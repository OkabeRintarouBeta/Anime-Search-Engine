13,1005,0,14.734748577818536,story with the main character transported to another world,Star Ocean EX,"Claude C. Kenni, a crewmember on the spaceship Calnus and son of the commander of the ship, is transported to Expel, a backwards planet with swords and magic. He teams up with Rena Lanford, who thinks he is the legendary Warrior of Light, and other characters to investigate the Sorcery Globe, a meteorite that has been causing problems all over the world.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Twenty years after the events of the Star Ocean video game, Ronixis J. Kenny and his son, Claude C. Kenny are on a mission to investigate a newly discovered planet. While investigating a strange machine with a mysterious energy field, Claude finds himself transported to the planet of Expel. He wakes up in a forest, where he meets Rena Lanford, a young girl being attacked by a monster.  After defeating the monster with his phase gun, Rena takes him back to her village of Arlia where he is declared to be the legendary ""Warrior of Light"" who will save Expel.  The planet is in peril since the landing of a large meteorite, the Sorcery Globe, which has caused monsters to spawn around the planet, as well as numerous natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunami.
Claude refuses to accept that he is this warrior, and leaves to try to find someone who can help him go home.  In the next town, he learns Rena is in danger from her childhood friend Allen.  He rushes to rescue her and finds Allen under the control of a magic crystal.  With the crystal destroyed, Allen returns to normal.  Realizing the crystal is tied to the Sorcery Globe, and wondering if it can help him get home, Claude decides to travel to El Continent to investigate it and Rena goes with him.  Along the way, they meet Celine Junes, a Heraldic Magic user and treasure hunter who tricks the pair into helping her steal the treasure from a cave.  The treasure turns out to be a book written in a language none of them knows, so Celine decides to stay with the pair to try to find out more about the book.  The group is later joined by Ashton Anchors, another swordsman whom they first encounter in a cave trying to defeat a monster terrorizing a nearby village.  Ashton attacks a two-headed dragon, thinking it is the monster, and after he trips the dragon fuses itself to his body, leaving him with the two dragon heads coming out of his back. Ashton makes the group go with him to find the King's Teardrop, blaming them for ""distracting him"" during his fight and causing everything.  After they get there he learns that using the magic power would kill the dragon, so he refuses to do it and joins the group until they can find a way to remove the dragon without causing it any harm.
In the town of Linga, they meet Precis, a young girl inventor who develops a crush on Claude and is oblivious to Ashton being in love with her.  They help her cure her friend from a dying illness, and afterward Precis decides to go with them to Lacour where they hope the famous Dr. Leon can answer their questions about the Sorcery Globe and Celine's book.
","Star Ocean EX will likely make a lot of Star Ocean fans mad. And since fans of the games (especially The Second Story, specifically) will probably be the main audience, choices made by the creators of the anime will drastically reduce the enjoyment of this series. 
 
What exactly are these choices? First of all, the anime follows only the story of Claude, rather than Rena. Though most people do choose to play Claude's scenario in the game itself, people who preferred Rena's perspective are alienated - besides, changing the media from video game to anime could have allowed them to show BOTH aspects of the story, giving people who have already played the game an extra reason to watch the series. 
 
Even more seriously, though, is the decision to portray only part of the story; the anime only covers pretty much only the first disc of the game. This leaves loads of unanswered questions and loose ends, and with virtually no hope of a second season (since the game is over a decade old), the cliffhanger ending is truly frustrating. This fact becomes especially annoying since the story doesn't really get good until the second disc. The makers of the anime did add in lots to the story, which sounds like a good idea since, in the game, the first disc really only amounted to somewhat tedious traveling; however, the new scenarios in the anime are equally as pointless and not all that interesting. The worst part comes near the end of the anime, where the story from the game is completely thrown out the window and replaced by a new (and, in my opinion, lesser) version of events. 
 
Another problem is that the anime arbitrarily chooses a main party of Claude, Rena, Celine, and Ashton, leaving the other characters in the dust. With the exception of Noel and Chisato (who aren't even mentioned), all the other characters don't have too much airtime and barely fight with the group. With a game with so many characters and so many group combinations, it seems silly to choose a particular four-person group and go with that for the whole anime, rather than featuring the entire cast. There are, however, new characters added for the anime, but they are all generic and uninteresting, adding nothing to the enjoyment of the series. Luckily, Ashton is one of the main characters chosen for the anime, and he is portrayed hilariously - in fact, Ashton is basically the only reason I stayed with this anime to the end.

          
 
       Helpful Star Ocean is an adventure-comedy anime suitable for children. It's based off of a video game [which I've never seen or played since I'm not a gamer]. The maturity level is a little greater than Pokemon...not by much, though I must say I still liked it and I think older people would like this show as well. So long as you don't compare it to the video game or expect it to be this wonderfully sophisticated piece of work. 
 
~ Art 
The art is kinda amateurish looking though it's not totally bad. Use of lines, shape and proportion are all OK, however the actual shading is pretty weak. The color palette is very simple and has a “paint-by-numbers” look to it. The hero is of course blonde with blue eyes *rolls eyes* with matching the colors for his boots, gloves and jacket., The heroine is blue-haired with blue eyes and the sorceress woman is violet-haired with violet eyes.  
CGI is used in small doses but all for the wrong reasons like monsters melting away and cheesy-cheap looking ocean/water distortion but it's not really used for the fight scenes or special F/X. At the end, they use more CGI but again it's very cheesy and cheap-looking. Another clue that this show is for a younger audience is that scenes are reused constantly, especially the heroes' attack moves. 
 
~ Sound 
I watched this show in the English dub and it was pretty good. Each of the actors properly conveyed the right mix of emotion and humor into their characters. Also the guy who did Kira Yamato's English voice stars in this show as Claude Kenni, he is a very good actor.  
The music is on the generic side, the OP sounds like typical shonen anime electro-pop synthesizer music. The ED is a somewhat peppy sounding feminine rock song which was still on the generic side. 
 
~ Story 
As with most children's stories, the plot is pretty basic. A guy gets thrown into a strange world and goes on an adventurous quest to return home incidentally saving the world while he's at it. But what really makes Star Ocean work [for me at least] are the individual episodes, the situational humor and the connection between the characters. The story is told in a very childish and straightforward fashion with all the requisite of humor as can be expected from shows of this nature. Therefore don't look for any deeper meaning or any sophisticated narrative elements like irony, metaphors, or complex plot twists. 
 
~ Characters 
The characters are pretty much what make the show what it is. At times they seem pretty stereotypical with the typical anime/RPG line up: the hero, the healer, the wizard, the rogue knight, the thief/bandit[s], the comic relief....and so on, but then they did some unique things like throwing in some modern elements like doctors and scientists [also electricity].  
The unity and overall good-naturedness between the characters is what I found most admirable and enjoyable in the show, I really like when a band of characters go off on an adventure and really stick together and help each other. Star Ocean is really good at portraying unity....and because of that I don't think I found any one character annoying.  
At the very beginning I didn't like Claude because he just seemed so brash and heedless of caution, even though I know it was because he had a point to prove that he was not just some kid living under his father's shadow, Commodore Kenni. Thank goodness he changes during the anime and quickly learned when to turn on the bravado and when to switch it off. Once that character flaw was removed, Claude became my favorite.  
I also liked Ashton very much, he carried his share of the show very well and despite what everyone else in the show was saying about him, he's actually a pretty skilled swordsman and a very likable character. It's easy to see why the two-headed dragon got attached to him.  
I also liked Celine and Rena, the two girls of the group. They are basically two sides of the same coin except Celine plays the sexpot card and Rena plays the short, cute and helpless card. 
 
~ Verdict 
Overall I'd say it was a pretty cool show. Maybe it's not the “OMG!!! this is effin' EPIC!!! Lemme tell all my friends about it!!!” kinda show, but it kept things light and I was entertained. So if some one was interested and asked me about it....then I'd tell them to check it out, it's pretty good and funny.

          
 
       Helpful I was really surprised when I had started watching this, I had assumed it would be a big letdown but when It started I actually liked it. The only downfall was towards the end. The show started moving in a different direction away from the plotline of the game and ended at a climax that made you wanna rip your hair out (but hey that's Japan for you). 
 
I first played the game for the PSP before watching it so I expected it to follow that plot line pretty close, and it did for about half of the series. I think the reason they did change the series half way through was because they knew they couldn't fit the original plotline into 26 episodes and they didn't want to make a second season. 
 
If I remember correctly, the point at which the show started moving away from the game was when the boat holding the lacuer hope was attacked and sank, washing the people on a different continent (don't remember name). At that point they went straight to the sorcery globe, totally removing the transport to energy nede. Along with that the ten wise men were never mentioned or showed up in the series. The only thing that may have been the first showing of the ten wise men was when Rena and Claude were inside the Sorcery globe and they were stopped by a screen that showed up showing what looked like 10 people i think, one being a Nedian. He told Rena she was one of them and ofcourse, she started crying (figures). But I won't ruin the show for you if you haven't watched it. Just know the ending will leave you pissed off, atleast it did me.

It is not really possible to do badly on the story because it is all other people's work. They were not too different from the classic fairy tales we know, just slight variations to the actual story here and there.  
 
The art is very cutesy and everything revolves around Hello Kitty and her friends. 
 
The sound is very good overall, but be warned: Tara Strong is doing the highest voice she can in the dub for Hello Kitty and it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Just mute the computer when you see Hello Kitty come on screen. 
 
The characters are all playing fairy tale characters, so they act like they do in the fairy tales. 
 
This anime is very enjoyable for children. If you are looking for something a little more intellectually stimulating, try a different anime. This is a bunch of cute little kid fairy tales. It can be enjoyed by anyone who likes Hello Kitty at any age though.

As for the art, the animation has been improved ofc since it was 1993, yeah just improved . 
What i like the most about the sound is the ED music soundtrack , ok i just watched this anime a while ago ( not 1993) but the music from that time i remember, and i couln'd stop dancing and you just figure out why :). 
Soooo happy st see the apperances of most of the previous serie's original charachters in all their glory, but i even was happier to see a new enemy on the scene and a strong , relentless one to say. 
The feeling of a adventure rpg anime is always going for a intense, but positive feeling and i am a fan of that , even to compare the anime to the videogame is a though behind for example Dragon quest, still to me its an anime that kids these days prob would have liked, u can watch it with almost ppl from all age's. 
Overall this is a good ( without the re-imagine serie's ) a very enjoyable closure of the serie's , but the problem in once again the availabillity and even if its sold u can count spending an easy 250-325 Euro on the boxset serie's  since its japan import, on this case its just with pain in my heart to say its better to download this.

","It's a misrepresentation of the Lewis Carroll's classic ( Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -OVA 1- and Through the Looking-Glass -OVA 2-) but bathed in a ecchi comedy with faint manifestations of yuri. 
 
If there is anything worse than the visions that some authors do on consecrated creations, is when they taken the license of drastically change  of the work address. This is a clear example of that, it becomes a classic of children's literature (that preserved a mathematical meaning) in a bland lesbian and erotic comedy. 
 
The construct of fantasy is not good, as they take all the characters, objects and animals and replace them with women, perhaps for benefit the yuri trend .  
 
It is valid to clarify that it is not a work fully homosexual but has some suggestions in the friction, the looks and touching, something like what is shown in Burst Angel or Murder Princess. 
 
Probably the only success is the character design. Clamp style  well marked that isn't committed to the measures voluptuous but in giving certain elegance to the characters. This makes the work don't look so markedly sexy. 
 
The late detail of both OVAs as suggesting that it was not all a dream seems appropriate. 
 
In compendium, an insult to the literature, not only by changing the contents of the classic but because it isn't able to retain some of the spirit of that great book.  


          
 
       Helpful Fushigi no Kuni no Miyuki-chan is a two episode Madhouse OVA based off of a relatively short, comedic Clamp manga. I have talked about Clamp's works quite a bit since I've also reviewed xxxholic, Blood-C, Cardcaptor Sakura & Magic Knight Rayearth. So far, only one of those has been largely negative. So, that's not the worst record out there. But let's see what happens with this one. 
 
Story: 
 
Our heroine, Miyuki, wakes up one morning after a nightmare we don't get to see. She notices she's running late and hurries to school with toast in her mouth. Which is a completely original gag that has never been used in anything else. A scantily clad bunny girl skateboards in front of her, muttering how she is also late. They both fall into a hole, the bunny girl likely regretting her lack of safety pads and a helmet but we don't see her again. Miyuki gets pulled into the chest of a girl who is also a door and goes into Wonderland where scantily clad women all want a piece of her. Seriously, she has more women pursuing her than Inés, except non-consensually. The second episode is close to the same set up, except she gets pulled through the looking glass. 
 
The biggest problem with the OVA is a very simple one. The comedy is shite. Miyuki basically moves from one awkward situation, where buxom, predatory lesbians try to grope her without her permission, to another and struggles to escape. That's the entire joke of the entire OVA. Because it's such a hilarious joke that this high school girl is being assaulted. Because when women do that to other women it magically becomes funny... because shiny umbreon has blue rings. 
 
Even if the joke was conceptually funny instead of being blatantly terrible, it would be so heavily run into the ground that it would be melted from contact with the molten core. There's a reason a good comedy will find new and unexpected things to do with its running gags because a comedy needs an element of the unexpected to really work. If you know exactly what's going to happen as soon as the set up starts, the joke probably isn't going to be funny. So, we face a situation where there's one joke and it's not even conceptually funny.  
 
Characters: 
 
There's no real sense of character in this. Every character Miyuki encounters is pretty much defined by being a predatory lesbian who will freeze to death the moment temperatures drop. Miyuki herself is just boring. No personality. No comedic quirks.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork isn't very good. It's not so much that Clamp likes to give its characters awkwardly elongated limbs as it is the series emphasises skimpy outfits and other fan-service elements over anything that would be good. If we're going to take a detour through worlds based off of Lewis Carroll's classic stories, we should have some strange, whimsical scenery and objects to capture our attention but in this version, the scenery and backgrounds are pretty boring & low effort. Clearly, they thought your eyes would be somewhere else but my mum taught me not to stare at noodle-limbed ladies with awkward proportions.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is pretty bad. I don't blame the cast since Madhouse did get some skilled people including Kouda Mariko. I think it's more that they have nothing to work with. Miyuki spends her time crying out or being startled. The rest of the characters might get one or two lines. Honda Toshiyuki's soundtrack is pretty bad. Most of the series uses the same intense comedic music on loop. It might be an innocuous enough track if they played it a few times, but when it gets repeated over and over and over again for close to thirty minutes it makes you want to drop kick a baby.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
The whole premise is based on predatory lesbians, so there's a lot of groping.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Make it funny. There's so much potential for strong, quirky humour using Wonderland & the world through the looking glass as a backdrop. You just have to take advantage of the strangeness of the situation and actually make the characters funny and quirky instead of just molesty.  
Vary your music. Because using heavily repeated music to annoy your audience into dropkicking babies is not a good way to solve global overpopulation.  
Revamp the shoujo ai aspect. If you want to make a shoujou ai work based off of Alice in Wonderland, I think that's great and I'm all for it. But making all your characters offensive predatory stereotypes is not the way to do it. You could have Miyuki meet a bunch of really homo-erotic girls with fleshed out personalities and funny character quirks. You could have her meet and travel with one and give the pair a budding romance. You could have her come to terms with her own sexuality after seeing new and wondrous things on her adventure. Any of those would have been much better.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Fushigi no Kuni no Miyuki-chan is complete crap. Horrible humour, artwork that's only passable at being exploitative, a music loop that gets obnoxious quickly. At least it's mercifully short. I'm giving it a 2/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Picture one day in your life that you awaken only to find yourself in an unfamiliar world, and that ever character there wants a piece of you in a bizarre way! Well poor Miyuki seems to have the worst luck in the world, as everyday is that kinda day for her! 
 
Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland is pretty much a unique take on the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; story, only done by the all women Japanese team known as Clamp, only this time CLAMP does it their own way! This title contains two 15 minute OVAs. (Miyuki-can in Wonderland and Miyuki-chan in mirror land) Both are very similar in their concepts. 
 
Story: 6/10 
Its pretty straight forward, Miyuki wakes up for school one morning when she happens to come across a scantily clad female women dressed like a bunny, a giant hole appears beneath both and sucks them into a mysterious land, she then has to find a way to escape the mysterious world. Along the way she comes across a bizarre cast of suggestively dressed women, all who in fact want.....ahem......a piece of her! (Yeah its a Yuri title) A big majority of the cast from Alice and Wonderland are represented here, except this time they are all adult females. No matter what kinda situation Miyuki is in, she always seems to swiftly escape either on purpose or by accident. Which indecently is my only major complaint with this title, that&rsquo;s pretty much all you see.....her escaping one after another! There is no more point to the OVA than that. Not to mention the only dialog we hear is Miyuki introducing herself, the Wonderland characters introducing themselves, then Miyuki escapes them! Wash rinse and repeat! The other half of the OVA (Mirror Land) is the exact same thing, only this time she is running from fairies and a clone of herself. But again, its the exact same thing as before...running....running.....and more running! The only thing that really distinct its from the first part, is that Miyuki gets sucked in by way of a mirror this time around. 
 
As far as offensive material goes, it does contain many characters in tight reveling clothes, and it is a Yuri title. Not to mention there is a scene where Miyuki&rsquo;s clone appears topless for a brief few seconds. So if that&rsquo;s not your bag then don&rsquo;t watch. 
 
Art: 7/10 
Being that its a 1996 title, it shows its age to be sure. The art with the character design itself is pretty good though, with colorful well detailed characters and clothing. It really is great in that aspect. The backgrounds themselves do leave a lot to be desired though, they are not detailed very well, and even the color........for an older title mind you, is lacking a lot in the artistic department. Still, the character design and style make up pretty well for that short comings of this. 
 
Sound: 4/10 
Miyuki-chan has a nice catchy jazz style theme that both has a high (saxophone and horns) and low (soft drum beat) parts to it, it is just great! So why the 4 then? IT&rsquo;S THE ONLY TRACK YOU HEAR THE ENTIRE TIME! Seriously, it just loops and loops over and over again from beginning to end. Since it has the low point of the track playing most of the time, it makes you feel like your in an elevator. And if you are watching this while fatigued, it will most likely put you to sleep. While there is sadly no opening theme to this title, the closing one is alright, a nice light j-pop styled beat. Nothing special, but it fits for the ending scene. 
 
Character: 5/10 
Well honestly, the only character you really get to see is Miyuki herself, all other cast members are there for only a few seconds after she runs away from them. Miyuki herself is likable though, which is good since she takes up about 90% of the spotlight. Other than that there really isn&rsquo;t much else to say, especially since there isn&rsquo;t much in the way of over all dialog and conversation going through out. Nobody ever comes off as annoying so the titles is okay in that regards. 
 
Bottom Line: 6/10 
Over all Miyuki-chan in Wonderland isn&rsquo;t bad, its just repetitive! I give Clamp credit for trying a unique take on this classic story line, but its just a shame there is no over all story concept to this OVA. To its credit though, it is cute and entertaining for its short little span. Though I can&rsquo;t promise you you&rsquo;ll be re-watching this that much. I recommend it for the Clamp fans and Yuri fans out there. Not great, but not all that bad either.

(Source: ANN) 
","['Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","The story takes place between August and October, 1952. It primarily follows crime fiction writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi and news magazine editor Morihiko Toriguchi as they investigate, with the help of onmyōji Akihiko Chūzenji, a series of unusual crimes that take place in Musashino and Mitaka.
Kanako Yuzuki and Yoriko Kusumoto are friends and middle school students. The two plan to go to Lake Sagami over summer break. On the night they are to leave, Kanako is hit by the train on which Tokyo police detective Shutarō Kiba is traveling. After the hospital stabilizes Kanako, her older sister, Yōko Yuzuki, has Kanako transferred to Kōshirō Mimasaka's research hospital. Several days later, the discovery of a severed arm and two boxed, severed legs catches the attention of Toriguchi, who travels by automobile with Atsuko Chūzenji and Sekiguchi to investigate.
Yoriko tells Kiba that Kanako was pushed into the train by a man wearing gloves. Shortly afterward, Kanako is apparently abducted from the hospital; Mimasaka's assistant, Tarō Suzaki, is murdered; and Kanako's guardian, Noritada Amemiya, also disappears. Witnesses report seeing a gloved man in the area where three other girls are soon abducted. Residents of the surrounding area later discover the girls' boxed, severed limbs.
Noriyuki Masuoka, the lawyer for Kanako's grandfather, hires private investigator Reijirō Enokizu to find Kanako. Masuoka explains that Yōko is actually Kanako's mother. Kanako is unaware of her true parentage, but she is the only heir to the fortune of Yōkō Shibata, who appointed Amemiya as her guardian.
Toriguchi obtains a list, labeled ""Onbako-sama"", of believers in a local cult led by Hyōei Terada, a self-proclaimed onmyōji. Toriguchi believes Terada is involved with the dismemberment case, because all the dismemberment victims are daughters of Terada's followers. Sekiguchi notices two names on the list: Yoriko's mother, and fiction writer Shunkō Kubo. As a fellow writer for the same publisher, Sekiguchi already knows Kubo, who always wears gloves. After Enokizu and Sekiguchi meet with Yoriko, she meets Kubo, who takes her to an abandoned temple filled with boxes. Later, Yoriko's severed arms are found.
From reading Kubo's latest fiction work, Chūzenji deduces that Kubo is the perpetrator of the dismemberment case. Chūzenji, Sekiguchi, and Enokizu confront Terada, and demonstrate that all of Terada's practices are fake. Terada confesses his swindle to the police, and reveals that Kubo is his son. Meanwhile, Tokyo police detective Bunzō Aoki goes to the abandoned temple that Kubo is using, but Kubo escapes. Later, Kubo's severed limbs are found.
Chūzenji tells Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu that he knew Mimasaka during the war. Mimasaka's research involved replacing biological human body parts with mechanical ones. Meanwhile, Kiba accuses Mimasaka of dismembering girls to further his research, and demands to know what he has done with Kanako. Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu pick up Yōko and arrive at Mimasaka's facility. Yōko tells them Mimasaka is her father. Chūzenji soon arrives with Masuoka, Aoki, and police constable Fukumoto.
Chūzenji recounts the series of events, beginning with Yoriko pushing Kanako onto the train tracks. Suzaki had been blackmailing Yōko, because he knew that Kanako was not Yōkō Shibata's legitimate heir. Since Mimasaka could keep only Kanako's head alive mechanically, Suzaki could easily stage her kidnapping and demand a ransom from Shibata. The first severed limbs found, before Kanako's abduction, were Kanako's. After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with Kanako's head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside a box. Kubo himself then tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box. Kubo wrote about it all in his fiction. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. When he went to Mimasaka, in hopes of learning how to replicate what he saw, Mimasaka instead performed the same procedure on Kubo.
Aoki tries to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, but Mimasaka grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, so Yōko kills Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.
","This episode, you could say, is almost like a summary, which is why I gave an 'Overall' of 6.  
 
Due to the complexity of the main anime, and the murders as well as the 'supernatural perspective' in it, it was quite hard to comprehend what was going on at the beginning.  
However, at the end I'd say I understood 80% of what had happened as everything was revealed then.  
But what about the remaining 20% which most of the watchers, including me, couldn't comprehend or had failed to remember? 
 
Well that's when this Special works its magic on us. 
 
It basically retells the events that took place in the story from the perspective of Atsuko, the younger sister of the talkative priest Akihiko Chuzenji, who is seen in one of the earlier episodes - this was a strength to the Special as they reused a very minor character so that we at least have a connection to them, a contrast to a few other anime in which random, unknown characters are used to do this. 
 
Furthermore, the Special has a story in itself which links to the telling of the murders that took place, which doesn't make it a pure summary - I found this interesting as I could then not doze off but instead I was interested in it. 
 
The Special also made it so that the episode itself was centred around Atsuko's perspective from day 1, during the time when the murders were happening, and ended itself a year later or so after the case was solved - this was indeed a great element to it because the Special doesn't take place 'after' the anime's story takes place, but during, which made it all the more realistic and not just 'forced'.  
In addition, they include one of the scenes from the earlier episode in the main anime where Atsuko was in just to mix it in to make it seem more natural and to also remind us of who she is. 
 
I also loved how they reused the soundtracks and characters, it was almost nostalgic. 
 
So to conclude, definitely watch this if you didn't catch on to all of the details of the main series.

The art itself is fairly good (6) and so as the sound (6), the characters role kinda represent a different genres, but the main point of it all is the muchacho who is represents a kind hearted soul which every members of the harem connect with, so I rated it as an 8. The enjoyment is  very good and the author really defined the the phrase ""FOR GENERAL VIEWING"" which can be viewed by all ( as long as you forget the panty shots). 
 
Overall, I thinks the author of this anime should have made a season 2 instead of a couple of OVA's. So, at this point we can only hope. (my overall rate is 8)

       Helpful To be an OVA, this anime is pretty informative in filling in gaps in the main season storyline.  It explains what Ban did immediately after the death of Elaine, how Meliodas and Hawk meet and start the Boar's Hat, and how Merlin healed the King.  The first episode is about Ban and Elaine. It just expounds a little more upon how they met and grew to care about each other before the attack by the red demon. The second episode is a series of shorts that fill in some backstory and side events in a humorous way. It follows around various characters from the anime and pretty much just pulls off gags, but is also pretty good at explaining some aspects of the anime that the main series didn't cover.

However, after a sudden death, she was transported to a divine realm to be reincarnated—and granted one wish to top it off. Thinking about the ordinary life that she had always wanted, she wished to be born as a normal person, with abilities that are average for the world she will resurrect in. 
 
Reborn as Adele von Ascham—the daughter of a noble—she possesses magic powers completely exceeding what one would label average. Still desiring to carry out the life she wanted, she leaves her home and enrolls at a hunter school in a faraway kingdom using ""Mile"" as an alias. However, try as she might to hide her overpowering potential, attaining her goal will be difficult—especially when facing against the crazy situations that ensue! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Fantasy']","Misato Kurihara, a genius girl who couldn't make any friends due to her exceptional abilities, is killed after being run over while protecting a young girl. Offered the chance to be reborn into a fantasy world, Misato asks that she simply be reincarnated with average abilities. After she regains her memory of her old life, she discovers that ""average"" in this new world takes into account the power of the absolute strongest and the absolute weakest magical creatures, resulting in her physical and magical abilities being 6,800 times stronger than that of a typical human. The magic used in this world is effected by nanomachines created by a more advanced civilization; the project was eventually abandoned, however, and the world's civilization has regressed and since stagnated as a result.
Reborn as the noble Adele von Ascham, her life takes a sharp turn at the age of eight, when her mother and her grandfather are assassinated by her conniving father, who then marries his mistress and then begins favoring his other daughter. By the age of ten, Adele is sent off to the prestigious Eckland Academy, where she makes the first friends in her two lives. However, when she uses her tremendous magical abilities to save a boy from being beaten by the royal princess' escort and passes herself off as the mortal vessel of a god, the resulting attention towards her person forces her to flee to another kingdom. Attending Hunter's Prep School and forming a team with her classmates Mavis, Reina, and Pauline, Adele tries her best to live her life as normally as possible, which does not prove to be an easy feat.
","Aside from starting in the middle, which the manga also did to a point, the anime so far skips over massive portions of the LN, throwing away entire characters and skimping on plot development to anticlimactically finish an entire arc in 3 episodes. 
The animation and art is pretty good, as well as sound, so I originally had decent hopes from the first episode - I just hope the directing picks itself up from here on out. 
 
For those not familiar with the source material, you may have a hard time connecting to the characters as the story develops so quickly, but hopefully you'll be able to see enough of their charm to stick around to get to know them, bless their chuuni hearts. 
 
For those who are - I'd certainly recommend watching this, as it's fun to see these girls come to life - like I said, they are animated (and voiced) pretty well, and the anime has a pleasantly vibrant vibe that is very faithful to the original art. Just be prepared to be disappointed when it comes to fight scenes. They're very short, and very one sided (whether are heroines are winning or losing) and all around I felt they were pretty pathetic, including their poor scripting. 
Essentially it's a bit rushed, and there are some missing and changed side characters, but overall I'd say it's enjoyable as light watching.

          
 
       Helpful you have to watch this super funny, full of parodies, overpowered main character anime.. yea yea.. another isekai movie, died because of truck-kun, and become overpowered.. BUT thats the whole point of this anime as it is doing funny stuff and parodies all over the episodes. The anime feels kinda like a slice of life, anime but in the last part, the story is going forward as they finally found a something to investigate.. too bad it ends right at there. hope season 2 will be announced soon! easily one of my favourite anime series of this season! super super enjoy this anime series. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful The ever expanding world of Isekai light novels just keep getting bigger and bigger with all kinds of similar but weird concepts, but what if I told you that a change will actually cast some new light onto these stories and shed an entirely new function that is still a good watch? That's the result of ""Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne!"", with the main MC being reincarnated (for reasons obvious) with a wish of wanting to be average in the next world (but who cares, the Isekai gods aren't wavering, so they STILL made her look OP instead). 
 
But as-is with the elephant in the room, I have to address this serious problem: ""Do changes outside of the source materials make or break them?"" This is always an ongoing issue that we have experienced time and time again, and you can say that the results of all that are quite diverse but mixed. Especially for readers of the LN (because that's where the anime mainly looks at for source adaptation), it was quite a harrowing experience to find out that the director of this show, Masahiko Oota, wanted this show to be completely ""original"" in ideas while still lifting off the atmosphere and essence of the LN, which actually created a rift between anime-onlys and LN readers calling it out as a butchered adaptation. To be fair and give some due credit, the ""Himouto Umaru-chan"" and ""Yuru Yuri"" director has done the same treatment to those shows and others he directed, and though it may seem that the damage is written on the wall, no one saw the adverse effect coming, that no matter how vastly different the source material may be, the anime can still prove to be as good on its own, mostly as a niche. The same it was then, and the same can be said for this show with the backlash in the very beginning, but turned out to be quite the experience at the very end. You say: ""How does this experience affect the rest of the show then?"" Keep on reading to find out. 
 
In such a story like this where the CGDCT x Isekai genres have taken flight, the characters are an integral part in making all this possible, mainly the 4 girls of the Crimson Vow: 
 
Originally Misato Kurihara, hit by Truck-kun and reincarnated as Adele von Ascham a.k.a Mile, the ""seemingly average"" girl, but borne with the blessing of the Isekai gods to harbor OP powers DESPITE her absolute wish to be just like everyone else in another world, to live a normal life. In order to learn and discover the Isekai world as it is, she fused herself with an alias for a royalty name to not be a sore thumb Along the way with the mysterious cat-looking creature and guide known as Nano, she comes into a consensus as she found a school to mingle with like-minded people, and the Crimson Vow was born. 
 
Reina a.k.a Crimson Reina, the daughter of a merchant, her specialty with fire magic has made her a capable mage, but not without the fact that due to the loss of her father to evildoers in her growing-up stages of life, she has an immense hatred towards bandits. She too is the Crimson Vow's ""dictionary"" when it comes to practical knowledge and experience. 
 
Mavis a.k.a Mavis von Austien, the daughter of royalty, and a swordswoman. And you know the familiarities of royal families all too well when she ran way from home against the will of family members not wanting specific children to follow in the exact footsteps (because of gender bias against her father and brothers) to shame the family of a girl being another swordsman. How depressing is that. 
 
Pauline a.k.a Pauline Beckett (the family name isn't so much of a confirmation), also the daughter of a merchant, but the heritage of her family is quite distorted with what can be described as a façade to utilize the family in backend trading hostage, so she isn't spared from trouble as well. But despite her gentle appearance and demeanor, don't take that for granted as her ruthlessness sets her in quick so fast it's terrifying (but all in good fun). 
 
All in all, these 4 girls truly are the fascinating points of the anime amidst their difference in personalities and goodwill to carry on their usual adventures. While Mile constantly dishes out references to the Isekai tropes that the 3 other girls will NEVER understand, it certainly was some good old-fashioned comedic banter that created a hell lot of laughs, especially towards small girls having BIG boobs and flat chests for 14/15-year olds. 
 
In the visual department, another Project No. 9 show and an Isekai one at that, the 2nd one this season pumped out alongside ""Choujin Koukousei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyuu de Ikinuku you desu!"", but this anime is presented way better than that horrible show, while the art and animation themselves are sparse at best, as expected of the low-budget quality from the studio. The same can be said towards the music, which is mostly a mix of the usual fantasy-esque ones that we'd hear in RPGs. The OST is quite the LICC though as both the OP and ED are happy-go-lucky ones, especially the OP with that whole ""WAHO! WAHA!"" sequence from the Crimson Vow. Both songs are greatly enjoyable, you just can't afford to skip them! 
 
Indeed, this anime's ""origins"" are basically meta reference jokes with some 4th wall-breaking from the MC that at first can be quite off-putting with the tame story and character development, and as it progresses, the entire show somehow came into a consensus all on its own, and as an anime-only (while briefly following the manga adaptation based off the LN) for the most part, I can say that it while it was nothing to scoff at from the initial settings, the development was there and soon I found myself enjoying the anime for what it is. It is self-conscious of its own environment, that's for sure. 
 
Amidst the backdrop of a somewhat different execution, this anime is full-on lightheartedness and it's easy on the palate for so much fun. The humor is subjective though, but that doesn't detract from the experience overall. If you need an Isekai with none of the bells and whistles of overused tropes, this is no perfect show, but a good one to just relax to, not amazing but not bad either. 
 
*In the Fall 2019 Isekai genre, the 3rd position of enjoyment right behind Cautious Hero and Ascendance of a Bookworm.*

His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the Underworld (霊界, Reikai, ""Spirit World"" in the English dub) where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of ""Underworld Detective"" (霊界探偵, Reikai Tantei, lit. ""Spirit World Detective"", ""Spirit Detective"" in the English dub), charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World (人間界, Ningen Kai, lit. ""Human World""). Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or Reiki (霊気, Reiki, lit. ""Spirit Energy"") fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane (魔界, Makai, lit. ""Demon World""), a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World.
Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. To test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament (暗黒武術会, Ankoku Bujutsukai, lit. ""Dark Martial Arts Association""), an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.
After the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.
As they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. 
Two years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the cast. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach.
","(I really don't want to write a long review here, I'm just writing because I felt like I need to say something about this two-part OVAs) 
 
It would be quite fucked up for me if I said that I loved everything about it except for the story and rate it 7, and I'll. 
 
Jokes aside, I don't want to focus on the bad sides, seriously. I didn't expected those to be masterpieces and the stories worked fairly well considering the short runtime. I mean, the best shonen of all time just came back from the dead after 20 years for two, not one, but two specials. This is not something you see everyday and I'm really glad this happened. 
 
The animation looks gorgeous, fluid and colorful. Hearing all those characters again feels really lovely. The joy on the cast's voices are undeniable. 
 
And of course, the best aspect: the soundtrack. They kept the same soundtrack from the anime and that just killed me. It felt incredibly good to hear all those tracks again. 
 
They tried really hard for a fan service but you know what? This is the first time that I don't give a flying fuck about that. I loved those really on your nose induced nostalgia trips, specially the fight in All or Nothing. 
 
Whatever, I liked it.

Yu Yu Hakusho Special - Again, I swear I didn’t just choose this anime because I had to fill out the list with something. I actually wanted to see some new content from this series. This was a part of the 25th anniversary of the series Yu Yu Hakusho. 
 
This special is divide in two episodes. One is about when lil Vegeta (Hiei) and Kurama meet and the other is an adaptation of the Interdimensional laser chapters, basically the second last chapter of the manga with added panels from the last chapter. Yeah, the anime follows the chapters as they seemed to go panel to panel. Minimalistic for an adaptation, but acceptable in this case.  
 
The cast is back and so are the voice actors for our 4 main guys. It’s good to see that even the director is back to give us this anime one more time. It just shows that this IS a short return, a reminder that this series is profitable.  
 
You know, I think this anime does sort of rekindle my interest in the series, for that I gotta thank the writer. The character interaction are either straight taken from the source or altered for the sake of the narrative. The new dialog in the flashback seems to be incharacter back before they meet Yusuke. Yusuke is being Yusuke and Kuwabara is hilarious as always.  
 
The action scenes are decent for what they had to work with. There is something about the action in this series that show some intelligence against even the average of demons. And can I just say that they finally animated that 5 second scenes from the manga, I have always thought how that scene would be animated in current animation. 
 
And that’s it. I don’t think this special is any special than what it is. It’s not breaking new grounds. A good short return of the character we know, indulging in a short adventure yet again. This does remind me of those short special of Rumiko work years ago, so I guess the same could apply here. It knows that it just a simple story and it does have some fun with it. There isn’t much to complain about and there isn’t much things to praise it. This is a watch for any Yu Yu Hakusho fan. 


          
 
       Helpful I grew up watching Yu Yu Hakusho and I'm kinda protective of what could have been of the show in its special, but I'm happy with the results, overall. 
 
The first OVA is a prequel to the anime, showing when Hiei and Kurama first met. I think this was in the manga, showing a girl that Kurama met in junior high. Being the first thing to watch, all hyped that I was, it was a bit boring, cliché and hushed (the episode is very short), the final battle is a bit dumb too but it was good seeing the boiis again.  
 
The second one is a sequel to the events of the last tournment, with the complete Urameshi Team. It was fun, had lots of characters in such a small screen time and lots of good nostalgia. The ending was a bit too much for the simply plot of the episode, but that's also ok. 
 
I think YYH looks way better hand drawn, but I didn't have any problem with this digital era service on it. Watch it if you like the original show, it will definetly be a good nostalgia experience!

What a waste! Really, a tragical one. I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i'm kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn't so original, and that's valid both for personality and appearance, but they've managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that's enough. 
 
Re:Creators isn't a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, even too smooth; in what sense? It's predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can't stand that a series with a nice potential isn't supported by a strong and ""aggressive"" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i'm so far from being an expert in the field, so i'm going to stop the moaning now. 
 
Overall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it's pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice. If you have great expectations leave them behind before it's too late.

          
 
       Helpful Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley. 
 
What began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening. 
 
This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion. 
 
Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it. 
 
If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide. 
 
The main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing. 
 
Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to. 
 
Overall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking. 
 
Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.

          
 
       Helpful The only reason this even gets a 5 is because the premise is great, and the production values are very good too. (Sound design, visuals, animation, etc) 
 
There is a lot of potential to be had here..and even some deeper philosophical questions about creation and the meaning of life lingering around...unfortunately, the way it's executed ruins everything 
 
over half the show is pure exposition dump done in the most boring possible ways, with mostly dull characters. this is made even worse than usual due to the atrocious dialogue. There's some trully novice level mistakes in the writting like characters repeating the same word 10 times in a few sentences leading to almost comical delivery. 
 
you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators 
 
""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world's gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world"" 
 
It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show. In one particular episode (i think it was 4) this gets so bad i actually started laughing out loud at the characters...that'd be great if this was a comedy...alas, it is not. 
 
This has been one of the most frustrating things i've ever watched...because beneath all the terribly written exposition dumps anyone can see there is a brilliant premise begging for a better script.

(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Historical']",none,"The adaptation the manga deserved. 
 
Just some context: Hi no Tori is a manga by the great Osamu Tezuka, who is unfortunately primarily known as the creator of Astro Boy. I say ""unfortunately"" because although Astro Boy may be a seminal work and an important stepping stone in the history of anime & manga, it does not come even close to rivaling the sheer brilliance and philosophical depth of Hi no Tori, which I would class as one of the ten greatest works of fiction I have come across. Anyway 2 adaptations had been tried before Hi no Tori: Houou-hen: the live action film Hi no Tori: Daybreak Chapter, and the loose anime adaptation Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, both of which I have had the misfortune of watching. Daybreak Chapter was directed by the usually fantastic Japanese auteur Kon Ichikawa in the low period of his career, the film itself being his nadir, for its cringeworthy effects and unconvincing performances. Ai no CosmoZone is just a pathetic attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the manga which is not worth discussing any further. After these two failed attempts, the sometimes great Rintaro stepped onto the scene and delivered what would be, to this day, the best adaptation of Hi no Tori. 
 
Hi no Tori: Houou-hen itself near-perfectly captures every element that made the manga so awesome. It recreates the wonderment of the original story as well and the intense feeling you get deep in your gut as you get to the end of this particular part of the manga. 
 
Characters 
The characters are fantastic, though I would add this caveat: other than the two leads, characters should be considered merely foils or ways to advance the plot. That said, the two leads, Gaou and Akanemaru, are some of the most interesting characters I have come across in years of watching anime and other media. Gaou's transformation in particular fascinates me (but I won't talk about it to avoid spoilers). 
 
Art 
The art is amazing, although this is perhaps the one part of the movie that does not capture the greatness of the manga, which boasts drawings of the highest quality. One potential reason for me having this problem (other than Rintaro's slightly worse art direction) was that the only quality I was able to access this relatively obscure film in was quite low in both frame rate and resolution. 
 
Sound 
Oh boy that synth heavy soundtrack/score really makes the movie. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the manga and adds elements of mystery, wonder and suspense. 
 
Story 
It's Hi no Tori. of course the story is mindblowing. 
 
Overall a masterpiece for the ages.

এর আগেও অবশ্য এইটার খোঁজ পেয়েছিলাম, তখন ম্যাল এ লো স্কোর দেখে আর আগাই নি। এবার সাহস করে দেখলাম। ভাগ্যিস দেখলাম!! এটার স্কোর এত কম হতেই পারে না। কেন?? কারন এতে আছে দৃষ্টিনন্দন আর্ট, সুথিং মিউসিক, আর সর্বোপরি চিন্তা উদ্রেককারী ম্যাচিওর গল্প। একেকটি OVA শেষ করার পর আপনি অবশ্যই কিছুক্ষণ গভীর চিন্তায় ডুবে যাবেন, গল্পের পিছনের অন্তর্নিহিত দর্শনের খোঁজে। 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: সারাজীবন দুষ্কর্ম করেও একটিমাত্র ভালো কাজের সুফল যেমন পাওয়া যায়, তেমনি একটিমাত্র অমার্জনীয় অপরাধের সাজা থেকেও মানুষ মুক্তি পায় না। এই শিক্ষাটি আপনি এই OVA থেকে পাবেন। ৩টির মধ্যে এইটা সবচেয়ে বেশি Thought provoking। 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: রোমান্টিক ফ্যান্টাসির আড়ালে পাবেন আরেকটি অসাধারন দর্শন। এটার এন্ডিংটা আমার খুব পছন্দের। 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: স্পেস ড্রামা। ৩টার মধ্যে আমার সবচেয়ে প্রিয়। অসাধারণ সাসপেন্স আর এন্ডিং আছে এটাতে। 
যারা হাল্কা স্বাদের আনিমের খোঁজ করেন, এই জিনিস তাদের জন্য নয়। বাকি সবাইকে আমি এই ৩টি OVA দেখার অনুরোধ করব। 
এই ৩টি OVA ছাড়াও TV series আছে, মুভিও আছে। টিভি সিরিজটা Tezuka Productions এর বানানো, আর্ট কোয়ালিটি অত ভালো নয়। 
 
English: 
For a while I've got an addiction. I'm looking for OVAs of Madhouse in the 80s-90s era. Then I came across this OVA series. It is an adaptation of the manga composed by the famous mangaka Osamu Tezuka. There is a story in each volume of the manga. The setting of each story is completely different. However, the stories are linked up by the advent of ""Hi no Tori"" or ""Immortal Phoenix"". 
Actually I came across these before. Then I dared not to try these out, looking at the low scores. This time I dared. Thank God I did!! The score cannot be so low. Why ?? Because it has wonderful art, soothing music, and above all, thought provoking and mature story. After completing one of the OVAs, you will surely be in deep ponder for some time, looking for the underlying philosophy behind the story. 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: A single good deed may save a human immersed in a lifetime of evil deeds. On the other hand, humans can't escape from the punishment of a single unforgivable crime. This is the lesson you will get from this OVA. This is the most thought provoking of the 3. 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: Behind romantic fantasy lies a spectacular philosophy. The ending is my favorite. 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: Space Drama. This one is my favorite of the 3. It has excellent suspense and ending. 
This is not for those who seek light anime. To everyone else, I would request to see these 3 OVAs. 
Apart from these 3 OVAs, there are TV series and movies. But the art quality of the TV series made by Tezuka Productions is not that good.

","The eternal dilemma which is always brought up infront of Anime and cartoon lovers, by those who are close minded is “These animations are for children, not for grownups.” As a result, you find a lot of Anime lovers resorting to Anime with evident superficial markings so that they could prove that Anime is not in actuality for children. Some examples of superficial markings is the presence of violence, blood, fatal injuries, or sexual intercourse. This way of looking at things is not accurate, because some Anime on the outset - such as Deadman Wonderland – look like they contain a lot of blood, gore and violence, but their storytelling in general is unoriginal, weak, and most importantly, immature. The Anime Thumbelina: A Magical Story, on the outset, looks very childish and is made for kids, and it lacks any semblance of violence or gore. The surprising thing is that this Anime is more suitable for adults than, let’s say, an Anime that actually entails all kinds of violence in it. So, what is the general rule that is applied to knowing precisely if a work is for children or for adults? Hopefully after describing this Anime, you’ll get a better view.  
 
The story is an adaption of the novel by writer Hanz Anderson, by the same name of Thumbelina, and it talks about a princess who is the size of a thumb, who comes out of a flower and faces many who would like her hand at marriage, until she settles in a true and loving relationship. The Anime adapts this in a light manner, and tells the story from a different angle. The main girl, Mia, is a normal human girl, who makes her mother exhausted due to her bad demeanor and shady shenanigans. Due to this trouble that Mia is causing, her mother seeks the advice of an old woman so that she could help her out with her issues. The old woman gives the mother a book by the name of Thumbelina, and the mother takes it before she falls asleep on her rocking chair, and is later picked up by Mia. Unfortunately for Mia, the book imprisons and traps her in it’s fantasy world, and from there on, Mia tries to return to her own world and her mother, and her true size as well, since she became much smaller upon entering the fantasy world. In that book, she will face a lot of enemies and circumstances, and form a lot of friendships as well in each passing episode. This is the body structure of the story, it is classic, and is ready to be filled with well-developed characters and a strong narrative. The script is very well done in the sequence of events and the speed at which they take place in, is intelligent in showing the necessary details. The writer is proficient at writing the script, and he respects the mind of the viewer.  
 
The Anime’s beginning is straightforward and spectacular, where the viewer gets to know the titular character Mya and the general goal of the story in a clear manner, and it contributes to sculpting a road for the writer to take later on in the story. The Anime is episodic, and each episode is different from the other, but they are all related in the fact that they have the general goal of adventure. Due to this, some episodes will turn out excellent while some others will turn out to be fairly average, and with that I find that the average mean score for all the episodes is fairly good.  
 
The main characters which are reoccurring in most of the episodes have a lightweight depth and are easy to understand, but they are still fairly developed, and that is something which makes it easier for the younger viewers to follow the story and understand the events that are taking place, while the older viewers are not deprived of any depth in the story as well. The most beautiful aspect of the story is that the development of the main characters, and that of the heroine are very concrete, and it begins to show more and more in a logical and natural way over time, and this is a professional achievement when it comes to storytelling.  
 
The secondary characters, or the guests of each episode, are complete in their compositions and are fairly developed. The ending is intact and beautiful, although being normal, and it was in dire need of a touch of brilliant directing to make it better, not better writing. There are some light negative points in weaving certain events and reaching their significance, and a lack of excellence in some episodes, and this deprives the storytelling in this Anime from reaching the highest level of writing, but does not deprive it from achieving a high quality nonetheless.  
 
All of the camera angles and movements have a significant meaning, and they contribute to the narration and making the Anime more exciting. The visual backgrounds throughout the Anime’s run are beautiful and very well done from a technical standpoint, and are filled with important details, to the point where they reflect on the personality of the characters that live in them, giving off a deep backstory for them, and contributing to making the story highly credible. The drawing of the movements and the characters maintain their quality throughout the Anime’s run, as most of the episodes contain incredible drawings and visuals, and there are episodes which are even greater, especially when those episodes become plot driven in a big way.  
 
The character design is imaginative and brilliant, even the secondary minor characters look unique in their own way, since each design reflects on the personality and traits of a character in a correct manner, without the need to make them look as outlandish as possible. The color palette is brilliant, especially when it comes to creating indoor lightning and mixing it in a way that comforts the eye and contributes on making the events more focused. The sound effects are also brilliant, as well as the music, which is harmonious with the events of the story and effectively contribute to aggregation and integration.  
 
All in all, this is an Anime that walks a fine line when it comes to writing, creative in showcasing it’s themes and has some of the best pacing in Anime. The characters are all well developed and lovable, appropriate for both young and old audiences. As for the old person, who suffers from the eternal dilemma of Anime being a children’s medium, this one proves otherwise. Don’t let the outer design of something fool you, rather let the essence of something be the most important. Plenty of times do we see something that looks like it was made for adults, but is in fact contextualized for a young audience of little experience in life, and plenty of times do we see a work that looks like it was made for a young audience, but rather becomes apparent through it’s context that it was clearly done for an older one. 

          
 
       Helpful I seen this twice and re-watching it again, I really think its underrated, also a very rare gem of early anime too. 
 
Story - This story is really a twist; it has elements of the story of Thumbelina base off Hans Christian Andersen but goes its own way. 
A woman whose fed up of her daughter's bratty attitude went to the town's witch and ask what to do, the elderly witch gave her a book called 'Thumbelina' and told her to  read it to her daughter. 
When she get home, she told her daughter Mia about the story and started reading it; a few pages in the story the Mother felt asleep and Mia decide to read the book however she suddenly grow smaller and smaller. 
Mia started her adventures, made friends along the way as well while heading to a kingdom to get back home and avoiding the evil witch and her magic. 
 
The story like I said has some elements of Thumbelina and a hint of the Wizard of Oz too while still being its own. 
Characters like the Toads and the mouse appear in the story as well with other creative characters. 
 
Characters - I'll admit their pretty descent but the only grew we see is our Main Character. 
Mia is indeed a total and ungrateful brat, like kids mostly are when she suddenly shirk down; she was helpless and scare  while still being bratty but along her journey, she starts being less of a brat. 
-The side characters are fun and cute too, Noble and Hoppy are super cute. 
 
Art- The art is good old school anime style, bright and colorful to dark and mysterious. True gem. 
 
Sound - Thou I did watch the dub, the voices were okay and I'll admit Mia's voice gets annoying at first but gets better later on. 
The music is wonderful and magical. 
 
The only down side I'll admit is the Witch Character, thou I won't say anything about it. 
 
This is a wonderful story to watch, and I want to find the DVD to this since its a cute story.

","Belonging to a Muslim family my bedtime stories consisted of the adventures of Sinbad, Ali Baba and Aladdin. We had a copy of the children’s version of 1001 nights at home and me and my brother would hang on every word as our mother would read them to us. When I grew older I watched all the movies and series based on these stories (e.g The Theif of Baghdad – a must watch if you like the Arabian Nights) 
 
So when I came across this movie by Tezuka, Osamu I was ecstatic. 
 
Let me explain the story a little. Senya Ichiya Monogatari (SIM) tells the tale of Aladdin as he ventures into Baghdad as a water seller and falls in love with a slave girl. The girl is being sold in the market place and Aladdin, who fell in love with her at first sight, taking advantage of a sandstorm takes off with the girl and that is where our tale begins. I won’t dispense too many details here, because its very entertaining to watch the story unfold. Since the original 1001 nights is so vast the writers have chosen and used some elements of the different popular tales and infused them in telling the tale of Aladdin (like the bandits cave, the flying toy horse and the flying carpet). I loved seeing all the different elements come together to create a completely new tale of love, hate, power and insanity. 
 
The characters are very entertaining to watch. There is just the right amount of comic relief in the dialogues and there are also scenes that will bring tears to your eyes. A few scenes sent a chill up my spine too but they were just as entertaining. By the end of the movie I felt that I had actually gone through a long journey because the time span covered in SIM is that of years but it doesn’t feel rushed at all.

       Helpful I've decided to write my first review on what I consider the best anime movie ever made. Now I doubt anyone else will agree with me on that statement but I truly feel this movie is a masterpiece. It was this movie that introduced me to the genius that is Osamu Tezuka. I expected to like this movie but I didn't expect it to be this good. It was excellent in every way, certainly better than any other cartoon movie at the time. With that being said its very sad to see this great film fall into obscurity the way it did. Any way on with the review. 
 
1001 nights is the first film of three films known as Animerama. The others were Cleopatra and Belladonna of Sadness. These films were among the first attempts at cartoons aimed for adults this one being the first full length animated feature made for adults. As you can expect their is quite a bit of nudity, sex, and Violence however it is not done in a sleazy way in fact it's quite light hearted feeling. The thing that truly makes this movie so great though is not as much the content as the Master story telling by Tezuka. This whole story is so deep and complex and even though at points it seems like it's going off the rails at times it all comes together perfectly in the end. The story is basically a twist on the story of Alladin with additions to it like Sinbad the sailor and the tower of Babel among other crazy stuff. It's hard to really explain the story without spoiling anything but it's largely a tale of rise and fall where many peoples lives intertwine. All the Characters are quite interesting and memorable and most have a strong amount of Character Development most notably Alladin. 
 
The art is also quite good for it's time and often mixes real in life images. There is is some nice psychedelic sex scenes which are quite mesmerizing. The music is awesome classic rock and proto-metal type stuff and is very catchy. The main theme often ends up stuck in my head in fact it is at this very moment. The whole movie is outstanding in everyway. 
 
 
Yeah that's my opinion and even though i'm plrobably alone on it I would suggest you watch this film if your cool with oldschool anime. It really is by all means a great film.

          
 
       Helpful Belonging to a Muslim family my bedtime stories consisted of the adventures of Sinbad, Ali Baba and Aladdin. We had a copy of the children’s version of 1001 nights at home and me and my brother would hang on every word as our mother would read them to us. When I grew older I watched all the movies and series based on these stories (e.g The Theif of Baghdad – a must watch if you like the Arabian Nights) 
 
So when I came across this movie by Tezuka, Osamu I was ecstatic. 
 
Let me explain the story a little. Senya Ichiya Monogatari (SIM) tells the tale of Aladdin as he ventures into Baghdad as a water seller and falls in love with a slave girl. The girl is being sold in the market place and Aladdin, who fell in love with her at first sight, taking advantage of a sandstorm takes off with the girl and that is where our tale begins. I won’t dispense too many details here, because its very entertaining to watch the story unfold. Since the original 1001 nights is so vast the writers have chosen and used some elements of the different popular tales and infused them in telling the tale of Aladdin (like the bandits cave, the flying toy horse and the flying carpet). I loved seeing all the different elements come together to create a completely new tale of love, hate, power and insanity. 
 
The characters are very entertaining to watch. There is just the right amount of comic relief in the dialogues and there are also scenes that will bring tears to your eyes. A few scenes sent a chill up my spine too but they were just as entertaining. By the end of the movie I felt that I had actually gone through a long journey because the time span covered in SIM is that of years but it doesn’t feel rushed at all. 
 
The animation is old but surprisingly it complements the story very well adding to the majestic atmosphere. The scenes are very vivid and the imagery is very powerful. (I wouldn’t watch this after doing drugs :p) 
Overall I loved SMI. It reminded me how much I enjoyed the Arabian Nights tales as a child and its motivated me to buy the 1001 nights compilation translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Magic', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS. The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","I actually had watched .hack//SIGN in 2007, and didn't find it too crash hot. I don't think at the time, I had realized that there were more .hack series apart from Legend Of The Twilight and Roots, so I never got round to watching Intermezzo, and the others. 
 
STORY: Couldn't really remember much from the main SIGN series, and I was reminded today about how. .. average the story line was. Of course this is only a one episode special, so there wasn't much to it; Mimiru drags along Bear to check for something in a temporarily re-opened dungeon in The World. I mustn't have been paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn't realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past. That made no sense to me, but whatever. Another turn off would be the MMORPG theme, and that would be probably because of the characters which I will discuss later.  
 
ART: .hack art, well, character designs remind me of Angelic Layer's and I honestly can't be screwed looking up whether it is designed by the same person. Anyway. The overall design is pretty smooth and bold, however the noses are a bit of a bother sometimes. Animation was par, apart from some parts, typically involving bright, flashy scenes, oh, and the opening. 
 
SOUND: The sound has always been good in the .hack series, even if I do have to strain my brain to remember. Same goes for both the ending and opening themes, especially the opening. I guess the 'chanting'(?) used in the series is appealing to me. 
 
CHARACTERS: I'm sorry but, do any of these people who play in The World actually have a life? If you completely ignore the fact that the players seem to be almost always online and how serious they play the game, I think I would probably give the overall series a 6. In Intermezzo, the audience is introduced to three 18 year old girls, taking turns to play a single character called Mimika. The three of them go on about how that they can be appreciated in The World, and not in actual life, suggesting that they are 'incompetent' and 'plain'. Sure, on the odd occasion I play MMORPGs, but only for fun when I have spare time and I feel like it. I don't take it very seriously, and I only play at my own pace. But is it really necessary to take a MMORPG, or any game, so seriously that it almost blends in with your own life offline? Many times during Intermezzo, and the other .hack series, I've wanted to remind the characters that ""it's just a game."" 
 
This special was fine, and I honestly can't expand any further on it. Definitely something I would suggest to a .hack fan, and if you're not interested in MMORPG themes or you didn't really enjoy .hack//SIGN (however I'm the type of person who HAS to watch every series' special, movie, ova, etc, and I don't normally drop anime.), I do not suggest watching this.

While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.

","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The film is based on the tradition of ""four basic necessities of life"", like each other and is divided into three storylines: 

The Rice Noodles (Japanese: 陽だまりの朝食, romanized: hidamari no chōshoku, simplified Chinese: 一碗乡愁; traditional Chinese: 一碗鄉愁; pinyin: yì wǎn xiāng chóu), focusing on food

","I watched the netflix version of this, which just sort of mushes the three stories together to make a feature length film. The story is as the MAL description says. It has three parts that do not really have much to do with each other. Each story is sweet and features about 80% voice over to tell it. Your enjoyment of the three may vary. I personally feel that the middle story is the weakest and kind of played out. However, the characters are solid. The first is my favorite for the visuals and the voice acting (which we'll get into later) but lacks any kind of story. The third is the only one with a real story line. However, the characters are bland and the voice acting is terrible. No one part has everything.  
 
The art is absolutely spectacular. While the character design is lacking, the background and and settings are very deep and dazzling. There was a shot of a puddle in the opening minutes that made me mark out hard. The art is pretty consistent throughout the three stories, but the first is where the most animation time went into.  
 
The sound and music are not very noticeable. Aside from a few good tape recording and cooking effects there is not much to talk about. The dubbing is a bit rough. It is a little noticeable in the second story with not awkwardly read, but awkwardly translated lines. Then, in the third story we get to listen to captain no charisma do the main character.  
 
The characters are where this movie takes a hit. Outside of the second story there are not any noteworthy characters. Some kids, some grandparents etc.  
 
Overall, it is a very easy and fast watch. The movie likes to try to trigger nostalgia and in some cases may do so effectively. I would recommend watching it with the dub if only to be able to focus on the beautiful artwork as it is one of the few saving graces of the work.

          
 
       Helpful • SLIGHT SPOILER REVIEW • 
 
Shikioriori, English name: Flavors of Youth, is divided into 3 Chapters: First (Sunny Breakfast), Second (Small Fashion Show), Third (Shanghai Love). Similar on what Shinkai did on 5 Centimeters per Second. The movie is placed in China and even the main character’s name is all in Chinese. But the studio and voice actors are Japanese. Here’s my quick review of the film: 
 
Story: 
As the film begins, you're greeted with an aesthetically beautiful art and animation followed by a few words and the first chapter’s title. The MC of the first chapter then is introduced. As the first chapter ends, the second chapter begins. The transition is the same as the first one. As the story flows, the movie gives a very heartwarming slice of life, with a slight touch of love, heartbreak, and a mediocre drama. The story travels from the perspective of a young man experiencing youth, first love, and being unknowledgeable about adults. Being able to wonder why do people leave? The story then jumps from a young man to a 20-ish women. The movie shows how life has plenty of trials to overcome, and how people be able to overcome those difficult trials. In this chapter, the movie also questions you, ”The job you choose, are you really enjoying it?” ”Have you really live life to the fullest?”. Then from 20-ish women to a young boy, in this chapter, you are able to realize how communication is really important at any times. This chapter is so far the best among them. A really strong friendship of a group of best friends followed by a trial they should, with the emotion of love, anxiety, and fear at their backs. This chapter shows how this group of friends reacts to their current situation and how time could never be rewind even you wish to. Overall, the plot is filled with tons of great slice of life, paced on a slow start and an explosive ending. There are no big expectations, to begin with. The story might be boring to some non slice of anime fans. 7/10 
 
Art: As the Studio who created Your Name, 5 Centimeter Per Seconds and Garden of Words, it was amazing. Tho there are times where you can able to see some lousy animation, but overall its good. The budget might not be too big as compared to Shinkai’s work, but CoMix Wave really give a shot especially to those beautiful backgrounds! The CGI of the cars are actually good too. Nevertheless, the animation is amazing, tho they have flaws, but the positives overpowered all the negatives. 8/10 
 
Sound: Sound effects are great. The food preparation during the first few minutes of the film is amazing. The chopping of ingredients, up to the sound of rain. It's actually pretty decent. The credits song is actually good too. 8/10 
 
Character: The character designs are mediocre for me. I mean, CoMix Wave actually has pretty decent animation and art skills. But their character design is just .... meh. Its nothing to be amazing and shock about. VAs are good. They did choose a very warm tone for the VAs of the MCs. There is really no character development that can be seen in the movie. But on how the MCs end their chapter is really a big thumbs up for me. It also relays a message to the viewers and few life lessons. Overall, 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: I’m a fan of slice of life anime, so I’m pretty used to a slow-paced plot. A slow pace movie also gives the audience time to enjoy the great art drawn by the studio. Afterall, it is a great animation that leads the viewers to finish the movie at the end. I somewhat enjoy the movie. There are no explosives and huge plot twist like Your Name, nor a heavy drama and heart pounding ending like 5 centimeters. Just pure slice of life with a glimpse of love and a tiny drama. Overall, 8/10 
 
Conclusion: As I said a moment ago, this movie is pace differently to other famous one. So you should not compare it to them as they are way different from each other. I would definitely recommend this anime to SOME, as non slice of life and drama fan might get really bored to this film. Overall, a great film if you are looking for something to cry one. Overall, films score is 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful This film comprises three shorter, independent stories, with the common premise of the inevitable loss of the things, people and places that used to make us happy. I think it is targeted at a certain demographic starting at late 20s to early 30s, when one begins to realize the extent of this loss. It is an emotional experience for those of us who can relate to it, but to those who not it may be boring, since all three stories are built on a feeling more than a plot: In that aspect, it reminds me of Jiro Taniguchi's works. Let's say as well that I don't agree with other reviewers in the point that it is a product for an Asian audience specifically: I am Spanish and I can fully relate to the themes presented. 
 
When giving a score to it, the problem is that I'd give a different score to the three shorts: 7 to the first one, 6 to the second and 8 to the third; therefore, by average I give it a 7 (plus an extra point because overall I enjoyed it quite a lot and felt touched). I feel though that the themes could have been better executed, specially in the first and second stories. 
 
Keep in mind that this is not something you watch for the story, but for the shared feeling of nostalgia between the film and your own experience. If you haven't felt that experience of seeing the things that mean your younger days disappear, you'll probably find this boring.

 Hetalia Axis Powers  takes these questions and runs with them, personifying countries into characters. The show takes a comedic and light approach to politics and historical events while educating the viewer. 
 
Taking place primarily during the events of World War I and World War II, the story focuses on the Axis Powers and occasionally throws the spotlight onto the tumultuous relationship between the Allied Forces. The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests.

       Helpful When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

          
 
       Helpful First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story – inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio – is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

Ranze has yet to manifest her supernatural powers, and her parents are beginning to get worried she might be normal. So begins the fantasy romantic comedy story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Vampire']","15-year-old Ranze Eto lives in an isolated castle in Japan with her werewolf mother, vampire father, and younger brother, Rinze.  Despite her lineage, she has yet to demonstrate any special powers of her own, and her parents are worried she might be a normal girl.  One day, Ranze's innate power finally manifests itself when she, quite by accident, discovers that she can change herself into a carbon copy of any object she bites, whether it be a person or an inanimate object like a piece of bread, and can return to her normal self only by sneezing.  Her parents are overjoyed, but Ranze's new powers make it difficult to continue living life as a normal teenage girl.
On Ranze's first day at her new school in junior high, she meets and falls in love with the brash yet handsome young athlete, Shun Makabe. The chief problem with this is that Ranze's parents will not allow her to date a human - although there may be much more to Shun than meets the eye. On top of this, she also has a bitter rival in the pretty but spiteful Yoko Kamiya (the daughter of a yakuza boss) who also likes Shun and doesn't take kindly to Ranze's intruding on her turf.
","Tokimeki Tonight is not a well-known anime (which is why there are no reviews for it). It's fallen to the wayside since it finished airing 35 years ago. Is it fair or is there more to this series than what's on the surface? 
 
Story: 
If you ever wanted an anime version of the Addams Family with your typical shoujo clichés thrown in, this is the closest you're going to get.  
 
Due to the episodic nature of the series, don't expect any significant progress. Yes, even after the dramatic events of episodes 25 and 26, everything turns back to normal when the credits roll. Also, don't be surprised if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground. 
 
The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze's love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers. (More on that later!) 
 
Music: 
I was rather taken aback by the score on Tokimeki Tonight. The score was quite infectious, to the point that some of it played in my mind while I was trying to fall asleep. A special shout-out goes to the fighting music with the saxophone in it. 
 
Of course, the main draws are the OP and ED. I must admit, this is one of the few series where I liked the ED music more than the OP. However, both are quite catchy and memorable (in accordance with the law of 80s themes). 
 
Characters: 
While there's no character I like 100% of the time (outside of the shark in episode 32, which, trust me, makes sense in context), the main cast tends to be likable more often than not. 
 
However, there were some I couldn't bring myself to like, no matter how hard I tried. The rigidness of Ranze's mother made any scene she was in tough to digest. She wants Ranze to fall in love with a fellow monster and repeatedly tries to sabotage her romantic efforts with Makabe-kun. In fact, her rabid traditionalism even puts Ranze in danger in episode 13. 
 
Yoko, Ranze's rival in love, is a brat at best and downright treacherous at worst. However, I believe she was intentionally written to be unlikable. 
 
Recurring characters Sand and Prince Aaron are borderline predators and that ruined any enjoyment I could have had of them. 
 
Art: 
One of the most unusual aspects of Tokimeki Tonight is the background art. While the series presumably takes place in Japan, most of the signs are in English and the architecture has an old European flair to it. 
 
As for the rest of the art, it's par for the course for an anime made in the early 80s. There was obviously a limited budget, which explains why the coloring is often basic and there's a lack of detail in the character's faces (you'll notice several times throughout the show, characters are drawn without noses). I'm willing to let this fly, as the art isn't vomit-inducing and anime wasn't the most fruitful industry at the time. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Tokimeki Tonight is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's good. Some stories are entertaining, while others can be borderline snooze fests. Like most everything else with this series, my enjoyment was about abverage. 
 
Final thoughts: 
While not the worst anime I've seen (*cough* Blue Flames), it's understandable as to why this series fell to the wayside. It's a 7 at its best and it's a 3 at its worst. I honestly thought I would have more to see for this, but it's just-so average. It's an obvious 5. 
 
So, all in all, I give this series five glasses of tomato juice out of ten.

Giant Robo is a character-driven adventure in a retro-futuristic setting, drawing on influences from opera, kung-fu cinema, wuxia stories and classic mecha anime. It incorporates characters from the works of the manga author Mitsuteru Yokoyama but it is designed to be a stand-alone story.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","
","Story - 10/10 
The events take place in the near future, ten years after the advent of the Shizuma Drive triggers the third energy revolution. The series follows the master of the titular Robo, Daisaku Kusama, and the Experts of Justice, an international police organization locked in battle with the Big Fire (BF) Group, a secret society hell-bent on world domination. 
 
Art/Animation - 10/10 
Started in 1992 and finished in 1998, Giant Robo's animation is just absolutely amazing. For being made in the 1990's, it felt like it was made just in the last year. It's some of the most beautiful and clean animation I've ever seen from the 1990's.  
 
Sound - 10/10 
Giant Robo's music/sound was composed, arranged and conducted by Japanese Academy Award nominee Masamichi Amano and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir. The music ranges from grand pieces to more light-hearted tracks. The music of Giant Robo has been called one of animation's crowning achievements. 
 
Character - 10/10 
You'll fall in love, I guarantee it, with many of the characters and the noble heroism they bring to Giant Robo. You'll fall in love with the heroes of the Experts of Justice or the villains of the Big Fire Organization. All of them are likable. Giant Robo is considered to be a character drama, as each episode passes, you'll fall deeper and deeper into the character's depth. 
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
Giant Robo is considered one of the true classics of anime. With each episode varied in time(35-60 minutes each), each episode is like a movie, it sounds and feels like one. It's over-the-top action and adventure will leaving you grinning cheek to cheek. It was so over-the-top, those who watch the last episode after watching the first six, have known to spontaneously combust - it's that good and enjoyable! 
 
Overall, I give this a 10/10. This is a must-own to any and all anime fans. Truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 

          
 
       Helpful I remember watching the first episode of the OVA back when I was a kid, and I always wanted to finish the special but never had a chance to up until now. Giant robo is a special kind of anime that is like no other because it's based off of a 60's manga. This klind of classic doesn't get the attention it deserves so I intend to share my experience with others in hopes of having more people recognize this great anime. 
 
Story: The anime shoves it's plot down your throat consistently throughout the entire anime, which is sort of a bad thing. While the story is epic in proportions and has a drama and intensity of greek theater, the plot is riddled with holes and inconsistencies that plague the anime from about the middle to the end. What's charming is that it never fails to make the audience want to care and understand the world in which the protagonists and antagonists live in; and because of this it keeps the story enjoyable because it's bad plot doesn't take away from the story told. 
 
Art & Sound: By far the strongest aspect of the anime. It's production value is INSANELY high. The original score is absolutely fantastic  and the animation is top notch. The art style is much like astro boy or the more recent kikaider with an older, more traditional anime character design as in the 60's and 70's manga and animation. It's a nice change of pace from the huge eyes and pointy colorful hair. Also, the English dub is AWESOME. The quality of the English dubs in this OVA were spectacular! Never were there lines lost in translation and nothing sounded off and strange, it was just perfectly suiting for the anime. The main characters had a great cast that had enthusiasm and voices to match their respective characters. 
 
Overall: While the anime struggles to deliver a good plot for the audience, it doesn't fail to present to us a beautiful story told with great animation, sound, and character design. While it has many flaws, there was never a dull moment watching this long OVA. Every minute you spend, regardless the good or the bad were enjoyed because the anime is incredibly enjoyable to watch. 
 
It's a flawed masterpiece.

          
 
       Helpful A great tribute for the late Mitsuteru Yokoyama, Giant Robo is a show that revives classic characters and puts them in an interesting storyline that includes elements of science fiction and even fantasy. 
 
The animation in Giant Robo is gorgeous, which is expected from its production values. Anyone who enjoys good old fashioned cel animation can expect some of the highest quality. 
 
The sound and music department is another element where the series excels. Classical styled music and even a little opera are used to fill up you with excitement or pull out tears from your eyes during its dramatic moments. 
 
The story is an epic and coming of age tale of its main character, Daisaku. However, one can become overwhelmed by the number of characters and their involvement in the plot as well as the many mysteries that are slowly resolved or dragged on through the story. Its also inconclusive as the project for the series could not be sustaind any further, ending it abruptly. 
 
Given opportunity, Giant Robo can be a highly enjoyable experience. Especially for fans of the mecha and scienfe fiction genres as well as seasoned manga readers who may recognize elements that inspired this project.

(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']","More than 14 years before the events of the series, a Japanese archaeologist named Jidan (ジダン, Jidan) fell down the hole of the ruins on the mysterious Crow Island into the Magical Realm (魔法界, Mahō Kai) during his research on the crow statue (クロウ像, kurō zō). He was found and imprisoned by Grande (グランデ, Gurande), the leader and general of the warlocks (魔族, mazoku). A witch soldier named Atelia (アテリア, Ateria) rescued him and later had a son named Lennon (レノン, Renon) together. Jidan left her to seal the True Book of Spells (真の魔導書, Shin no Madōsho) away in the Human Realm (人間界, Ningen Kai), keeping the forbidden dark magic (黒魔法, kuro mahō) from turning the Human Realm into an empty haven for the witches (魔女, majo) and warlocks from their old, dying Magical Realm. During a voyage back to the Human Realm, Jidan was accidentally separated from his son, who would grow up to be a pirate on the Interdimensional Sea (異次元の海, Ijigen no Umi). Jidan eventually married Yoko (ヨーコ, Yōko), with whom he had a daughter named Arusu (アルス, Arusu). He taught their young daughter to believe in magic and use magic for happiness, with the True Book of Spells as a present for her 5th birthday. He left the family for the Magical Realm in search of his son, only to endure 6 years of imprisonment in Wizard Kingdom (ウィザードキングダム, Wizādo Kingudamu), the underground capital city of the Warlock Realm (魔族界, Mazoku Kai).
In the present day, Arusu finds herself in the Magical Realm at the age of 11, summoned by Lennon and the True Book of Spells. She is captured by some witches alongside a mina fairy (妖精ミーナ, yōsei mīna), only for Eva (エバ, Eba) to release her in gratitude for giving her a sweet chestnut, species of which do not grow wild in the realm. Arusu is initially delighted that her dream has finally been granted, however, she is not satisfied with the way of the witches, insisting that magic should only be used to make people happy. When she releases all the fairies (妖精, yōsei) the witches have captured as the source of magic spells, she is tasked with removing the Curse of Eternal Youth (大人になれない魔法, Otona ni nare-nai Mahō) from Sheila (シーラ, Shīra) and Eva, two apprentice witches of her age. During their attempts to recapture the fairies, Arusu and her new friends deal with the special task force (特殊捕獲部隊, tokushu hokaku butai), an elite team of combat-oriented witches sent by Atelia, now one of the Three Sages (三賢者, San Kenja), for the same purpose. Arusu begins to live with her new friends in Dragon House (ドラゴンハウス, Doragon Hausu) as Atelia arranges for her to live as an apprentice witch.
The Witch Realm (魔女界, Majo Kai) reaches the day of the witch evaluation (魔女検定, majo kentei), which banishes apprentice witches who fail to pass at the age of 16 to the Human Realm, a fate all witches fear. During the evaluation, a huge hydra fairy (妖精ハイドラ, yōsei haidora) attacks the realm, allowing the warlocks to find out that all the fairies have escaped. Arusu turns herself into stone to save the realm, only for Qoo (クー, Kū) to bring her back to life with her long hair. This causes Atelia to allow Qoo to stay in the realm because she is no longer a failed witch. Afterward, the warlocks invade the realm in search of the True Book of Spells, the 100 fairy species, and a witch, all of which they need to cast dark magic. With the help of the mysterious Sigma (シグマ, Shiguma), Arusu and her group sneak into the Warlock Realm, where science dominates every aspect of life under a new rule. Arusu and her group accidentally reveal themselves as apprentice witches in disguise, forcing them to escape from the police. Arusu emerges from a coma to find herself healed and sheltered by Wil (ウィル, Wiru), an old rebel who fights for the wizards (ウィザード, wizādo), the group of magic-using warlocks forced by the military dictatorship to live in the deserted Miche Village (ミッシュ村, Misshu Mura). At the Sanctuary (聖地, Seichi), Sheila learns from Sigma about the eventual destruction of their home realm, as well as the existence of the real portal to the Human Realm.
After Wil helps Arusu reunite with her group and save the fairies, she suggests to Sheila and Eva that they found the Magical Girl Squad (魔法少女隊, Mahō Shōjo Tai) to protect magic and the fairies from the warlocks. During the celebration for the foundation of the Magical Girl Squad, Sheila drugs Arusu to send her on board Ludens (ルーデンス号, Rūdensu), a ship carrying failed witches to the Human Realm. Under the order from the Grand Master of Witches (グランドマスター, Gurando Masutā), Sheila spies on the Three Sages at night to find the traitor, the witch secured by the warlocks to cast dark magic, in hopes of removing the Curse of Eternal Youth from at least Eva. After surviving an explosion thanks to the True Book of Spells, Arusu returns to the Magical Realm with Lennon, who calls himself her ""mirror"". Discarded by his superiors for failure, Sigma becomes cellmates with Jidan and learns of the human's personal history. Eva begins to see a vision of a mysterious old man encouraging her to stay hopeful, causing her magic to become stronger than before.
During a meeting in the chapel, Atelia declares a full-scale war against the warlocks, scapegoating them for the destruction of the Magical Realm. The ensuing war is interrupted by Arusu, who screams to the masses that the witches and warlocks should work together to protect their home realm. The Magical Girl Squad and Lennon are invited by Atelia, who demands the True Book of Spells from them. She reveals that she broke the law of the witches and had a son named Lennon by Jidan, who stole the True Book of Spells 14 years ago, much to Arusu's shock. During a rebellion led by the special task forces, the warlocks mistake Lennon for Arusu and capture him away, threatening to kill both him and his imprisoned father unless he gives them the True Book of Spells. When the witches are approaching to fight back, Luca (ルーカ, Rūka), one of the commanders of the warlocks, declares the humans as a common enemy who keeps dark magic from saving all the citizens of the dying Magical Realm. Encouraged by Arusu, Atelia confesses her treachery and offers herself in exchange for her son, shifting the anger of the masses from him to herself. To get people to trust the humans, Arusu gives Grande the True Book of Spells in exchange for her father and Atelia as promised. During the destruction of Wizard Kingdom, Sigma rescues Arusu and helps her return with her friends, recognizing her as the savior foretold by his late father, who died in defiance of Grande's nefarious plans. When Luca and his men are looking for Jidan and Atelia at the bottom of Hydra Lake (ハイドラ湖, Haidora Ko), Jidan offers himself to save Atelia, leaving Arusu desperately searching for his body in vain. Eva suddenly loses her magic and grows weak from the plague that has afflicted many witches and warlocks as a sign of the destruction. The Magical Girl Squad temporarily surrender to Grande and the special task forces, who demand a mina fairy from them. After another visit from the mysterious old man, Eva accepts his offer to restore her magic with the True Book of Spells.
The witches and warlocks scream in despair as the Magical Realm crumbles through the fierce power of dark magic. Grande reveals to Sheila that Eva has darkness in her heart, allowing him to manipulate her into casting dark magic. Realizing that dark magic is made of hate, distrust, and despair, Arusu decides to save her friend despite her betrayal. Contrary to Lennon's warnings, Arusu manages to come back from the bottom of the Interdimensional Sea where she is dragged into the Human Realm by the interdimensional sirens (異次元の天女, ijigen no tennyo). She feeds Eva a chestnut as a token of their friendship, saving the Magical Realm with the legendary magic of light (光の魔法, hikari no mahō) in the process. Full of new hope for the future, all the witches and warlocks come together as one to rebuild their home realm. Sheila and Eva have the Curse of Eternal Youth removed from themselves by the Grand Master of Witches, who asks Arusu to stay and improve the Magical Realm, which the human girl refuses. After a tearful farewell, one of the interdimensional sirens takes Arusu home to Japan, where she finally reunites with both her parents.

Suddenly, Alice found herself being in the forest she had never seen and  
being stared at by a creature looked like a fairly. Then, a witch on a 
broom came and attacked her. She and the fairly ran away not knowing why. 
Until that morning, she used to be a normal girl, and she was in her  
class listening to the teacher speaking with only half an ear.  
She must have been only an eleven-year-old girl, who opened the book  
titled ""A book that makes you a witch"", which had been given by her  
father, and imagined herself to be a witch. 
She and the fairly were caught by a witch and confined into a fairly jail.  
Soon, apprentice witches, Sheila and Eva, came. They were astonished that  
there was a human in the magical world. Alice also came to realize that  
it was a magical world. Alice changes the world in which she exists and tries to make it better, she teaches by example that magic is privileged rather than something to be taken for granted. 
 
Mahou shoujo tai, takes u on a amazing ride through the world of magic with Alice, like never seen!! 
 
In terms of both visual style and storytelling it breaks with a lot of anime conventions, using rare but beautiful character designs (the character design on this amime, reminds me of noien, I don’t recall watching other anime like this) , strange but interesting creatures, the backgrounds are gorgeous like all the rest, and animation is also good… 
 
The characters are great, each of the main characters Alice, Eva and Sheila, each has a unique personality, even the secondary characters are great with lots of different looks and personalities… 
 
The music is Superb with a magic atmosphere; the background effects and ambiance are, with a suitable musical score to match, and the characters voices feat perfectly. 
In the music score I have to give a special mention to the ed song ""DuDiDuWa*lalala"" by KOTOKO, I just love this music, and it feats the show quite well… 
 
Overall: This is that kind of anime either u love or either u hate (well I don’t believe anyone could hate it), its an enjoyable anime worth anyone watching it… 


          
 
       Helpful Mahou Shoujo Tai Arusu (Magical Girl Squad Arusu, or ""Tweeny Witches"" in the dub) is a fairly enjoyable fantasy witch show. 
 
The show takes place in the Magic Realm, opposite the Human Realm from which the main character obviously arrives. Being the oddball idealist that she is, Arusu, the human newcomer, manages to get away with destroying the tradition of the magic realm and disrupting what the witches would deem normal by using her enthusiasm and optimism to assure everybody that magic exists to make people happy. Magic is not a tool of war, and war will eventually lead to destruction, despite the ideals that the higher-up witches hold in high regard. 
 
It can't be said that the plot is unpredictable, but each episode is short (at ten minutes) and keeps the viewer on their toes as to what will happen next. The story isn't hard to follow, and seems to rush into some elements without much explanation (i.e. the magical realm is going to be destroyed), but it is charming and enjoyable in a way that keeps it watchable despite the numerous clichés and tropes it employs. 
 
The reason I watched this show is that Studio 4C was involved, and they are renowned for making exceptional anime. This certainly isn't one of their best, and the animation style is nothing to gawk at, but it is a capable show. You won't find many shocks or surprises in this one, but Arusu is a roller coaster of emotion, friendship, idealism, and magic.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 8 
 
Mahou Shoujo Tai Arusu is one of those animes where the storyline can, for the most part keep you intriged and wanting the next episode, as each small episode ends in a cliff hanger for the most part. The story overall in itself is genius, and except for a few things is very likable. So, what isn't likable about the storyline? 
 
The thing about Mahou Shoujo Tai Arusu is that it likes to slam the reader over the head with 'ideas'. For example, there are messages that become apparent in some of the episodes. One is that we depend to much on technollogy. The other is that evoulution is true, which might upset people who either refuse to believe it, or hate it when it isn't treated like a theory.  
 
And the overall theme is peace instead of violence. The problem with this message, is human nature itself has always had to have a balance of these two. Of course, this is a story where there needs to be a happy ending, so this in a way works. 
 
Art: 7 
 
The art in here is experimental in the style. There is a lot of detail in their, but in the same time, not a lot. For example, there is detail put into the intricate designs of the costumes and clothing, but the hair and other things lack texture, and it isn't blocked in, not to mention that shadow for visual depth is lacking, giving the anime a kind of haunted look.  
 
And some of the techniques don't quite fit. For example, when the characters cry, their tears become really sparkly and look more three dimentional shadow wise then anything else. Other times, one is given a wierd effect as they distort things visualy. 
 
Also, flash back are flash backs, flashing in and out for a few seconds. While this fits with the mood and theme of the anime, it should be warned here... if you run the chance of having siezures, you may not want to watch this anime, even if you might find it delightful. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The sound was haunting, action packed, and fit the moods as they came and went. The score was beutiful and is one of the highlights of this anime. 
 
Character: 10 
 
Part of the enjoyment of the characters is that, if it isn't am unnamed character, they are given lots of attention to detail on the designs of the characters. The second part of the enjoyment is the depth behind hte characters. Each has a very distinct personality, which actually helps the storyline along, and to go into depth about the characters would spoil the actual story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
While I rather enjoyied this, there was a point where I had to put down the anime. The main reason is, I got annoyied at the time with Alice's overly positive attitude at that time. However, I met characters that I really liked later on, others that I knew I was meant to hate. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
This isn't going to be for everyone. Some will take one look at the art style and choke. Others will get fed up with Alice's attitude of positiveness, while others will not like things bashed over their head. But it is at least worth watching for a bit to from ones own opinion...

JRPGs made my childhood, not only mine, but also millions of other people. I played countless hours in Pokemon, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and The Legend of Zelda. The time spent by the creators in making these fascinting worlds made me apreciate these titles so much. That’s why I loved imagining myself in them, and wondered what I would do in a place of main character. Turns out that I wasn’t the first person to think that. A whole new genre was created out of these thouhts.  
Isekai is fascinating in concept, guy or a girl is transported into another world, or they’re trapped in a game, where they need to start a new life, using the knowledge they aquired in the previous, where it would’ve normally be useles. The problem starts with how repetitive this got. I absolutely don’t understand why they stopped at fantasy setting, there’s so many other interesting genres. Also basically every isekai excluding No Game No Life, is making the same flaw that Tolkien had started, and that is every species needs to do exactly what was established in the earlier story’s. For example the ogres are warriors, elphs live in the peace with nature, and thay’re skilled at handling the magic, and so on and so forth. There’s never an explanetion of why something like this occur, it’s just simple copy, and paste from other fantasy titles. Everyone is just pretending „that’s how it was supposed to be, and every difference is a heresy”. If the author doesn’t care, why you should? 
 
Part 2: Story is laughable 
Finally I’m starting to talk about this show, so let’s go with the plot. It begens with two main characters walking down the street, then suddenly the bike is atacking them!!!! 
Altough sadly they avoid it and are teleported by some magic ring, that has apeared out of nowhere, to another world. I must say that if they died by being hit by a bike, it would’ve definitelly grab my attention.  
The only difference that this anime is proposing is a female counterpart for a protagonist. Although this turns out pathetic later, I'm gonna talk about this in the next part. 
The rest of the story feels like it was written… no actually drawn by a todller, and some adult thought that it’s a good idea to write a story based on this drawing. It is full of plot conveniences, deus ex machinas, incostinent characters, broken power ascalation, in the end I still don’t undarstend why it is called „cheat magician”, and the worst thing – it’s boring. If the writer don’t try, then why he even started this in the first place? Of course it’s for the easy money. 
 
Part 3: Formless goo, not characters 
Characters are totally riped off from other shows. There’s litterally nobody, who would even seem to be kinda original. They’re remembering me of those creatures from one scene in Inside Out where Happyness and Sadness go to the inside version of Holywood, and there are those beings that take some form if you see them by „dream lense”, and the script from wich they were acting depanded from what happened in the day of Riley.  
What I meant by this comparison is that those characters are basically those beings, when you watch this show, the „dream lense” is your monitor, and the script for them are characters from other shows. 
 
Part 4: The visuals are awfull 
It doesn’t feel right to give this, and Kenja no Mago the same score, the second one has at least kinda original plot, and the visuals were actually good. What can I even say about Isekai Cheat Magician? Animation is bland and disgusting, nothing that stands out. 
 
Part 5: Soundtrack is passable 
 To be honest I don’t really remember anything at all from the soundtrack, but maybe it’s better that way, if something did stand out, it would probably be so bad it would’ve made my ears bleed. And these are harsh words to the composer of Dororo soundtrack. But actually there was something that made my ears bleed, it was opening. I’m not a fan of Myth&Roid, in my opinion they made, at best 3 good songs, and one very good. And the ed was painfully avarege. 
 
Overall Thoughts: 
Why would you even consider watching this. Everything that could be done better was already made. Watching this is a painfull waste of time.  
Isekai is probably making it’s dying breath, looking at how many of those shows they’re cramming now, where practically every one of them is avarege at best, which most of the time, is a sign of a bitter farewell. I asked some people some time ago „is there any good isekai left” the answer wasn’t very reassuring, the future does not look too bright for this genre. 

          
 
       Helpful You can tell just how bad this anime is going to be by simply looking at the cover art. But hold up! That doesn't mean that this isekai doesn't have some unique elements! 
 
For one, it isn't just the Legendary Overpowered Super Excellent Revolutionary dude, or LOSER dude for short, who gets isekai'd to a fabulous new word. No, his female friend does as well! How shockingly unexpected! Also, this anime subverts your expectations by making you think that LOSER dude is going to get killed protecting main girl from an oncoming bike, but PLOT TWIST! It completely misses them and they just get sent to a fantasy world via a magic circle instead. How exciting! Finally, this was the anime that's come closest to making me fall asleep while watching. If it had actually succeeded, then it truly would have been one of a kind! 
 
With great innovative twists like these and (maybe) some others, this anime is surely spectacular, right? Well, it does unfortunately still contain many qualities typical of mediocre isekai... 
 
It still has an overpowered protagonist who can't fail, can do no wrong, and must have accidentally left his personality in the real world considering how bland he is. 
 
It still has cute girls that unfortunately have absolutely nothing going for them except their cuteness and their singular defining trope that lets you differentiate between them. 
 
It still looks bland with uninspired character designs, terrible animation complete with choppy movements, and background and scenic visuals that I feel like I've seen before. 
 
It still sounds like nobody with any talent was involved...wait, hold up. This anime has the likes of Takahashi Rie and Myth&Roid involved? Ok, I take back what I said about the sound department. But nothing else! 
 
It still contains a paper thin plot that nobody, including we the viewers, the characters in the show, and the writer himself actually cares about considering how generic it is.  
 
It still is boring as hell and I won't be watching any more of it. Props to you if you're somehow able to make it all the way through! 
 
But hey, the positives outweigh the negatives so much that this anime obviously still deserves a perfect 10/10 cuz a gurl iz isekai'd...or at least it would, but I was told to be serious in my scoring so...1/10 instead. Hooray... 


          
 
       Helpful This show is so bad that I actually decided to write a review. I only have a couple sentences for this review. I wasn't expecting much if this show and I still don't. I am currently on episode 9 and all I can do is just stay disappointed. The show is best described like this "" it's like a trainwreck. You know it's bad but you can't help but watch."" That is the best way to describe the show and I have somehow managed to watch 9 episodes of this shit. I hope to never have to do this for another show ever again.

13,1040,23,8.985779230677004,story with the main character transported to another world,Mizuiro Jidai,"Yuuko is a shy middle school girl who has feelings for her childhood friend, the boy next door. When she finds out that her best friend also likes him, she is unsure what to do. The story explores the relationships between these three characters as they confront everyday junior high problems. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The story of the anime follows Yuko Kawai, a junior highschool student, as she faces the challenges of growing up and overcoming her shyness as she comes of age. She begins seeing her best friend Hiroshi Naganuma, the boy next door, in a different light.
","This is Yabuuchi Yuu’s “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is her story, her journey, of coming to understand the world – ever so gently. As this chronicles the pivotal events in Yuuko’s three years in middle school, Yabuuchi tells her story as she would tell to her younger self, with guidance and reassurance.  
 
If you might not have noticed, Yuuko kawai sounds very similar to kawaii Yuu ko, which is literally cute Yuu child (same kanji for Yuu, the author’s name). This is Yabuuchi’s fond memory. We view along with Yuuko her issues of life, of love, of friendship, of fate, and of the feelings that she can’t discern. Then with Yabuuchi’s conveyed respect and acceptance of Yuuko’s worries, find reconciliation through the help of others.  
 
I don’t think I can introduce Mizuiro Jidai better than what has introduced each episode throughout the whole series, the op “Mizuiro Jidai” by Jun Yoneya. The op begins with the gentle breeze and the passage of time conveying something, something important. This is much of how Yuuko has to understand the world, as no one will tell her what she wants to know. The messages that Yuuko needs, is one that she has to work out herself. “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong” is how she comes to recognize that there is something wrong with what she understands. Everyone is alone in this way, in their perceptions of reality. Still, Yuuko wants to “chase after the scattered clouds”. She wants fight the “loneliness” of the misunderstandings and regret. And so it goes, “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is the color of her time right now, clear and undefined.  
 
Its middle school environment is misleading of the sharpness of Yabuuchi’s direction, of the way to lead life. All the problems that result are entirely natural, and by no one’s ill will. Every single person wants to get along with everyone else. Misunderstandings occur, but communication is all they need. Thus we come to Yuuko. Yuuko doesn’t understand at first why everyone acts the way they do, nor why Hiroshi likes her. She’s a lost soul and all she can do is run, run as fast as she can. Upon realization of her friends’ feelings, what she can do is hear what everyone has to say. Then in silence come to term with why the things are the way they are. It is only with this understanding that she feels compelled to put herself out there. It is in Yabuuchi’s gentle treatment, that Yuuko finds the security and resolve to do what she believes she has to do, what her ideal reality looks like. Then with a smile each episode closes. What Yuuko comes to understand never becomes explicitly said, or rather Yabuuchi doesn’t see that as important compared to the feeling she wants to convey - of affirmation of what we are, the greatest guiding principle of all. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s main focus is on love, but its way to illustrate love’s nature is in feelings of acknowledgement. Hiroshi is there to accept everything Yuuko has to say, feel and worry about. What Yuuko tries to do, Hiroshi constantly encourages. Hiroshi has the right words to say because he believes in what Yuuko tries to do. This connection is one that is forged through time, a childhood friendship. However, things seem to change when Hiroshi declares her love for Yuuko. Love is not just a promise towards being a partner in life. To be connected through ups and downs means that there is something special in the constant of each other. Yuuko and Hiroshi can’t quite put into words what they represent to each other, but they are constantly comforted by it. So, they move forward in life facing all their struggles together in the hopes of discovering what that love is. This idea of love follows for Takako, Rumiko, Kugayama, Kitano, and Yuuko’s parents. Seeing how others come to love each other, Yuuko becomes prepared for the challenges she has to face in her love with Hiroshi. To the very end, when the love that became the source of strength for Yuuko wanes with distance and time, she goes forth accepting what comes her way and does what she can believing in the love that they had. This is Yabuuchi’s romance, one that is tied to trust. This is a romance in the trust to something eternal and to something real - each other. 
 
Love’s counterpart, friendship, is core to what drives the cast to be together, what drives Yuuko. What Yuuko constantly comes back to friendship for is companionship. Yuuko seeks people who are going through the same things she is. Other than what Hiroshi was, her best friend, Takako, is there with her every step of the way. Even if there are disagreements, Yuuko finds peace talking with Takako because they have the understanding of each other to be able to empathize. Communication to Yabuuchi is the ultimate clarifying source. Sharing the privacy of their worlds, Yuuko shares a diary with Takako. What each share to each other is their poetry, their thoughts, their feelings. Then in the silence of each other’s company, puts into words their moments of time. Of course, as with all things, communication can break down. Not because they did anything wrong to each other, but by the absence of what keeps them connected - reassurance. They would never dare to intentionally hurt each others feeling and yet, they do. Either by withholding words or by being incapable of expressing their view: ""Everyone seems so far away..."" Perhaps this is where all friendships lead, an inevitable disconnection. With each passing day and with each passing year, Yuuko has to question what all her relationships mean to her. Then, come to the conclusion that the only answer she can say about her yearning for friendship is that she wants it. Yuuko accepts the transient nature of friendship and finds that she wants it because she needs it - for the time.  In moments of doubt and apprehension, the lens that Yuuko finds the security of everything she understands is through friendship.  
 
Just as core as interpersonal relationships is recognition of what education is to oneself. Yuuko couldn’t learn in school, nor could she learn with the help of Hiroshi. There is one episode where Yuuko even stalks her friend Tomoko because she was disturbed by how enthusiastic Tomoko was about education. Viewing Tomoko as if she’s an alien, she did not understand where it was all coming from. Feeling ever so disconnected with what education meant to others, she eventually decided to go to cram school. There she met Kitano, a representation of a student who is working hard for her future. Yuuko wanted the kind of conviction Kitano had and felt compelled to see her as a real person. It’s in the smallest of conversations with Kitano that Yuuko was able to find peace in her worries about what education is to her. In the next episode, Yuuko started to actually learn about soccer! Exciting. It’s the small things!  
 
This is Yuuko’s story first and foremost. We hear her hesitations, her frustrations, and her agony. She makes mistakes trying to grasp her line of reasoning. She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi. The amount of growth Yuuko had perhaps can be best seen by a simple note she hands to Kugayama, her rival in love, after graduation: 
  
“Let’s talk about love sometime, okay?”  
 
It would be a mistake to talk about love and not mention about what sexual interactions are to Mizuiro Jidai. Ingrained into what a relationship of love is, it is essential to how a couple becomes attracted to one another. However, Yabuuchi draws the line with sex. Yuuko and Hiroshi do kiss to show their affection, but finds trepidation that sex may lead them to lose the meaning of what their love is. They have a fear that just like how their instinctual actions sometimes lead to hurting each other’s feeling, succumbing to their desires would be how they stop connecting with each other. Yabuuchi finds that love in Mizuiro Jidai has enough “weight” because it is as important as it matters to them. At first, Yuuko did see value in love as a way to express her feelings to Hiroshi. Later on though, Yuuko finds the value in love as a promise towards the future amidst the march of time. Mizuiro Jidai is a story focused on the perspective of love, and although an expansion on what sex is to them may have been warranted, it is okay. The primary concern to Yuuko and the cast is in what the meaning of their life is. Of course, they are middle schoolers, so it would be hard to take whatever they learn seriously. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s characters and by extension, Yabuuchi, understands how insignificant their realizations are in scope of the world. Anything they feel or start to comprehend can be easily diminished by the words, “common sense”. Kitano points out the meaninglessness of her love because it is just the first time a boy has been nice to her, as “ah that’s all there is to it”. In the same manner, Yuuko’s father nonchalantly mentions “ah romance can be useful, huh” concerning Yuuko’s vigor to studying more because of Hiroshi. However, Yuuko denies this thought of common sense from the very beginning. From the first episode when Takako wants to quit band in the same way she feels she has to abandon her crush on Hiroshi, Yuuko responds confidently to her dismay with “It’s important to you still!” Yuuko believes that her feelings, her struggles, and her thoughts are relevant because it is what she is going through. Yuuko does not want to give up as just an observer of her own life. Yuuko wants to take action for what she feels like she has to do and acknowledge her own feelings. For this reason, Yuuko could not bear Takako’s giving up. This message is what persuades Takako to move forward and what would eventually move all the cast to work for a greater cause, a treasured memory.  
 
The story of Mizuiro Jidai begins with reflection and ends with nostalgia - it is a memory in transition. What this story shares to us is the casts’ contemplations in life, moment to moment. However, being a memory, we can’t forget how Yabuuchi affects the lens upon which we view her story. She is guiding us towards what she believes. That being said, just as important as how the problems are shown, is how the answers from friends, family and teachers are being portrayed. In one episode Yuuko was worried about her love with Hiroshi because she did not understand how the passage of time was affecting their relationship and how the future would affect it. What became Yuuko’s biggest ray of hope is when Yuuko’s mother shared how she married Yuuko’s father. No one else could answer how time affects love better than someone who has gone through it. Yuuko’s mother was always there with a smile, ready and doing whatever she can to help Yuuko with her worries. Yet, Yuuko could not ask of her mother for anything. Thus, in the silence and the faded background Yuuko’s mother waits. Indirectly and by guessing, she can only do what she can to help. It was only until this point that Yuuko was willing to open up her mother and become able to tell her any advice. This way of communication is much of how everyone has to tip toe around Yuuko. Whether by being strict like her father and her teachers, or by teasing like her sister did, it’s their way of starting communication. It’s only when Yuuko is ready to ask for their help that they can tell her what she needs. As Yuuko becomes more confident in what she believes, she comes to recognize all the little ways people tried to help her along the way. It’s in this that she becomes able to thank people. During graduation, the entire class even throws a surprise party for their strict teacher thanking him for the time spent together. It wouldn’t be so far as to say that Mizuiro Jidai, as a whole, is a celebration for the people that have helped kids like Yuuko. 
 
Everything is not perfect in Mizuiro Jidai nor does it want the viewer to see its messages as definitive. The responses that Yuuko gets from the people around her often avoid the question or can be insensitive. The world around her is as clouded in meaning as she is. There is no “right” answer. The intentional removal of what the “message” is can even lead the viewer confused about the whole point of the ordeal Yuuko has to go through. Hiroshi has an answer to what to do. Hiroshi, in memory of all the bad things that happened in their first year, passionately responds that he would never do the same things the second years did. Hiroshi doesn’t believe in this tradition, in this cycle of life. He can be better than that. Hiroshi  sees the ""tradition"" for what it is, and wants something more real, more fulfilling. Admittedly, Hiroshi will still point out how cheesy it. Not because he doesn't believe it, but because it always seems out of place. The desire for acknowledgment comes into question as their memories, their dreams , and their visions often doesn't reflect reality. The search seems futile when one can just take the world in for what it is. They look to be reaching our for nothing. Thus, on unsteady ground, they move on trying to understand what the ground even is. Yabuuchi wants the viewer to take that lesson just as Yuuko would, and work out the foundations that makes us people. Then, make the best of it. Perhaps that is all I can say about Mizuiro Jidai. 
 
Much of this review is in admiration of what Mizuiro Jidai has accomplished, but it is just as much what I have come to understand of the world around me. What Yabuuchi has to say  reaches the same conclusions I had about the world. It's not life changing nor particularly powerful. It's normal. Mizuiro Jidai is simply a tale of what everyone has to go through. Being normal isn't particularly... special, but  this has all the aspects I have ever wanted from a narrative. The subjects of love and friendship is all too delicate that I am amazed at how Mizuiro Jidai goes the step further to exploring what they mean. Then in the transit of time, explain how we have to deal with the intermingling of concepts. Maybe what surprised me the most was the gentle presentation of it all. Mizuiro Jidai views through Yuuko her process of understanding of the world while maintaining the dignity of everything involved. All the while, maintaining the breadth and acceptation of what makes us people... It makes me nostalgic, too. Sure, I can remember my own anguish growing up. It wasn't fun. I sometimes cringe when I look at my own past, my own stupidity at that time. Then, I come back to Yuuko and smile. Its a strange thing to say as a guy, but I connect with Yuuko. Just as Yuuko did and just as Yabuuchi tried to show in her story, I should try to value my own journey, too. My memories, my experiences, my feelings it was all worthwhile. Seeing a message communicated so humanly is perhaps what we all need for the elusive goal of assuring ourselves. How important these messages are up to interpretation, but it must be lauded how deftly Yabuuchi intertwines these themes into a coherent story that is nothing short of real.  
 
Real to me - to my life. To what I need now. 
 
 
Some things to think about: 
 
Please consider hearing the next episode previews at the end of each episode! It is written like what their diary entries are like.  
 
Thinking about the names is nice though I must confess I am still learning Japanese, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, a character does tease Yuuko for being kawaii just like her name suggests. 
 
The opening to Mizuiro Jidai has an English translation that is misleading, and is why I wrote about the opening in this review. Currently there is only one English translation around for this show, so this is kind of important.  
 
“I’m conveying something important” should be “It’s conveying something important."" Its referring to the things mentioned before.  
 
“Somehow, there are words for days that pass each other by” should be something like “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong”. Surechigau! Surechigau! 
 
Everything in the sub is okay. The translation group probably took the same opening that the previous one did and left those blatant mistakes. 
 
I don't find it as important to talk about the animation or the sound considering this is 2 decades old. It works and shows everything that it needs with the feelings of the characters. The transitions are well paced and flows gently because of the clear foundation Yabuuchi set in her manga. It won't try anything tricky. 
 
At episode 38 we lead to the end of Mizuiro Jidai. Yuuko’s reuniting with Hiroshi is extremely drawn out. It was actually just two shots Hiroshi and Yuuko together in the manga. Well I forgive it because it was well deserved, but yeah.  
 
Ep 39 is a summary 
 
Episodes 40 to 47 are from Shin Mizuiro Jidai, which I think Yabuuchi kind of did in a bit of a rush… Yeah it isn’t so good. Mizuiro Jidai was a popular manga and when the anime series released she probably did it out of obligation. You can see that the release of Shin Mizuiro Jidai coincides with the anime runtime. The tight narrative isn’t quite there. 


          
 
       Helpful This is one of the best school romances ever made. Everything is just so real and the characters feel like real people and are all likeable, it's just a heart warming story about the troubles of teen times and how to overcome them. 
 
A must watch. Btw the people on this site are way too negative. Most of them just hate it for looking old. Which is retarded. Not to mention old anime actually makes characters looks like real people and not fucking squeaky moe dolls with big tits. This is one of the best

This is Yuuko’s story first and foremost. We hear her hesitations, her frustrations, and her agony. She makes mistakes trying to grasp her line of reasoning. She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi. The amount of growth Yuuko had perhaps can be best seen by a simple note she hands to Kugayama, her rival in love, after graduation: 
 
“Let’s talk about love sometime, okay?”  
 
It would be a mistake to talk about love and not mention about what sexual interactions are to Mizuiro Jidai. Ingrained into what a relationship of love is, it is essential to how a couple becomes attracted to one another. However, Yabuuchi draws the line with sex. Yuuko and Hiroshi do kiss to show their affection, but finds trepidation that sex may lead them to lose the meaning of what their love is. They have a fear that just like how their instinctual actions sometimes lead to hurting each other’s feeling, succumbing to their desires would be how they stop connecting with each other. Yabuuchi finds that love in Mizuiro Jidai has enough “weight” because it is as important as it matters to them. At first, Yuuko did see value in love as a way to express her feelings to Hiroshi. Later on though, Yuuko finds the value in love as a promise towards the future amidst the march of time. Mizuiro Jidai is a story focused on the perspective of love, and although an expansion on what sex is to them may have been warranted, it is okay. The primary concern to Yuuko and the cast is in what the meaning of their life is. Of course, they are middle schoolers, so it would be hard to take whatever they learn seriously. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s characters and by extension, Yabuuchi, understands how insignificant their realizations are in scope of the world. Anything they feel or start to comprehend can be easily diminished by the words, “common sense”. Kitano points out the meaninglessness of her love because it is just the first time a boy has been nice to her, as “ah that’s all there is to it”. In the same manner, Yuuko’s father nonchalantly mentions “ah romance can be useful, huh” concerning Yuuko’s vigor to studying more because of Hiroshi. However, Yuuko denies this thought of common sense from the very beginning. From the first episode when Takako wants to quit band in the same way she feels she has to abandon her crush on Hiroshi, Yuuko responds confidently to her dismay with “It’s important to you still!” Yuuko believes that her feelings, her struggles, and her thoughts are relevant because it is what she is going through. Yuuko does not want to give up as just an observer of her own life. Yuuko wants to take action for what she feels like she has to do and acknowledge her own feelings. For this reason, Yuuko could not bear Takako’s giving up. This message is what persuades Takako to move forward and what would eventually move all the cast to work for a greater cause, a treasured memory.  
 
The story of Mizuiro Jidai begins with reflection and ends with nostalgia - it is a memory in transition. What this story shares to us is the casts’ contemplations in life, moment to moment. However, being a memory, we can’t forget how Yabuuchi affects the lens upon which we view her story. She is guiding us towards what she believes. That being said, just as important as how the problems are shown, is how the answers from friends, family and teachers are being portrayed. In one episode Yuuko was worried about her love with Hiroshi because she did not understand how the passage of time was affecting their relationship and how the future would affect it. What became Yuuko’s biggest ray of hope is when Yuuko’s mother shared how she married Yuuko’s father. No one else could answer how time affects love better than someone who has gone through it. Yuuko’s mother was always there with a smile, ready and doing whatever she can to help Yuuko with her worries. Yet, Yuuko could not ask of her mother for anything. Thus, in the silence and the faded background Yuuko’s mother waits. Indirectly and by guessing, she can only do what she can to help. It was only until this point that Yuuko was willing to open up her mother and become able to tell her any advice. This way of communication is much of how everyone has to tip toe around Yuuko. Whether by being strict like her father and her teachers, or by teasing like her sister did, it’s their way of starting communication. It’s only when Yuuko is ready to ask for their help that they can tell her what she needs. As Yuuko becomes more confident in what she believes, she comes to recognize all the little ways people tried to help her along the way. It’s in this that she becomes able to thank people. During graduation, the entire class even throws a surprise party for their strict teacher thanking him for the time spent together. It wouldn’t be so far as to say that Mizuiro Jidai, as a whole, is a celebration for the people that have helped kids like Yuuko. 
 
Everything is not perfect in Mizuiro Jidai nor does it want the viewer to see its messages as definitive. The responses that Yuuko gets from the people around her often avoid the question or can be insensitive. The world around her is as clouded in meaning as she is. There is no “right” answer. The intentional removal of what the “message” is can even lead the viewer confused about the whole point of the ordeal Yuuko has to go through. Hiroshi has an answer to what to do. Hiroshi, in memory of all the bad things that happened in their first year, passionately responds that he would never do the same things the second years did. Hiroshi doesn’t believe in this tradition, in this cycle of life. He can be better than that. Hiroshi sees the ""tradition"" for what it is, and wants something more real, more fulfilling. Admittedly, Hiroshi will still point out how cheesy it. Not because he doesn't believe it, but because it always seems out of place. The desire for acknowledgment comes into question as their memories, their dreams , and their visions often doesn't reflect reality. The search seems futile when one can just take the world in for what it is. They look to be reaching our for nothing. Thus, on unsteady ground, they move on trying to understand what the ground even is. Yabuuchi wants the viewer to take that lesson just as Yuuko would, and work out the foundations that makes us people. Then, make the best of it. Perhaps that is all I can say about Mizuiro Jidai. 
 
Much of this review is in admiration of what Mizuiro Jidai has accomplished, but it is just as much what I have come to understand of the world around me. What Yabuuchi has to say reaches the same conclusions I had about the world. It's not life changing nor particularly powerful. It's normal. Mizuiro Jidai is simply a tale of what everyone has to go through. Being normal isn't particularly... special, but this has all the aspects I have ever wanted from a narrative. The subjects of love and friendship is all too delicate that I am amazed at how Mizuiro Jidai goes the step further to exploring what they mean. Then in the transit of time, explain how we have to deal with the intermingling of concepts. Maybe what surprised me the most was the gentle presentation of it all. Mizuiro Jidai views through Yuuko her process of understanding of the world while maintaining the dignity of everything involved. All the while, maintaining the breadth and acceptation of what makes us people... It makes me nostalgic, too. Sure, I can remember my own anguish growing up. It wasn't fun. I sometimes cringe when I look at my own past, my own stupidity at that time. Then, I come back to Yuuko and smile. Its a strange thing to say as a guy, but I connect with Yuuko. Just as Yuuko did and just as Yabuuchi tried to show in her story, I should try to value my own journey, too. My memories, my experiences, my feelings it was all worthwhile. Seeing a message communicated so humanly is perhaps what we all need for the elusive goal of assuring ourselves. How important these messages are up to interpretation, but it must be lauded how deftly Yabuuchi intertwines these themes into a coherent story that is nothing short of real.  
 
Real to me - to my life. To what I need now. 
 
 
Some things to think about: 
 
Please consider hearing the next episode previews at the end of each episode! It is written like what their diary entries are like.  
 
Thinking about the names is nice though I must confess I am still learning Japanese, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, a character does tease Yuuko for being kawaii just like her name suggests. 
 
The opening to Mizuiro Jidai has an English translation that is misleading, and is why I wrote about the opening in this review. Currently there is only one English translation around for this show, so this is kind of important.  
 
“I’m conveying something important” should be “It’s conveying something important."" Its referring to the things mentioned before.  
 
“Somehow, there are words for days that pass each other by” should be something like “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong”. Surechigau! Surechigau! 
 
Everything in the sub is okay. The translation group probably took the same opening that the previous one did and left those blatant mistakes. 
 
I don't find it as important to talk about the animation or the sound considering this is 2 decades old. It works and shows everything that it needs with the feelings of the characters. The transitions are well paced and flows gently because of the clear foundation Yabuuchi set in her manga. It won't try anything tricky. 
 
At episode 38 we lead to the end of Mizuiro Jidai. Yuuko’s reuniting with Hiroshi is extremely drawn out. It was actually just two shots Hiroshi and Yuuko together in the manga. Well I forgive it because it was well deserved, but yeah.  
 
Ep 39 is a summary 
 
Episodes 40 to 47 are from Shin Mizuiro Jidai, which I think Yabuuchi kind of did in a bit of a rush… Yeah it isn’t so good. Mizuiro Jidai was a popular manga and when the anime series released she probably did it out of obligation. You can see that the release of Shin Mizuiro Jidai coincides with the anime runtime. The tight narrative isn’t quite there. 
 
This is one of the best school romances ever made. Everything is just so real and the characters feel like real people and are all likeable, it's just a heart warming story about the troubles of teen times and how to overcome them. 
 
A must watch. Btw the people on this site are way too negative. Most of them just hate it for looking old. Which is retarded. Not to mention old anime actually makes characters looks like real people and not fucking squeaky moe dolls with big tits. This is one of the best

          
 
       Helpful This is my first anime review here on MyAnimeList, so here goes! 
 
Mizuiro Jidai is such a pure and heartwarming coming of age anime. The story focuses on our protagonist Kawai Yuuko who is a friendly yet sometimes clumsy girl figuring out who she is as she lives out her last year of middle school. Throughout the series, we see how she forms relationships with her best friends and childhood friend who soon becomes her love interest. The art is very 90's and the soundtrack is soft and soothing, fitting for the series. 
 
The show tackles topics that I believe stay relevant even after the 'Aqua Age' of adolescence. There's an episode where Yuuko gets stuck in the middle of a fight between two of her friends Takako and Miyuki, and the audience watches Yuuko struggle to please both of them. In another episode, Yuuko gets her period and you see her friends being supportive and helpful. Plus, her childhood friend Hiroshi even chimes in with uplifting words at the end of the episode. One of my favorite episodes was actually one where everyone in the friend group started fighting with each other. It felt so real and reminded me of the times I too felt frustrated with my friends 
 
This is a great anime to watch if you want something simple and nostalgic. Watching Mizuiro Jidai made me miss the days of being just a student surrounded by friends daily, slowly taking steps towards adulthood. I actually started watching this series back in middle school but the subs at the time stopped somewhere around ep ~20 which devastated me. I forgot about the anime but later discovered all the episodes on YouTube 10 years later (even though now I am proficient enough to not need subs anymore haha)! Life works in mysterious ways~ 
 
I hope my review helps. I really enjoyed this series and I hope others will feel the same way too.

13,34914,24,8.872885099060591,story with the main character transported to another world,New Game!!,"​It has been a year since Aoba Suzukaze started working at the Eagle Jump game company. In that time, she and her eccentric coworkers in the character design department have worked hard to release the company's newest game: Fairies Story 3. With their latest title now complete, a new project must begin—starting with a contest to decide the character designs for the upcoming game. Through hard work, dedication, and some guidance from the previous character designer, Kou Yagami, Aoba wins the contest and begins her new role as lead character designer. 
 
However, her new job is not an easy one. In addition to having extra work and longer hours, Aoba questions whether she is the right fit for the job.  New Game!!  continues as Aoba overcomes her inexperience with the help of her friends and coworkers, willing to face any challenge to make Eagle Jump's newest creation, a cutesy game called Peco. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Having been inspired by the character designs of a particular video game when she was younger, Aoba Suzukaze, a high school graduate, begins working as a character designer for the video game's developer, Eagle Jump. As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game is back better than ever with this second season, which in my opinion was a solid improvement of the first. 
 
One of the strongest points of this sequel is that it found the right balance between the cute and funny parts, and the more serious, work related moments. In the end, New Game is about these lovable girls working hard to achieve their dreams in the videogame industry, all while becoming closer to the others and having fantastic experiences, and the viewers can definitely see both things, sharing their feelings and cheering for their success. 
 
Talking about the characters, god, I love everyone! New Game balances well their screen time, which mixed with how likeable they are it's no surprise one ends up attached to them. This sequel also introduces two new girls to the cast in the form of Momiji and Narumi, two close friends who add new dynamics to the cast and form interesting duos when paired with Aoba and Nene respectively. 
 
Doga Kobo delivers as usual in the artistic part, with colorful and visually pleasing art and solid animation. In the music department, the background themes keep properly helping to establish the mood of the scenes without particularly standing out, same can't be said about the fantastic opening and ending themes, which were unskippable to me. If I have to be honest, I never expected the new opening to surpass Sakura Skip from S1, which is an opening I absolutely adore and will most likely never leave my playlist, but STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑ still did a fantastic job as a mood maker and made me excited to watch the episode. This sequel also featured two ending themes, which are pretty much tied up as my favorites of the season. 
 
Overall this sequel of New Game was a step forward for the series and a joy to watch from start to end. I really recommend to watch it if you liked the first season, and if you read this review wondering if this anime is worth it, sure, give it a try!

          
 
       Helpful I love the first season, now I love the second season. 
This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched. 
 
It's a harmony about girls in a company working hard to develop ""NEW GAME"", one season with a new game basically, on perspectives of arts and coding. How everyone in the same group or different group works hard and takes care of each other. 
I feel happy for them when everyone gets what she deserves from her work. 
 
It is perfect if you are looking for something simple but will make you happy all day long. 


          
 
       Helpful New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season. 
 
While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season. 
 
The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard. This anime had and will always have a special place in my heart. 
 
Overall, for all the people who love to know more about producing and developing a game, I highly recommend this anime. It has a really nice, cute story and a good sense of humor. 
 
Overall rate: 9/10

","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere. 
 
The rest isn´t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don´t want to concentrate or if you´re a Moe fan anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. 
 
A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.

This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.
","Ah, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is truly one of the classics of Chinese literature. It is an amazing story of war, bloodshed and honor. However, Souten Kouro seems to take this classic and make it much more uninteresting than it truly is. It stars Cao Cao, often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant, as the hero of the story. After watching the first 11 episodes of the series, I truly know what the Chinese idiom ""speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes,"" truly means. 
 
MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS 
 
Story: The story begins with Cao Cao's early life. The story itself generally follows the time-line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but takes on a different tactic of telling the story. An example I would like to use would be the Alliance against Dong Zhou. The anime follows history precisely but throws on a handful of encounters that aren't 100% historical. It is true that Cao Cao refuses to become Dong Zhou's right hand man, but in no way does history point out that he does it in such an articulate way. The story makes Cao Cao reign supreme, while throwing Lui Bei in the background as the ""villain"" of the Three Kingdoms period. 
 
Art: The artwork was very unimpressive. It was more like the manga was reproduced EXACTLY how it looks. They did not any special animation to the anime. When armies were slain, you'd only see blood splurting out of them, and no indication of how they were even cut. Surely production value could not have been so low for a manga that won the 22nd (22nd award every given to a manga, not 22nd place) Kodansha Manga Award in the general category? 
 
Sound: Beautiful is the only word I can think of to describe the sound of the anime. The music was incredible and fit each situation to the fullest. Mind you, the OP and ED are not amazing, but the soundtrack during the fights, and during every scene were astounding. The music is memorable and that to me, is what really saved this anime. 
 
Character: The characters were not very developed in the anime but what can you expect? It is based more on the history of the Three Kingdoms period than it is on Romance of Three Kingdoms. I will however give an honorable mention to Cao Cao's character portrayal. Throughout the anime, you can feel his character slipping slowly into the tyrannical warmonger we all know and love. 
 
Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime to a certain extent and I would have given it a 7 over the 5 because of it but the story itself progressed in a way that was a little boring. Mind you, if you love Chinese politics and the era of the Three Kingdoms in general, you'll want to watch this anime despite any review you see. However, it was not my cup of tea, and I lost interest very quickly.

          
 
       Helpful Story:  
 
Based off Luo Guanzhong's 14th century Romance of the 3 kingdom novel, which is considered one of the 'Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature', it's one of the most well known and most adapted stories in China. 
 
If you've seen John Woo's Red Cliff, played Dynasty Warriors, or any of Koei's ROTK games and enjoyed them, i'm sure you'll be familiar with the character names in the description, but just in case you missed it, well, now you know. This is ROTK, and you will most likely also be interested in this. Not much more else to say really, it's one of the most well loved and known stories of all time. I'm not too sure how far they will go with the story, but i really don't think they will do the whole thing in 26 episodes, seeing as i'm 9 episodes in and it's not even a quarter of the story told, and it is already moving quite fast. Time will tell i guess. 
 
Art: 
 
Overall high quality and unique style. I was kind of put off the first few episodes and i thought it didn't look realistic enough for such a historical title, but i got used to it soon enough and now i think that it lends itself quite well and fits the tone of the series, considering that some of the battles and scenes are especially over done to be epic and grand.  
 
As of episode 9, fight scenes have been relatively realistic, especially when showing epic war battles with thousands of soldiers. Formations, tactics, strategies from Sun Tzu's Art Of War are all discussed and shown. Catapults, castle sieges, are all done well, with no ridiculous super powered individuals like in Sengoku Basara. If that's what you are looking for mainly, i suggest you go somewhere else. One major gripe i have is with the way they depicted Liu Bei, but i might be biased since i already have a pre-conception of how i think he should look. Also, one character in episode 9(where i'm up to) has shown signs of static electricity circling his body when he made an entrance, and i hope that that is the most 'shounen' it's going to get. I don't mind that so much because that character is meant to be powerful, and i guess that it's just artistic license since no one else so far is like that, but if it does change into a shounen wankfest, i will update this review to reflect it. Also, on the MAL page, it says R rated - Mild Nudity, but be warned. There is also quite graphic violence and plenty of blood flowing, as is to be expected. 
 
Sound: 
 
OP: Screamo rock/metal, which i think is ok even if that is not my cup of tea, it suits the animation well. 
ED: Some feel good pop song played over floating clouds, otherwise nothing memorable. 
VA is fine, and music/score suits the battles and tense moments well. 
 
Character: Based on real life figures, they are all heroes and based on larger than life figures. In fact, one of them is actually defied and worshipped as a god/deity in Chinese folk 'religion'(the main 'religion'), even in this day and age. Every chinese person would know this character. However, as of episode 9, it seems to focus more on one character, while it neglects the other two(or at least, for the moment). Also, i do not like how they portrayed Liu Bei, so purists be warned. Otherwise there is a huge diverse range of characters who all contribute in some important way or other to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: What else can i say? If you can't tell by now, i'm a ROTK fan, and i'm also a historical swordfighting/samurai buff, and i also love fantasy. This combines them all into one neat package. 
 
Overall: I would like to give it a 10 based on enjoyment alone, but i do have some minor gripes with it, and that is that it moves quite fast and is kind of hard to understand the story even knowing the story prior to watching since they gloss over some relatively important characters, and that the first few episodes were kind of slow, which might put some viewers off and make them not want to give this awesome series a chance. I think it really starts to pick up after episode 5/6 after it has done the basic character development, it moves into fast pace action epic mode.. If you enjoyed Legend of Galactic heroes like someone said in the recommendations, you would probably also enjoy this. This has more fights and is more violent, but both use quite a bit of narration and voiceover to keep you up to date with the current happenings, which is quite understandable to tell a story of this magnitude in just 26 measly episodes compared to 100+ for LOGH. 
 
Considering how cliche and unoriginal Sengoku Basara is, i'm really disappointed that not more people are following this anime, and that is has such a low rating. I guess it's the same way for LOGH however, which is a damn shame since this is one of the best series currently running. 


          
 
       Helpful Most adaptations of the Romance of Three Kingdoms portray Cao Cao as a power-hungry villain. Souten Kouro is a little different -- he is the hero in this version, and it makes for an interesting take on this ancient tale. The animation is really, really cheap at times but if you're willing to look past that, it's a great show. 
 
The other thing that makes this show interesting is that it talks about a few things that most ROTK adaptations skip over or condense -- namely, Cao Cao's childhood, the fall of the Ten Attendants and the Yellow Turban Rebellion. 
 
I wouldn't recommend this show as an entry point into ROTK because it is very different from a typical adaptation of the novel -- see John Woo's live-action film Red Cliff and if you like that, give this show a shot.

Sunred, ally of justice, is dedicated to stopping the evil organization Florsheim on their quest for world domination, while General Vamp and his minions are constantly thinking up new schemes to defeat Sunred. In what sounds like a typical story, the characters make all the difference.  
 
Our hero Sunred is rude, violent, and lazy, playing pachinko all day and leeching off of his girlfriend Kayoko Uchida. Meanwhile General Vamp is polite, conscientious, and an ideal homemaker who cooks, mothers his minions, and discusses housekeeping with Kayoko, who bickers constantly with Sunred. Even the monsters of Florsheim tend to be adorable and harmless. 
 
Each episode is comprised of several shorts weighing in at anywhere from a few minutes to a few seconds, and explores the daily lives of these sworn enemies. This is the story of the battle between good and evil that takes place in Kawasaki. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Super Power', 'Seinen']","Astro Fighter Sunred is a parody of the Sentai superhero genre, most notably of the Super Sentai series.
The story revolves around the Tama River area, based mostly in Kawasaki City Kanagawa where battles are fought between the evil organisation Florsheim and the ally of justice Sunred. The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as simply 'Red') is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.
Despite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.
Each episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.
","I usually decide whether or not I will watch a series based on its art work. Whatever it was that made me try this series out, I'm very, very glad of it. It brought to me many minutes of hard laughter, and occasionally melt my heart. 
 
Theres not much a story, since it is episodic. However there is plenty of merit in the anime's setting, character development and their interactions. 
 
The art and animation is, at first glance very low quality, but this is to match the randomness and hilarity of the series. And it accomplishes this very well. It actually became cute and nostalgic for me. The sound was great in a similar sort of way. The voice actors are very good with their characters, and the opening and ending themes are well worth watching/reading the lyrics. (theres 2 slightly different ones for the opening) 
 
In addition to a mini-cooking show and some other highly random scenes, the series is about the 'conflict' of 'good' and 'evil' in a Japanese town. Every other episode there is a belly-crushingly hilarious scene. Certain jokes (very few) are somewhat cultural sensitive, however, and many western audiences may miss them.  
 
I found just about all of the characters hirlarious, and they all represented a different type of person (or the same person, if you will in different stages of life). Unwittingly, you may just find yourself sympathizing with them.  
 
I found the ending to be very satisfying- just what 250 minutes of hilarious but effective character development needed. But some may say that it sacrificed too much humour in the process. 
 
Be warned that the humour of this series is the very dumb type. If you know you dont enjoy those, this might not be the show for you. But i'd still give it a shot, since the episodes are quite short (13min/ea including op/ed).  
 
I'm very glad there is a second season to give me the opportunity to revisit these characters. Its been one of the most enjoyable shows- Something is always happening. And if you don't get a joke, worry not! theres another one due in about 3 seconds.  
 
Theres not much of a story to keep you thinking or intrigued. But if you want a good time? Definitely watch this series. 

          
 
       Helpful Astro Fighter Sunred got thrown around a lot around the time One Punch Man came out as a comedy show about overpowered superhero that has more than one joke. It's a gross comparison cause whoever said this lacked understanding of both OPM and Sunred if they thought the two are alike because the similarities are superficial. But this is not a comparison, just wanted a disclaumer if anyone came here from a similar recommendation. The two are different shows and whoever still thinks one is the other done right doesn't know what they're talking about. 
 
Sunred is a short comedy show about a slob of a hero who has to keep on fighting villains who can't stand up to him and the villains have to endure the beating over and over in their hopes of successfully dominating the world. At least that's the core of it, there's always a segment or two revolving around Sunred but for the most part you'll be seeing daily lives of kaiju that try to defeat him instead. There's about 5 or 6 different segments I can think of right now, each focusing on different kinds of humor. The normal Sunred and Vamp segments focus on just about anything  concerns them, be it woes of slob superhero's wife or monsters going on vacation, usually a lot of the comedy in this segment and in animal soldiers segment where cute little plush monsters try to kill Sunred come from juxtaposing either terrifying monsters with completely mundane problems or cute looking bunnies and cats with murderous intentions. One of my favorite segments was Godom and Sodorrah that's just a few seconds long segment where Godom pesters Sodorrah with thoughts almost on the level of Karl Pilkington's ""Drugs being tested on animals. That sort of thing, well, it depends, doesn't it? If the drug's aspirin and the monkey's got a headache, is it tight?"". 
 
The art and animation were a pretty nice part of this show, it goes for a very stylized comic look with thick lines and solid shading  and occasionally textures laid over background. It looks very nice and stays solid throughout the show, it's rare to see something this consistent throughout the run and they don't exactly skip out on animation at any point, there are some cut aways from action but they're mostly comedic so it works just fine. 
 
Overall I think the technical side of the show is pretty rock solid but how enjoyable it is will change depending on what you find funny as comedy is entirely subjective. Personally if a comedy show regularly makes me laugh it's good enough in my book.

          
 
       Helpful This is definitely a great super hero anime parody!!! Astro Fighter Sunred is supposedly the magnificent story of the conflict between good & evil that takes place in the city of Kawasaki, however the true story is more about slice of life with super heroes & villains. 
 
Being a parody of super sentai (power rangers) much of the show focuses a role reversal specifically the main hero & villain Sunred & General Vamp. Sunred whose is suppose to be the hero of this show is a jerk who doesn't take his job that seriously as he isn't in full costume, spends his time playing pachinko & enjoys beating the crap out of villains. General Vamp who is a member of an evil organization named Florsheim, is the most kind-hearted villain you'll ever meet. (Vamp is often compared to a housewife than a super villain) 
 
Most of the humor is found through its dialogue &  its satire towards the superhero genre however the anime's comedy can vary per episode but usually remains consistently funny. This is due the anime having several small segments such as animal soldiers, some quick shorts lasting a few seconds, skits featuring other side characters & even Vamp's own cooking segment.  
 
Another fun gag that the anime pokes fun at itself with its opening & ending themes as the lyrics are anything but serious, especially when the ending theme is just a cooking recipe being sung in a very soothing way. Another example is the opening animation trolls its audience displaying a typical super sentai opening while doesn't deliver what you see. There aren't any real flaws to this series but people should be aware that the animation is intentionally choppy which adds to the humor of the show. Furthermore, most characters & monsters don't have lipflaps often resorting to them moving their heads which I hope this won't be a problem for most viewers.  
 
Tentai Senshi Sunred has a total of 2 seasons equaling 52 13 minute episodes. The only personal flaw I have with the series is the lack of more episodes as the anime concluded in 2010. I'd say give the series 13 episodes before you think of dropping it. While the series is mostly comedy heavy it does give this ""fuzzy feeling"" as the villains of the show are so likeable that they behave more like a family rather than a evil organization.

Hatsukoi limited I don't have a damn idea why I loved it so much ... The story is so educative I think, in fact it shows the different love problems the teenagers are having between hesitatation and temptation, the story is told in many diffrent scenarios and each time it focus on one character only. 
 
I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes) 
 
I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(. 


          
 
       Helpful ""Are you in love right now?"" 
 
Well with this anime..it's more divisive than ""in love"" actually... 
 
Hatsukoi Limited follows several unrequited relationships and each of the earlier episodes focuses on one set of relationships while developing the ones from the previous episode in tandem, which makes one elaborate love dodecahedron. 
 
Well since this is a relationship-based romance naime, LA needs to start off with the characters themselves and their relationships. Let's start with Ayumi Arihara voiced by Mariya Ise, one of the genki ditz of her girl group who has a crush on Mamoru Zaitsu voiced by Miyu Irino but his older brother Misao voiced by Kenji Nomura also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality. Next we have Rika Dobashi voiced by Minako Kotobuki a calm yet athletic member of the girl group who has a nice romance with Haruto Terai voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in which they have this superiority inferiority complex towards each other. Next is Nao Chikura voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, one of the more shy member of the girl group and Hiroyuki Sogabe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai had a crush on her BUT she also has a fleeting romance with one of her former art club seniors by the form of Yukito Renjou voiced by Akira Ishida. Next (YES, there's still more!) is Misaki Yamamoto voiced by Rie Tanaka and Mamoru Zaitsu has a crush on her BUT Misaki likes Ayumi's older brother Yuuji voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino (in which HE has a sister complex and doesn't really have feelings for Misaki), next is Meguru Watase voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in which she and Gengorou Takei voiced by Kazuya Nakai DO have feelings for each other ALONG with their love of swimming but Meguru has other worries but that a bit later. Second to last is Koyoi Bessho voiced by Aki Toyosaki who has a brother complex to her older brother Yoshihiko Bessho voiced by Satoshi Hino in which he has feelings for Misaki and FINALLY we have Kei Enomoto voiced by Shizuka Ito, the alpha *ahem* bitch of the girl group in which she has a violent tsundere relationship with Etsu Kusuda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma the local pervert of the series and friends of Sogabe and Mamoru and later on Enomoto gets a rival in the form of Sumire Fudounomiya voiced by Ayako Kawasumi. Did you get all that??? 
 
Ok in all honesty, the relationships ranges across the board and even the ""great relationships"" has skewed priorities to the ""horribly awful relationships"" have a silver lining. In terms of favourites and worst romances in the anime itself, LA thought that Chikura's and Dobashi's were some of the best one-shot romances with hardly a gleam of skewed priorities to them. Misaki's, Meguru's and Ayumi's were ok relationships with a few problems to them (Misaki's due to the fallout results concerning Mamoru, Meguru's for skewed priorities such as -sigh- her big boobs and Ayumi's for not being developed enough not just to Mamoru but to Misao as well and it's NEVER resolved...completely). LA would place Koyoi's relationship to be of comedic relief in a ways and NOT meant to be taken seriously, even if it's incest and you know LA rule with incest in anime (as long as it's their completely serious about it's subject matter of incest or it plays it up for the sake of comedy with no seriousness and dignity towards it's characters and Koyoi's is essentially this) thus Koyoi's only focus episode is a bit grating but it's only for the sake of comedy. -sigh- here we go...LA REALLY didn't like Enomoto and Kusuda's relationship, Enomoto for always having her belief that they need to be handsome and rich in order to even START dating her (see what LA means by alpha bitch?) AS well as Enomoto's CONSTANT tsun and violent verbal and sometimes physical abuse to Kusuda just because he's being perverted and eyeing someone else, Kusuda is no better as he's one of the main source of pervertedness in the anime besides the stray panty shots. Relationship-wise it's one of the most destructive relationship in the anime and by the end of it even with Enomoto and Kusuda's realization LA still hated the both of them by the end of it. 
 
Well here's also the thing, be it relationships that has no flaws and it's the perfect romance or one of the most destructive ones and LA didn't like them one bit, the perfect romance will have quips of completely idealistic to the destructive romances to be too harsh or unbelievably pessimistic and because of that LA chose Ayumi as LA's favourite she's in the middle of having flaws in her relationships but she's also idealistic in a ways. 
 
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the character designs were pretty to typical designs for the vast amount of characters in this anime and sometimes LA mistook characters for other similar looking characters (see Yoshihiko and Mamoru...no seriously...one time LA ACTUALLY thought this at one point), the backgrounding is typical but nothing to gawk at either. Finally the comedic moments does use the chibi visuals (both facial expressions and their entire body at times...Koyoi and Ayumi being the main culprit what with both of them being the comedic reliefs). The animation overall is decent with some level to detail on it's character designs but not much beyond that. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well this voice cast is JUST amazing, from Mariya Ise to Ayako Kawasumi and even Sayuri Yahagi!. Yes, LA did have a HUGE problem with Shizuka Ito's character but it is her CHARACTER LA didn't like, her vocals were still suited to Enomoto nonetheless. LA's favourite voice actor would go to Mariya Ise along with Ryoko Shiraishi. Nonetheless fantastic vocal line up!. 
 
Hatsukoi Limited for LA's experience in watching this anime ultimately depends on how you view the characters and their relationships in which they entail, you might hate some of the characters or you might love them and their relationships for the one true pairing or you see both the good or the bad towards one of the relationship. LA overall felt VERY divisive about this anime due to this but ALSO thought it had shades of wasted potential towards some of the relationships it had going for it.

          
 
       Helpful Usually I am not a huge fan of 12 or less episode series, but this was among one of the few that I really enjoyed. Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there. 
 
As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females, and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two. 
 
After the first few episodes I wasn't really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series.  
 
I'd suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure.

The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it

       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

It could have turned out into something memorable or something forgettable, unfortunately it was for the later case. The animation was not the best, could easily been made in '85 without any effort, but there were some major flaws in this title that went beyond the animation field and that pushed it to the land of obscurity. The story had major holes that could have been easily fixed if it had a proper care. Questions like, ""Why did they do this?"" ""Why did they do that"" in certain scenes keeps popping out, "" why did they show this here?"", etc... 
The story wraps in a bad way and leaves stuff unexplained and there even were some parts that even though it had it's sort of explanation, you just couldn't understand.  
The end of the story reserves no surprise and it is a ultra forced happy ending. 
 
As you can see, this is an OVA of 59 min, it's hard to make a character growth in due time, but they tried to do it here, they failed horribly, so the characters came out being pretty weak, especially the lead role, Carol. 
 
All in all, it was an entertaining watch for the laughs and the WTF moments that weren't' suppose to be WTF moments, especially the ""cool sunglasses elf"", must be seen to be believed. 
It deserves well the honour of ""so bad it's good"" title. 
 
Rate: 4:5/10 

          
 
       Helpful When I read the brief description of the story, I was sure this was probably some kid's story with a morality lesson or something.  As in, something for six year olds.  It's a the type of plot you might expect from super magical girl show (a la PreCure) or something.     
   
But nope, turns out it's more of a shoujo story aimed at young teen girls (I think the protagonist is fifteen).  And the story is played out seriously, at that.  Once you strip away the seemingly childish elements from the story description, it does boil down to a pretty standard shoujo story type.  Just like, say, Harukanaru or Twelve Kingdoms or Fushigi Yugi.     
   
And that is, ordinary teenage girl from the modern day ends up travelling to a fantasy world, gets surrounded by a bevy of pretty-boys who help her along the way, and she has some special position or power that could SAVE THE WORLD!     
   
Eh, it's not a terrible story, but it's well-trodden territory, which has been done with much more panache by other anime, than this 60-minute story.  And setting aside the story, the artwork is...okay...and the animation is...almost okay.  Just give this one a pass, there's other anime out there that does this story better.

       Helpful This OVA series has to be one of the most underrated anime ever.  Although at first glance this may seem very stupid, but actually its very funny.  It takes &quot;Devilman&quot; a very serious show along with &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; another series show although it did have some comedic moments and basicly parody them along with their creator Go Nagai himself.  Plus although I doubt anyone will count this as cannon, but it also bridges the gap between &quot;Devilman&quot; and &quot;Violence Jack&quot; another work of Go Nagai.  The only minus I can see is that if the person watching isn't aware of anything Devilman, Mazinger Z, Violence Jack, or even Cutey Honey related then they wouldn't get pretty much all of the jokes, so only GO Nagai fans will be able to enjoy this.

The  Eto Rangers  themselves are anthropomorphic animals, each representing one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals (and The Twelve Branches in Buddhism). In Japan they are known as the Eto animals. The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story).

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy']",none,"""The 12 animal rangers"" is one of the best show for kids with a very unique story within an exotic world of fairy tales.  
 
Summary: 
The world Nobel is made of countless mini-worlds of fairy tales created by humankind. The evil who plans to destroy this world from within sends minions into each fairy world under disguise of the world's characters. Each episode, the Mouse and a select few among the rest are chosen to be sent into a different fairy tale on the Unicorn (Kirin) Ship to blow the disguise of these minions. 
 
Story: 9/10 
As summarized, the story is very creative and attractive to kids since it explores a lot of fairy tales with ""improvisation"" due to distortions by the evil minions.  
In this story, that the Cat is made the evil general utilize the fact that Cat is excluded from the 12 Lunar animals in Japan and most Eastern countries. In the Chinese legend, the Cat finished too late to win the race for any place in the calendar and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forever. 
 
Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber. 
They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable. 
 
Even as show mainly geared toward kids, the last episodes are particular dramatic when most animal rangers sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the evil force, making way for Mouse to confront the evil mastermind behind the Cat. The ending relies on a miracle when all deceased animals were revived but it was enjoyable, and acceptable to kids shows of this kind. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art is decent regarding the time this was made. The animation is repeating especially during special attacks but they are not too often. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
OP and ED are particularly memorable. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The 12 animals get relatively equal coverage but, as a show for kids, there's no deep personalities. However, they did a very good job in showing friendship and cooperating spirit. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
As a twenty-something now after 15 years I still find this very enjoyable, absolutely.

Did not help that it had the same animation style, voices, crew and OST again, either. 
 
Now, you are probably thinking: why did this person give a high score for this anime? Are they perverted? NO, I am not. I am reviewing it based on what it's doing: being an omake. This word can vary on what it delivers as extra content, but this one decided to go the path of softcore hentai. 
 
For what this is delivering, it does it well. Obviously, it was aiming to be hentai and I give it a high rating cause it succeeded at doing so, to a certain degree, but I do not give it a very high rating because it kind of failed to give any of the scenes a proper climax. Don't get me wrong, it probably gave its viewers a climax at some point ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
 
However, any instance of something sexual about to happen almost never does. But, before I get into that, I will share a little background regarding what part of Green Green that this omake is set in. 
 
It appears that no boys are present here, so it must take place a little ways after the anime. Though, what doesn't make sense is that Midori is reincarnated again here, or that she returned from the future. However, she is friends with Reika now, which signifies that this is definitely after the original ending, because Reika hated her guts until Yusuke found out the truth. So, this makes sense. Then again, Midori is talking about how much she loves Yusuke at one point, hinting that this is probably a little after Yusuke regained his memories. Which explains why Reika is not nearly as critical as she is of Midori. 
 
With that being said, I will go about each one individually and basically explain the plot in written format in case you are not too into this stuff and are curious about what these specials are. Each of them are split into three segments; first being the obvious buildup, which always has some form of sexual joke in it; the second being the sexual climax, which usually disappoints; and the third being the sappy ending, which makes no sense to me. Though, I do know that almost all broadcasted anime is known for teasing the viewer with fan service in most cases, so I suppose it is fitting.  
 
This will be the most sexual review I ever write on this website, but this is what the omakes are and I am only reviewing cause I wanted to be first and also cause I watched the original anime. So, this is some unrated content I am about to describe here and I am basically explaining the story of three softcore hentai scenes. Then again, this is probably why nobody reviewed them to begin with. Last chance to turn back. The end of the review is at the bottom, but I just wrote this cause I was bored and thought you wouldn't want to see all the sexual visuals that these offer. So, I will try to elaborate the story as much as I can here. 
 
(OMAKE STORY BEGIN) 
 
Omake #1: Midori and Reika 
 
This one has the usual fan service at its finest, nothing too different. 
 
First Act - Buildup 
 
The scene starts with it zooming in on Midori's room, with her complaining that it won't fit to Reika (strap-on (...) perhaps), only to find out it was just a yukata and her chest was too big for it. They have some casual conversation that ends with Midori groping Reika. They start to wrestle and Reika wins right away. Midori say she will give up, but then continues with a surprise attacka and it is an even match for a while alongside a montage of what the other girls are doing. They moan about the heat in the building from the humidity and Midori suggests an idea. Later, they go into the pool cause, combined with the humidity in the building, they also basically worked each other out a lot from wrestling. So, they change into swimsuits and then just take a relaxing soak; everything still seems a bit in place of the characters. 
 
Second Act - Climax 
 
Midori begins talking about how she is glad Reika decides her destiny, and about how she loves Yusuke. She also says that Reika was apart of her destiny and, out of nowhere, they share one of those ""universal connection"" things that is common in most anime, and some cartoons even, where the characters are suddenly in space, just the two of them; something that normally occurs when two lovers are in sync with each other or something. They were just floating around in the pool with bikinis, so now they are completely naked in this little imagination world; something that sometimes happens in these scenes, though I can not remember why. And, very out of character here cause she admitted how much she loved Yusuke before, or because she is feeling sexually deprived, she starts holding Reika's hands in the imaginary space (Reika never bonded with any boys either, so maybe she is also feeling similar) they are in and they are about to, yup, get it on in the pool. In the real life scenario version, they are actually in the pool and were engaging in a casual conversation well holding hands and, presumably, about to kiss like in the space world. 
 
Third Act - Sappy 
 
They are then interrupted by their teacher. And eventually, to add to the plot, the other students come out and also take a dip into the pool because of the humidity in the building. It ends with them watching some fireworks and the soundtrack is fitting here. I strangely got goosebumps from it, but also cause when I saw Sanae up on the roof out of nowhere, she did it of her own will (she is normally very scared) and it was actually a pretty sweet moment. I do not know, I thought it was my favorite ending of the three in that regard. 
 
Omake #2: Futaba and Chigusa 
 
Now, HERE is one that caught me off guard. Yup, a student and teacher pairing, but this one makes more sense this time around in how it happens. Although, the third act I am a bit mixed about when calling it sappy, cause it still delivers more content worthy of the climax portion. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
The first scene starts with Futaba approaching Chigusa's office, looking very sickly and collapsing. In yet another misleading scene, it looks like Chigusa is eating her out, only to reveal that the reason Futaba was freaking out and ""could not be seen this way by the other boys"" was because she was in pain and just acting like a casual girl would in the matter. She was just being bandaged, basically. She just kicked one of the boys really hard, which is how the injury happened; and further explains that the boys are still in the school and that this takes place in the way that I said it did earlier. It just ends with Chigusa telling her not to do it again, with Futaba going on about how annoying the boys are and that she feels she needs to. 
 
Second Act: Climax 
 
It begins at night with Chigusa drunk, oh boy. Futaba puts her in her room and relaxes from how long it took her to carry her there. She is about to leave to let her rest, as anyone would do when someone is drunk and tired; and Chigusa grabs her arm and tells her not to go. Futaba feels like she just needs to talk, but is then pulled in on the bed as well. Chigusa further gets more serious and tells her not to leave her alone, and Futaba still thinks she just needs to talk. And then, Chigusa wraps her hands around her face and, honestly, this is probably the closest you will EVER see of a Yuri scene actually happening here. But, anyway, Chigusa slowly pulls her in and Futaba is just believing this is a joke, but as she is about an inch away from contact, she grabs Chigusa and SWINGS her across the room as her face hits the door and breaks it. For one more moment, Chigusa is still drunk and calls to Futaba, only to immedaitely become sober and jump out of her arms in embarrassment. She then starts crying and grabs onto Futaba yet again, as her drunken state returns. She then talks about her relationship, which we are now finding out about for the first time in the entire anime, and says all the generic lines about it. She talks about it all night and it ends with Futaba saying that it was, in fact, a drunken frenzy. 
 
Third Act: Sappy 
 
Futaba and Chigusa are now in the hot spring, fully naked this time. It does the generic hentai thing here, being ""my breasts are so small"" and, you know, Futaba wanting to squeeze Chigusa's. Okay, coming from someone that was not willing to engage with her, I think this is a bit more on the personal space level than the events of the other day. Though to be fair, Chigusa might have probably had sex with her otherwise if she went with that one kiss. Anyway, the last generic line, ""how can my breasts be bigger"" which ends with Chigusa telling her it happened naturally well she was doing push-ups. Futaba misinterprets this as the push-ups being what caused the increase and it ends with her doing them as Chigusa watches in enjoyment. 
 
Omake #3: Sanae and Wakaba 
 
And they just get more bizarre from here, but this one makes a bit more sense. They are pairing two characters that are both innocent in their own ways, so it kind of fits. It also has an unusually long Climax, too. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
They are just casually talking about the weather cause of how nice of a day it is, alongside the flowers and Sanae goes on about how one of her dreams was to see all the flowers look like the miniature spinning fans that only spin when you blow on them. It is actually kind of unusually heartwarming for one of these, but I did tell you my favorite part of the first one was when Sanae showed up. Anyway, Wakaba supports her dream and they are both feeling really happy from thinking about it. And, strangely, nothing sexual happened in this whole scene; kind of fitting of character, as I said earlier, these omakes were pretty faithful to them. Anyway, now they are watering the plants and there is a light montage on it; still pretty normal of your typical episode of Green Green so far. And after they go to grab some more water, here is where things turn back into hentai as Sanae gets hit with some water and now we can see through her outfit. She puts some water on Wakaba and the same thing happens. Then they have a water fight. The only sexual thing here is how the audience is reacting, but not how the characters are at all. 
 
Second Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Probably the only time anything sexual does happen in these, they go inside and talk about one of Sanae's many fears. This time, of her never going to swim in the pool. Wakaba asks Sanae if she wants to wear the swimsuit and she says why not. But, before she changes, she turns Togemura around, cause apparently he is a boy cactus. Okay, that sounds a bit random, but you probably watched the anime before you got here so you must know what I am talking about here. Anyway, Wakaba, being entirely in character here, sees a mosquito bite on Sanae after she complains of an itch on her neck and checks it out; with her believing it to be poisonous. Sanae reacts a little and Wakaba, thinking she is in pain, asks if she is okay. She says yes and Wakaba informs her that she will help her out. Also, one thing to note here is how extremely innocent this scene is, unlike most where the character doing the act keeps going regardless, cause Wakaba actually lets up whenever Sanae expresses a moan or anything that Wakaba can consider serious enough to stop doing what she is doing. But, she then continues sucking on the bite and Sanae shivers; leaving Wakaba to suggest she has a cold. She sees Sanae's tit and believes that it is another mosquito bite. Here, I question Wakaba's intelligence, but I NEVER saw an episode surround her before, so I never really knew. Anyway, she believes that is why Sanae is shivering and sucks on it; showing the first onscreen sexual act out of any of these omakes that is not interrupted. She sucks on it and Sanae moans again, once again concerning Wakaba to stop and ask her if it still itches. Wakaba says she will suck harder and, this time, Sanae is moaning pleasurably; which leaves Wakaba to continue sucking. She stops to say it was good enough, but then notices Sanae is still scared and has her eyes closed. As she opens them up, Wakaba looks at the other tit and thinks it is another bug bite. As she is about to suck it, Sanae says she is okay and Wakaba stops right away. Sanae then says she will try the swimsuit on and takes off her panties. As Wakaba tells her to put her legs through the swimsuit, she notices yet another ""bite"" between her legs and says she must suck out the poison. She then does so as it pans up ending with Sanae feeling pleasure once more. If you watch the anime itself, you would understand the innocence of this entire scene. Regardless, it is still softcore hentai, but probably the most innocent you will ever see of it. 
 
Third Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Wakaba and Sanae, now in the hot spring, are talking. Apparently, Sanae passed out from the pleasure and Wakaba talks about this as a concern. Sanae revealed that it was possibly anemia which caused it, which is understandable since she does take medication in the original anime and who knows how long Wakaba sucked on her ""bite"" for. Sanae goes on about how she was feeling weaker as Wakaba was sucking on her, prompting Wakaba to once again suggest it was the poison. She suggested sucking harder and using her tongue next time and said that her chest got harder as she was sucking. Oh, the level of innocence is a bit too much here, or Wakaba has never seen a woman naked before; even herself. She then says she should suck harder next time, with Sanae saying her heart is beating really fast; suggesting she is beginning to enjoy what Wakaba was doing. Wakaba suggests that Sanae do the sucking next time, as to which she agrees without hesitation and a smile. Futaba, overhearing the entire thing, gets startled as she hears them getting up from the hot spring and turns around to see that Sanae and Wakaba approached her. It was revealed that she was borrowing Wakaba's swimsuit and said she was in the hot spring to get a feel for the pool. Futaba acknowledges it. Lastly, we see Wakaba and Sanae washing each other, but getting unusually chummy about it. And then we see Wakaba's swimsuit hanging, with it dripping on Togemura. Yup, even the cactus was involved in some way. Anyway, now Wakaba is full on groping Sanae with her body, going on about how slimy it is. Sanae acknowledges it and then Futaba rushes in immediately to separate them. 
 
Fourth Act: Sappy 
 
Sanae and Wakaba go on about how summer vacation is almost over and we get a brief cameo of Midori and Reika talking about wrestling moves as they walk by. Sanae and Wakaba talk about how much of a good time they had and hope they can return next year. Sanae then says she will go into the pool that year and Wakaba acknowledges it by saying they will swim together and they promise each other that they will come back and enjoy school life. It ends with them looking at a meteor shower in awe. 
 
(OMAKE STORY END) 
 
Ah, that was a handful. I do not know why I even wrote all of that, but I guess I was just bored and wanted to write about something and this came around. Also, had nothing better to do. But man, was that a mouthful. Anyway, watching these is up to you. It is basically fan service from start to finish. Do I recommend it? Sure, if you want something to get it off to real quick. I only watched it cause I admired how it kept the OST, voices and everything from the anime into them, right down to the art style as well. And, the endings were alright, especially since I wound up finding out more story in a few of these from the girls than I did in the entire anime.

I really liked this series but that is only because of Miss Monochrome :3 She is a android with a somewhat childish robot view upon the world, so many misunderstandings and so on happens a lot indeed! which gives a special kind of comedy to it. 
 
Even though there are somewhat lots of randomness in this one then it is still one continued plotline throughout the series which makes it not too random ^^ which it is something that I like. 
 
The main problem of the series is you really have to like Miss Monochrome because she is the main factor for nearly everything in the series so if you don´t like her, then there is not much to like about this anime :)  

          
 
       Helpful Sometimes, when reality is too much for us, we want to watch something that'll take us away from it for a while, whether its funny comedy or cute antics of cute characters. Cartoons have been an escape from reality since its first inception. But sometimes, this isn't always a good thing. I personally like serious stories, but even I like something short and sweet once in a while. One such short and sweet anime is the recent Miss Monochrome anime series that's recently taken Japan by storm. What's this? An idol anime that's not ridiculously stupid or melodramatic? Awesome! Buuuuut all of the episodes are four minutes long, and there's a lot in this anime that really doesn't make sense, so I'm not gonna lie, it is VERY flawed. 
 
An android named Miss Monochrome has lived on Earth for years and years. When a stupid girl named Mana steals all of her money, Miss Monochrome is left penniless, living in a rundown apartment (how she's able to live there and pay any kind of rent or mortgage is never explained) with no means to support herself. She does have two things: her portable vacuum cleaner and a dream to become an idol like a woman named Kikuko. When she befriends a convenience store manager, who she's convinced is an idol manager simply because he has manager on his tag, she strives to stand out and be an idol like Kikuko. But the journey to become a singer is hard work. 
 
Since the anime itself is extremely short in its duration and episode length, there isn't really much to talk about. The animation looks quite good and it does its job well, but for the most part, it isn't really noteworthy. All the girls are drawn in cute moe style, the movements are reasonably fluid but not enough to make hardcore animation fans gush over it, and oddly enough, the CGI in the ending is actually really good! Normally, CGI is really bad or doesn't blend well with the 2D animation. There's no CGI in the actual show, so it doesn't have that problem, but the CGI in the ending theme is reasonably fluid, it doesn't look stiff or creepy, and since Monochrome is an android, it does a good job in keeping her uncanny valley appearance without going into uncanny valley territory itself. The music is...not much to write about. Sweet piano pieces are in abundance, Kikuko's music is bland, and I don't even remember the rest of it. 
 
For the most part, every single character is bland. Monochrome's a robotic android, Kikuko is the sweet cutesy idol whom everyone loves, Maneo is the hapless doormat who does everything he can for Miss Monochrome even when he's not obligated to, and Mana...she's easily the worst character, namely because she gets away with grand embezzlement, never gets arrested, and NOBODY calls her out on it! They even go as far as to say she's helpful and sweet even when her intentions are as obvious as a pink dress in an all-black wardrobe! But other than Mana, none of the characters are bad. The short run-time of four minutes doesn't give them time to really do much. 
 
But bland characters and lack of a compelling storyline aren't the worst of the show's problems. There are some elements that it introduces out of bloody nowhere that don't really have an effect on the show whatsoever, such as a group of aliens destroying Earth, allowing it to repopulate, then making plans to destroy it again. Sorry, but these aliens add nothing to the story, nor do they have a reason to be there in the first place other than to show how inhuman Miss Monochrome is. There's also the fact that Ru-chan, Miss Monochrome's pet portable vacuum cleaner thingy, dies at one point in an early episode, in a way that can easily be fixed, but Monochrome acts as though its the worst thing ever...and then he's brought back in the next episode without a second thought! Consistency, people! It's not that hard! 
 
All in all, it's nothing great, but if you want something sweet to tide you over, feel free to watch Miss Monochrome. It's a cute show with little substance, but at least it tries.

          
 
       Helpful If I had to describe this anime, it would be weird and random, but funny at the same time. I have no idea what I just watched, but I like it! For a 4 minute show, Miss Monochrome will definitely leave you saying, “what just happened” by the end of each episode. If you didn’t know already, Miss Monochrome is a slice of life anime.  
 
Story: (8/10) 
 
The story begins with our main character, Miss Monochrome, aspiring to become a popular idol like Kikuko on T.V. and her caretaker, Mana, asks to be her manager. She becomes her manager and requests 19.3 billion yen as the first thing to do as an idol. Our poor main character, Miss Monochrome, believes her and gives her all her money, leaving her broke, homeless, and stranded out on the streets to search for a new manager. Upon hoping to find one, a person named Maneo, who is surprisingly a manager, appears out of nowhere, but is not the manager you’d expect him to be. Little did you know, he’s actually a manager for a convenience store. Maneo becomes her manager and decides to help Miss Monochrome try to become a popular idol that she had always dreamed about. There’s not that much to say about the story, because the anime is so short, but what makes this so compelling is that you don’t know what to expect. What you just read, was an example of one of them. Majority of the episodes you watch are unexpected and randomly funny and by the end of each episode, it leaves you wondering if you’ll ever see Miss Monochrome become an idol. The only drawback I found within the story is that it perceives to be linear by the way the writer had set it up. You may not think the story leads anywhere, but it all comes together in the end.  
 
Characters: (10/10) 
 
This anime couldn’t be done well without its characters. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, may seem like a vocaloid by appearance, but in actuality, she’s an android. Her inability to feel emotions and take things literally enhances the show’s comedy. Another thing this anime does well is that the characters feel like a comedy routine. Maneo, being the one to find jobs for Miss Monochrome, sets up the joke and Miss Monochrome, the android who can’t differentiate between a joke and a serious answer, is the punchline. Mana, the con artist, sets up the tragedy for the main character and Kikuko, the popular idol, being the main goal. Of course you couldn’t forget about Miss Monochrome’s trusty pet, Ruu-chan, to add character depth towards her. Each character in this anime serves a purpose and executes it well.  
 
Art: (8/10) 
 
The artwork was produced by Liden Films who also made Yamada-Kun and the Seven Witches, Terraformars, and Senyuu. The artwork for this anime wasn’t that bad. The 3D CGI character of Miss Monochrome in the end credits were well done. However, the overall environment and the design for some of the characters looked generic.  
 
Sound: (9/10) 
 
There’s no opening theme for this anime, only an ending. However, only taking up the last minute of the show, it sounds good. I was surprised how well the English dub vocal crew were compared to the Japanese one. The main character for Miss Monochrome sounds very similar to the Japanese vocal actress which I liked very much. The rest of the English dub voice actors seemed to have fit the role just as the Japanese ones as well.  
 
Enjoyment: (8/10) 
 
Since Miss Monochrome is 4 minutes long, I expected it to become another generic anime and something linear, but it seemed to have proved me wrong. This anime made me go on an unexpected feels trip. I never knew something that seemed so upbeat, lighthearted, and innocent be so tragic at the same time. Another thing I liked about this show, was how it referenced some real life people, anime, and merchandise. I mean, who doesn’t like a bit of references right? An anime can throw around a few references, but when it’s done right, it can become a masterpiece. In Miss Monochrome, the references aren’t just some subtle hint hoping to give you a little chuckle, it actually adds toward the story and the comedy which, surprisingly, impressed me. 
 
Overall: (8/10) 
 
Overall, Miss Monochrome is a short, enjoyable, slice of life anime that will make you laugh and feel good after watching it. You can kind of expect what’s going to happen in the end, but the random journeys you go on with Miss Monochrome makes up for it. Miss Monochrome’s stale but optimistic view on becoming an idol has certainly put a smile on my face. This underrated anime deserves a little more attention and I hope you give it a chance too.

(Source: ANN)","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Shounen']","Yukinari Sasaki is an average high school student who is frequently ridiculed by girls to the point that he developed an allergic reaction to them. As a result, he breaks out in hives whenever he comes into contact with a female. One day, when he returns home from school, he is kicked into his bathtub by his neighbor Kirie Kojima, but is transported to Seiren (セーレン, Sēren, ""Siren"" in the Tokyopop manga translation), a mysterious world with a mostly female population. He befriends Miharu Sena Kanaka, who ends up following him to Earth. Other Seiren girls with various motives soon visit and join the household. They are taken on many adventures as Miharu discovers the wonders of Earth.
","((Pretty much the same as the first but stuff added to the end.)) 
 
Girls, naked breasts, and panty shots. Is this what Anime has become? Well, it’s not as bad as Eiken. The artwork is actually mostly tasteful (Ok… it’s not really but at least the girls don’t have breasts the size of body pillows on their chests) and the storyline is actually rather well done. It’s almost like a Romeo and Juliet storyline in parts because the two always seem to be ripped apart by some things. 
 
Let’s start with the characters. Miharu is a little cutesy and a sweetie. Sometimes though, a little too much of the sweet, naive character. She has the traits of an alien character in that she has supernatural powers that sometimes can’t be controlled and the fact that she didn’t know much of Earth. She has a black hole of a stomach since she is always hungry but oddly, some of the things she eats, she does it way to odd. For example, the second episode, she eats a banana rather suggestively. She has no concept of not changing in front of people, mostly in front of Yukinari though. 
 
Koyomi is pretty cute as well and again, is way to naïve. Her background story is actually quite sad. She Has a fear of men but not surprisingly actually is alright with Yukinari after quite a while. She works with the space management office on the planet Seiren where the two are from. Her special agent friend, Tomoka, is actually rather childish and way different then the shy Koyomi.  
 
Kirie is a rather kick ass sporty type, who has a thing for Yukinari (You can see where this is all going). She is the childhood friend of him and sometimes ends up just walking into his house without a care in the world, many times leaving a rather big misunderstanding that ends up hurting Yukinari. Whenever she fights a ‘pervert’ she screams out something ‘in hell’ as she beats the crap out of them. It was fun for a little while, and then got rather old. 
 
Yukinari is… well like every other fucken main character in a Harem! He’s clumsy, small, and not really able to stand out in a crowd. He has an allergy to women though Miharu doesn’t make him brake out at all. Other then that, he is rather sweet and kind, with a wonderful heart. 
 
On the other side of the spectrum is Kazuharu who flirts with every girl around him. He is a pervert who always grabs the girls’ breasts and panties. He is allergic to men though, hence the white gloves that he wears. His sister, Risa, is really into black magic and has a crush on Yukinari. She has a really pushy and throws her servants around to get him to come to her. Now for her servants, Kosame is into Kirie actually. This is actually a new concept I never really saw in another show, especially because it’s a Yuri relationship. 
 
They crammed so much into this show that it’s really jammed with a lot of stuff into it. We got the enter-dimensional transportation, black magic, love triangles, aliens from another world, magical girls, special ops characters, and perverts. We even have a little cute side kick animal named Ebi. Ebi and Miharu have an interesting little relationship much like Excel and her dog.  
 
The artwork is pretty much standard. It’s clean and bright but It just doesn’t stand out much from all the other anime done around this time. It makes it really hard to figure out just what to say every time I review a show that is pretty standard in this area.  
 
The English voices are pretty good, though I feel a bit odd about Miharu’s voice. It’s Michelle Ruff who also played the voice of Ai Sakuraba from Ai Yori Aoshi. Kasuharu Fukuyama is actually played perfectly by Liam O’Brien who did Taishi Kuhonbutsu from Comic Party. Yes, the overactive Otaku is playing the overactive pervert. Not a large difference but it works perfectly for this show. 
 
Season two comes out pretty much the same as the first, though even more perverted. I did like the episode where Yukinari and Kazuharu changed bodies. I really loved how it suddenly turned into a really messed up way where everyone switched with every other person at the swimming pool. The only thing that bothered me was the tentacle rape part.  It was kind of going overboard. 
 
It is here when I figured out why the story plot seemed so disjointed. I found a lot of these episodes were all filler, most of them only going for one episode. It was all made for fan service that sort of gets old at times. That and the stupidity of Miharu seemed to get even more. Still, I couldn’t help but keep watching it, thinking that there may be an underlining storyline for the whole show. There… kind of was but it didn’t show up until episode 17 (6 in the second episode) but there was barely any info about it till Episode 20. Sadly, this only has 24 episodes when adding the two seasons together. 
 
I pretty much see the name as ‘Oh! There are girls naked and sexual innuendos with anime fan service! Bravo!’ or at least that’s what I think the guys are thinking.

       Helpful Girls Bravo feels like a parody of every bad harem anime out there, and for that reason, it's almost so bad it's good. 
Harem protagonists are stereotypically seen as wimps, aren't they? Well, the one in Girls Bravo takes the cake as the biggest loser I've seen star in an anime. Ever. The main character, Yukinari, is straight-up allergic to women and has an outright phobia of them too.  
 
However, his life is changed when he's transported to a world where only women exist. The women in this world are nice and don't give him rashes, unlike the pesky ones on Earth. They're all in love with him; he's the only male they've seen in years, after all. One of the women of this world, Miharu, accidentally comes back to Earth with him. 
The premise alone is just so pandering, they don't try to hide it. 
However, I will say this series has its fair share of good comedy. (The kind they intended, not the so-bad-it's-good kind) Kazuharu is probably the funniest character in the show. The scene of him dancing on a rooftop dressed in a banana suit was too priceless. 
Also, the music is pretty good. 
 
So, that's my take on it. It's a show that clearly panders, has a really stupid premise, but it's almost so bad it's good.

Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting,  Spring and Chaos  is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers. 
 
(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","The story follows Kenji Miyazawa through different periods of his life, centering primarily on his relationships with his sister, his father, his students, and the farmers in his area. The film opens with a sequence of Kenji carrying snow in his hands and chasing after a moving train containing his sister Toshi. Suddenly the ground splits and the train descends into the sea, as Kenji sinks to his knees and calls his sister's name. In the real world, Kenji's students sit in their classroom and gossip about the strangeness of their teacher. Kenji enters through the window and proceeds to tell the students to shut their books and close their eyes, explaining principles of heat and temperature to them. Then he leads his students on an outdoor excursion, demonstrating the eccentric teaching style that Miyazawa was known for.
Six years earlier, Kenji walks through natural landscapes with his friend, Kanai Hosaka. Looking at two telegraph poles, he gets the inspiration for his poem Telegraph Poles on a Moonlit Night. He talks about his dreams for the future with Kanai on a mountaintop while gazing at a beautiful field of stars. Upon returning home with an armful of rocks he has collected, he witnesses his father at work at the family pawnshop business, in the middle of insisting that he cannot give a poor farmer any more money for his goods. Kenji later argues with his father about the business, decrying the practice of profiting off the poor. However, he is cheered by his sister Toshi; he asks her if she has read his poem in Azalea, a reference to the magazine that Miyazawa started with his friends. Toshi starts to cough violently and Kenji rushes to her aid.
In 1923 Kenji moves to Tokyo out of depression, working at a small publishing out. He meets his friend Kanai again after three years, but Kanai now believes Kenji to be too idealistic, and says that they cannot walk the path they dreamed of together after all. Kenji returns shortly afterwards to Hanamaki to be with Toshi, who is very sick and talks about her fear of death. Kenji reads her a story of his and describes his writing methods and the inspiration he takes from nature. His creative process is depicted in an abstract sequence showing birds, bears, a winged Kenji, and numerous other images in varying art styles.
Kenji's father berates him for printing so many copies of his book, which no one ended up reading. Kenji declares that he doesn't write to sell books. In the classroom his students read his poetry collection Spring and Asura, but they all profess to not understand it. Kenji observes the farmers toiling slavishly in the fields and becomes overcome with emotion, hit with a sudden hallucination of being trapped and surrounded by water filled with skeletal corpses and fearful spirits. He comes to with his students worrying around him. They then tell him about a student who has been stealing from his classmates; Kenji catches the student and tells the boy to follow him, travelling a long way through difficult natural terrain until they reach a mountaintop. There Kenji asks the boy about his motives for stealing, offering selflessly to give the boy his entire salary and to get him however much money he needs. He learns that the young boy is from a poor family of farmers.
Kenji makes up his mind to quit teaching and to work the fields alongside the other farmers. He is unused to the work, and the other farmers scoff at him and view him as a weak amateur. As a sung version of Miyazawa's famous poem Ame ni mo Makezu plays in the background, Kenji works in the field in the day and teaches the farmers about art and literature as well as new fertilizing techniques during the evening. However, many other farmers still do not warm up to him, continuing to think of him as spoiled and rich, even sabotaging his crop while he is away.
He works himself to exhaustion farming and hallucinates once again, leading to a rapid series of flashbacks. He despairs and thinks of one of his last moments with his sister, when she asks him to bring her fresh snow and he feeds it to her in bed. As Kenji lies desolately in the field, all of a sudden a pair of trains burst up from the ground and towards the sky, referencing Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, the basis for which was said to be his sister's death. Seeing this, he is able to regain hope. He recites a segment of his poem Spring and Asura.
","I came across this movie whilst searching around and I needed something to watch so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not very long, barely and hour but for such a short movie that would seem to be a child's animation, I was very impressed. I of course watched the dubbed version - it wouldn't have mattered to me - and though the voice acting was a bit shaky, it didn't take away from the actual story. I was very impressed by it's mix of CGI renders and animation, the effects taken on during one scenes left me speechless.  
 
This movie really isn't for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience. I truly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Miyazaki film or a Otomo film. 
 
I do say though with heart, the main character, Kenji, left me to wonder a lot of things about life and its surroundings. This movie can teach you something. 

          
 
       Helpful How do you make a fitting tribute to a great person? Well, this is how. It's EXACTLY how it needed to be in this case: poetic and extremely heartfelt. 
 
Spring and Chaos is a short parable on Kenji Miyazawa's life as an adult, directed by Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame. Of course, one cannot expect a comprehensive account in less than an hour's time—thankfully, this movie doesn't attempt that. Colorful and deliberately surreal, it instead relays the atmosphere of Miyazawa's works and the circumstances of their creation, the physical and emotional turmoil he was going through in his short life, and his unique and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand what this person is about. Surrounded by all kinds of misfortune, sadness, and misunderstanding, Miyazawa's noble soul shone through in his unrelenting dedication to comprehend the world and enrich the lives of others back when almost nobody—including most of his family members—could realize the extent of his talent, motivation, and self-sacrifice. 
 
The movie quite fittingly gives us a good taste of Miyazawa's writing and worldview by presenting his life as a visual poem—and does so by capturing the very essence of poetry in all of its splendor without focusing too much on worldly details; in a sense, taking an approach almost exactly inverse of the over-represented slice-of-life genre. Call it an ""essence of life"": the genre where you say a little to tell a lot. And yes, in its relatively short runtime it tells quite enough to overwhelm. Just like good poetry should. 
 
Many of you know how it feels to rewatch something you first saw many years ago. More often than not you fail to recapture that first-time experience. But Spring and Chaos is one of those very rare pieces of art that doesn't only stand the test of time—it also actually becomes better on a subsequent watch. I was about 20 when I saw it the first time, and, while it certainly did seem inspired and engaging the first time around, I couldn't say I was moved very much. I have, however, rewatched it multiple times since, and by the time I hit 30 it managed to completely floor me. Almost every scene, especially in the second half of the movie, is so unbelievably powerful despite its subtlety, it can move you to tears without ever becoming a forced tear-jerker. This is especially prominent considering the movie has very little actual dialogue and relies predominantly on visual storytelling. All in all a mark of an outstanding work that transcends its medium and succeeds at its ultimate task: to introduce the viewer to the marvelous world of Kenji Miyazawa. The lamp is lost, its light forever preserved. Sleep well, Kenji-san.

          
 
       Helpful A truly unique and enjoyable anime.It tells the story of rich businessman son: Kenji Miyazawa who tries to find deeper meaning to life and his place among society. As the son of a rich businessman it would be easy to undertake the role of the family business and live in relative comfort and splendor.But kenji yearns for adventure and so tries his hand at different jobs to see if he can find any answers to life. 
 
The main character  Kenji Miyazawa is a bit of an oddball,his idealistic view of life and carefree attitude is a point of contention between him and his father and a source of amusement among children.He's immature while at the same time convincing in his lead role. 
 
I really like the animation,the drawing was done with great detail,the like of which is rarely  seen among today CGI animation.

Cautiously venturing inside, she realizes that there is more to this place than meets the eye, as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls. Ghostly apparitions and food that turns her parents into pigs are just the start—Chihiro has unwittingly crossed over into the spirit world. Now trapped, she must summon the courage to live and work amongst spirits, with the help of the enigmatic Haku and the cast of unique characters she meets along the way. 
 
Vivid and intriguing,  Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi  tells the story of Chihiro's journey through an unfamiliar world as she strives to save her parents and return home. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama']","Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father decides to take a shortcut. The family's car stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Chihiro's father insists on exploring, despite his daughter's protest. They find a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have been transformed into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.
Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji refuses to hire her and asks worker Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, and is eventually given a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name, renaming her Sen (千). While visiting her parents' pigpen, Sen realizes that she had already forgotten her real name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names, and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.
Sen faces discrimination from the other workers; only Kamaji and Lin show sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face (Kaonashi 顔無し) inside, believing him to be a customer. A ""stink spirit"" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic emetic dumpling. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it, then swallowing him. No-Face demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers.
Sen sees paper Shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse, and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.
With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts an engorged No-Face, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.
Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that that Yubaba used the black slug to take control over Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and offers to fly them home. No-Face decides to stay behind with Zeniba and become her spinner, while Sen and Boh leave with Haku for the bathhouse. In mid-flight, Sen recalls falling years ago into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Nigihayami Kohakunushi). When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything after eating at the restaurant stall. They walk back through the tunnel until they reach their car, now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, her hair tie from Zeniba still intact.
","Loved it! 
 
Chihiro and Haku(Kohaku) is so cute! I totally ship them! 
 
This had an ""adventure"" feel to it. I love it! 
 
Their little romance is cute too! 
 
I wonder if Haku kept his promise and met up with Chihiro. If he did, it would be wonderful!~ 
 
The plot is interesting too. It has a ""wavy"" feel to it. And I like it. 
 
I don't really care about the art, but it was still pretty good. Especially how Haku is drawn.  
 
Overall, this was a pretty good movie. I'm hoping to find more Studio Ghibli movies and watching them. They must be good, if this movie and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is pretty good.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, I don’t even know where to start with this work of art. “Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi” - or in English referred to, “Spirited Away”, honestly swept me off of my feet. Before I go on though, I’d like to address one thing. This is in fact my review, and my opinion towards this anime. I’m only speaking for myself as everyone has their own thoughts. None are “better” or “more legitimate” than others.  
 
Starting this off, I’m not going to lie, I saw this anime movie feature when it first came out. I was a child back then, and this film managed to scare me. However, recently I decided to revisit this due to high recommendation of a friend. Never would I have ever guessed that this film would rank so high on my list. Being a child that was easily frightened, the unique animation had sent chills down my spine… but with age, I’ve came to enjoy the plot and characters within this series.  
 
First, let’s go over the basic plot of this anime. It might seem stereotypical, but this anime introduces the idea of a young girl stumbling into a magical and unheard of world. However, despite previous adaptations of this simplistic idea, Studio Ghibli brought something fresh and interesting to the table. We’re brought into a world featuring a bathhouse for spirits, complex characters, and blooming romance. For those who don’t find amusement in the romance genre, don’t fret. It’s not a major thing in the plot considering that the main character is ten, whoever, it does introduce the power of ‘true love’. With that essential power at their disposal, our protagonist learns how to work with this world to save her parents and to escape in the meanwhile.  
 
Next- let’s jump into the characters. The first thing I’d like to announce is that the characters are in no way bland. Each person has their own personality, appearance, and importance in this. Character reliability is also put into play here. Our main character, Chihiro, is at first terrified by this whole experience. However, with the help of Haku (a strange boy who aids her in her search to go back home), she’s introduced into the basic lore of this world. Along the way she meets a series of foes and friends who she later learns to get along with. They bond, and over a period of time she becomes content with these spirits. The characters all play important parts in Chihiro’s journey even if it’s a faceless spirit, a huge baby, or a dancing light post. I don’t know if it was only me, but I loved being introduced into the different types of characters in Spirited Away.  
 
Okay, now onto the more technical parts of this anime ; the anime and sound qualities. The animation is pretty good, as it’s not that straining to watch. I don’t have much to compare it to, but definitely it gets the job done beautifully. The sound quality was good, as they gave distinguished noises to multiple things.  
 
Now to wrap this up. I highly enjoyed this feature. Hands down, I recommend this to both anime fans and not. It’s a good movie, and it DEFINITELY deserves the high rating it has on MAL . Even though it might not be for everyone, a bigger half of anime fans mark this film as one of their favorites. And after watching this, I can definitely understand why. 

          
 
       Helpful This was such an amazing movie, one of Ghibli's and Hayao Miyazaki's best works. I would highly recommend this movie if you want something wholesome that still engages you with action the whole way through. Spirited Away, or should I say Blew Me Away, is cute and fun all the way through and all of the characters are loveable in their own unique ways. Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi is a must-watch for all Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki fans. At some parts, the sound was a bit off but it is an old film - you cannot tell it's age with ease either.

(Source: MAL News)","['Comedy', 'Super Power']",none,"I like To Be Heroine, and have been waiting for reviews to come back so I can maybe convince a few people to check it out who might have otherwise been turned off by the low score. I give it a 7 overall, but I would consider it a strong 7. It's not perfect, but it has some uniqueness to it that I find captivating. 
 
Disclaimers: 
0. I haven't actually seen the first series. Do with that what you will; I might be missing some things, but there's also no selection bias here. 
1. This is my first MAL review 
2. The show is only at episode 4 at the time of writing, plus a behind the scenes. I may or may not update the review, but currently I would recommend it. 
3. I haven't seen all that many anime in total, so some pretty tired tropes aren't as old for me as they might be for others. 
 
 
That said! 
 
Story: 7 
To Be Heroine's story so far doesn't seem like anything super groundbreaking, though I find the use of vignettes and the method the story is told with to be pleasing. Futuba is a girl dragged into another world and charged with restoring it. We've all seen this before, so her quest has been generally glossed over in favor of flashbacks that give us insight into the kind of people Futuba and her friends are, and their struggles. At times it can seem like the show is trying to do too many things at once, and sacrifices clarity for it, but I can accept a little uncertainty if it means that I don't have to be given exposition dumps on characters archetypes we've all seen before. Ultimately, from where the show stands now, it appears to be less about Futuba's quest to purify this world or whatever, and more about her own personal ascension to womanhood. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but I like the presentation. 
 
Art: 8  
Originally I wasn't too impressed with the art, but it's grown on me. The storyboarding is well done: shots help tell the story in a way that shows care is put into each scene. Faces on people, even background characters, are always drawn, again, carefully. If you pause at any given moment, you can tell that the artists were considering the actual anatomy of a face, even for the guy in the back all the way to the left of the screen. The action is pretty, if perhaps a little lazily drawn, but that's hardly a cardinal sin for a weekly show. There are some things that look pretty distinctly chinese to me that might stick out to you as Quality, like how faces are drawn in nearly full profile, but frankly anime is typically no more accurate than this show when drawing faces from the side. Nice use of color. I like the way it looks. 
 
Sound: 8 
The show sounds good. The SFX work well, the music is suitable, the OP and ED have cool themes, though they might sound a bit too much like DDR tracks for some people's tastes. What puts it at an 8 for me is the use of chinese for the flashbacks to the real world and nihongo for the weird alternate one. It's not a huge deal, but it's just a cool detail, one the significance of which I look forward to finding out. 
 
Character: 6 
Not too much to say only 4 episodes in. The blonde chick is a badass. Nobody sticks out as anything completely new, but that's okay. Characters in the flashbacks aren't super interesting but they're pretty believable people that way. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 and 7 
I just generally find the show pretty cool. the action is flashy, the plot feels like it's gearing up, and I have a good feeling about the show going forward.

          
 
       Helpful I normally never write reviews, simply because if you're gonna like it - you will. If you're not - you won't. BUT this review is only to let you know, the person who isn't sure if they should watch this yet, or the person who is confused three episodes in, that yes... you should finish it. It's only seven episodes, with a weak budget. But comparatively to the full season, big budget assembly line anime we watch every day 'To Be Heroine' is a refreshing change of pace.  
 
The animation is sloppy, the voice acting is hard to listen to and the story is so strange off the bat. BUT WAIT before you realize it you're caught up in a story you didn't realize you were, invested in characters you just met and getting all emotional at those final credits.  
 
If you've got a couple hours to spare, you'll be rewarded for your investment.

          
 
       Helpful To be heroine is a Japan-Chinese product and i know these is a lot of people already give it some hate just for that fact. but this show is really good. and have real effort given by people behind it. 
 the sound and track in action scene China cut ver is actually  more intense (maybe to bring more people to watch the chinese ver)  
 
 
OK, THE REVIEW. 
 
The show is good. animation, sound, character, story... all did a good job  
 
In the first episode. i know it at least is a enjoyable show with that quality. after the 3th. i know it will be a good ass story. just some minutes, the back story of Hikaru's parent nailed a good love story better than most majority romance anime. so just experiment it you self.  
I actually surprise with my self since i never like the sound of Chinese. it kinda weird even though i watch a bunch of kung fu movies. but the moment three kid start singing, it just beautiful !  
 
at the episode 6, I confused. everything is make sense now. why bring that element back (the kid in other world). but instead of just bring a resolution and end the story. it keep me wonder and curious. it maybe some more good shit behind it.  
At the episode 7. I lost. did it just... miracle happy ending and that all ? just 7 episodes ?  
 
I though i may miss something. and when i research a bit. i saw some crazy theory. OK, SKIP THIS AND ONLY READ WHEN YOU WATCHED THE SHOW: the only thing happen is the read head boy able to upload the video pro . all of that spirit fighter only in her ""world"". so that mean nothing happen just... they are all dea... No. i rather take they drop quality and use a deus-ex machine.  
 
 
i would wait if there is more . For now i leave it a 8. Still a full of fun, sadness, happy, emotion drive. Would recommend

","I seem to be the odd one here, especially because I LOVED season 2 even though it's not canon, but OVAs just for silliness aren't really my thing.. I watched these because Netflix had them tacked onto the second season, and I personally found most of them a tad boring/too ridiculous.. That's just me, but yeah-- if you're wondering if these are just for comedy and silliness, they are.  I honestly can't remember the Wonderland episodes much besides one awkward scene and Grell being the Cheshire Cat. I know I wasn't too entertained by them though. ""Welcome to the Phantomhive's"" puts the viewer in the show, like the characters are talking directly to you, which, to me, felt kind of odd and cringy when not actually playing a video game. The ""Making Of"" episode is in a documentary style, interviewing the characters as if they're just actors playing the roles of the story. I didn't care for it, but it might be amusing for you, if you like that sort of thing. The episode about the reapers (""The Tale of William"") was probably the best for me. I always enjoy Grell and if you do too, watch that one at least. :) I know this review is simple; sorry if it's not helpful for you.

          
 
       Helpful I suppose the review is for those lucky people that managed to find all the ova episodes since most were tooken down by some sites. This is my 1st review, so i'll try to make this look good as much as I can. 
 
Story & Art ( An Acceptable 8) 
 
As expected, the artwork hasen't changed much just like the series and such. So all is still well. The story is good and all but not on every episode. It probably deserves a 7 instead.... but what brought it to an 8 was how the humor and more scenes with the supporting characters replaced it and brought up the score. 
 
Sound & Character (Nice 9) 
 
The Opening (that is brought in 1 or 2 episodes I think) are the same as the second season. Not every episode has an opening though. The ending isn't all that much looking forward to, but it plays pleasant music by Kalafina. The voice of Alois Trancy's Thompson Brothers (Or whatever those triplet butlers are called :\) is kind of annoying but decent. I've never heard them talk before. The music is great. The characters still remain the same of course. And with more Grell xD. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall ( Just A 7) 
 
It was all good, I think they could've done better on the stories in the episodes, (9), I think one of the episodes was just done from running out of ideas, (8), and they should've they should've made a little clip for ending in the last episode since it seemed kinda empty without one. (7). None-the-less, I'd recommend watching it of course. Not everyone's opinion is the same :).

13,552,41,8.252058105730812,story with the main character transported to another world,Digimon Adventure,"When a group of kids head out for summer camp, they don't expect it to snow in the middle of July. Out of nowhere, the kids receive strange devices which transport them to a very different world to begin their  Digimon Adventure ! Led by the plucky Taichi Yagami, the seven children must now survive in a realm far from home, filled with monsters and devoid of other humans. 
 
Luckily, they're not alone: each child is paired off with a companion digital monster called a Digimon. Together, the children and their new friends must overcome their insecurities, discover their inner strengths, and evolve into stronger fighters - literally. 
 
A force of evil is spreading through the Digital World, corrupting all the Digimon. The DigiDestined have arrived and it’s up to them to save the Digital World, if they ever want to see their home world again.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Kids']",none,"When it comes to 'childhood shows' you grew up watching, there comes a certain kind of dissonance between the experience you had as a kid and the experience you would have as an adult. Rewatching Digimon Adventure recently, I realized that it's the kind of show that wouldn't sit well with you if you think too much, especially when compared to other better anime. Objectively speaking, it's not a classic, and one would certainly have to retain some sense of nostalgia to really enjoy having this adventure. For an anime created to promote the virtual pets merchandise, however, it is a well-produced series that offers a few surprises, even for the more cynical audiences. 
 
While it's definitely better than the other popular 'mons' anime franchise in terms of its overarching plot, the story is not the strongest aspect of the anime. The series is split into four major arcs, and like any monster-battling shounen shows, the storyline can get a bit episodic, with the children fighting a new set of villains with the beginning of each arc. Predictable cliches are commonly found without looking closely, and there are even a number of plot-holes and deus ex machinas that attack your common sense and logic. That said, viewers going in expecting a typical beat'em up will be pleasantly surprised by some of the darker plot-twists during mid-series. For a show seemingly targeted towards a younger audience, its angst and drama can become a bit mature for the little ones. This is where the strongest suit of the series comes into play - the character writing. 
 
For the entirety of the show, it's as if the writers had set out to place their focus solely on 'evolving' the seven children (and to a lesser extent, the eighth child) in the show. Most of the side characters in the show, even the protagonist Digimon characters, have little to no personality. Their morality and motivations are pretty clear, and it's definitely a good versus evil story at play. There's little intelligence to be found among the villains' cliche 'take over the (digital) world' scheme, and even the good guys don't give a satisfying explanation of why these particular children, and not any others, were chosen to be sent to the Digital World and fight the battles. Nevertheless, this leaves plenty of room for a singular focus - the Chosen Children characters. 
 
As the story goes on, each of the eight children are given a proper development scenario where they have to conquer their flaws and become a better person. Nearly all of them has an inner demon to fight with, and this can range from casual angst to realistically unpleasant situations. After doing some research on the show, I found out that the writers had decided to name each of the characters based on symbolical words that are related to good luck and fortune. This had me thinking that the writers really cared about the characters as they would care about a bunch of real children, and the writing really shows. While the manner in which the characters overcome their fears and anxieties can be overly convenient and even awkwardly forced at times, 'character development' is at its most literal sense here as we see the children evolve past their immature selves and be freed as a butterfly would. 
 
For an anime produced in the '90s, the art department did quite a decent job. However, the first thing I noticed rewatching the show is how blend the water-color backgrounds can be. While it's a common, traditional style among many anime of that era, the art of both the Digital World and the real world in this anime would be the least memorable thing in your mind. This can be effective in the sense that your focus is entirely placed on the characters instead of a picturesque backdrop, and considering that the characters are well-animated, this is hardly a problem. Given the angst the protagonists would face, the color tones at these grimmer moments do give the show the appropriate atmosphere, being cheery, thrilling, and emotional at the right times. 
 
However, viewers would be annoyed at the repetitive transformation sequences the Digimon would go through very often. While this may be fun for the kids, and it's certainly an effective business technique to promote the toys, they get old and tired for the more impatient viewers. Moreover, while the traditional animation transformations were decent to look at, viewers may find the CG animations to be cheesy and even cheap. The accompanying music, however, helps the audience through the ordeal without leaving things too awkward. 
 
Some of the scores you hear in the anime might feel familiar for you older audiences out there. That's because composer Arisawa Takanori had decided to recycle and remix a few of his old tracks from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars. Cheap productions aside, I noticed that many of the scenes in the anime have awkward silences where no track is played, and this can be sometimes anti-climatic. That said, there are more than a handful of enjoyable scores, character themes, and battle themes inserted in every episode to keep one entertained, not to mention the ever memorable ""Butter-Fly"" theme song by Wada Kouji. In addition, the theme song for the Digimon evolution sequences, Miyazaki Ayumi's ""Brave Heart"", would certainly fire up the spirits in your heart as you root for the heroes to win. 
 
One particular aspect I would like to mention about the songs in the original Japanese series is that the lyrics are definitely a lot more mature, symbolic, and memorable than those second-rated pop songs used in the dub series. In exchange for an opening about becoming a fluttering butterfly, the dub chose to use an over-the-top cheese-fest that repeats the word, ""Digimon"" over and over again. 
 
The overall enjoyment of the series is a difficult aspect to evaluate. As stated above, what one might enjoy as a child is vastly different than as an adult. Being a kid, I really loved this season of Digimon to death, more so when I discovered the original Japanese version. The values this show brings to children about courage, friendship, and love are more entertaining than preachy, and they really help the younger audiences relate to them as they journey on this fun adventure with these lovable characters. But as you grow older and become more cynical, you would start noticing the chinks in the plot-armor, the randomness even in the original Japanese dialogues, and you would wonder to yourself how the heck you had managed to sit through this show. 
 
Nostalgic factors aside, the anime series is pretty tame compared to better-written shounen shows out there, even with its above average character writing. However, for a carefree experience revisiting your childhood again, the show will serve up a more than decent entertainment as you travel with the Chosen Children on this Digimon Adventure.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The storyline of Adventure evolves (no pun intended) into something wonderful as the series goes on, however, the beginning is very shaky, and, for some audiences, a weak beginning is an automatic turn-off. It starts off very episodic, and, aside from the fact that the kids want to get home and have to fight a guy called Devimon, there is not much else for plot. However, after they get home, the series jumps into one of my favorite anime story arch of all times: The Eight Child arch. That part (which largely takes up the middle of the series) was masterfully done, and if the beginning wasn't so average, I would have surely given this anime a 9 or a 10 because of its splendid center content, which is like a bipolar carnival ride of smiles and tears. 
 
Art: For a show in the 90's, Adventure had very good art, and, even today, I prefer its style over that of many newer animes (Digimon ones included.) It is a hybrid of a toony style and a realistic one, giving the show a somewhat recognizable flare. Also, they have some amazing creature designs. True, there are some insanely cute Digimon (especially the babies) but, for the most part, the monsters actually look like what they are: Monsters! Adventure also uses a pleasant blend of CGI and traditional animation. Thankfully, they keep it low on the CGI (possibly due to the technology of the time) so it never looks stupid or overdone. 
 
Sound: What can I say, I love the soundtrack for both the English and Japanese versions. The dub and sub have catchy tunes throughout, however, in both versions there is nothing outstanding in the area of music. It’s mostly just songs that’ll get stuck in your head, but there are no memorable pieces destined to give you chills. 
 
Character: As someone who writes, I know that, the more characters you have, the harder it often is to develop them all. Adventure never seems to have this problem. The characters are all fleshed-out wonderfully, and are very relatable. Though they are young and clearly wise beyond their years, they are not so wise as to raise too many eyebrows, for they still make childish mistakes, and, despite their maturity, still act like kids. All of them have their own back stories and issues with their own images; at times the things they say are surprisingly deep, and I often found myself laughing and crying along with them. 
 
Enjoyment: It's not too often I can come back ten years later, watch a show, and enjoy it more than I did a decade ago, so Adventure deserves a ten in this department. When the creators said they wanted to make it a show that anyone of any age could enjoy, they were not kidding. 
 
Overall: Very good. Though it is definitely not perfect, due to a fun plot and great characters, it's still worth watching if you've never seen it, and rewatching if you have.

Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine is your typical cute girls playing baseball, the catch?...well the one inspired to make a baseball team in her school played before and she wants to play baseball. The catch is still cliche in some respects but the real problems lies in it's animation but that a bit later. 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters are probably one of it's more stronger elements of the anime so let's start with it's characters. 
 
Tsubasa Arihara voiced by Nozomi Nishida and our main narrative focus is your typical genki leader type character akin to Honoka from Love Live but baseball, she's your all rounder in a sense and one of the main reasons the rest of the cast gravitate towards her and baseball, Ryo Shinonome voiced by Reina Kondo is your typical kuudere but is one of the leading aces in the cast being similar to Arihara in term sof experience but fills in the missing expertise that Arihara lacks, Yuki Nozaki voiced by Saki Minami is your typical ojou-like character and like most of the cast is a newbie to baseball but quickly picks things up, sorta a voice of reason towards the group but is your typical calm, cool headed ojou. Akane Ukita voiced by Yumiri Hanamori is your typical shy girl  and is a catcher for the team but gets sever inferiority complex later. Tomoe Kawakita voiced by Honoka Inoue is Arihara's best friend and ventures with Arihara in forming a baseball team, she gets a bit of development in terms of her and Arihara's friendship and Tomoe wanting to learn without Arihara and this gets into a little bit of drama with Arihara as a result. If there one real flaw towards it's main cast of character is what LA has been saying about every character, ""typical""...or more harsher ""cliche"" but nonetheless Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters is WAY better than it's weak typical plot. 
 
The plot follows Arihara wanting to form a baseball team is the basic template but to add to that, we look into each of the characters, some who come later to actually form the ""9"" in the title and some of the characters developments and ""episodes"" are decent in certain respects, from Tomoe to Akane. Since the plot follows the character development switching formula it goes with the only upside is the formation of the team and learning of any new newcomer to the team but in terms of plot, it's ok once the entire group forms and the anime starts focusing on the character development of the members as well as honing the characters with baseball and later on a tournament in seeing the characters progress sports-wise as a clutch. 
 
LA was suppose to praise this anime but with the next thing coming up, guess not... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation done by TMS Entertainment is probably one of the inconsistent messes of Spring 2019 and shame since the character designs went not derping is one of the best things about the anime. Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation to say with absolute honesty is a derp ridden facial distorted mess of an anime, it's no My SIster My Writer levels, but if there was one full length anime LA watched in Spring 2019 that was this inconsistent and filled with low quality animation derps then Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this. LA doesn't know was TMS Entertainment stretched in animating this and the remake Fruits Basket that Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this bad in the animation department?. Nonetheless as much as LA wanted to praise Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine for it's character designs, it slips quite easily due to it's derpy animation littered throughout the anime. 
 
The voice acting was....decent...seriously was the least interested and ""meh"" element of the anime, expected from a typical cute girls playing sports anime. 
 
With all the flaws seeping out of this anime, LA doesn't outright hate this anime but it wasn't exactly nice going through to this anime to the end to the state it was at from episode 1 and again, this anime wasn't My Sister My Writer terms of derps in terms of it's animation but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine isn't helped by the fact that this anime was adapted from a mobile game and that's where all the flaws now makes MUCH MORE sense (sans animation). 
 
Well LA won't push Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine even more as one of the better dynamics of the anime is the comparison towards Arihara's Satogahama team and the Seijo High's baseball team, budding rival teams that met in a practice game. As Arihara looks more towards having fun with the team and teamwork through her teammates strengths and weaknesses, while Seijo High's captain is more focused on winning and bearing everything on herself in order to win the tournament, it's just kinda too bad that this dynamic only arrives at the finale and is only touched upon.  
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine wasn't exactly the one of the worst animes LA watched in Spring 2019, yes it had a rather typical  underdog sports plot, cliche characters with ONLY saving grace being some of it's character's developments and horrible animation filled with animation derps, nonetheless with all this being said and how much LA beaten this anime with all the criticism that LA levied on it...it was cliche yet harmless, cliche for a sports anime yet harmless what with it's character development of the cast and typical underdog plot. 
 
Nine out of Ten?, pffftt it wishes...nah rather spin that nine 180 degrees.

Or do you need to drive them hard so they improved themselves . Can you coach a team with kindness and understanding, or do you need to be tough and use a whip and forced people to advancement? Well lets find out! Welcome to Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine!!  
 
 
 
 
 
First there where no baseballs teams for females.But girls wants to play as well and are as competent if not even more capable then the men!!  Tsubasa have always love the sport, and one day in the school assembly hall. The student are gathered for a meting and presenting different clubs to join. Tsubasa see her opportunity and bravely takes the floor, even if its a risk she is going to be ridiculed she loudly and proudly announce her love for the sport .And telling the whole school that the baseball club for girls looking for members .This is a epic saga about relationships hardship struggle love and baseball!!  
 
 
 
Story 4/10  
 
 
Not a i big sport fan! And the drama segment in this anime are not impressive .Its way over the top ,scenes that you are suppose to take serious becomes very silly and laughable ,, And that is not what they where after, does drama scenes fails miserably in my book! I was close dropping this anime a couple of time just because of the horrendous drama! But it got better after a while 
 
 
 
Art 6/10 
 
 
Pretty low quality to be honest especially in the beginning but it improves in later episodes. And i'm here for the pretty girls and they are really cute and have a good character design. Akane stand out the most she is just a doll.. She is very adorable and does cat ears suits her tremendously well.So because mostly of the girls I give the art a bit over average in score  
 
 
 
Sound 6/10 
 
 
The music is noting special in that meaning but it works, and are suitable to the scene , I really enjoy the op.Its doesn't stand out but it neither hurt my poor old ears   
 
 
 
Character 10/10 
 
 
And we have our first home-run and not by a little bit the ball goes out all the way to parking lot when its come to the alluring characters. We have everything and more, We have the shy Akane that sometimes are a bit intimidated to speak up, But she always hangs in their she never gives up and she wants to improve herself. We have the leader Tsubasa that wants to win but never sacrifice friendship over it.She is so kind and loving and instead of screaming or being angry she lift her teammates up, by being a gentle and understanding.We have the girl with Asperger's or a light form of autism ,She may have some problems with social situations but her friends love her and she is a part of the team.And she is a lesbian that flirting wildly with another female it's very cute. For me its a monumental plus when they include diversity. I love all my girls! I don't care if they have Asperger's autism or are in a wheelchair or any other form of handicap. They are all beautiful and I cherish and treasure all of them. And I like to see when they include what is not consider to be normal, because they exist and should take part in anime!! 
 
 
 
 
Enjoyment 10/10   Yuri 7/10 
 
 
We have another home-run. I love and adore the girls so much, and with that strong attachment  I having a lot of fun. I got really invested because of the strong pulchritudinous and warm females. I need my girls I need to love them if I do all the rest will fall in place. And I will enjoy the anime and my girls delivers strongly. And I especially enjoys the strong side characters.  Remember one scene in particular ,When unexpectedly a girl wanted to speaks up,, And I know her from a earlier episode and I considerably approve of her , Go ahead Honey! Speak from your heart! What she then said is up to you to find out,But most importantly if a female that I like wish to express herself she is allowed to do so, and I want to hear what she  have on her mind., That's an important aspect for my enjoyment,Really like that this anime take its time with scenes like that .And we also have a lot of flirting and sympathetic females that really love each other , So there definitely existed  some Yuri elements. Which I enjoy greatly  
 
 
 
 
Overall 10/10 
 
 
There where an considerable amount of bad drama and some other problem like the animation. But because of the righteousness females and the good character development I really like this anime. and they included a girl with autism .Its was fun its was delightful  and it was so heartwarming , and to witness the girls grow so much made me both happy and very proud  Akane fought worked suffered and pulled trough .And Tsubasa was a shining star. She didn't back down from her believe and shepherd her team with love and encouragement,  and not treating them badly .Overall it was more about female loving other females. Rather than fierce competition, and if you after an anime with that aspect.  I don't recommend this,, This is a Cut Girls Doing Cute Things show and the rivalry it's rather light. But if you like cute girls mellow anime. I can really recommend this  
 
 
 
I dedicate this review to both Akane and Tsubasa. I can't be more content with them!! 
   
 


          
 
       Helpful this series is the cross between a sports anime (baseball in this case) and an idol series with a heavier emphasis on the idol side. That is not to say it's about singing and dancing but it has the same type of character tropes and situations you would expect from a series like Love Live or something. However it doesn't really make the best use of either genre.  
 
As a sports anime, the drama and tension just isn't their, at least not when it comes to the sport itself. As an idol anime, though it doesn't have the singing and dancing like I said, the characters are a carbon copy. You have the eccentric happy go lucky girl who starts the group with her childhood friend as her support, they come across girls of varying types from the small cute one to the tall serious one and every trope in between. That isn't to say it's bad mind you, it's just predictable. 
 
The story follows your general run of the mill group of girls trying to start a club and eventually, to win nationals. Like i said the only difference between this and an idol show is this group of girls is playing baseball. They recruit members, practice, take on another team that eventually becomes their benchmark and rivals, and eventually play in a tournament. 
 
The art suffers at times with odd face syndrome. I didn't notice it early but there are times when background characters look a little worse for ware. You could tell it didn't have the best budget but they did what they could with what was given to them. 
 
The sound was actually pretty good. I liked the fact they had different sounds for the girls catching balls early on. you could tell just from the pop of the ball which girls were catching the ball with the pocket of the glove and which were not.  This even got mentioned at one point to help one of the girls improve which is a plus for me. 
 
I won't really go into characters since I did already, If you have seen an idol anime you know what to expect. the whole range is here. 
 
Overall the show did grow on me. I had more fun with the last half of the show when the realization of their situation came to a front and they started taking practices and stuff more seriously. This also, ended up bring some nice character development which the show needed. 
 
Overall i did enjoy the show. It had it's ups and downs and would not be the first show i recommend for sports fan, or fans of cute girls doing cute things, but as a quick binge while gaming, I had a good time. I give it a solid 6. Did I mention this has a mobile Gatcha game? you know? like a idol series.  I know i stressed the idol comparison to death but that is exactly the vibe i got from it.

I normally skip movies which are recaps of the anime, but I am glad I watched this one. The ending seemed more complete than that of the second season since it elaborated more on the events after the final battle, leading to an even more heartwarming closure. 
 
Though I would recommend watching the whole movie, there are parts you can skip, if you binge watched the whole anime, unlike those who watched it weekly when it was aired. The first 10 minutes and the last 15-20 minutes have to be watched, since they have new scenes that convey the finale of the anime much better that the ending of season 2.  
 
The movie is a must, if the first and second seasons made you feel miserable. It just means that you didn't pay clear attention to the important details that were mentioned in the anime. I am one of those who felt incomplete, and the movie was just the thing to make me appreciate the anime to the fullest.         
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful EDIT 9/25/18: 
I've gotten some messages regarding people who were slightly confused over this review, so I'd like to clarify something. 
At my time of writing this review, the Lostorage WIXOSS series had only just began airing (literally five days after I wrote and posted the review), and as it hadn't quite been a thing at that point, I want to mention that any mention of the ""WIXOSS series"" in this review is SOLELY directed towards the Selector WIXOSS series, whether it be Infected, Spread, or the Destructed movie. 
Even to this day, I have yet to watch the Lostorage WIXOSS series and currently have no plans to, and the series itself is COMPLETELY unrelated to this review. Sorry if that was confusing to anyone, but this review was written at a time when it didn't exist, so I didn't have any way to know whether or not my usage of specific terms would be confusing within the context of this review. 
 
The rest of the review beyond this line has been untouched; hopefully MAL staff doesn't take my review down for editing it two years later. 
 
Contains spoilers of the first and second seasons (none of the actual movie, however), so read at your own risk. 
 
This will be less of a review of the actual movie and more of a review of the fact that it was a movie. I'll explain that in more detail later. 
 
 
I have every right to believe Selector Destructed WIXOSS was just as good as the second season, and even better than the first. What I don't quite agree with 100%, however, is the fact that it was made into a movie. 
 
Please, do NOT panic when I say this. Don't consider this an automatic dealbreaker if you've seen the first and second seasons and are trying to decide whether you should watch this movie or not. But, about 70% of the movie is recap of the first and second seasons. 
 
This may come off as a bit of a disappointment to some, especially for people like me who had been waiting nearly 8 months since its original February 13th release date in Japan for this movie to be released on BD and subbed. And hell, I'm sure there are MANY other diehard WIXOSS fans who had been watching the entire series weekly since it started airing, and it's felt like a seemingly endless journey waiting for the series to be concluded. However, just in-case you don't understand based purely on my rating, I was the exact opposite of disappointed. 
 
Here's some facts about the state of recap present within Selector Destructed WIXOSS. It gives you just enough to enjoy the movie if you're one of the people who have never seen anything WIXOSS-related and just decided to go out and see the film, but at the same time, doesn't overload you with stuff you already know if you're a returning fan who's already seen the first and second seasons. In its own way, it's a perfect way to bring up more WIXOSS fans. They'll watch the movie, and sure, they'll already know all that happens. But some things that aren't explained in the movie (that, as someone who's seen both seasons, can confirm ARE explained in the TV series) might draw curiosity out of some of the viewers, and cause them to go and watch the first and second seasons. And, with how underrated WIXOSS is, I'm MORE than welcoming to any attempt to draw in more fans. 
 
Why were things done this way? Simple. The entire sequel aspect of this movie comes from things being explained within the actual storyline present within the first and second seasons. 
 
The movie starts out with a bit of a prequel, explaining one of the loose ends I actually audibly spoke about having a problem with within the first season. It continues with more recap, but as the recap continues on, more and more plotlines that perfectly (and I mean PERFECTLY) tie up some other loose ends present within the series are sprinkled within the film, making it feel like a much more fulfilling experience. It, then, ends with a very well-written ending that I couldn't have asked to be any different. 
 
The reason that I don't agree 100% with the fact that this all was turned into a movie is simply because I do think that this all could have just been added into the first and second seasons. The prequel aspect could've been added in a way similar to the psychokinesis scene in Shinsekai Yori, where it seemed random and out of place but as time continued on, you begin to understand it more and more. The rest could've just been placed within the series chronologically, with no problems. And the ending, at the very least, could've been an OVA of the 2nd season. 
 
Let's face it. 70% of a 90 minute movie being recap doesn't sound very appealing, it means that only about an episode's worth of content was actually fresh. To think that that couldn't have been squeezed into a 26-episode multi-cour series is absurd. It's quite obvious that the purpose of the movie was just to milk the series, and bring up more fans of it by forcing them to sit through it in a movie theater in order to watch it. 
 
But, while I did say I don't agree 100% with their choices to do this, does that mean I truly disagree? No, not at all. If their goal of this movie was to milk it by bring up more fans of the series, then I am completely okay with that. It just gives me more WIXOSS to watch, and more people to talk about it with. No problem with that. 
 
So, as for the new content, how good was it? It was nearly flawless when you look at it a certain way. 
 
My biggest problem with the first season was that it only deconstructed aspects of what a majority of the card game sub-genre has been up to now. When I started watching the series, by around episode 3 I was really craving a full deconstruction, but that wasn't what I got. What I got was a story written similarly to Madoka Magica, in how only certain aspects are deconstructed and the rest are left out in the cold. It was definitely still a great series simply because of how well characterized every character was, in addition to how well the story went with what it had to work with, many of the situations being handled really well, and overall great directing. But I was still left a bit underwhelmed. 
 
Then we continue onto the 2nd season, which pretty much fixed every problem I had with the first season. Every single aspect of what makes the card game sub-genre what it is was completely deconstructed in pretty much every possible way. The psychological aspects behind how well developed every character was, the loopholes in the system, the way everything was created. Just everything. I really was amazed, and I didn't really expect such an amazing season out of it. But, here's a fact: there was a reason why I didn't really expect things to go the way they did. You see, while I DID want things to go in a way that completely deconstructs the card game sub-genre, I didn't expect they would because I knew the process of creating a story that did just that wouldn't be easy by any means. It was going to be a heavy load to carry, and I thought it was kind of a miracle that they pulled it off. However, given how heavy of a load it was, things weren't pulled off flawlessly, and there were still quite a few unanswered questions by the end of the 2nd season. So, I thought it was amazing but wasn't quite at the level of being a masterpiece. 
 
Then, we continue on with this movie. Every, and I mean EVERY, single unanswered question, loose end, and confusing plot point was answered flawlessly. What we were given was a completed work, one that showed that everything was planned from the beginning, and how well-written the story was as a whole. The things that were missing from the 2nd season that made me not consider it a masterpiece were present within this movie. Even though I wouldn't consider either a masterpiece, I have every single right to say that the WIXOSS series as a whole is deserving of being called one. 
 
I do want to say that the way things were presented was kind of fun, in its own way. It reminded me a lot of the presentation of the Monogatari series, where everything was aired in non-chronological order and felt a bit like a puzzle, which made it kind of fun. The WIXOSS series, up until the movie, was definitely chronological, and even the movie itself was chronological. But, the fresh content introduced within the movie that wasn't within the first and second seasons wasn't chronological to the first/second seasons. So, it was a bit fun in that regard. 
 
 
And, in the end, the movie really was just about as good as I expected it to be. All my questions were answered, and I end with a fulfilling experience that I think is worthy of being considered one of the best I've ever had with anime before. I don't completely agree with the fact that it was made into a movie, but with everything all said and done, I think it's fine that it was just because I still got to experience everything in a way that was quite close to perfection. 
 
And with that said, I'm done here.

          
 
       Helpful I will straight this movie is not good it is basically a recap of infected and spread, does not service the show well. So watch those first if you plan to watch this. 
 
Now there is a Unique story is in that is Ulith story is of course a character from infected and spread. Is worth watching for that. If they did less recap and more of Ulith story focus I think I would have enjoyed it more, but what I got was still ok. 
 
I don't wanna say anymore but that is what you get with the movie so now you know what you are getting.

His father, Graham, who dislikes all robots, has never truly been supportive of his efforts. That is, until they move to Bubble Town, a city with ""as many robots as people,"" and the location of RobixCorp. The reason for RobixCorp's global success is the EPU (Emotion Processing Unit), which allows a robot to develop their own unique personality, just like a human being.
Now that Connor's dream has finally come true, he finds himself with one really big problem: everyone in Bubble Town owns a robot, except him. Shortly after his arrival, he meets his nosy neighbor Abby, who sends her flying pet robot, Dondon, to spy on him. Graham, being not so fond of a robot spying on him, attempts to capture Dondon. During his escape, he crashes into Connor, knocking him out. A worried Abby, along with Connor, hop onto her hover scooter, rushing for the one place in town that can fix her friend.
Here, Connor meets Hela, who runs a repair shop called The Botties' Pit. However, to become an employee, he has to fix a robot in less than 24 hours. Of all the robots he could have chosen, Connor picks Cubix, a one of a kind test model referred to as the 'Unfixable Robot.' The Botties all tried to repair him, especially Hela, who could never quite throw him out. Cubix is the one memory left of her father, Professor Nemo, who invented the EPU. Sadly, he vanished after an experiment with a highly volatile substance known as Solex.
Suddenly, a rogue robot inventor named Dr. K runs off with a stolen robot, leaving the Botties' Pit on the verge of collapse. Connor races back inside in a final effort to save Cubix, leaving him trapped inside. This act of kindness jumpstarts Cubix's EPU, bringing him back to life. With only a moment to spare, Cubix saves Connor from the collapsing building. It was never a matter of hardware; rather, of heart, that fixed the 'Unfixable Robot'. Therefore, Connor passed the test, earning him a place in the club.
That was not the only surprise Cubix had in store, with his amazing design he can transform into virtually anything. Along with their new friends, Connor and Cubix face up against Dr. K to take back the kidnapped bot.
This series follows the adventures and discoveries of the group, as they unravel Dr. K.'s conspiracy and the disappearance of Professor Nemo.
","Cubix, excuse me, Saiko Robot Kombock is one of the series I obsessed over as a child. I'd flip to Kid's WB at whatever time it was on and make sure I caught every episode. I had every one of the toys (not very many, if I remember) and it was, oddly enough, the show that got me sort of obsessed with mecha. I'm hesitant to say that because I'd already had my fill of Gundam Wing and bootleg copies of G Gundam (how I obtained those as an 8/9 year old is a story for another time) but it made me feel as if I could have a robot of my own.  
 
Knowing a bit about rose-colored glass and all that, I decided to take a crack at this one as an adult. I couldn't remember much about the actual story or the characters as I was really just focused on the robots (read: toys) so this was for all intents and purposes a fresh watching.  
 
I watched a few episodes of the sub before I quit caring and went back to the sub.  
 
Let's start with the animation and models. Even for the time it was just bad. The models quality was inconsistent and it was easy to tell who was not going to be a repeat character. The animations themselves were clunky and it didn't feel as if much effort was put forth. The robots mostly got away with this but the human characters did not feel fluid and felt like robots themselves. I will say that while several look quite generic, many are original and refreshing designs.  
 
The voice acting in both the dub and the sub were horrendous. The mouths didn't even try to match with the audio in either. The acting was over the top and the voices didn't match the characters meaning the antagonist had an overly squeaky voice despite not looking at all that he should.  
 
The story and characters were generic. A generic 'Gary sue' for a lead, his female friend who explains things to drive the story, a smart kid to be used as a McGuffin when the group is stuck in binds, and the lovable dumb oaf. It really could not be more cut-and-paste. Plot development is predictable, even for a children's show. No attempt is made to be original here. It felt like a twisted knockoff of the Mega Man plot but much, much worse. I can't think of what else to say on this, really. Just plain bad. 
 
Overall, the series did not live up to my memory. Everything was bland and just plain awful. This one seems to have been forgotten by most and it deserves to stay that way. I should have left it dead in the past but my curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of any reason for anyone to watch this one in the modern day. Even if you're thinking about it for nostalgia's sake, just don't. 

          
 
       Helpful I haven't done a nostalgia review in a while, and I happened upon Cubix not too long ago- so here we go. 
 
“When a foolproof plan fails, it’s not necessarily proof that the planner himself was a fool, right?” - Dr. K 
 
Preface:  
 
If you were a kid in the late 90s- early 2000s, chances were that you were watching the recently popularized anime Pokemon or Yugioh. A lot of people don't know this, but before Funimation really took off (DBZ was their biggest license prior to acquiring One Piece from 4Kids, and they rescued DBZ from Saban), before Viz Media, before Aniplex America showed up on the scene, you had basically two companies that were licensing the majority of Japanese animation for western audiences: Pioneer/Geneon, and 4Kids.  
 
Nowadays, 4Kids Entertainment is the butt of many jokes and the easy target for  ""bad English dubs"" and censoring, after their mishandling of One Piece and subsequent loss of licenses for a pair of golden eggs: Yugioh and Pokemon.  
However, 4Kids was an important step in shaping the anime licensing and dubbing scene of today. With the smash hit of Pokemon in 1998, then again with Yugioh in 2001, 4Kids proved that not only was there a huge market for children's animation, but that it could be supremely profitable. Back in a time where very few movies series received licensing treatment- let alone TV shows, (which were always niche at best)- 4Kids was paving the way for the aforementioned companies to come.  
 
Now, onto Cubix- a long forgotten and overshadowed production of 4Kids.  
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 1 
 
Starting with the bad: the animation, and boy, is it ever odious. It's that early 2000's 3D CGI that looks so fake, you would rather eat melted down plastic on your pancakes than margarine. Seriously, it's bad. I would rather spoon out my eyeballs, hammer nails into them, dip them in gasoline and light them on fire than watch something with this style of 3D CGI again.  
 
 
Story: 4  
 
Cubix combines the elements of an episodic kids' show with an overarching plotline, mostly to good effect. It doesn't get ultra formulaic like its stablemate Pokemon, and it doesn't get into stupidly long single fight arcs like Yugioh. The basic premise is that the Machiavellian evil Dr. K is attempting to capture an energy source called ""Solex"", which, in a crystallized form, provides a source of nearly unlimited energy with which to power his various robot creations and rule the world. 
 The issue with Solex is that when it manifests, it causes the robot it exists in to go insane and attack people/destroy things, which forms the conflict of the first season. Connor, Abby, Chip, Mong, and Hela are trying to dispose of the Solex so that the robots return to normal, meanwhile, the nefarious Dr. K is foiled time and time again. He even gets blasted off.  
 
 
Characters: 4 
 
Connor and Abby are the pair of protagonists- Connor is the new kid on the block, loyal to a fault, friendship, all that kids' show stuff. Chip is the token nerd kid who quips and makes sarcastic comments, some of which are fairly adult, but mostly just bad puns. Mong is the token fat, strong kid with the temper. Abby is standard fare female protagonist- she helps and contributes, but ultimately everyone falls to the wayside for Cubix, Connor's robot. Cubix is a modular cubic-block robot (wow such naming conventions) that is naturally the hero of the show. He has his own magical girl transformation sequence that's used about 5 times per episode, and transforms into whatever form necessary to defeat the villain of the week, whether it's flying, tunnelling, super OP, or Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann. (I think I just imagined that last one.) 
 
 
Sound: 9 
 
Now, finally, something good. One more thing about 4Kids: they produced some fine voice talent, and while they were employed in-house, similar to how Aniplex does, they were also compensated well for their talents. The names this show has on the credits list reads like an A list Hollywood ensemble of voice acting.  
Connor is voiced by Andrew Rannells, a guy that's made the successful jump from VA to TV and movie acting in some recent NBC productions, but he's of less note than the other main characters. Veronica Taylor (Ash in Pokemon) voices Abby, and sounds fantastic as usual; her counterpart Rachael Lillis, also of Pokemon fame voices Hela, the engineer and repair lady.  
Dan Green, of Yugioh fame voices the robo-hating, angry dad character.  
The late Maddie Blaustein nearly reprises her role as Meowth in Dr. K, the squeaky, scheming villain who seems to be equal parts Dr. Robotnik and Team Rocket. My personal favorite, Megan Hollingshead, also appears as Raska, the self important, arrogant TV star. 
Lastly, they even got the Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin himself to do a role as the bogan (Aussie slang for redneck) robot, Kan-it. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 7  
 
The question is not ""did I enjoy Cubix as a story with characters and a cohesive plot"", but rather, ""did I enjoy Cubix for what it is""? and the answer to that is yes. As far as a kid's show goes, Cubix is absolutely run of the mill generic, and completely forgettable. Even as far as being a production of 4Kids, it's been largely forgotten in favor of much more important and big shows like its stablemates Pokemon and Yugioh. Cubix wasn't important enough to remain relevant, not to mention that it's not even Japanese!  
 
What I liked about Cubix was how this cast of voice actors that have gone on to do awesome things later were together on this little, long abandoned show for just a few months, 12 years back in my childhood. I watched it as a kid, and maybe I enjoyed it then, I don't remember. Now, I'm viewing it with a different perspective and am still finding things to like, and I have 4Kids to thank for that- not to mention what they did for the industry, of which Cubix is just a microscopic part.  
 
 
Overall: 5 
 
Recommend? 
 
If obscure 4Kids licenses with good Voice Actors and the occasional one liner geared towards adults appeal to you, this will be right up your alley.

","I'm going to keep this review short and simple to give the reader insight about the anime .  
 
 
General overview : 
This anime ( movie ) is based on Manhua that goes by the name Feng Yun . Story is held in ancient China and is all about kung fu . So if someone is into watching kung fu or some good Majestic Martial arts , this is the anime . By Majestic martial art , i mean martial arts that involve super natural abilities and Ki ( Qui ) energy .   
 
Story : 7 
Story development is just fine . It is good enough to make the non busy viewer stick to seat and complete the movie . It have some very good fight scenes and little bit of romance . 
 
Art : 9  
Art is just great .You can observe the movement of clothes due to wind , light effects during fight ( fights are flashy ) . Scenic beauty is amazing. 
Everything is detailed .  
 
Sound : 7 
Language of the original movie is not Japanese ( I'm not sure if it's Korean or Chinese ) , so otaku's might find it difficult to watch it . Sound effects are good . It have great sound for everything it shows , example movement of water , air , Kung fu background music . What it lacks is music that feels and touches the heart !!! 
 
Character : 8 
Main characters are very cool looking . Characters have sense of honor and are little series type .  
 
Overall : 7  
 
I would actually give it 7.5 rating .Movie is enjoyable if you are looking for Adventure , Martial arts , expect anything else , it will be in your dropped list .

Celsia is cursed into the form of another animal this time. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","Elf Hunters seek five spell fragments that have been placed on the skin of elves, similar to tattoos, throughout the magical world they have been transported to. When they find them, they will be able to return to Japan.
The Elf Hunters travel by means of a Type 74 tank, which has been transported to the magical world with them.
The reaction of various elves as the team attempts to strip them naked is a primary basis for much of the show's humor, and are more ridiculous than suggestive. The series is also known for breaking the fourth wall, mostly from Junpei.
","Those who hunt elves is basically just a show about running gags. It has no aim other than to make people laugh with fantasy parodies and pop culture references. 
 
The very idea of the show is rather odd considering the cast being nothing like or even comparable to each other. After watching the firsts season of those who hunt elves i really hadn't even given it a second thought and started watching season two. It just grows on you after a bit and you cant help but liking it at least a little. 
 
I cant really say there is a favorite character for this series they all are pretty equal since the show actually divides the screen time fairly well. The characters are pretty two dimensional and there is not much to them once you know there role that's all they really are. Interestingly enough this does not bother me like it does other shows that try to keep some semblance of a plot. This one has a simple plot where your just along for the ride to laugh when silly and random things happen. 
 
The art and sound is all done very simplistically and in a older art tone. I don't have much compliments or negative comments about it. I really watched this more for the enjoyable humor. The show really is just a medium for jokes and i can appreciate it.  
 
The only thing that i could say to sum this up is don't take the show very seriously cause it doesn't. The show knows what it is and never tries to be something its not.

          
 
       Helpful Even though the second season of ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" doesn't seem all that different from the first, I found it a lot more entertaining, and not just in a so-bad-it's-entertaining kind of way (though there's a bit of that too). I'm not sure whether this is because the second season is better executed, or whether I just became more tolerant of anime humour by the time I got around to watching it. Maybe a bit of both. 
 
Whatever the reason is, it's safe to say that I found ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" considerably funnier, in particular the abuse-filled exchanges between Celcia and Junpei. The stories seem better too - even though it's essentially same thing as the first season, the episodics seem more imaginative and interesting. It also feels like there's even less serious content than the first season, which is good because the first season fell flat on its face on the occasions when it tried to be more serious. This isn't to say the plot doesn't have its problems, a glaring one being the lack of urgency on the part of the protagonists, which totally contradicts the events that led up to the second season. The ending was also poor, and was in fact so meaningless that I'd struggled to remember what happened within a couple of weeks of watching it. In addition to its own problems, ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" also inherit some of the senseless problems of the first series, such as Junpei continuing to strip elves in the most crude manner possible and the others making no attempt to persuade him otherwise. 
 
While ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" retained the general feel of the original, there were some small changes here and there: the episode titles now have a common theme; they introduced this adorable teddy bear who doubles up as a kind of mascot for the series, which worked pretty well; there's also the addition of a bizarre but strangely funny line at the end of each next-week-preview clips, but it only really works when Junpei says it. Oh, and they've added a new combination of open/ending themes. The new opening is nothing to write home about, but the new ending theme is great. 
 
""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" may satisfy the conventional goals of a good sequel - building and improving upon its predecessor - but the first season was so far from being good that this second season needed to improve a lot to be considered good itself. Unsurprisingly, it falls short. It's funny at times, but not consistently so; it's better, but still suffers from too many of the original's problems. It's an example that, no matter how much you decorate and polish a turd, it's still just a turd. 

          
 
       Helpful Wow… this is, um, different. It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over. Hoe a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he is the worst I have really ever seen. And Airi is so high and mighty about being a actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well. Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2 and really give a whole lot. 
 
The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously. 
 
The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I love the dub since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script sometimes. The voices though don’t sound very good. They seem more like Bible Black.

I get that it is essentially an add for Murphy's Stout (which essentially explains the absolute lack of story and character), but I do believe that something should be emphasized on why this anime has a certain appeal to it. 
 
For a start, I actually liked the art style - for a 60 second anime made in 1997, it actually is really well thought out and certainly stands strong even after the 19 years since its first release. The same goes for sound - the way each samurai enters the bar and the overall ambience they make just to get a stout (combined with the retro cyborg feel that these samurai were aiming for) makes this a unique ad as well as anime, to say the least. 
 
In hindsight, its an ad, but one which makes me want to have stout. Its nostalgic, well drawn, and the sound makes it hold strong even now.

          
 
       Helpful This is basically an advertisement for Murphy's Irish Stout, and its incidents are just as the synopsis says. 
However, it is an excellent ad which relays a strong atmosphere of a post futuristic megalopolis setting. The cyberpunk apocalyptic scenario along with its excellent design, superb choreography and smooth animation makes a very enticing experience for the eyes while an exciting music playing in the background. Production I.G. nailed it. And it ends it with an interesting unpredictable ending that serves like a cherry over a tasty cupcake. 
It delivers an interesting view of a futuristic world. There's not much to say about this 19 years old ad of 60 seconds. It perfectly does its job and is interesting to watch.

In order to do so, he must first gain the love and trust of the last of the Yappie, the ancestral guardians of Slaffeaze. This is a task that will take more than a little courage and daring, for the last Yappie is not just a cute young female, she`s also a dragon. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']",none,"As soon as the OVA begins, we're directly shown Taku warped to Slaffleaze world a la Escaflowne. We're not even introduced to him beforehand, way to go for main cast characterization. Besides, it's a chronic problem with this format. I found myself not caring at all for characters like Dr. Garetti. This Magikoopa lookalike is so bland I question his legitimacy in the plotline after watching Capricorn. Was he useful ? After all, Taku and Mona simply put infinity anchor out-of-order without his help even if we're told he's the only one able to do it. The supporting cast isn't particularly detestable or likable, they just lack too much screentime for viewers to relate, so fine, they're all cardboard cutouts to say the least. A special mention to Zolba whom reminds me a coolass Dragon Ball villain, too bad he simply suffers the generic evil conqueror syndrome... By the way, his death is only implied. We don't even get a final confrontation between him and the heroes!  
Overall, the story is too much generic to not be forgettable. It was rushed with deus-ex machina devices along to make plot advance. 
 
Art wise, it feels like character-designer went to work after a streak of Hayao Miyazaki's Sherlock Holmes episodes (excuse me to channel his name in vain, but it was the first thing popping in my mind while digesting it). It was alike, albeit lifeless and uninspired. Apart of that, main cast design looks dated like a mid-eighties OVA, it's hardly acceptable if you compare it for example with Silent Mobius movie released the same year... 
I'm not particularly compelling about animation in general, so I'd say it's pretty decent in my book. 
 
The music, unfortunately, is like the rest: it's your token fantasy score thrown in for good measure. If you ask me to whistle away one song I wouldn't be able to make it. It's a bad sign. 
 
All in all, there are very few redeeming qualities to that title. I liked the mere idea to see squads of hominoid armored dragons in action but without a strong background behind it, I can't help but being only remotely interested.

Gunvolt, the main character who has the power of Sevens, used to be in Feather, a resistant group who fought against the Sumeragi Group. The story begins with meeting the heroine, Sian. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.
The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.
Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.
After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.
However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.
","*THIS'LL BE A SHORT ONE* 
 
Azure Striker Gunvolt is a beloved action platformer series that has spawned two games, with more probably on the way in the upcoming years. From the footage I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun. Since the franchise has been a success, it would pretty much be inevitable for someone to make an anime to either adapt or promote the games. I'm not sure how fans will react to this OVA, but I'm not impressed by it. Some of you might bemoan me for ripping on a glorified advertisement for a video game, but that didn't stop us last month when tearing up Fate/Grand Order: First Order, and it certainly didn't stop us from obliterating Mars of Destruction or Skelter+Heaven. Now, is it as bad as those few? Oh, hell no! It would be a sin to put this in the same ball park as the latter two abominations from yesteryear, and it's not as ridiculously bad as the former title either. Even still, when compared to other OVA promo prequels for beloved video games (like Megaman X's ""Day of Sigma), this OVA falls flat. This is coming from the perspective of a newbie that is planning on getting into the series, so maybe fans of the games will have a better time with this one than I did. So, why didn't this electrify me in the slightest? Well, let's find out, shall we? 
 
STORY: 3/10 
 
Basically, this is the story of how an adept, named Gunvolt, saved an adept by the name of Joule, with the framing decide being that Joule remembers being saved 6 months prior (how did she remember the stuff she wasn't there for? Did Gunvolt tell her? Dunno.). It's all basically a search and destroy mission and a generic OVA. Gunvolt breaks in, gets caught, has a poorly placed and poorly excecuted flashback, kicks some ass, finds the ""core"" that he needs to destroy, goes AWOL because it's the hero way and because he can relate to his target, and kicks more ass before getting kicked out. There's not much too it really. If the story was written tightly around that, with no asspulls, deus ex machinas, or any of that, this would be perfectly fine. However, specifically involving Gunvolt's fight with an adept by the name of Marik, and even before that, that proves to not be the case.  
 
In said fight, Gunvolt powers up out of nowhere, and he gets helped by an unknown sniper who isn't even seen by the end of this (unless there is context in the game to prove that it was someone we know), all in the middle of a generic and boring fight scene. This was clearly made for fans, as they make no attempt to explain much about anything here, leaving newbies, such as myself, in the dark. It all ends on a lazy advertisement of what's to come in the games, as was the case with the other glorified ad anime that came out recently. All of this may seem too benign for a 3, but, in 21 minutes, it stacks up really quickly, and with no flavor or anything to really mitigate the damage. Oh, we also see his rival, Copen, randomly because of course we have to shoehorn the rival character to advertise him. Maybe it was him who fired the shot? He hates adepts, so, why didn't he help kill the enemy adept? We'll never know. Well, let's move on. 
 
CHARACTERS: 4/10 
 
Another reason this OVA was boring was due to its characters. I understand that in 21 mintes, it's hard to really sell a cast of characters, especially when it's an adaptation of a video game, but shows like Steins;Gate have proven that to be possible, making us love the cast by the end of episode 1. Everyone feels stale and generic, but not stupid or excessively generic. It's a lukewarm cast with a lukewarm hero (Gunvolt, who I'm sure is more interesting in the games), damsel in distress (Joule), and Gunvolt's now ex-organization, QUILL, and Nova, the headmaster of the evil organization, The Sumeragi Group. There mainly there just for the sake of putting them in this scenario to advertise the game, and it shows since almost none of them have a personality that goes beyond the basic archetypes. 
 
ART: 7/10 
 
Gunvolt was animated by ""LandQ studios"", and they did an alrigt job, even with the borderline ""generic LN"" character designs. It really shines when they animate some concert scenes with Lumen, the pop idol who just so happens to be an extension of Joule. Everywhere else, it's merely ok; even by OVA standards, this isn't anything notably impressive. The combat is mediocre but not poor, and I'm glad they kept the mechanics from the game in check (unlike some adaptations out there). It's decently animated by a relatively unknown studio, and that's all we care about for this section. 
 
SOUND: 4/10 
 
There really isn't anything special about the background OST aside from the pretty decent Lumen songs. They make a good backdrop to whatever goes on, even if there is nothing else that has any real merit (like a sense of memorability). As for the dub, it's really bad. Given that it came out the same time as the sun, it makes some semblance of sense, but Space Dandy has the same scenario and, from what I've heard, it has a great dub, so what's Gunvolt's excuse? Everyone sounds like they're just reading their lines from a script instead of actually acting, and it really shows. For 2017 standards, that is unacceptable. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 4/10 
 
All in all, this was a very dull advertisement OVA. Nothing really tried to stand out, and it was all middling and lukewarm. The dialogue was also meh, as was the fighting. Nothing felt like it was really trilingual to entertain, and it's a shame. Still, at least it wasn't excruciatingly boring, but it was dull nonetheless. That's all there is too it, aside from one funny like about Marin complaining about Gunvolt's actions and lines sounding like a generic hero. 
 
OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 42/100 
 
There's not much left to say here. It's a boring OVA that, while meant to make us interested in the franchise, probably succeeds better at giving a small treat to existing fans than drawing new ones in. It doesn't do anything interesting or play it's events up in a way that is fun, but at least it's not as bad as some of its earlier contemporaries. Still, it's not one of the better ones if it's kind out there. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.

          
 
       Helpful Gunvolt, a game that I've watched the walk through for because I do not have the money to buy it on eshop. I don't even know how to put money on eshop. I absolutely loved the game and I was even more excited for the anime. But there are things that they should of done to improve it. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Compared to the game itself, it mostly showed the very beginning. This leads me to disappointment as I was expecting a lot more than just the beginning. If they were targeting people to go play the game, they did a good job. To gunvolt fans who waited forever hit the dust as it was just about the beginning. In a story, there is a beginning, middle and end. We have one thing but where is everything else!?! 
 
Art: 8 
 
I really liked the art style in this episode. It really gives that spark. Especially when the blue lighting kind of flashes. Sadly when it came to a long battle. The portals kind of confused me. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
It was pretty decent. It did give energy, especially to the ones who have played the game as the song is recognisable but it was mostly all lumen. I know there is more music then that. Especially during the fight. What could of made it better is some dramatic fight music! 
 
Character: 4 
 
Where the heck is the character build!?! Yes, I know that it's hard to do something like that in 21 minutes. I bet anyone that has watched this and is basically new are wondering what is QUILL's main objective, what is the sumeragi and how many are they, what is an adept? If they did a whole series. It would give them time to build up more character in not just the main character but the supporting also. I'm betting right now that first timers only remember 2 names and it's pretty obvious what those names are. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
I really enjoyed it. What I never expected was Gunvolt wearing glasses and all that normal attire. It just gives fangirls a squeal. Like I said before, it was quite confusing with all the portals. Although I did really hate that it was only available on eshop. It would of reached far if the good quality was available for other devices. 
 
Overall: 6 
 
I enjoyed this one short episode. I believe it would of been better to have it as a series than a 21 minute video. There was so much left out just by doing one episode. Like Danganronpa. It started as a game. It had a 13 episode series which not only attracted people to play it but also to play the sequel and other games in the DanganRonpa franchise. Other than that, I liked it! 
 
I hope you find this helpful

          
 
       Helpful Armored Blue Gunvolt or Azure Striker Gunvolt would be an awesome anime series. All of it the story, art, sound and characters match the game so well.

These ratings are based on MAL /10 guidelines (1 being ""Appalling"" 10 being ""Masterpiece"" etc) 
 
Genius Party - Clearly meant to be an introduction for the longer films in Genius Party, this short of the same name somehow manages to become repetitive in its measly five minutes runtime. There is some pretty good art and animation but overall it never becomes too interesting. It seems like something I won't remember watching in a week. 5/10 
 
Shanghai Dragon - Fun to watch. Great action scenes. Touching story. 8/10 
 
Deathtic 4 - I don't know language they are speaking. 5/10 
 
Doorbell - With something like this everything hinges on how the ending of the film presents itself. It presents itself pretty well. 7/10 
 
Limit Cycle - I really don't understand this one at all. Although to be fair I gave up listening to the voice-over about half way through. There are some nice visuals present but I could never hope to decipher what they mean. 4/10 
 
Happy Machine - Like Shanghai Dragon, this short film is great fun to watch all the way through. Unlike Shanghai Dragon, Happy Machine has much less conventional storytelling and there is no dialogue present. It doesn't really need these things to be enjoyable however and the ending is like a cherry on top. 7/10 
 
Baby Blue - A fantastic roller coaster of a story that manages to stay believable and immersive throughout in spite of the ridiculous events that take place. In the 14 minutes this piece encompasses it managed to make me feel a more varied range of emotions than most full length anime series. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Since Genius Party is a compilation anime with no overarching connection, I'll post what I thought about each one in the order of my favorites. 
 
7. Limit Cycle 
This one was really bizarre. This is the longest short at about 18 minutes, but struck me as the worst of the whole thing. Basically a man made out of static and moving motifs goes on a very long, fast paced speech about.... literally nothing. Usually if I see someone say something attempted to sound complicated but falls under its own weight I don't believe them, but I see this as one of those cases. The man talks about a variety of philosophical, religious, sexual, and biblical topics with absolutely no context, all in one stream. This must have been a nightmare to sub, it was almost a nightmare to watch as well. Maybe the point of this short went completely over my head, I wouldn't put it past me, but if you are expecting any kind of explanation of what is going on or any kind of basic premise on which your interpretation can be based on, you will not find it in this short. If I had to guess optimistically, the point was to be as chaotic and nonsensical as possible, in order to make some sort of ""sentence-art"" phenomenon to go on. This would work out well with the visuals, which are extremely spectacular, both technically and creatively speaking. A variety of colorful motifs and symbols take up the screen most of the time, and it is cool to see. Not enough to make the short itself fun though, unlike in the Genius Party opening short. 
 
6. Doorbell 
This short also struck me as weaker than the rest. The premise revolves around college student looking man, who finds himself unable to walk into places or houses because a specter of himself is already in the house, and no one can see him. This sounds strange on paper, its also strange on screen. Although this short is about 13 minutes, it still felt a bit too long. At least half of the short revolved around the nameless main character walking around town, which isn't exactly a technical marvel or art style or animation I might add. In the end it was rather boring because of this, as well a premise that didn't interest me. The climax obviously carries some deeper meaning, and I won't reveal exactly what it is just in case some are reading the review without seeing it. My interpretation is that the young man is either bipolar, or it has something to do with how people put on different faces and sub-personalities based on their environment. Definitely not strong on that though, as it was an ambiguous climax. I wouldn't watch this one a second time. 
 
5. Shanghai Dragon 
The theme of this short is the imagination of children, and the premise is a young chinese boy acquires a futuristic device that allows him to create basically anything using it like chalk, that is he makes a drawing out of something with it on the ground and it comes into reality. Overall I was mixed with this one. Unlike Doorbell or Limit Cycle, I never got bored while watching it, but I wasn't stunned by anything either. The theme of children's imagination conquering the evil robot overlords was cool but, when you think about it, all of these Genius Party shorts already have a theme on imagination to begin with. The visuals definitely had a style to them, but it wasn't a very unique style like the one used in Deathtic 4. The action and chase sequences were both very fun to watch, as well as the finishing scene were the boy powers up into his imaginative toku suit of armor to fight evil. Again, didn't blow me away but its just another addition to the compilation, and is good variety in retrospect. Cool crayon art stuff on some scenes. Salute to Sai and his cuban cigars. 
 
4. Baby Blue  
This short is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the well known director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. A high school student asks a girl to skip class with him and go somewhere. The girl agree and they head off, all the while small talking and reminiscing a little bit. It turns out they don't really know where they are going, but eventually decide they want to make a turn for the beach, and off they go. Baby Blue features very hushed voice acting, which gives off a subtle feel compared to the rest of the compilation, and the banter between the two really complimented the atmosphere well. This isn't one of those shorts that tries to hit you over the head with symbolism, its just kind of a simple story that I can't really describe much further without spoiling, but it works well. There were some funny scenes too, most notably the part where they were intercepted by the bike cop. Bike cop had a cool voice too, good audio experience indeed. I liked the ending too. Another good short and a nice quiet anime to compliment with the crazy action of some of the other shorts. Besides that, not much else to say about this one. 
 
3. Genius Party (short) 
This is the titular short of the compilation, the first of the pack in order, and also the shortest at around 5 minutes. It is similar to Limit Cycle in where, you really don't know what the hell is going on. That is to say the events that transpire are without any form of context are background information. Big difference though, it isn't 18 minutes long and full of monotonous nonsense. Instead, its an explosive piece of animation, with awesome art style and spectacular choreography to boot. Everything is colorful and complimentary, it is a huge visual and audio presentation and a great way to start off the short. An animation explosion is what it is. It's so short you could watch it on youtube in a few minutes so I won't say whats going on in the short besides theres these really happy rocks and they love to dance. Great anime. 
 
2. Deathtic 4 
CGI oh no! The CGI is really cool though because it has something many CGI anime lack, and that is detail to the art. Usually because CGI isn't meant to look like art i.e drawings in the first place, thats for the modern traditionally animated anime. This short features a bunch of zombie dudes trying to send a frog who fell into zombie land through a tornado in the sky or something (Uzu Uzu.) They get embroiled in some shit on the way. Plot is straightforward. Fantastic art though seriously, its like some kind of woodcut style thing. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the style of the background and the art. The style was particularly cool, everything is dead and zombieish, character designs fit the bill and they are all very unique. Props to the zombie police and Posse. This was one of the most entertaining shorts for me, mostly due to the reasons above, I really like when the shorts feature experimental animation or art or cool design, this one has all three. Details on the CGI, its basically like the characters themselves are computer generated, but they have a caricature style that you usually don't see in CGI anime, although you see it in western CGI alot. The backgrounds were mostly drawn in though. Anyways its a short with a simple premise but its unique because of some really funny scenes and cool style. Also all of the characters speak in some kind of bizarre, incomprehensible Scandinavian/Russian which only adds to the out of worldness of the environment. 
 
1. Happy Machine 
This was my favorite short in the compilation, and is directed by one of my favorite directors, Yuasa Masaaki who directed Kaiba, Kemonozume, and The Tatami Galaxy. If you had to relate this short to anything complete he has worked on, it would be Kaiba. In a sense, Happy Machine is a visual prototype for the style and the atmosphere featured in full on Kaiba. The visuals and the design of characters, creatures etc. are very unique, in fact they are my favorite of the entire short, even more so than in Deathtic 4. I love how chaotic and enjoyable the director can make a short with such a simple premise that it goes without words, but will go with words for the sake of the review: A baby is taken care of in a bizarre machination of a day care center, only to leave it on a combination of impulse and accident, and ends up venturing out in a world that really doesn't have any laws of physics to speak of. The short is made up of several main scenes, like parts where the baby encounters a flame who burns his crackers, and riding a gigantic horse plant thing. It is not reliant on detail to add to the experience, instead more so on really cool atmosphere, music, and funny scenes. This is a kind of anime that you can just turn your brain off too and go wide with wonder, kind of like the baby. I wonder if this was the intention. Happy Machine has a theme about the cycle of life that only really makes sense at the end of it. It is really entertaining, an animation and style experiment that eventually matured into Kaiba, which was also one of my favorite anime. A great one to watch with friends.

          
 
       Helpful I'll keep this simple. I'll give a rating for each short then an overall rating. 
 
1. Genius Party - 8 
2. Shanghai Dragon - 9 
3. Deathtic 4 - 4 
4. Doorbell - 5 
5. Limit Cycle - 1 
6. Happy Machine - 8 
7. Baby Blue - 10 
 
Simply put, Genius Party had a great start and ending (obviously Baby Blue and Shanghai Dragon being the standouts), but a bad middle (with Limit Cycle being the worst). If you are planning to watch this then please skip Limit Cycle it's awful, I can't stress that enough. Overall this was a good anthology series that I would recommend simply for the experience alone. 
 
Overall Rating - 7

13,123,51,7.82902063273761,story with the main character transported to another world,Fushigi Yuugi,"While visiting the National Library, junior-high students Miaka Yuuki and Yui Hongo are transported into the world of a mysterious book set in ancient China, ""The Universe of The Four Gods."" Miaka suddenly finds herself with the responsibility of being the priestess of Suzaku, and must find all of her celestial warriors for the purpose of summoning Suzaku for three wishes; however, the enemy nation of the god Seiryuu has manipulated Yui into becoming the priestess of Seiryuu. As enemies, the former best friends begin their long struggle to summon their respective gods and obtain their wishes... 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Martial Arts', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","The series describes the various trials of Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, two middle-school students. While at the library one day, Miaka and Yui encounter a strange book known as The Universe of the Four Gods. Reading this book transports them into the novel's universe in ancient China. Yui is transported back to the real world almost immediately, but Miaka finds herself the Priestess of Suzaku. Miaka is destined to gather the seven Celestial Warriors of the god Suzaku in order to summon Suzaku and obtain three wishes. She falls in love with the Celestial Warrior Tamahome, who eventually reciprocates and Miaka's desire to use a wish to enter the high school of her choice begins to shift towards finding a way to be with Tamahome. Yui is also drawn into the book when she tries to help Miaka to come back to the real world; becoming the Priestess of Seiryuu, working against Miaka out of jealousy over Tamahome and revenge for the humiliation and pain she had suffered when she first came into the book's world.
","This anime is a bit old but it rivals (is as good as) any romance anime I've watched till now. 
 
Miaka, main character- attractive, cute, honest, caring but annoying, is sucked into an ancient book and found herself in plenty of trouble. Well first, she falls in love with Tamahome. Somehow, Miaka is so hot that even the Emperor is in love with her LOL:) There are some love triangles going on, adding spice to the story. 
 
The (Suzaku) warriors are slowly revealed in an interesting manner. Each has their own tale and attractive personalities. I would say my favourite is Tatsuki- because he adds a lot of comedy besides looking soo hot. Also, he initially was rough and sort of a bad guy. Other than Tamahome, he seems to have actual character depth and development out the the 7 warriors. 
 
For the Seiryu warriors, my favourite are the twins. The really livened up the story. As you know, Miaka's best friend, Yui became the priestess of Seiryu and so became enemies with Miaka. However, you'll have to watch the anime to find out why Yui went over to the dark side:)  The real bad guy here is Nakago of course- he is smart and manipulative. However, you'll feel sorry for him when you learned of his tragic past. 
 
Since this anime's setting is in ancient China, the surroundings and clothings will be of that. Think Chinese temples, emperors, etc. Each warrior also has a Chinese character on his forehead. Ironically, the villian Nakago's character represents 'heart' ,while the protagonist Tamahome's character means 'demon'. 
 
The story is compelling as it is not the usual 'fight the bad guy, save the world type'. A very important part of the story (other than romance) is about friendship. It is really touching to know after all the bad things Yui did, Miaka still forgives her and retain their frienship. 
 
Overall, the story is great and entertaining. There is a fair bit of fight scenes but violence is kept to a minimum. Lots of drama and suspense moments.  
A word of caution: Miaka and Tamahome will proclaim their eternal love for each other multiple times throughout the anime. Translation: there will be a lot of kissing, hugging, etc. Most of the time it's sweet and cute though:) 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Its almost impossible for me to express how much I love this anime just in a review... This anime was and is very inspirational! The plot had me beyond the edge of my seat! The characters are all so colorful and different, they make you laugh and make you cry. Speaking of crying, I could raise the sea level back up with the amount of tears I shed for this anime. But I laughed so hard at so many of the scenes! Every second of this INCREDIBLE anime was worth while! I'd say that this anime has all the elements of what makes a great anime great. The story line is just so unbelievably addicting!!! I might sound a bit over enthusiastic but you know how (almost) every anime fan has that one anime that they just go crazy for? This is mine. And oh my gawd am I CRAZY for it. :) WATCH IT!!!

          
 
       Helpful Fushigi Yuugi was one of the cartoon shows I watched in AXN when I was a kid. It was fun to watch but now I'm older, I have a different perspective. The art and animation was ok. The fighting scenes are ok as well but the problem lies within the main character of the show. 
 
Miaka Yuki: 
 
She is greedy, stupid, coward, crybaby. Everytime when she wants to rescue Yui, she always thinks of Tamahome. She keeps saying ""Tamahome! Tamahome!"" many times until I got tired of it. Just like characters keep saying the name of a person who he or she loves like Yuka Minase from 11eyes, Orihime Inoue from Bleach. She also becomes vulnerable in situations and becomes the damsel in distress. She always do not want to accept the difficulties in life and she easily cries all the time. 
 
I really just don't understand why the characters like Miaka. 
 
So because of her, she screwed the whole show for me and I am not going to watch it again. As a note, I really hate whiny and crybaby anime characters like her. If you enjoy the series, that's cool. But I just couldn't dwell in it.

On his first day in the game, newcomer Haseo thinks he has made some friends to quest with. However, as if mocking his sentiments, they kill his character just for fun. Luckily, he is saved by a mysterious, one-armed player named Ovan who offers to show him around The World.  
 
Alongside Ovan and his cleric friend Shino, Haseo enjoys a wonderful first year in the game. But this peaceful life is shattered when Shino's character is killed by a familiar figure notoriously known as Tri-Edge, whose victims have all fallen into comas in the real world. In a fit of rage, Haseo vows to find the elusive Tri-Edge and kill him. 
 
Taking place during Haseo's first year in The World,  .hack//Roots  explores the friendships Haseo built in the game before Tri-Edge ripped them away. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Sci-Fi']",""".hack//Roots"" follows the tale of Haseo, a black 'Adept Rogue'(a class that can use multiple types of weapons) and member of the ""Twilight Brigade"", a small guild created within ""The World R:2."" In the year 2015, the CC Corporation's building burned down, and with it, most of the existing data for ""The World."" By splicing in data from what would have potentially been another game with what remained of ""The World"" after the fire, CC Corp. created ""The World R:2"" and released it in 2016, which is when the anime takes place. The main revisions in this release were that the game allowed for guild and PvP (player vs player) play.
Haseo logs into The World R:2 for the first time and falls victim to the PKers (player-killers) that reside within the game. He is saved by Ovan, who prompts him to join the Twilight Brigade alongside Sakisaka, Tabby and Shino, who are in search of finding ""The Key of the Twilight."" However, a popular guild named ""TaN"" obstructs the Twilight Brigade in its mission and is attempting to obtain Ovan's unique character data. The Twilight Brigade has discovered special items, known as 'Virus Cores', and believed them to be the path to finding ""The Key of the Twilight"" and went to find them all. Once the Twilight Brigade had acquired all 6 cores, the guild headed out to use them in one of the ""Lost Ground""s, after figuring out that the two were connected to one another.
However, the group discovers that this was all a trap laid by the members of TaN in order to capture Ovan. With Ovan gone and no sign of the Key of the Twilight, the Twilight Brigade disband and previous members, such as B-set and Gord, quit the game entirely. Soon after, Shino is killed within the game by a mysterious PKer named ""Tri-Edge"". This somehow puts her into a coma in the real world, which devastates Haseo. Haseo then begins training in order to get strong enough to defeat Tri-Edge and save Shino from her real-life coma. Through this ordeal, Haseo becomes obsessed with power and ends up as a Player-Killer-Killer(PKK), in an effort to find information on Tri-edge. When Haseo competes in a special event that promises a special reward, he gains a new power, but his mind is corrupted and he begins to kill PKers with yet more aggression, gaining him the title of ""The Terror of Death.""
","Honestly, out of all hack. series, this one is in my opinion the best one. Characters had more development compared to others. The story was enjoyable too, even if a bit boring at times. I especially liked later episodes, but I won't be spoiling the plot here. And while I'm here, I just want to say that music in this deserves more attention than people give it credit. At least to me. The worst thing among all of this was probably the animation. Because of how much it lacked, action and overall joy were the ones that got hurt the most. Any action sequence seemed bland because of the stiff movement and poor perspective. I'm not throwing garbage at style in general though, it was okay. 

          
 
       Helpful I have seen this anime before not too long ago 
and I must say that he is one of my favorites. 
The reasons are the following: 
The story is a really cool invention 
This is about ""The World"" an online game world with 
a virus in him. 
There you meet the players, playing ""The World"" 
like a MMORPG. 
One problem is perhaps that it can be difficult 
to understand the backgrounds of this world, 
if you do not have all the parts to. / / hack saw. 
I was fascinated by this series because it is a complex 
Anime, with a deep background story 
which brought me to, even the other parts of. hack / / 
to look. 
The openings and endings are very well made and beautifully set to music, 
the characters from the mid-series change their appearance, 
perhaps bring a little bit more momentum to the story. 
Humor and excitement are here were also quite well distributed, 
loosens up the series. 
All in all a horny anime.

          
 
       Helpful Okay so if you haven't seen any of the .Hack series or played the game you will be confused.....very confused. Yes the con you on buying the games to know more of the story...so it goes.... .Hack//Sign, .Hack//Dusk, The Games -&gt; .Hack//Infection, .Hack//Mutation, .Hack//Outbreak, .Hack//Quarantine, .Hack//Fragment (Not released in the US), Then .Hack//Roots...then after .Hack//Roots comes the other GU games if you want to know more X3. 
 
Story 
 
The story is what you could call a continuation when i first saw .Hack//roots i was a bit confused on what was going on until i ran into spoilers then it kind of all made sense. So yeah reading the manga's and playing the games can help you understand  the story. What i love about the .Hack series is it all connects together as a whole so  .Hack//roots is just another chapter added to the story. The plot is seireus and interesting it just makes you want to know more on the Twilight about Haseo and everything. It has a mysterious feel you just want more but with all .Hack series there all have that feel. 
 
Art 
 
I love the art in .Hack//Roots its very detailed in the backgrounds and the structure of the characters. I didn't really feel anything unique about it just that it was structured and the animation was very nice. Just in love with the overly created character design and the overall flow of it is very nice. 
 
 
Sound 
 
I have to say that this is one of the rare anime's that has a great dub i really loved the English and the Japanese both i think there both great. The music~ Its not as great as the .Hack//Sign OST but it still has great music. See-Saw does the ending song and Ali Project does the beginning~ they do most the songs in .Hack//Roots i love them all &lt;3. If your a fan of See-Saw or Ali Project you'll deafently love the OST to .Hack//Roots. 
 
 
Character's 
 
I love love love the characters in .Hack//roots it makes you of course want to know more about them outside there character they play in the game. They have this mysterious feel about all of them that makes you want to know more about them which i love! And of course you don't get to know much about them in .Hack//Roots since it continues off in GU. But just the overall feel of the characters i love. Tabby and Felo is probably the most you'll know about a character in .Hack//roots which is interesting still overall the characters are great once you know more about them in the manga's and games. Overall i like the uniqueness of the characters personality's, Haseo is probably the first iv seen of a character like  him. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
I personally really enjoyed watching this series  i really had allot of fun watching to see what would happen next you kind of get suck in with the relationships which there are a few and the mysterious of the anime that never gets solved...unless like iv said you play the games or read the continuation of the manga. 
 
Overall 
 
Overall i gave this anime a 10~ I think you have to be a real .Hack fan to enjoy this series and understand what its all about. Everything overall is a great feel to it but i wish there was more of a completion to it but of course as all .Hack series they don't like completing the anime fully.

Upon hearing of her kidnapping, Lupin rushes to her rescue. Additionally, Lupin receives a written challenge from a mysterious person named ""The Masked Count"" suggesting a contest: who can obtain the ""inheritance of Count Cagliostro"" first. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made. 
It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don't worry, there's still some of it"". 
 
So, what went wrong? 
The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki's film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie. 
Yes, they took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time. 
The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they're completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie. 
 
The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced. 
 
I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching. 
 
In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it. 
But if you're looking for a fresh tv special I don't recommand it.

          
 
       Helpful I can say I've developed a standard for my Lupin content, and this failed on the character development. One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like. 
 
The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don't know yet. And, the opening is too long. 
 
Speaking of the character development girl, I don't feel like she actually learned anything because her development was rushed and it felt empty. 
 
The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless. 
 
I don't suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general.

or the breath of fire serie's ( 1989-??) to name a couple. sadly i've only played some old rpg but never the first release of the serie's. 
The story itself give's WAY more than the summary says i mean omg shit became intense halfway through!! and remember , its LOOSLY based so it means than some elements and /or npc's dont even appear in the game itself  
but does not take away the potential of what it could do more and adds a extra taste to it in following the 'Rpg guideline, the further u get and more levels u unlock, the harder the enemies and terrain unlock special artifacts , meeting new charachters, upgrade items  ect.ect. 
Animationwise, if Dragonball never exsisted, there would never been  Dragonquest, like 2 drops of water. 
The soundtracks itself fits , but gets repeated a lot during action scene's. 
 If we imagined to take a peek inside goku's head what he is dreaming about  to be a legendary hero in a fantasy world we got this: 
Abel=Goku 
Young abel = 13 year ol gohan 
Mokomoko =Yasirobi 
Slime ( the onion like creature's abel has a blue one) he calls ChiChi 
Baramos the devil= Hatchiyack from the DBZ ova  plans to eradicate the sayians ova  
Tobi = a long silverhaired trunks 
Jikoku= a demonlike overambitious impression of vegeta 
just to name a few. 
i enjoyed the fullest out of this show and is a FREAKIN DISGRACE that it never had a official DVD release outside japan, yeah keeping the best shit for themself alright ): 
Overall, i would watch it all over again because it appears as a kidshow but it give's a very colourfull and dark aspect in itself , and its damn funny plus its is one show that makes a lot memorable thanks to a lot of positive factors!!! 
I LOOOVE DRAGONQUEST!!!! u got + 1 up life

13,23277,55,7.666812915695781,story with the main character transported to another world,Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata,"Tomoya Aki, an otaku, has been obsessed with collecting anime and light novels for years, attaching himself to various series with captivating stories and characters. Now, he wants to have a chance of providing the same experience for others by creating his own game, but unfortunately, Tomoya cannot do this task by himself. 
 
He successfully recruits childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura to illustrate and literary elitist Utaha Kasumigaoka to write the script for his visual novel, while he directs. Super-group now in hand, Tomoya only needs an inspiration to base his project on, and luckily meets the beautiful, docile Megumi Katou, who he then models his main character after. 
 
Using what knowledge he has, Tomoya creates a new doujin circle with hopes to touch the hearts of those who play their game. What he does not realize, is that to invoke these emotions, the creators have had to experience the same feelings in their own lives. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'School']",none,"This review contains light spoilers: 
 
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata has your typical RomCom harem set up...but is there more than meets the eye? I certainly think so. 
Enter Tomaya Aki an Otaku down to the very core that has a confrontation only seen in fairy tales. In order to capture this moment eternally he makes it his sole mission to make the best Visual Novel that anyone has ever gotten their hands on joined by his gang of a tsundere, kuudere, and his blank canvas of a main heroine. 
 
Story/Character: 
 I'm going to go ahead and start this break down with what I easily enjoyed the most. Branching off of the vague description of the characters I gave prior if you have seen shows such as OreImo this group of characters may not seem that unique at first glance. However, I was pleased to see that over the course of the show we were delivered with detailed back stories for each character and how they tie back to the main giving them more incentive to reach the final goal. The set up of their development really leaves you in a pinch trying to choose your favorite 
 The story over I felt was very clever and it reminded me why I love anime and the otaku culture so much. Seeing Megumi develop as a otaku herself brought back nostalgic memories from High School sharing my favorite animes and introducing more than one friend into a culture that soon became a big part of their lives.  
 
Art/Sound: 
The art for this anime is very vibrant and appealing to look at. I never found myself at a loss of what was happening on screen and many scenes were accented with a unique filter. All of the small details that referenced different anime made the overall environment fun. The sound for this one is something I can't say drew me in, but it certainly didn't have any major faults. The highlight of the music was definitely a shout out to a certain famous anime at the end but I will leave that for your viewing pleasure! 
 
Overall: 
If you are a fan of animes like OreImo, Oregairu, or Toradora I am positive you will fall in love with this anime. From beginning to end it consistently delivered interesting episodes and left the next season open for some intense character developments and more light hearted fun! 

          
 
       Helpful Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata or Saekano, if you're one of those lazy ass guys like me who can't be bothered to memorize a full length japanese title, is a romcom harem.  
 
That's all you need to know. Who actually cares about what's inside since it's going to be another run-of-the-mill harem romcoms, right? 
 
Well, that's where I was wrong and why I'm here to tell you why you're kinda wrong as well. Sit back and grab some popcorn coz if you're reading this, this'll be a long ass ride.  
 
Now, let's get this straight. I find harem romcoms to be utter shit in most cases but Saekano is kinda different. When I watched this show, I gave it a 3 episode trial and was honestly immersed. In a rare occasion, I actually managed to finish a harem show without puking my guts out in boredom and annoyance. Why is that? What is different w/ saekano that most harem romcoms fail to have? 
 
Simple. It has proper pacing and development. 
 
This anime has a plot. No, I don't mean big boobs and flat justice, though it really does have those in various sizes *wink* *wink*, but this show actually has its proper story set in place. In this show, the main character dreams of making his very own galge (or hentai games for the uninitiated) and he gathers up multiple stereotypes *ahem* I mean characters to aide him in his plight.  
 
Now, normally a harem romcom's story is forgotten amidst the swirling pile of boob shots and ass shots in the show, and while some of 'em actually do travel along the story's goal, it goes by it so subtly that by the time you realize they defeated the demon king, you'll just be like ""Err... what happened? last I noticed, there were boobs... and boobs... an ass shot, and more boobs"" which basically meant that they weren't paced well at all. Why is that? Because harem romcoms are focused more on characters rather than story. You can basically set the story into any theme and a harem romcom would still work given that your characters are the same kind of stereotype. 
 
And this is where I commend this show(although I should likely commend the light novel writer for making something that actually moves in decent consistency). In a span of 12 episodes, the MC managed to recruit a good artist, a good scenario writer, a good music composer, and a good heroine. That shows that the plot, or original purpose of the show, was never forgotten. While some of the scenes and episodes may seem unrelated, it will still show that they are working on the game they're doing, either blatantly pointing it out or saying it in a subtle way. That shows that there's actual story progression, and you don't have to wait 1 billion episodes before this series comes to a conclusion, which likely would be as rushed as flash when his gf says ""parents not home"". 
 
Another thing this show does well compared to most harem romcoms is development. When I say development, I mean character development, and not only MC to heroines but heroine to heroine development as well. One thing I despise about harem romcoms, and which makes me have a stigma against the genre in general, is that they half-ass character development all the time. And that's the rule to it. In harem romcoms, the MC should always have equal standings between all heroines just to balance the playing field (or give everyone a fighting chance for a flexible ending). Basically, it means that when the MC is doing something special with a certain heroine, you should expect that there would be a fallback. Either that the event blows up in a comedic fashion, rendering the character development null, or that all the girls will have a similar character development scene just so everyone is on an equal standing. And you know what I think about that? Dogshit stupid. That basically renders the effort of a heroine to nothing considering either it becomes nothing or everyone gets something, and when everyone is special then no one is. 
 
Let's get back to saekano. I mentioned MC to heroine development earlier, and like a normal run-of-the-mill harem, this show gives an episode dedicated character development to all the heroines. But there's a twist. There's a wildcard in the fray. What is it? It's-- nevermind, I won't say names. Anyway saekano's actually doing a good ol jedi mindfck technique. Yes, sure, every girl is getting an episode dedicated to character development, but the director is subtly hinting the viewers to someone else. They're making sure that a certain heroine has a huge advantage, which shows dedication. This show makes it solid that ""this girl will win, stop fighting for best grills"" and in doing so also makes it sure that every character development scene was put into a different use, either it'd be a set up to an emotional standoff or to strengthen character relationships (to a certain degree). Another thing is, this show doesn't only have MC to heroine progress. There's heroine to heroine progress, which is important because it shows that the heroines are not completely useless without their fcking boyfriend. Stole that line from gigguk lol. Jokes aside, character development in normal romcoms are so heavily dependent on MC to X-heroine that they don't normally interact with each other. That's not the case in saekano, and the show even shortens the gap between certain heroines, just to show that they're not stereotypes to fawn over but actual real characters that were given proper thought and idea. 
 
Anyway, that's the main points I wanted to cover. Music is good (catchy OP and ED and holy shit the sorairo days cover on the last ep was legit), art is good (boner popped multiple times courtesy of Utaha tights and Michiru hopes and dreams~), and honestly, the show is really enjoyable. It has its own flair that can make you immersed and feel like you're not just watching a set of stereotypes bumbling around in a story created purely for cashgrab reasons, but with actual characters you can care about and see their growth as a... well... character. And that's the deal I have with most harem romcoms. Everything is so forgettable and generic that you can't even be bothered to care. It exists just for wankers who want cute grills. In the sea of boobs and ass out there, saekano stands out as its own brand of bread and butter doing its own thing and this is why you should give it a try.

Creating content is an interesting notion. Someone sets aside time to mold, craft, or piece together objects in an attempt to have their cohesion bring about a finalized product. And these objects take on a variety of forms. For instance, this very review is content, where the objects are words and the product is a review. Architects work with wood, chefs work with ingredients, and painters work with paints. Visual novels, too, are a type of content. They require a plot, artwork, music, and coding, all working in unison, to make a game that is worthy of being played. But as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata shows, sometimes it isn't the objects that are difficult to work with but the people behind them that are. 
 
STORY 
 
Saekano (as it will be known from here on out) stars Tomoya Aki, a completely average high school guy. While at the bottom of a steep hill, he sees atop it the figure of a girl. Just then, his imagination sparks and the idea for creating the greatest visual novel of all-time has begun. 
 
One absolutely cannot talk about Saekano without first discussing its meta level. It sounds ridiculous, but the phrase ""that's so meta"" doesn't do this anime justice. The show revels in this fact, and refuses to leave any form of meta-ness untouched. Besides just being self-referential, the show: has dialogue that ""unintentionally"" matches the current shot, contains fourth-wall breaking moments, and cliche events that all standard romances follow. But Saekano doesn't stop there, either. For it also parodies the tropes that these romances (and harems) capitalize on. For example, the leader of the harem has every girl clamoring for him yet he shows literally zero interest towards them; each of the girls is stereotypical yet simultaneously not (Utaha is a ""kuudere"" but secretly a ""yandere,"" Eriri is a ""tsundere"" but a childhood friend, etc.); and the problems that surface are not just one-way streets -- they personally involve both Tomoya and the girl of choice. In this way, the show is capable of poking fun or heading in a multitude of directions that at first glance seem quite tired but later turn out to be surprisingly refreshing. 
 
But where Saekano begins to dip somewhat is precisely with those aforementioned problems. The show is essentially split into the ""girl of the week"" arc format; in other words, the anime revolves around getting each of the girls to join Tomoya's circle in order to create his soon-to-be masterpiece. But as has already been talked about, Saekano is a master of the meta. That is its element. So when it goes outside of its comfort zone, when it diverges away from what it does so well, it starts to falter. The emotions that ensue with any of the girls -- be it Utaha, Eriri, or Hyoudou -- can't match up with its foundation. Utaha's ethical dilemma, Eriri's impassioned guilt, and Hyoudou's personal acceptance are supposed to feel dramatic or endearing, but their existence only aids in making the experience more ""well-rounded."" And the meta aspect of the show isn't the only obstacle that prevents these more serious events from being meaningful. The show is rampant in sexualization of the girls and various types of humor. The meta-ness supports these facets, so when the show moves away from its meta roots, the sex and comedy is lost, too. 
 
Jumping off of this idea, the thematic presence of Saekano is often lacking as well. What the show attempts to get across is the notion of ""facing reality."" In essence, there are certain facts that people need to come to terms with before they can truly begin to move forward in their lives. For Tomoya and Kato, this kind of thinking isn't present: they know what kind of person they are and aren't afraid to act in such a way. The haremettes, however, see such messages. Utaha learns not to be held down by her past, Eriri understands that she isn't the best, and Hyoudou realizes her true self. But again, such themes are clouded by everything else the show tries to be, namely a meta, sexy, and funny harem. Furthermore, each of these resolutions comes about rather quickly -- especially in the form of tiny flashbacks -- so their overall meaning is generally lost. Especially so when the show reverts back into its original mode. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
The art for the anime is generally quite pleasing to see. It mostly sticks to Tomoya's room, certain classrooms, or regularly-used locations, but it isn't afraid to branch out from time to time. Anime conventions are visited, as are parks, clubs, and malls, each of which contains a relative amount of detail. Like most shows, though, the art isn't wholly captivating or special, but serves its purpose. Also of note are the semi-rare occurrences of multi-colored shots for stylistic effect, and the often employed camera work. This usually involved panning motions -- to ""check out"" the girls in different positions -- or close-ups of the chest, face, and butt -- to ""accentuate"" a girl's features -- both of which were used to nice effect. 
 
The character designs are good as well. Utaha's red, captivating eyes, Eriri's yellow twin-tails in the morning but tomboy look at night, and Hyoudou's all purple, all sexy design came off as rather pleasing to see. And given that the girls are usually the focus, this was definitely a plus in its favor. 
 
Finally, actual animation hovered somewhere above average. Besides bouncy bosoms and benign bucking, the show would incorporate minute facial twinges, hair flow, and other normal movements. At times, the characters would remain static, but this was mostly during prolonged talking segments. The previously mentioned camera work would help to alleviate these moments, and thus the animation always seemed to be ""going."" 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
When it comes to harems, there is always quite the cast to talk about. Here, attention is given to the most relevant three: Eriri, Utaha, and Kato. 
 
Eriri, anonymously famous for her work as an ""h-doujinshi"" artist, is classified as a ""tsundere:"" she's harsh but her inner kindness comes through at certain points. She's prideful, jealous, and quite emotional; in short, she's entirely childish and acts accordingly. This makes sense, too, given her childhood friend status. And as Tomoya lays out clearly for her, she isn't as good as she thinks she is, both as an artist and as a friend. Her constant clashing and arrogant attitude made her into a girl who was entirely intolerable. But following her prince and princess moonlit escape, she softens slightly, becoming more respectful towards her longstanding rival and friendlier towards her newfound coworker. While she still doesn't like to be one-upped by those around her, she no longer takes it out on others but instead uses it on herself to drive her to be that much greater of a person. 
 
Similarly famous but a lot sleepier, Utaha embraces two separate archetypes: the ""kuudere"" and the ""yandere,"" that which is cool and that which is insane, respectively. She's generally composed, yet isn't afraid to be flirtatious or crass. Known to call the boy of her affection ""Mr. Ethical,"" why the nickname exists comes to fruition: his rejecting of her literary ""advances."" It's this sentiment that she latches on to. She went from zero to hero in the writing world thanks to Tomoya, and thus her life since has nearly always been about him. From her works to her feelings, she had him on her mind. And therefore it is only appropriate that through him she comes to balance the life she's led. She learns to acknowledge the past, not let it control you; enjoy the present and what it offers; and move onward to a future that makes not only makes yourself but also everyone around you happy. Again, like Eriri, her development doesn't fully quash her former behavior; Utaha still pines after her crush and flips between her personalities. But now, she isn't so distant. Rather, she begins to include others, from Eriri to Kato to Hyoudou and to even herself, in the activities that surround her. 
 
Perhaps the most important cast member is actually the one ""seen"" the least. And that is Kato, the average, normal, everyday girl that coincidentally stumbles onto the scene. When thinking about her character, there isn't anything else to her than what has already been said; she's nice and quiet. That's it. But that's the point. She isn't meant to be some grandiose figure whose personality overshadows everyone else. She isn't designated to have some tragic backstory or hidden feature. This is to fall in line with the meta that the anime boasts. In other words, in an anime like Saekano, the main love interest is as dull and as real a person can be. Utaha, Eriri, and Hyoudou are (obviously) the complete opposite. They're vibrant, both in personality and demeanor. They're talented in the ways of writing, art, and music, respectively (Kato has nothing, and even more than that she's learning to program, a relatively boring job). And they're each actively vying for Tomoya's gaze. Kato has none of these aspects to her, contrasting heavily with the rest of the harem goers. But it's precisely for this reason that she has the most in common with Tomoya, an equally passive, nonchalant, and regular guy. 
 
Even so, she does do something worthwhile. And that is act in that outsider role, the supporter, for everyone else. While she may seem to be in hiding, her influence is apparent everywhere. With Utaha, she ends her date with Tomoya; with Eriri, she gives Tomoya the idea of using visual novel ""flags;"" and with Hyoudou she unearths for Tomoya his cousin's unknown indoctrination. Meaning, when taking a step back and looking at the entire picture, the entire circle, nobody has had a greater effect on it, from initial conception to final formation, than the unremarkable Kato. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP is alright. The beat can be somewhat generic and the singer at times can be rather grating on the ears. However, following the middle of the piece, the one-two-three lyrics help to make it a bit catchier, and the background singers also support the main vocalist well enough. 
 
The ED, on the other hand, is quite good. The ""popping,"" the all-over-the-place pacing in the singing, and super catchy lyrics make it quite pleasant to listen to, both in and out of the show. The random assortment of sound effects throughout also make it that much more fun. 
 
The rest of the soundtrack is, more or less, fine, teetering on bad. The tracks themselves fit the anime, but aren't particularly impressive in terms of sound or composition. Some are jokey, with their dainty instruments and tone -- used during those similarly comedic times. Others try to be more emotional, with heavier emphasis on piano. All seem to lack a certain level of attention. 
 
Getting back on track, though, the voice-acting is way above average for many of the cast. Special shout-outs are in order for: Ai Kayano as Utaha for her collected way of speaking, Saori Oonishi as Eriri for her pronunciation of Utaha's name, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Tomoya for his usual screaming. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Out of everything airing this season, this one was able to make me laugh the most. The nicely timed jokes, the fun characters, and the girls' ""romance"" -- the blushing, the yearning, and the quips between each other -- always had me chuckling during an episode. 
 
And when I wasn't smiling, I was treated to some rather well-done fan-service. Many of the girls are given stunning physiques, and the anime lets you see as many sides to them as possible. Nakedness, sexual innuendos, and lewdness are the norm, and I enjoyed watching it all. 
 
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata may be mired in meta, but it's a tad bit more than that. With nice animation, a good cast of characters, and enough sexiness to satiate any palate, this harem offers more than just a well-done visual novel. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, master of meta, lame issues, clouds its own theme 
 
Animation: Good, nice art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation 
 
Characters: Good, Utaha and Eriri are good, Kato is great, and the rest are okay 
 
Sound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, great VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Good, lots of laughs, fun ""romance,"" and sexy fan-service 
 
Final Score: 6/10

Little Busters!' story revolves around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke who is in his third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.
The story opens on Sunday May 13, 2007, and the next day at school, Kyousuke decides that the Little Busters are going to play a baseball game, except they do not have enough members to have a complete team. Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.
The story's main part takes place in what seems to be a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term previous to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.
Rejecting this turn of events, Rin travels back into the artificial world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, the two of them go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, and the members of the Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.
","Right off the bat, similarly to refrain i would immediately recommend this to those who have watched the original series - as you'll be enthralled by this additional show consisting of yet again, well thought out, powerful and untold stories: of 3 supporting characters. 
 
EX has a good blend of a spectrum of genres, from the start you'll be hit with a very cinematic, action packed main plot, and as you observe these other characters too, their untold relevance is seamlessly revealed. 
Fans of LB will be pleased to hear that yes, all of the base components well reflect that signature narration - a powerful hybrid between emotion, twists and dark sides. 
 
As a special, you've probably already realized that this installment doesn't go on for too long, and so when the creators opened a building-full of great possibilities, they had to shut at least a few windows to fit everything in. The first told story line was definitely comprehensive, yet i can't help but feel that the remaining two were a tad rushed. 
 
It is still a win for the viewers though, a special series that will further enrich your knowledge on that faithful group of childhood friends. As i expected it was an enjoyable watch :) 
 
Not really much else to say. 
So See You ^^

An anime adaptation of the new route additions in key's visual novel - Little Busters!: Ecstasy, Little Busters!: EX is a good summary of the arcs in the visual novel, however it cannot be compared to the masterpiece of which the VN is. That being said, covering three entire arcs over only 8 episodes of such an amazing visual novel cannot realistically be of the same standard as the visual novel. However, the eight episodes are indeed still of very high quality.  
 
The expectations I had for this anime, were naturally very high given that I had just watched Little Busters!: Refrain, now one of my favourite animes that I have watched so far. However, I was not disappointed, and was instead met with an anime definitely worth the wait of one month per episode for. Little busters EX, although not nearly as sad as Refrain; still builds onto the series wonderfully and does it justice.  
 
The characters in this anime are in a word, incredible. Keeping in line with the original series, each and every character has a tragic background that is completely contrary to the facade they portray in public at first. However as the main character (Riki) progresses, their facade is removed and their past is revealed. Choice of music in Little busters EX, like the original, is amazing, and Jun Maeda should be commended for this. If you liked air, angel beats or clannad, it is likely that you will enjoy little busters EX too. The art style is the same across the series, and is quite good. 
 
The only con of this anime, would be that the second and third arcs could be a bit longer, as two episodes each can not adequately cover their stories in as much detail as I would like. That being said, they are still made very well. Saya's story however, is told across the first four episodes. This is probably because she is entirely new to the series, while the other two main heroines of little busters EX appeared in the original series, though only briefly.  
 
If you have not yet seen this brilliant anime, then you should really stop reading this review and go watch it. However, if you haven't already, watch the original series first (Little busters and Refrain). Also, if you have the time, definitely give the visual novel a try as it explores all the characters in greater detail than the animes. However, currently Little Busters Ecstasy has not been fully translated yet. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Note: I'm going to make references about the original work, the visual novel Little Busters and its ex version, Little Busters Ecstasy (Although I haven´t played the ex version yet) 
 
Little Busters is considered one of the most influential visual novels from Key studio whose works like Clannad, Air or Kanon have had a good success on the market. Due to the good reception and results of the sales, Little Busters got an addition with a new heroine and two new stories about two of the supporting characters from the original visual novel which got an anime adaptation several months ago. 
 
At first, you need to watch season 1 and season 2 or even better, just read the visual novel. Unfortunately the ex version haven’t got an English translation yet. For all this unless you know Japanese, these ovas are the only material available of this part of the story. The story is divided in three arcs so I will try to show you the main ideas of each one. 
 
Saya is a new heroine who hasn’t been shown before her arc. Naoe Riki, a school student is walking through the corridor of the school at night, looking for the notes which he forgot on class when he hears shots and immediately a shadow takes him down and forces him to escape to the gate. But in his way, he finds a school card which is property of a school student called Saya Tokido. 
 
Although their first encounter is so nice and Saya seems  to be a charming girl, but you can't judge a book by looking at the cover and Saya will demonstrate that she is a mysterious girl who needs his help desperately. But Saya is a very selective person and needs to know that his mate is reliable. Will be Riki her soulmate? Take a look at the ovas if you want to know more. 
 
As for Sasami arc , it is set after the events of Refrain so take as an advice what I told you before. Remember that Sasami was a devoted dog’s lover who hates cats, which creates  problems with Rin. Well in this arc  we will know why. We will know the past of Sasami and we will dive deeper into her personality, discovering a new aspect of her personality, in the end  she is a emotional and lovely girl  contrasting with the proud and arrogant personality who was shown in the original work.  
 
In this arc, Riki and the rest of the Little Busters are enjoying one new day in the school when a mysterious cat, unknown to Rin, appears. This cat is curiously very close to Sasami and seems to get on well so good with her, which surprised the Little Busters. Several days later Sasami appears on Riki´s room and begs him for help. 
 
Finally the first half of Kanata’s Arc is set (at least on the visual novel) before Refrain and the second half is after Refrain. On the anime everything is set after Refrain.  Despite of this, you can easily get what the main idea is. In this route, the Little Busters have an important role. Kyousuke , proposes Riki to get close to the student council for getting more credits and help to maintain alive the baseball club. 
 
As a result,  Little Busters will need to do some communal work. In case of Riki, he needs to help Kanata Futaki and A-chan (both are coming back from the first season) to make some paperwork. With all this we will discover a past tragedy and the sacrifice which Kanata made on his childhood for the sake of her sister, Haruka Saigusa. But Riki will show her a more brightful vision of life, the lesson of the Little Busters. 
 
In general these are the main ideas of the three arcs. Personally as I said before, you need to read the visual novel instead of the anime (It is my personal recommendation but the anime isn´t bad, but it can´t overcome the masterpiece that the visual novel is) 
 
As for the music, we shouldn't forget the mastery of Jun Maeda, who adds a lot of new tracks which are lovely such a Saya's Song, The Cat, Glass and Round Moon, Will & Wish  and much more. 
 
Characters are one of the most important parts of this series. Characters are so incredible and the relationship between them is so incredible, wonderful and even enviable. The new heroine, Saya Tokido, together with the development of Sasami Sasasegawa and Kanata Futaki is fantastic. 
 
Anyway J.c Staff made a good adaptation at the end or al least for getting the main idea of the story. Due to the absence of a translation of the ex routes, you will need to take a look at these ovas if you want some material of this part of the story. If not just wait for the complete patch.

His days are occupied with Kendo practice, visits to his family's shrine, and dreaming of his high school reunion. When his spirit is suddenly transported to the world of Byston Well, Chris becomes Garzey's Wing, a legendary holy warrior. The Metomeus tribe summoned him to help liberate them from slavery, but unfortunately, Chris has no knowledge on how to be a holy warrior, and moreover, only has an incredibly dull sword which he salvaged from a corpse. 
 
To make matters more complicated, there is another Chris who is still in the normal world!  He cannot control the events in Byston Well, but is tied to the fate of the other Chris. The young man must struggle and adventure in a world of magical creatures and mysterious foreigners. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Action', 'Fantasy']","The protagonist Chris is abruptly whisked away to a parallel world called Byston Well while his physical body remains in his home world. Chris' spiritual manifestation travels to a new world, where he is thrust into a rebellion. Chris is told that he has a mystical power called ""Garzey's wing"", which causes large wings made of light to come out of his ankles, allowing him to fly and run quickly.
Chris is told to fight against slave owners and the King's army as the slaves of the Metomeus tribe make their escape from the palace at Izumido. The Ashigaba army fights back with horses, bows, and dinosaur-like creatures called War Beasts. The series centers around the slave's escape, the conflict between the King's army and the slaves, as well as Chris' struggle to make sense of his convoluted situation.
Chris exists simultaneously in Byston Well and the real world, and the two can communicate to each other through a necklace they both wear. Real-world Chris feels the bruises and pain Byston Well Chris experiences while fighting soldiers, and training he does in the real world allow him to learn it in Byston Well. While one Chris is in Byston Well surrounded by 12th and 13th century foreigners and being chased by a real army, earth Chris must do Chi exercises to strengthen his mind.
In the end, Chris fights off the army and saves Byston Well, but his spirit remains there. Meanwhile, in the real world Chris has gained the power of Garzey's wing himself.
","An anime so awful it deserve a warning much more than a review.Christopher Chiaki gets transported to the past by a enslaved village people as they believe him to be a  legendary warrior called garzeys wing.He helps them to fight there captive in  bloody encounters. 
 
Well kiddies if you were expecting something deeper to your story you're better off watching hentia.the plot is so paper thin that's its almost non- existent,yet at the same time being convoluted and silly.What confusing was even though Christopher was transported to another time period a version of him was still left in his time and they communicated by means that frankly made little sense. 
 
Oh boy the dub was so bad it was epic.You'd think the studio just hired people from off the street and compensated them with Mac Donald's coupons. 
 
The animation wasn't that great either and the character and music wasn't worth mentioning.Overall an anime just to past the time.

          
 
       Helpful Strange case we got here: a show so bad that it's good! Make sure to watch this show dubbed though because ever single line is delivered with such horribly delivery that you can only question if the actors have ever held a normal conversation with a person before. 
 
The story and characters in this show are just awful. The story barely makes a damn bit of sense and the characters reactions to it are just terrible. That's not to say that there is not enjoyment to be had here because there is plenty of enjoyment to be had here, everything is so bad it makes you want to finish watching it at the very least. At least the art is watchable, but still pretty bad. 
 
We have our main, Chris, and for some reason he gets spirited away by a giant glowing duck and we never really get an explanation. He's spirited away to the same place where Aura Battler Dunbine takes place, but for some reason he was only half spirited away and is still in the real world, where everyone acts like it is perfectly normal that he is half there and half in the past. The plot holes are so frequent you can only wonder if anyone bothered to proofread this before they started animating it. He has a lot of scenes where he talks with himself and the dialogue and acting in them are just so godawful that every line feels like it makes fodder for instant memes (""Oh my god I felt like I was having a dream!""). The cutest thing here is that the story thinks that its serious, but every aspect of it is so marvelously terrible, from the basics, the ending, everything in the middle, the characters, the interactions, the predictability, that you mostly end up watching it for the horrendously bad dialogue. Therein lies why I say that the enjoyment factor is high, it's sorta like going to a friend's school play where no one can act and you secretly snigger during the performance, but instead of acting awkward when you compliment them afterwards, you can let your true feeling out and just laugh your head off. 
 
Recommend watching this with a group of friends though, it will only add to the enjoyment factor. You'll question how this went so terribly wrong given that the guy behind Gundam made it. Be sure to watch dub though or you'll miss out on the inadvertent humor at every turn. And that fairy is creepy.

          
 
       Helpful Those of you who have been anime fans for a while probably know that Garzey's Wing is one of the most reviled, known-to-be-awful anime titles of all time, and, quite frankly, I don't intend to change that opinion. I think that, if you need a reason to watch Garzey's Wing, that's gonna have to be your reason going into it. But you have to be ready for it, because even preparing yourself mentally might not be enough. And that's because Garzey's Wing is so unrepentantly terrible. In fact, the dub will immediately let you in on what you're in for. I've had my shares of bad dubs up through the ages, most of which usually make me switch to Japanese. Not so with Garzey's Wing, though. The dub is so utterly wooden, most of the characters sound like they've never set foot in a dubbing studio before, only starring in this OAV because they're literally forced to at gunpoint. ""You are so easygoing"", the female love interest chides as our hero drives off on his motorcycle to attend a class reunion pool party. ""My necklace is rattling. I wonder, could it be the shiratori shrine?"" Chris muses as he drives by during the night. ""This must be where Yamato-Takeru-no-Mikoto came down from the sky."" And the exposition goes on and on and on. It humorously reminds me of what Carlos said about the dialogue in his Escaflowne movie review, where people would uncharacteristically throw monologues about the land, the mythology or the people to aid those who walk into this OVA not knowing what the hell is going on. And it's not helping. The dialogue only serves to make the video feed redundant, but doesn't really do a whole lot making things clear. Fellow reviewer Jason Huff was the one who made me aware that Garzey's Wing is actually related to another show called Aura Battler Dunbine, which only serves to bring even more questions into the equation. Would I understand this show better if I had watched Aura Battler Dunbine? Or would that only make this one worse by comparison. Would switching to Japanese help? Somehow, I doubt that. If there's one positive thing that can be gleaned from this, then the show is at least visually interesting. Character designs are actually pretty good for the most part, and the backgrounds are also nice. If you've seen screenshots from Garzey's Wing, you might actually wonder why people complain about it. The animation is just terrible, though. I know I complained about the animation in Record of Lodoss War, but Garzey's Wing has animation more on the level of Crying Freeman. Hell, Garzey's Wing might actually beat said show when it comes to animation cel pans. The story plays out like a fairly typical fantasy story. Our main hero is summoned to an alien world, and has to save an enslaved race of people from their oppressors. The angles, if you can call them that, is that Chris is apparently separated into two identical entities through the summoning, and the two of... him... can communicate with each other through... well, interdimensional telepathy, I guess. Garzey's Wing sounds fine... on paper. And that's kind of the problem, because the execution is just terrible. It's almost like Amon Saga; Chris might have more of a personality compared to Amon, but both stories are hilarious, confusing messes with vaguely impressive fantasy elements and terrible, Zero Wing level dialogue. For instance, the first hurdle you'll face is exposition that doesn't teach you anything. Mostly, it's namedropping, and you're left asking ""What the hell is a Gabujuju?"" ""What the hell is a Bunzudo?"" ""What the hell is Gabygas, and is that related to the Gabujuju?"", but more importantly: ""Why are all these names so darn goofy?!"" And Jesus Christ, the aforementioned terrible dub just makes the whole thing so much more difficult to digest, which is only made worse by the many ways this show doesn't make any damn sense. For instance, what's the importance of the leap year? Who are all these people, and what's their history? Why are all of Chris's friends in the present time taking everything that goes on at face value? It would help to know these things, but Garzey's Wing just throws its main protagonist straight into the whole thing, and I swear; he goes through most of the whole show sounding as confused as I was when I watched it. There was also the whole subplot thing centered around Falan, the small fairy-like girl of a race called Fellarian, and for some reason, they're ostracised in Byston Well for largely unexplained reasons. Seriously, Garzey's Wing proceeds to literally smash us over the head with it somewhere in the middle of its runtime. Apparently, they're a race not to be trusted, at least according to the Bystonians. But, if this show is anything to go by, they have a strong sense of community, and Falan herself is quite loyal to Chris, even if more by necessity than desire. She might be annoying at times, but she's hardly malevolent. The show proceeds to give a half-baked explanation to this; that Falan was pulled with Chris, and that somehow purified her in the process. The rest of them just curse and mess with people according to the priestesses, which sounds more like an excuse. And so -- I write, sighing heavily -- she's also one of the more developed characters in this show. Which isn't saying a lot, granted, but her basic personality means she actually has one compared to the hundreds of nobodies running around. Even the villains are almost comically villainous, all going ""We enslave them all and force them to do our bidding, and they rebel against us? The nerve of them all. I will make them pay."" Unfortunately, the only other Yoshiyuki Tomino show I've seen is the almost equally infamous Ideon. Not being a mecha fan, I haven't really experienced the man at his best, and as much as could be said about Ideon, it doesn't reach the level of absurdity and sheer badness of Garzey's Wing. The maddening thing is that Garzey's Wing is so terrible, so bizarre, that it will influence how you look at other fantasy shows. It's more or less like certain scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies once you've seen a certain remixed song -- they bleed through and lessen the impact of said scenes, inspiring humorous smirks instead of grim pursing of lips. And much as I love watching a really bad show, Garzey's Wing does things to me. Bad, bad things. Things that may never heal properly. How do you outdo a show in being terrible? By being a terrible show made by someone who really should be able to do a whole lot better, that's how.

Suddenly, a conspicuous red button begging to be pressed appears before them. Overcome by curiosity, the otherworldly characters push the button, sending them to an unfamiliar world. 
 
With no way of escaping, the characters must lead a normal school life and make acquaintances with the others. One thing is certain: the classroom full of fan-favorite eccentric personalities never gets boring! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Parody']","One day, a magic button suddenly appears. The protagonists from KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, and Saga of Tanya the Evil all press the button occasionally, unintentionally and move to a parallel world — another brand new isekai — where a new story featuring high school life begins. Soon, they are joined by protagonists from The Rising of the Shield Hero and Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious.
","The concept of Isekai has been done so many times that the genre has oversaturated the anime medium and we'll likely have at least 1 major Isekai every season for a while.  
 
        While the concept of Isekai isn't unique, Isekai Quartet presents us with the question ""What if different Isekai characters were brought into a completely new world?"". This unique idea brought together four different series to create a smaller series that combines the bits and pieces that we enjoyed of each them. 
  
        The series spends no time recapping who the protagonist is or their personalities, so if you haven't seen KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero, or Tanya the Evil might want to check those out prior to watching the series as there is many ""in"" jokes that rely on the viewer having knowledge of the other series and characters.  The series does a great job of having the characters stay true to their personalities while they interact with others from different world's who have completely different experiences from one another. Thanks to that we are able to get answers to questions some fans had and get completely new questions about how they would react if they were introduced to different characters such as Rimuru, Naofomi, or other Isekai protagonists.  Hopefully, we get more unique takes on anime in the future because of risks like crossovers, we get new ideas and concepts that are a breath of fresh air in a medium that spews out content. 

          
 
       Helpful The best way to enjoy this series is if you have watched all four, if not why the fuck are you reading the reviews you've got some amazing shows to watch. But if you have great, this show is basically what if people that went to another world, went to another world. To be honest I think its nice, like from the 4 anime's they chose konosuba is the only ""positive"" one whereas the others are darker. So this gives us a nice pull away from those seasons. Also some of those series are still awaiting their second season such as Saga of Tanya and Re:zero, which I enjoyed. So this gives me reassurance that there will be another season lol. 
 
I think the main reason why this is so enjoyable is to see the characters interact with each other, which we wouldn't be able to see. And when they bring up references from their animes that gives it all the more joy. 
 
Basically, if you have suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or anything else that causes you emotional suffering and you have seen Saga of Tanya the Evil, Overlord 1, 2 and 3, Konosuba season 1 and 2 ANNNNDDDD Re:zero, then this is the cure to all your problems. Thank me later.

          
 
       Helpful Isekai Quartet represents the most wholesome and pure type of fan service one can write. In other words a spinoff truly made for the fans of not just one franchise but four of them, more specifically KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Youjo Senki and Overlord; kind of like a 2019 equivalent of what Carnival Phantasm was for the Nasuverse back in 2011. It should go without saying that you should have seen at least some and preferably all of these series before watching Isekai Quartet or you will not be able to appreciate this anime for what it is. 
 
This chibi crossover spinoff basically takes all the main characters from these various franchises and sends them to another world... again... where they meet each other in a seemingly ordinary human school and are forced to become students. Of course what the anime is actually about is simply putting all these loveable characters together just to see what the hell happens, and that is really the charm point of it all. Just seeing the crossover interactions play out is something any fan of these series should have a great deal of fun watching. After all, character relations such as Tanya's hatred for deities like Aqua and in turn Aqua's animosity towards the undead such as Ainz is unavoidably going to lead to a great deal of interesting confrontation. 
 
It's a simple show by design but it definitely works. The only real problem with it is that there are so many characters involved and potential interactions that would have been fun to explore, but with only 9-minute episodes (excluding OP and ED duration) we only ever get a quite limited amount of exposure to a large portion of Isekai Quartet's character cast. There are so many things I would have liked to see the show touch upon that never ended up happening simply because it ran out of time. But nevertheless it is still a great spinoff which I would highly recommend any fans of the related series to watch. It may be short but it's exceptionally sweet.

""Gakuen Handsome"" wonderfully parodies the vast world of Boy's Love (BL or yaoi), exaggerating everything and taking the parody to a whole new level - from the art to the non-existing plot with ridiculous situations, and even adding references to poop. 
 
I first learned about BL parody when playing the BL parody game ""Kusoge"", featuring the same parody type (and ridiculously long chins) than ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
It was so funny that I searched for more BL parodies of this type, and I stumbled upon a walkthough of one of the ""Gakuen Handsome"" games by a Japanese YouTuber, and it was so good that I watched the entire thing, along with the two MVs of the official character songs that were as funny as the rest. 
 
I was so charmed by this unique and strange... thing, that I was overjoyed when an OVA was announced. 
So here is my review, though I don't really know if it can be called a review because the ""Gakuen Handsome"" franchise is so out of this world that it... it honestly can't be reviewed. But I'll try my best :> 
 
[Story & Characters] 
The plot of ""Gakuen Handsome"" parodies the undying scenario of the average naive young transfer student, entering a new school to be almost immediately surrounded by a harem of bishounen ready to die for him (thumbs up for the headmaster and his little sister pairing up to encourage him in his love life). 
All the situations were very funny, and ended up with such enormous nonsense that I laughed a lot. 
The characters, that remained just the way they were in the original games, are such enormous cliches that it's hilarious. The kind childhood friend, the dangerous young teacher, the serious class representative and the cold classmate, among others, were perfect in their respective roles. 
 
[Art] 
""Gakuen Handsome"" being... well, ""Gakuen Handsome"", you obviously can't expect much from this wonderful parody, and The Animation kept this same crappy Flash animation used in the previous games and MVs. The poor animation serving the non-existent plot is fully part of the enjoyment, along with the ridiculously pointy bishounen chins and the strange moves and dances that pop up for no reason at all. 
 
[Sound] 
Unfortunately, and at my despair, the production staff entirely recasted the voice actors, leaving behind the hilarious voice acting of the games (bye bye, Sakuya's voice that made me cry of laughter). Instead were, among others, the well-known voices of Hanae Natsuki (Kaneki Ken@Tokyo Ghoul, Arima Kousei@Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and Kahikara Tetsuya (Natsu Dragneel@Fairy Tail). 
The new seiyuu, being pros, did an excellent job with voice acting, but I feel that they made me laughed way less than in the games, because even there the voice acting sounded so unprofessional that it was used as a parody feature. 
In a way, I felt that the new cast was too professional for an unique license such as ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
About the rest of the sound - honestly, I was so focused on wondering what I was doing with my life that I didn't pay much attention to it. 
 
[Overall] 
I can safely say that I laughed way more with the original games than with ""Gakuen Handsome: The Animation"", especially because of the cast change for the anime. But it was still great to watch, and I recommend to every anime viewer who wants to have some fun and gently make fun of the BL genre. 
If you're interested in more things like this, I recommend the visual novel ""Kusoge"" (lit. ""shitty game) <3

","Made in the mid 90's, this anime is fun to watch, just like the original. For those who've seen the original, you can pretty much skip to episode 35, since the first 33 are recaps and episode 34 is quickly summed up in the first few minutes of 35. If you're new to the anime, watch the whole thing, and if you want more detail, go to the corresponding episodes in the original.  
 
Now, from episode 35 on is pure bliss, because the character development of this fantastic newcomer, Shingo Aoi, is well done. If you can get a dub or sub, do it, since the dialogue is actually pretty important. This is unlike the original, which could have had no dialogue whatsoever and still been pretty much understood (except for a hilarious backhand smack that NEEDED dialog for effect, but I digress). 
 
The entire series is only 46 episodes long (45 in some dubs; I've seen the Arabic and Spanish ones), which means only a dozen new episodes total. But that dozen is absolutely fantastic- namely the internal feud at training camp and the epic match vs. Thailand.  
 
The music, in an absolute sense, is great, but compared to the original, it's somewhat disappointing. You just don't get the same feel. For comparison, if the original is DBZ, than Captain Tsubasa J is DBGT on steroids. Make of that what you will. The animation, however has me torn. It's different than the first series, but it's more pronounced (crisper) in both a good way- brightness, lack of blurriness- and a bad way; the original is easier on the eyes. I gave it a 7/10. 
 
All in all, this is great marathon fodder. It does leave you at a sort of cliffhanger, though, which is universally bemoaned, but at least it's good while it lasts. Here's hoping the next remake (aired 2001-2002) clears up that distasteful part of this anime for us.

       Helpful Welcome to the 90s with this series of 'CT'! 
 
Looking at this series, you'll find yourself a little in those and you'll find, part of the manga story that is written in those years. 
  
The first 33 episodes are a remake of the 'elementary arc' of '80 with some original anime content. 
In this series you can find also Taro Misaki's story, exactly like in the series of '80, in a completely new guise . 
 
In the second part you will find the first part of 'Captain Tsubasa World Youth', the part written by Yoichi Takahashi in '90, with the arrival of new characters, which will be fundamental to the story. 
 
The only problem is that, this series, stops abruptly just when the game starts to get really interesting and leaving many fans with a bitter taste. 
 
You will wonder why!? 
 
Because the Japanese national football team, at that time, failed to qualify for the '94 World Cup in U.S.A . 
 
In fact, 'CT', is the only anime/manga whose destiny seems to be boundlessly linked to the fate of the Japanese national football team. 
 
The graphics are really better than the 80s version, like the music too. 
 
Aniway 'Tsubasa & Co.' are always the same!

It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

Lots and Lots of chibi charachters, Sunrise Inc after the huge success of the gundam serie's that at that point aired from  1979-1988 (char's counterattack was the latest one at the time) found somewhat a new populair direction by creating a more kid friendly serie's in addition/rivalised of Toei Animation's Dragonball serie's wich was gaining hto uge popularity rating in japan, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru , with a huge pointer to Dragons since that is very important in japanese culture. 
 
The whole serie itself is more a friendly mix between RPG, Action adventure, Mecha's wich sunrise was best in doing and deformed charachters with funny traits to give, even for the villians. 
The first wataru storyline goes about a legend that saved the 1st godrealm ( there are i believe 3 realms in total according to the ova' and last serie's storyline) and that hero was named 'wataru', and it seems a 9 year old boy is a descendant or something of that legend and is asked to cleanse the godrealm of darkness and let the rainbow shine. 
 
Animation reallly fits for its time beeing it a kidsshow  both the OP & ED to me was likable because some of the singing was stuck in my head together wich the good ol oldskool popmusic, and the models looked drawn very colourfull and funny even for the bad one's with a very positive look at 'chibi'as i said, with every now and then some strange behavior is sometimes a good thing to keep the show going.same for the mini mecha models that is personalised for every charachter wich their own unique powers and abillitie's 
 
Musicwise: Copy, Cut& Paste wich was quite normal at the time and cheaper to do it, how repetitive it became god only knows, it could use some more variation for my account! 
 
The charachters were one of the main things that made the show populair and shows a very strong diffrence in personality's, behaviors, looks ect ect. 
but fun nevertheless, wataru himself is not a typical hotheaded ambitious type , more a heroic, helpful  boy just to point out, and i like the side chara as well for their part. 
 
I enjoyed it for a big part minus the 2 or 3 fillers every 10-12 episodes but then again it summaries some previous chapters, but the biggest enjoyment of it all was the rpglike action adventure encounters wataru and his friends had, returning all inhabitants to a normal state. 
 
overall i give it a 7/10, good to enjoy for a kids show , could give some more so hopefully the next serie's (minus the ova wich i have seen) give some less repetitive music and some more new encounters with more actionpacked scene's and a more darkerside storyline!

While she does vaguely resemble one useless character in the plot, whether it is she on the poster or not, either way both in the anime and on its poster the viewer is left thinking who and what the heck is she even doing in there?  
 
In many respects this summarises the feelings you get after watching Interlude, whose plot doesn't fail to get you worked up with expectations but at the same time gives you a headach for the most part due to it being basically pointless. It is one of those animes where the authors tried too hard to twist things up but end up in the end getting twisted themselves with loose ends all over the place and leave the mess up for you to fill in the blanks, pretending all along there is somehow some great psychological logic behind it all which of course nobody grasped!

          
 
       Helpful My first review on an OVA so here it goes! 
 
Interlude, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is an intervening or interruptive period, space, or event. How this can be applied to this OVA is moot. We can conclude that the most likely meaning of the Interlude in this anime is the world of memory, in which all of our characters live their lives in this ""intervening pause"" of the apocalypse. The tautology of the word can clearly be seen in every intro where one of the heroines gives a monologue (or even a soliloquy) about an abstract idea concerning despair in regard to personal ambition, the point of life, or obliviousness to the world around us. I may mention the motifs and symbolism I see throughout the series, which may be full of praise, but this does not reflect my actual review of the OVA as a PRODUCT. 
 
Now the review: 
 
(5) Story: There is no true plot. Just an abstract outline of the apocalypse in parallel with a dream world that was formed to preserve the lives and sanity of a number of humans left in the world. Now the beauty of this lack of plot is that the director gives us a piece of his work, his art and we're supposed to see what is truly being expressed throughout his work. There are questions imposed here that make you really think. Just to name a few:  
 
""Is sacrifice really worth it if a person you're sacrificing for is oblivious to your efforts?"" 
 
""Could you live with yourself if everyone else died but you?"" 
 
""Does the power of love juxtapose with the shame of regret in times of extreme trauma or does the power of love triumph over the shame of regret in those moments?"" 
 
""When and where does morality end and begin?"" 
 
I mean you could go on for hours trying to see the symbolism within this short OVA and determine what the author was trying to get across. However, many of my fellow anime fans know that anime is used as a direct means to express a certain emotion, thought, or outlook on an aspect of life or human values. However, making this OVA abstract detracted heavily from actually making this OVA enjoyable for most viewers. 
 
(9) Animation: This is one aspect which the producers clearly did not fail in. The art in this work was very smooth, clean, and crisp within the memory world. The apocalyptic world is portrayed in a fuzzy, surreal manner, giving way to the feeling of shock; how the world became what it was never supposed to be. I can't say the detail was simply amazing, but they way the artists pulled it off did contribute to the sense of illusion and loss of reality within the OVA. 
 
(7) Sound: Again no complaints. Just as with the art, the producers did not neglect on the sound effects, voice acting, or music of the series. However, I can clearly see that they did not go out of their way to use sound as a tool to further convey the feelings and emotions of confusion and dark self-reflection in regard to the main character's interaction with his surroundings, which is why I gave it a positive, but not an outstanding rating. 
 
(6) Character: Again, in relation to to my story rating, I believe the characters are used as a kind of foil, not just to the main character, but to ourselves. The characters were not very well developed because the I believe the director made it his intention to keep his story abstract. The only person whom I believed was really was developed was Mutsuki Saegusa who sacrificed everything for a step-brother whom she truly cared for. I can look into the characters and begin to delve into the realm of philosophy asking questions about myself, humanity, and the surreal. However, this is an anime review so I'm avoiding any digressions when I can! ;) 
 
(9) Enjoyment: I can go forever about this one. Let's keep it short.  
I'm a very deep thinker. This OVA presents questions and innuendos that really made me think about values, morality, humanity, etc. Because of this, I enjoyed the anime a lot because it made me reflect on a lot of ethics we follow today. 
 
(6) Overall: Again this OVA is not for people looking for amazing action or getting blown apart in terms of psychological thinking, like with Inception (I know it's not anime but it's a good example). It's supposed to stimulate reflection and provoke some sort of response in terms of what symbols you can pull out of the anime and discuss with other viewers. I enjoyed it as provoker of deep meditation. As an OVA, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are into finding deep, hidden themes and meanings within the shows.

          
 
       Helpful This anime does a number of things really well ... and then flops in a number of other areas.  The very first thing to understand about this anime is that you aren't going to understand this.   
 
Story 
The entire anime plays out similarly to the end of Evangelion where absolutely nothing makes any sense.  This is an area that could have used significantly more polish.  Done properly, this could have been a mind-twister that really made you think about some important questions in life.  In stead what we have is a Half-life/Evangelion hybrid that just doesn't feel right about half of the time. 
 
Art 
This is by far the series strongest area.  The art is relatively well done.  There's better out there, of course, but this really isn't bad.  The characters feel individualized, well drawn, and well animated.  The backgrounds are rich and contrast well enough that the characters don't become drown out by it.  The environment overall feels believable. 
 
Sound 
I really don't have any particularly strong feelings about the audio in this series.  For me it was just ... meh.  It certainly isn't bad sound and the theme isn't too bad ... but it also isn't good either.  It's just there. 
 
Characters 
This is the low point of the series right here.  There are token characters everywhere in this one.  This includes the obligatory mostly-naked girl in all three episodes.  For me, this really took away from the story.  Some of the characters are, for the most part, believable.  They do their best to draw out the main character but even then he feels ... empty most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment 
Surprisingly, I still enjoyed this anime.  It certainly wasn't the best out there ... but it was pretty good.  It is, for all intents and purposes, average.  If you've got nothing all that great to watch, this is at least a somewhat enjoyable experience. 
 
The final verdict: OK ... I suppose.

13,2595,64,7.54174841142302,story with the main character transported to another world,D.C.II: Da Capo II,"The undying Sakura Trees return. Based on a PS2 sequel of the original DaCapo game, the story once again takes place on Hatsunejima, but is set 53 years after the events of D.C. and D.C.S.S.. Although some characters will probably look a bit familiar to the initiated eye, the cast is a new one. The new main protagonist is Yoshiyuki Sakurai, who lives next door to the Asakura sisters Yume and Otome, who are the granddaughters of Junichi and Nemu from the first season. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'School']","Da Capo centers around Jun'ichi Asakura, who lives with his adopted sister Nemu on Hatsune, a fictional crescent-shaped island where cherry blossoms bloom all year long, where they attend Kazami Academy (風見学園, Kazami Gakuen) high school. On this island, people have mysterious powers and attributes, sourced by the unwilting magical cherry tree. Jun'ichi can see other people's dreams. One of his friends, Kotori Shirakawa, is an idol at the school who can ""read minds"". One day, to Jun'ichi's surprise, his cousin Sakura Yoshino comes back from America all of a sudden, who looks exactly the same girl that moved away six years ago, and has not aged one bit. She returned to remind Jun'ichi of their childhood promise.
","This is a new Da Capo with an entirely different storyline. I was expecting the least of it since it has a low rating and watching it at first got me confused and disappointed because it was something completely different from the previous ones, but, it turns out great. People must have taken this series the wrong way because it is actually quite good. I've watched it while expecting and searching for disappointments, but the only flaw to it is that it has two main stories which is basically wrong. The stories are great and they indeed, are able to switch between the two like it was dante's weapons in devil may cry 3, but as what everyone learned since elementary, there should ALWAYS be ONLY ONE main topic because it's very hard to talk about two things at the same time. ""EF - A Tale of Memories"" were able to pull it off somehow but this one didn't, still, this is definitely a MUST WATCH, not as a continuation of the previous Da Capo but as a new anime. 
 
The undying Sakura trees do return but they're more like just a background this time. There's a whole new story but sadly its very wrong because they tried to fit two stories into one show. However, when separated, the stories are pretty good. Da Capo II has a story of love between childhood friends and also a story of robots and society. There's also a side story of playing in a band and a hint of the Da Capo harem. There's also this thing about the main guy having dreams just like Junichi in the very first Da Capo. It's really such a waste that they tried a mix of stories here. They took the other things lightly and ended up focusing most on the robot story while trying to keep up with the love story, so it was quite a mess. Anyway, the fact that the stories in separate are good and because it had a very nice ending, the story department still deserves a good score. 
 
The art is very good. Everyone and everything looked nice, but the problem is that it lacked beauty and cuteness. The drawings are good and the animation is good but comparing it to the previous works, the art, most specially the characters, could have looked so much better (the characters look bad in side view). 
 
The sounds are great. It has a nice OP and ED that is well fitted for the genre and it also has nice backgrounds, and nice voices. Everything is well blended with the scenes. The sounds are really good but not to a point that people would like it so much. 
 
To the viewers of the previous Da Capo, the new characters will feel really weird and disappointing since they don't seem to be directly related to the old ones. No history was presented. Disregarding that, the characters were all great and everyone had good roles, except for Sakura Yoshino. Thinking about it, it's quite disappointing that she doesn't have much to do this time. Another bad thing is that the main guy can be too much thickheaded but he was able to make up for that somehow. 
 
Da Capo II could have been great. It's quite enjoyable despite the negative facts. It has the comedy back, it has good drama, and the music band thing was a big plus. Suginami's 100% evasion is something to miss though but it's still fine without it.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The weakest area of DC II. The story really has no backbone. There is some character development. But from what I have watched so far, nothing has changed at all! In nine episodes there has only been roughly 2 solid events: Koko's confession and the trip. 
 
Art: Based off a visual novel just like the previous two seasons, there is not much you can really say about the art work, except its well-drawn. Not that there are any significant differences in style. 
 
Sound: I was pleased with the songs in this season. I enjoyed the OP and ED song alot, as well as a few insert songs. The OST is exceptional so far, and I hope I'll be able to get my hands on it soon. 
 
Character: Not much of a difference between the casts of the First Da Capo and this one. Yes, they very much resemble their ancestors with slight differences. But I thought there are some unnecessary characters this time barely affecting the story at all. Nanaka and Koko are my favorite characters so far, the rest of the cast pretty much OK. 
 
Enjoyment: So far the series ranks an OK, I ll lets keep going, although sometimes I am reluctant. I usually can finish an episode in one sitting, but it actually took the course of almost half a day to a whole day to actually get back on track and resume. 
 
Overall: If it were not for the sound, this anime wouldve ranked much lower than I had reviewed the first season of Da Capo. Not much you can really say, that stands out. I guess this would be the standard for &quot;The Average High School Anime.&quot;

          
 
       Helpful I decided to change my review because I didn't liked it anymore, and I have other things to say now. 
 
Story 
I still say that I can't give the story higher then a 6. I think I'm going to sound very negative now, but I can't help it, sorry. The story is just.. boring! The whole series is about the Koko x Yoshiyuki relationship which isn't going anywhere! We also see some episodes about Minatsu, again, I'm not really interested, but other people can like it. After some episodes I was really forcing myself to watch it.. Like I said, one word: B-O-R-I-N-G. 
 
Art 
I can say something good about this, at least.. There's nothing wrong with the art, we could also see that in the other Da Capo series. Bright colors, nice characterdesign, you can see that this anime is kinda new, that's a good thing, isn't it? 
 
Sound/Seiyuu's 
Nothing wrong with the sound, you can hear it very bright, so.. we can't say bad things about that either. But now we come to the seiyuu's. Some of them.. ANNOY ME! 
Examples: 
Yoshiyuki: If my boyfriend had a voice like that, I would say: Goodbye! That was really harsh, isn't it? Okay, maybe I won't, if I would really love the guy. 
Minatsu: The most annoying voice ever, does she always have a cold or something?! Maybe her seiyuu was sick or something?! 
 
The rest of them, they're fine. Some of them are really good, others are normal, think you understand me, right? 
 
Character 
I like most of Da Capo II's characters. Good ones: Otome, Yume, Nanaka, Anzu, Sakura and the rest who aren't with the bad ones. Bad ones: Yoshiyuki, Koko, Minatsu. Why I don't like Yoshiyuki, Koko and Minatsu? They are the worst main characters they could choose, and the story is mostly about them. Yoshiyuki is way too dense. Koko is annoying and thinks that Yoshiyuki always will see her as the first place, selfish brat. Minatsu acts like she don't need help, so people will feel sorry for her. And WTF is the thing with the bananas? I mean, she (Minatsu) says that she hates them, but she needs to eat them to survive. I mean.. BANANAS! How do they think of something so stupid! Did they ask the greengrocer for help when they thought of this! Horrible.. That this still can get a 7 is because of the 'good ones', and because I'm way to nice! :-) 
 
Enjoyment 
Do you like boring stories with two people who are in a relationship which never will work out? Do you like robots and bananas? Then Da Capo II is the anime for you! Okay, forget what I said.. I can't believe that this crap is from the same makers as the other Da Capo series. Where is the drama?! Even the end s*ckt very badly! We don't know anything yet... I'm not sure if I want to watch the second season of this, it needs to be VERY good otherwise I will drop it right away. But maybe some people enjoyed this, I don't know, I think that there was a episode where Nanaka sings, that one wasn't very bad. 
 
Overall 
I'm sure some of you are wondering why I gave such good notes, because I was really negative if you ask me. 1. I'm way too nice.. 2. Other people may like it, I wanted to watch at their point of view a little..  
My real OPINION: I wasted my damn time on this sh*t! BUT, I'll give the second season ONE chance, maybe they will make up for the crappy story/ending and all the other things. If they won't, I wasted my time even more.  
 
Thanks for spending your time to read this review! Some of you didn't expected Erisu to go evil, neh? :-)

(Extended review) This is honestly my number one favorite Anime of all time. What makes this anime so great isn't the complexity of the story, on the contrary the fact that it's so simple makes me love this Anime. Overlord takes an old idea and makes it a masterpiece in it's own right. The story makes the title makes sense, Aniz Ooal Gown is as actual Overlord and during his fights the only reason why he doesn't destroy his enemy in one shot is to gain knowledge of the new world he's in. He's fighting to build up knowledge instead of power or money, he's also trying to gain a reputation so he can try to contact other people that may be trapped in the world with him, which I found to be interesting. Depending on how you like your main characters this can make or break you, if you like overpowered main characters that AREN'T 14 years old than this may be for you. However, if you want to see a long drawn out story where someone gets stronger through hard and rigorous training TURN AROUND and watch Kenichi Mightiest Disciple or something. 
 
this could be 9/10 or 3/10 but still my favorite anime.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING 
-So Overlord is one of those animes that should be great, a kids wet dream. Who doesnt want to be the Lich King from WOW or as op as One Punch Man? Its a very unique idea to play as the final boss of a game rather than the ones trying to get to the final boss (like Sword Art Online). 
 
-The problem with this anime is its poor execution in every way. 
 
There is 0 character development. Some reviewers have mentioned that the main characters humanity seems to be slowly slipping away by the end of the show but that would mean that he had an emotional range to begin with. He is bland and hypocritical throughout. At one point even referring to the fact that this is so. This doesnt make it any less frustrating. At one point our main character is masquerading as a common adventurer and joins an up and coming guild while hiding his true power (just like Sword Art Online) and then 3 episodes later after hearing countless minues of these characters interact they are all slaughtered and the main character does not even care. Passively mentioning that he had just met them. It makes the 3 episodes of their development completely pointless and makes the ""Overlord"" far less sympathetic. 
 
-There is a long list of supporting characters and their designs are mostly interesting such as lolita vampires, tsundere succubus, A nazi changeling who cracks jokes, etc. But the characters are all one dimensional-they spend all of the show praising the main character, even at the end when one of them betrays the group she still praises the main characters power during the battle. It is incredibly dull and does nothing to diversify their interests or motivations. If you have a thing for large breasted characters though the head guardian will certainly please, constantly trying to get a skeleton mind you, to have sex with her. 
 
-The story is nonexistent. The main character was the head of large guild in an MMO and then gets stuck in it after shutdown for reasons that are never explained. What happened to his body? Who knows? who cares apparently. There are at least 5 instances where the main character talks about putting the castle that he lords over on high alert or concealing it from enemies which sounds good on paper but during the course of the show there is never an enemy introduced who could defeat his subordinates let alone penetrate his castle. By the end of the show we still havent met any additional human characters stuck in the game, he has not conquered any portion of the world, and has not learned any meaningful new power or ability. In short nothing actually happens except they get a giant hamster, walk around a village stopping small fry, and fight amongst each other (the 2 episode end fight) for reasons that are never clearly explained.  
 
-I wanted to like this show so much and maybe a season 2 would speed things up for me and make it more interesting but as of season 1 i can not recommend this show to anyone except those who are fans of fanservice and the general idea of people getting stuck in video games. 
 
-The biggest problem with this show that I simply cant get around is it is so dull. There are 4 ""real"" fights in this 13 episode show and during these fights the characters spend as much time talking about how great and unstoppable they are rather than doing anything interesting. There is no suspense when you know that our protagonist can obliterate everyone on a whim if he so chooses-which he often does not. Instead it takes 15 minutes for the use of one or two spells that would have ended the fight in mere seconds. For a show called Overlord you would think there would be more lording and less walking around and talking which is simply not the case.

The characters are the best are very well done. Wonderful anime, the best anime I've ever seen. The story is incredible. 
 
The animations are of a wonderful quality, the soundtrack is flawless. The art of animation is really good. The best I've ever seen.

OVERLORD is the best anime I've ever seen.

One night Amu makes a wish that she would have the courage to be reborn as her ""would-be"" self. The next morning Amu finds three brightly colored eggs—red, blue, and green—in her bed. Each egg eventually hatches into a Guardian Character: Ran, Miki, and Su. Guardian Characters are angel-like beings that aid a person into becoming their ""would-be"" selves and fulfill the person's dreams. The Guardian Characters accomplish this by giving encouragement and advice, but they can also temporarily change a person's personality and abilities. With the Guardian Characters, Amu's life becomes much more complex as she now struggles to deal with her new personalities and the Seiyo Elementary Guardians—a student council group where each member has their own Guardian Character—who recruits Amu to search for and seal the X eggs and X Characters, corrupted forms of people's dreams.","['Comedy', 'Magic', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The main protagonist of the story, Amu Hinamori, is a female student attending Seiyo Elementary. At first glance, her classmates refer to her attitude and appearance as ""cool and spicy"" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her ""would-be"" self, and the next morning, she finds three brightly colored eggs—pink, blue, and green—in her bed. These eggs hatch into three fairy-like guardians called ""Shugo Charas"" (Guardian Characters): Ran (pink), Miki (blue), and Su (green). The Guardian Characters aid Amu in discovering who she truly is and help fulfil Amu's dreams. Amu's life becomes much more complex, as she struggles to deal with her ""would-be"" selves and Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who each have a Guardian Character of their own. People with Guardian Characters can ""chara-nari"" (character transform) or ""character change"". Each transformation has special powers, mainly for attacking or defending. Character changes have special powers too, but have more practical uses. Later on, they recruit Amu as the ""Joker"" to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of people's dreams, so the Guardians can purify their dreams. In Japanese, the egg is shortened.
Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs, in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.
Later on in the series, a fourth (yellow) egg named Diamond is born. Unlike Amu's other Guardian Characters, she is only seen a few times in the series. Due to Amu's mixed feelings before Diamond was born, she becomes an X character and is ""stolen"" by idol singer Hoshina Utau, who uses Diamond to character change for her concerts, planned by Easter as part of their plan to get the Embryo. Later on, Diamond is purified and becomes a regular Guardian Character. She would then appear in times of heavy crisis.
","The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever. 
 
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo. 
 
The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season. 
 
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline. 
 
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen. 
 
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu. 
 
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show. 
 
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!  
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in her bed. 
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!  
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).  
 
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time! 
 
Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to! 
 
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p 
 
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice. 
 
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself. 
 
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime. 
 
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

          
 
       Helpful (My First Review) 
 
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”. 
 
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character. 
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian. 
 
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream. 
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.  
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time. 
 
Art: 7.5/10 
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good. 
 
Sound: 7.5/10 
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.

 The Story has elements of suspense and drama, but ultimately is a coming of age type of story. Missing an ending. 
 
 Protagonist is definitely one of the most fleshed out characters I have ever seen. His internal conflict is one that many face, and the anime does a great job of detailing his character in such a concise amount of episodes. The supporting characters are memorable, but for the most part cliched. 
 
Art and Sound are good Quality, with the art being outstanding in terms of direction and audience engagement. 
 
Enjoyability: 100%

          
 
       Helpful Story: Think No Game No Life combined with Btooom. It's a psychological anime, yet it's unique. It doesn't even have any serious tragedy. Even those who are not into mindf@&# -like myself- will enjoy this. 
It's about a bunch of kids who can't adapt in the real world being warped into a mirror image of the world and told to participate in games with their lives at stake. These games  are different to what any one might expect from an anime like this and actually make sense and are exiting. You would find a cliff hanger of sorts at the centre of each episode which will make your heart go crazy and your eyes will be practically glued to the screen. However dispite it being unique in many ways there still are plenty of similiar story lines so one might find it to be a bit of a rip-off. (9) 
 
Art: The art is pretty and unlike most anime of the genre; doesn't have this dark and scary feeling. You'll find blood and gore in this show to some extent, but it won't colour your vision. It emphasizes on light and harmony in colours, bringing forth brilliant details, but for an anime of this era it isn't particularly spectacular. (8) 
 
Sound: This is a bit of a let down. The sound is fine and you could say unique, but still not particularly interesting. The voices of the characters aren't the cutsy type you normally get, nor the rough types you sometimes get, but something in between - but closer to the rough type- and have the proper emotions in place. This however is not enough to make them enjoyable. There is no OP and the ED is a simple piano stereotypical Alice in Wonderland tune, but it's quite fitting really. (7) 
 
Characters: The characters are all different and you can see the layers they might be hiding and the psychological strain they are under. They make some progress and discover their hidden abilities -like observation not like a rasengan or stuff-, but it doesn't take long as expected from a three episode long anime. Despite all this the characters are still all quite stereotypical: you get the wimp, the strong guy, the smart observant guy and etc. (6) 
 
Enjoyment: The enjoyment is a lot more than what you'd expect from a three episode long OVA. As a matter of fact it's absolutely perfect. You will find yourself getting the whole story well enough despite the few episodes, but still craving for more. (10) 
 
Genre: Action & Psychological. 
Non-existing Genre: Tragedy.

          
 
       Helpful What a disappointment 
 
Actually Alice in Borderlands is one or my favorite manga, enjoy reading each chapter, it has been a while since I read the manga, so I wanted to see these 3 ovas to see how, after all for my Alice in Bordelands it was a great and I knew that, despite being 3 ovas, it could be a good thing from there (well I was wrong). 
 
The story does not change much, Arisu Ryohei, tired of his life and with an inferiority complex by his brother, appears in another world with his 2 friends after seeing some fireworks, in the ""new world"" (which is equal to the Earth, but without many people) there are some survival games in which Arisu will have to participate to survive, the plot is simple, but it can unleash many possibilities, but the pacing is terrible, the plot rushes so much that we can not get to Psychologically understand the characters or their actions, the ovas only take advantage that they are a game of death to play great and develop them well (that is a good point that the eggs have at least) and then forget everything else, it shows due to the emphasis to make each game fit a game and making their preparations, which does not work because the grace that the games had was to see how the protagonists faced the games in a psychological way and in a way Inamica, while here they only focused on making the game great, leaving a kind of ""style over substance"", since the reflections and deductions of the characters completely dislodge due to the inconsistency that the ovas had to prioritize and retract the games ( it takes very little time to explain correctly and dynamically). 
 
The last game was the one I gave the most hope, but the flask forward (as opposed to flask back) that were recurrent in the chapter made the majority of the chapter's dialogue meaningless and explicitly let you understand that something wrong It was going to happen (which is a simple way to put tension although with everything, this game was the one that best treated the tension), without the need to resort to psychological immersion, which generates, although all the games are raised in a way correct, the latter in particular could have developed in a great way, but the little immersion with the characters and the fact that we could not get into their mentality makes their deaths do not feel like something emotional or that has weight (although the soundtrack did a good job in general), so, despite the good approach, the development was mediocre. 
 
The characters are where the ovas weakest, in the manga the characters are undoubtedly their best element (especially Arisu), due to the duration of the ovas the characters are very poor, you can not get to emphasize with any due to the emphasis that is only given to the games and in the ingenious way to solve them, it is not at the end of the third game where you can get to understand the feelings of the characters, but that only serves to generate an emotional scene where friends of Arisu die, if not for that reason the characters never managed to express themselves correctly, the exposition of deep themes is very superficial and pretentious (we never really get to know much about Arisu's past or why Chouta feels a loading, they are only vague themes presented in a superficial way), so the exposition of themes is superficial and does not complement the characters due to their poor presentation in the chapters (although I always I talk about character designs in other reviews, here I have nothing to say, it is normal), the characters besides being poor do not get to express their personality well nor can we see great relationships with each other (which is a contradiction taking in mind that they are best friends), so outside the protagonist the other characters become very boring due to their little time on screen (it provides very badly the exhibition of characters, something that did not happen in the manga). 
 
The animation is normal, although the scenarios are very muted and low in color that they use to express more the dark tone of the ovas themselves, outside of that the transitions are mediocre and the facial gestures too, the animation does not help to focus the viewer on certain aspects, at least the animation is not as bad as you might think at the beginning, it just does not meet decent standards. 
 
The end of the ovas only leaves the viewer anxious, forcing him to read the manga, which makes it a concise ending, but with clear intentions, I really find that these ovas were totally wasted, the manga being a work that gives much emphasis to psychological aspects and the ingenuity of the games, the anime only gave emphasis to the ""ingenuity"" of the games (since the few that appear are not the big deal), well, a short review, if I don't talk about other aspects of the ovas it is because it is irrelevant, I really would not recommend these ovas to anyone, or to someone who would like an anime about people in a survival game because in the end and seeing it in retrospect it is likely that there are not many things either good to get out of this animation

Sometime in future Japan, androids have been involved in every aspect of people's lives. One day, upon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the ""people"" in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?"". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, ""The Time of Eve"". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.
The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.
","We humans are in fact similar to androids in many aspects. We are programmed in our genes and minds to feel emotions, love, and apprehension. If our amygdalas, the parts of our brains responsible for emotions, were removed, our behavior would be along the lines of an android with a ring on its head in Eve no Jikan. As we saw in Eve no Jikan, the androids, when given the chance, will show human-like emotions and feelings for those around them. With the added fact that the androids look and act identical to humans, we must ask ourselves: in the future, will there be any differences between humans and androids? 
 
Eve no Jikan had a very ""contemporary modern"" feel with the cafe, artwork, androids, and soundtrack. What is known as pop culture today is not evident in Eve no Jikan; instead, the setting had a very tranquil and creative mood.  
 
Eve no Jikan's artwork was very unique in that scenes were shown in more of a fixed camera point of view as opposed to the point of view of the characters. The artwork was very consistent and devoid of blemishes. The voice acting and soundtrack were also very considerable. The influence of the piano in both the plot and the soundtrack is very creative; the piano is not only a symbol of an ultramodern theme but also a symbol of emotion. 
 
Eve no Jikan was a very engaging anime that had a lot of big ideas incorporated into its plot. The ultimate questions regarding the relationships between humans and robotic humans are presented in a very discussable and arguable manner.  
 
Please refer to other peer reviews if you are looking for a plot summary.

The Time of Eve is a café hidden well beneath the towering skyscrapers of Japan in the near future. As the customer opens the door to the café, a bell rings signaling their arrival. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy save for a little girl running around and calling herself a cat. A couple cuddles with each other and whispers sweet nothings into each other's ears. A man is sitting on a couch reading a book. With a bright smile, a woman greets the customer and welcomes the customer into their second home. With an order, the customer asks for a coffee to be brought at their table. It is warm, fragrant, and sweet. Before the café owner leaves, she asks that the customer treats every as equal. Of course, the customer would be happy to oblige...but for some, this is easier said than done, especially when that customer lives in a world where he or she is taught that humans will always be superior to robots. 
 
This is Time of Eve: The Movie, a film that rightfully deserves more recognition as one of the more superior anime films based on pre-existing TV anime and/or OVAs. The way the café is portrayed in the film could be an appropriate metaphor for the film as a whole. It's a quiet movie that slid under the radar of most anime fans, but through the help of some outside sources, my interest in the movie was piqued. Keep in mind that I did not watch the Time of Eve OVAs prior to watching this film, so whatever knowledge I have of the series is solely based on the film. 
 
One of the greatest achievements of the movie's story is that it makes the viewer grow along with the protagonists. I noticed myself warming up to the androids as much as the main characters did and felt a brief, small sense of betrayal when I found out which characters were androids. I think that that is part of a test that the movie is trying to bring upon the viewers as well as the two main characters, Rikuo and Masaki: try to get to know a person not by what they are, but who they are. The fact that this mirrors the way judgement is clouded in the real world by racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice is almost chilling. The robots even have rings over their heads so humans can identify them as such. If those rings were to be eliminated, no one could tell one from the other. The movie takes most, if not all of its time to make the main duo divert from the public norm and start embracing these robots as their companions rather than furniture. 
 
Another thing about the movie that caught my eye is that there are prevalent occurrences of television advertisements in the movie as distributed by the ""Ethics Committee"" that keeps a strict watch on all robot activity. The Committee airs these advertisements in an attempt to drill into people's heads that robots are machines and nothing more. This sort of ""Big Brother"" influence that the Committee has in the movie gives the world it takes place in an almost dystopian feel, making the secluded café a more precious setting than one should expect. 
 
As for the main characters themselves, Rikuo's development into his final opinion on the robots is more or less straight-forward, making him a sort of bland character, but Masaki proves to be the one to have more difficulty handling the situation, making him the more complex character between the two. The different levels of development eventually balance the two out, giving them enough chemistry to add dramatic flair to some of the film's more heart-wrenching scenes. The moral conflicts between the two, in addition to the other characters' moral support, make for a story that's just as touching as it is introspective. 
 
For an anime film that was released only a year ago, the animation isn't astoundingly beautiful, but there are some parts of the film that are nice to look at, like some of the computers when put into use and the inside of some of the buildings in the city. Some pieces of the café are rendered in CGI, which doesn't look bad when placed next to the 2D characters and makes for some interesting camera angles, but it's pretty obvious that those pieces are done in CG. The fact that the film is colored in an almost monochromatic tone makes for some slightly uninteresting animation. The animation isn't bad; it's just a little bland. This is a movie that you should try to watch for the story more than the art. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by the voice acting in this movie. Half the cast doesn't sound all that anime-esque, which made the performances all the more believable. The right voices were chosen for each of the androids in the movie, down to some of the older models that were featured. It made the older robots sound human, but detached enough to make them sound like they don't know how to carry on a conversation with another being. There's more of a layer of realism in that than the newer, more human-looking androids. Some of the more comedic scenes have some of the most rapid-fire conversation I've ever heard in an anime. It was almost like the characters were having a tennis match with their words. Speaking of which, the scene where Akiko is introduced is something that must be seen to be believed. While the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is distractingly unbalanced. Some of it is good, but the synth in it is so blatant that it tries to make some of the most touching moments seem melodramatic. Fortunately, the ending theme is performed by Kalafina, who are also known for performing the theme songs to the Kara no Kyoukai films and both seasons of Kuroshitsuji. The song is rather pleasant and the lyrics tie in to the main theme of the film well. If it weren't for the soundtrack, the audio would have been ranked a point higher. 
 
I really want to give this film a 9, but i can't seem to find it in my heart to do so. Looking back at this film, I know I'm going to remember it, but not well enough to make me say, ""Wow, was that a great film,"". Even though this is cliché, to answer the film's eponymous question, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?""... 
 
Yes, yes I did, but it don't think I'll be coming back for a while. Maybe I'll like it more when I do decide to visit it again. Only time will tell.

          
 
       Helpful When thinking of science fiction concepts, images of futuristic technology and the vast frontier of space are the first things that comes to mind. Arguably the most popular item in the former category is that of the robot. A machine that exists to serve a person or perform a designated function is nothing short of useful and can almost be seen as necessary depending on the setting of the story. Upping the ante are androids, ""advanced"" versions of robots that take on a human-like appearance. Though they have an advanced AI system and they can look as real as you or me, they are still machines bound by the 3 Laws of Robotics (not harming a human, obey human orders, protect its own existence). But how well defined are the 3 Laws? That's what Time of Eve wishes to explore over the course of its run time. 
 
Time of Eve is a film that, like the androids of the movie, masquerades its depth early on. In a ""not too distant future"", androids are seen serving humans in daily tasks and treated no different than any other kind of machine one would use. Adding to this is the propaganda created by the Ethics Committee, a group that has roots in radical anti-robot activities. Serving as a stark contrast to the outside world is the cafe known as the Time of Eve, a hidden location where these androids meet to talk and have coffee. In the outside world, androids have to have a pink halo above their heads constantly to let the world know they are robots. The cafe's golden rule goes against this, saying that all androids must turn off their halo as to not form any discrimination.  You would think that even with the halos off, identifying androids would still be quite easy due to robot mannerisms. However, the androids themselves change quite a bit when in the cafe, with personalities and behavior that strikes closer to being made of flesh than metal. It becomes a guessing game observing each customer, wondering who is real and who isn't.  
 
This is what ultimately makes Time of Eve so interesting to watch. The androids of the future aren't a weapon of mass destruction or some perfect human - rather, they are robots that use this independence as a way of better serving their designated master. They learn by observing others and they too have things that make them happy or sad. Just look at the bizarre love triangle of Koji and Rina or the absolutely heartbreaking story of Katoran. Though it is sci-fi on the outside, it's a slice of life at heart - personal stories are shared amidst coffee and the atmosphere of the cafe. Despite the laid back tone it sets, the film is not free from conflict. The main characters Rikuo and Masaki both have had their share of robot problems in the past, planting seeds of jealousy and distrust in their minds. Coupled with a society that condemns humans for seeing androids as more than mindless servants, they can't be blamed for their suspicion of this grey area. It takes the efforts of bartender Nagi and the histories of the customers to sway their opinion. 
 
What makes this film enjoyable stems from how the minds of the androids work. The androids are still bound by the three Laws of Robotics, but they try to grasp as much they can from around these laws. Lying, for instance, doesn't fall under this rule. Yet with all these nifty loopholes the androids have found, they use this towards better providing service to their owners/masters. It forms a strangely heartwarming experience, seeing how these robots wish to be seen as caring loving people instead of emotionless distant machines. With every law examined, it brings up questions of ethics not just for the characters but for the viewer. Is it OK to lie now if it brings something better in the future? Can you follow an order at the cost of hurting another? What appears as a basic human rights campaign is actually that of philosophy. 
 
The film is also a joy to watch due to its excellent pacing. It is told in a series of vignettes, and when director Yasuhiro Yoshiura feels a scene is over, he smartly cuts away or lets it fade into the next one. With a lot of ground to cover in just an hour and 40 minutes, we are given just enough to feel the impact of the characters without them growing tiresome. By the time the movie ended, it left me wanting even more and even feeling a bit upset there was no Season 2 or continuation. As quickly as I learned about this futuristic world, I left it with just as many questions as I started with. Even if there never will be a follow up, Time of Eve exists comfortably in its own world and can work just fine standing alone. 
 
A few problems do impact this film. A little bit of suspension of belief is needed to get into its world setting. I don't think that a future like this with near-human androids would be met with such backlash. Additionally, as human as the androids act, they are still programmable and as complex as the feelings that these robots show, they are still ultimately artificial. Yoshiura's directing style can also be yay or nay with some. His camera angles shift between first and third person quite often and frequently use a motion blur effect. Though it makes scenes more dynamic (I personally loved it), its alternative style can be distasteful to some (and could possibly invoke motion sickness)!  
 
The art style is a mix of 2D and 3D. This can usually be disastrous, but with a smart director (and a decent movie-sized budget), it gives the scenes more depth. In Time of Eve, there's no clash in these styles and things lay naturally in space. I like the character designs in particular - they're not particularly ""loud"" with huge expressions and distorted features but not plain enough to make it seem like a forgettable mid-2000's title. Outside of the typical ""anime feature"" of highly detailed eyes, I could probably see these character models as real people, from their noses to their hairstyles. The movie does fair audio-wise. Aside from the pleasing credits song ""I have a dream"", the soundtrack is more or less sound effects and short pieces to enhance a mood. The voice actors also did a good job in this film, in particular the main characters with a down to earth and realistic tone (though the mania that Yukana gives Akiko is loved as well). 
 
With this in mine, I give Time of Eve a 7/10. I admit that I was a bit skeptical on starting the movie, thinking it was going to be one of ""robot rebellion"" or overtly preachy. What I got was a mature film that was as welcoming and relaxed as the atmosphere in Nagi's cafe. Fans of shows like Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou will adore this movie, as well as sci-fi fans who are looking for something different than a thriller. On every object in the cafe, it asks if ""you are enjoying the Time of Eve?"" I certainly can say I did. 
 
Do you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review. 
 
Thanks for reading and have a blessed day!

Together they completed events and quests, along with their new friends Ouka, Mirelle, Hotaru, and Sanjuro. Soon after, mysterious monsters appeared, and death by these monsters caused players to slip into a coma in the real world. Only Shugo and Rena can solve this problem, but why are they being targeted, and what secrets is the game hiding? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Set in a fictional MMORPG called The World, the series follows twins Shugo and Rena. After winning a contest, Rena is given a pair of chibi avatars in the design of the legendary .hackers, Kite and BlackRose. After an odd occurrence, a mysterious AI named Aura gives Shugo the Twilight Bracelet, an item that both aids and hinders him. Rena and Shugo embark on an adventure to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.
Along the way, Shugo and Rena befriend Mireille, a rare item hunter; the fierce Ouka; and Hotaru, a peaceful girl. While waiting for an event to start, they encounter a strange girl named Zefie, who is lured to Shugo because she believes the bracelet smells like her mother, Aura. It is later realized that Zefie is a vagrant AI – an AI that acts independently outside the parameters of the game. Zefie's presence upsets many, including the Cobalt Knights, a group of administrators that follow the rule ""If you can't control it, delete it"" to an extreme.
Meanwhile, Balmung, another administrator in The World, encounters problems of his own. The suits, CC Corp's upper tier executives, are displeased with what little action Balmung has taken against Shugo and his illegal item, the Twilight Bracelet. Balmung's administrative duties are revoked.
Kamui, the leader of the Cobalt Knights, begins her pursuit of Shugo and company. She captures Shugo and his friends, but allows Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru to leave after they promise they will not interfere with the workings of The World. Shugo, Rena, and Zefie are left in a cell together. Rena and Shugo disagree over whether to stay until the end. After they come to an agreement to stay and fight, Zefie opens the door to the cell, freeing them.
In the outside world, Ouka, Hotaru, and Mireille decide to return to The World and help Shugo. Kazu, a friend of Balmung, meets up with Shugo and party, carrying ""Helba's Key,"" the key to an area called the Net Slums. Kamui shows up, demanding the key to the Net Slums with her knights in tow. Shugo and Kamui face off, which results in Kamui breaking her axe. Zefie tells her that everyone in The World is blessed. Shugo activates Helba's key and transports himself, Rena, Mireille, Hotaru, and Zefie to the Net Slums. Once at the Net Slums, the party is confronted by Balmung, refuses to allow the party to proceed to Aura unless Shugo can damage him. Shugo struggles, but manages to strike Balmung. Pleased, Balmung hands Shugo the virus cores he'll need to see Aura; he also explains that only three people can go see Aura. Hotaru and Mireille say their goodbyes to Zefie, Shugo, and Rena as they activate the virus cores and meet Aura. The manga ends with Zefie being reunited with her mother, and Shugo telling Aura of his adventures in The World.
","To start things off with a negative, after watching .Hack//Sign, .Hack//Legend of the Twilight really fell short to expectations. 
 
The story begins with two young teenage kids winning the opportunity to play as the two Legendary dot hackers Kite and BlackRose. Shugo the older brother playing the role as Kite and Rena playing the as Blackrose. Rena recruits her older brother to ""The World"" and they soon find themselves lured into various dangers throughout their online journey. 
 
The story of .Hack//Legend of the Twilight Bracelet really felt dumbed down since its last series .Hack//Sign. It's strange to see the significant difference between the two shows since they both take place in the same universe, but I digress. The first five episodes really are just there for gags and laughs with plenty of fan service to be had. Think it's due to the complaints of .Hack//Sign being too boring for most audiences. I mean, girls being pets, and sisters kissing brothers; heavens me. 
 
Sometimes, it felt like too much. In later episodes the only dialogue you'd hear from Rena was ""ONIIIII-CHAAAAN"" and ""ONIII-CHAAAAN"" and all of the above. Which leads me to the characters of the show. This series lacks character development and you can see hardly any change from either from beginning to end. It was such a change from .Hack//Sign, the characters there actually showed substantial change through events. 
 
The music isn't anything great. The opening's ""alright"" with its cheerful tune and upbeat lah-dee-dahs, but the actual shows OST's a tad bitter. The only real song I felt something for was the ED which had some beautiful lyrics. It's to be expected, since it was performed and written by See-Saw (The ones who did the OP and ED for .Hack//Sign.) 
 
The animation's pretty good I suppose. It features more childlike looking characters rather than adult. Things are bright and lush with a pallet of different fruitful colors. It's just average, nothing to really report about it.  
 
All in all .Hack//Legend of the Twilight's not a bad series; it's just not very good. If you'd like to follow the story of the previous titles then go ahead and watch, but if you don't I wouldn't see any reason to.

          
 
       Helpful Let me start off by saying this is my first review. Also .hack//Legend of the Twilight, was the first and only .hack series I have seen. 
 
Story (4/10): 
As a stand alone, much of the story didn't make much sense, and it wasn't the beginning that was so confusing. The beginning was rather interesting. Two siblings using a virtual game to stay in touch. It's what happens in the game that makes it so difficult to understand the plot. Throughout the entire anime, they hint at previous disasters and important events that have since past. For an avid .hack fan, it probably wouldn't have been a problem. As a first time viewer, so many aspects of the game weren't properly explained, so it was nearly impossible for me to connect to the plot and root for the survival of the characters. 
 
Art (7/10): 
The art by itself wasn't too shabby. The colors were bright, the characters were cute. Typical online games have pretty looking avatars. Overall though, it didn't quite match the story. When offline, I found it annoying how they would never show the eyes of the real people. 
 
Sound (8/10): 
I actually quite liked the sound. The opening was very catchy, if not a little too upbeat, and most of the music in game is what you would expect from an MMORPG. The ending, however, just sounds so soft and sad, and I can't make up my mind as to if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 
Characters (6/10): 
The characters weren't cliche or stereotypical, but I didn't fall in love with any of them. Shugo just wasn't all that likable although he had plenty of good qualities. Rena was fun character to watch, while Mireille was extremely annoying. Enough so that one character almost made me drop this series. The AIs were mostly underdeveloped and confusing. For people who've only seen this series, like me, we fail to see how the AIs are developed and just how/why they are so important to the game. 
 
Enjoyment (4/10): 
It was a pretty confusing and un-enjoyable show, although it did have some funny and cool sequences. I, however, think they should have either made this into more of a sequel or more of a stand alone, because as it stands, it doesn't seem to satisfy anyone. 
 
Overall (6/10): 
It was not the worst anime I've ever seen, but with a confusing story, unique, but not altogether likable characters, and art that doesn't match the tone of the story, this is a fair anime at best. For avid .hack fans though, they might enjoy another excursion into the world of .hack. For people who've never seen a .hack series before, I definitely wouldn't recommend this show.

          
 
       Helpful So a little background: the .hack//Legend of the Twilight manga was possibly my first non-Toonami related anime/manga ever. I say possibly cuz it was a long ass time ago and I don't really remember, and it was such a long time ago that the whole reason I got the first volume of the manga was because my horny pubescent mind noticed the steamy full color ""pin-up"" inserts in the first couple of pages. Good thing my mom wasn't curious enough about Japanese culture to ask to take a look before buying. 
 
However, this turned out to be the one time in my life my dick coerced me into making a good decision - the manga was actually pretty enjoyable in its entirety, and I read the whole thing several times, completely taken in by that magic I spend all of my time as an anime watcher trying to capture more of. Now, some months later I see a familiar looking DVD sitting on the new releases shelf of a store. They made an anime adaptation of my favorite manga at the time, and I couldn't have been more excited to see the story and characters I liked in full color, motion, and sound. That wasn't really meant to be. You see, as it so happens the .hack//Legend of the Twilight was one of those short mediocre budget series more concerned with advertising the manga than it was with doing it justice. Evident by the fact that the studios couldn't wait a measly ten months for the manga to finish. 
 
This led to one of the most drastically changed anime adaptations I've ever seen. I'm not inherently opposed to this idea, since changes always bring the chance of some improvements (like parts of Fullmetal Alchemist), but the fact is that improvements are extremely unlikely and optimally shouldn't be prioritized over first doing a faithful adaption. In an ideal world we'd have our complete manga adaptations and then whatever extended universe/re-imagining series the studios wanted, but in the real world there are time, budgets, and profits to consider. 
 
To make a long story short, if you're a .hack fan interested in the Legend of the Twilight world and were only going to do the anime or the manga, then do the manga because it's far, far better. Or at the very least do both, because they're entirely different stories. They begin seemingly the same way: Shugo and Rena are siblings living under different parents who reconnect in the online game ""The World"" after winning avatars that look like previous legendary The World players. When they're attacked by a mysteriously invincible monster, Shugo is killed and revived after being given a special bracelet item by a girl named Aura. This bracelet can rewrite data in the game to weaken it, allowing Shugo to combat these new invincible monsters. Shugo and Rena try to play the game normally but are continuously disrupted by strange circumstances and more invincible monsters. With the help of new friends Mireille, Ouka, Hotaru, as well as systems administrator Balmung and his friend Sanjuro, they'll have to confront whatever is threatening The World. 
 
The anime's story majorly deviates from the manga early on when Rena disappears for half the series after being killed by one of the special monsters. It's around here we see that our main antagonists are a group of hacker children, which is very lame because aside from our villains being snobby brats their motives are also never fully explained, they basically never interact with our main characters directly, and in the end they're written out of the story like they never existed. Every once in a while they send an invincible monster after Shugo because his Twilight Bracelet threatens their plans, but they never seem to realize Shugo can just deus ex machina it with Data Drain and win every battle the same way. It's similarly annoying to see the other characters attack the self-regenerating monsters repeatedly even though they know from experience only Shugo can do anything. 
 
If you remember Shugo and Rena's relationship in the manga being far too affectionate for a brother and sister, then you're really going to shake when the incest dial is turned up even further in the anime. Shugo is downright in love with his sister this time, ogling her (or at least her player avatar) twice in the first two episodes, and literally half of Rena's dialogue in the entire series is her yelling ""onii-chaaaan!"" often several times in a row. It's only made creepier when you remember this sibling love is bordering on both of them experiencing the beginning of puberty at around 14 years old or so. Gross. 
 
When the ""search for Rena"" plot appears one of the anime's worst traits is made obvious: it likes to waste as much time as it can. It does most of this through a ton of long-takes (this is where the ""camera"" pans slowly across a scene, sometimes to get something across but in here for nothing usually) and redundant pointless scenes of Shugo and friends running around looking for Rena all over The World, which is a completely stupid idea because if she was in a normal area she would obviously be contactable or could just log out. This new plot also means the manga's cute minor one of reuniting Zefie with her mother is completely gone. All other characters return in mostly similar roles, but a new main character called Sanjuro replaces Zefie. He's some experienced samurai type who mentors and trains Shugo even though his bracelet is more unstoppable than any legitimate attack, and he's friends with Balmung and also realizes the danger coming to The World. 
 
Nothing in the anime really has much personal stake to it. The main antagonist is only revealed when the anime is almost over and is never even hinted at or lead into before then, and neither they or the child hackers have absolutely anything to do with Shugo or Rena besides them just happening to win the special costumes (which they also had nothing to do with). Literally Shugo's only reason to be involved with any of this is because Rena just happens to get kidnapped. Naturally, the side characters Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru, despite being far more likable than the two main characters have even less to do with anything that's happening and really don't help much at all when the story is all said and done. 
 
There's a terrible tendency for the show to introduce slapstick jokes at complete random and often totally inappropriate moments. The worst example is the series's running gag of having Shugo, who is seriously one of the dumbest, most helpless anime protagonists I've ever seen, constantly trip and run into things and break a tooth off (which is even kept in some subsequent scenes which looks ridiculous). In the climax of the anime when everything is doomed bla bla bla a total comic relief character barges in from the edge of this apocalyptic scene just to cry and scream and run into a wall like an idiot. I know Legend of the Twilight is obviously aimed at a younger audience, both anime and manga, but that doesn't mean kids are complete idiots who can't get engrossed into any drama. 
 
If there is a single good thing about the anime's story changes, it's that the plot is now much more dependent on it taking place inside of a game. It wouldn't take much at all to rewrite the manga to fit inside a typical fantasy world with actual magic and such. The biggest problem would be Shugo's bracelet rewriting code to linearly make monsters weaker, but it still wouldn't be hard to imagine it as some kind of transformation spell. This is relevant because it's inherently harder to take a story seriously inside a world that has less consequences than a ""real"" one. In the anime the elements of hackers and such mean it has much more to do with .hack's unique setting, which is the whole point of .hack to begin with. Despite this, there's constant logic holes where the writers failed to equate the logic of the game world with what's going on in the story. In one scene a hacker has already been caught by the CC Corporation staff, but instead of them just banning him instantly because this is all data and they have the controls to do that, they literally chase the hacker around a virtual town until they catch them physically. Also, how are completely fluid human movements made with just a regular game controller? They could've just said the headset has some mind-reading power for all I care since obviously the fictional technology is already highly advanced compared to ours. In one scene the administrators talk about monitoring log-in info to see who accessed servers, but when they're searching for Shugo and friends none of them think to just stand by and wait until Shugo logs in for the first time of the day before he reaches Mireille's hideout and just capture him there? Also, why is a hideout hidden from administrators. They're administrators, they should have access to everything. There are hundreds of things in the anime to nitpick like this, and it counts because it makes both the world incoherent and the ability to buy into it as a gamer difficult. Everything I wrote above could have been written around, but the writers were either lazy or not very clever. 
 
The series was made around the time when digital animation was starting to take over, and it shows the worst aspects of the format. The show is full of bright, solid colors that aren't shaded well at all and give it a very ""flash cartoon"" appearance, and there are frequent ""moeblob"" faces and other poor art flubs such as background characters having stick-thin or otherwise imbalanced limbs and screwed up faces. It's not an ugly anime, but it's not afraid to cut any corners. The backgrounds are painted though and look quite nice, with a lot of the fantasy architecture looking mystical with their odd color schemes yet friendly and inviting. 
 
The music is, oddly enough, easily the best part of the anime. It's not really something I'd listen to outside of the show, but it's a somewhat post-modern mix of influences. It's typically light and breezy as the setting and characters are, and there's everything from synthesizers, xylophone-centered jazz, orchestration, and even (the best parts) picopop with bossa nova-esque vocals. I really like the opening even though the lyrics are completely impenetrable even by general anime standards, and the ending song and the short beautifully surreal visual sequence is literally my favorite part of the entire series. No joke. 
 
As for the dub vs. sub thing, it's a weird situation. Normally it's cut and dry whether a dub is worth checking out because either the studio cares or it doesn't, but in this case the casting is acceptable to great (both Steve Blum and Crispin Freeman as main characters) yet the voice you hear the most is absolutely horrendous. Bryce Papenbrook as Shugo is unbelievably aggravating, with constant shrill shrieks of whining and screaming for Rena like a complete teenage baby. It's absolutely maddening, and I don't know how someone thought this was an acceptable performance. It makes his moronic, childish personality even more grating. I guess try the dub and see if you can last ten seconds of Shugo's ballistic babbling because if you can tolerate it the rest is solid. 
 
But as a whole, I just don't want to recommend this to anyone. A serious .hack fan will watch it anyway and to them I only recommend to read the manga as well. Those on the fence should definitely just read the manga, where the main character personalities are far less annoying and every supporting character is used in the plot much more thoroughly. The story stays charming in its lack of severity which suits the more child-friendly tone of the art design and gentle characters, while the anime goes for broke on dramatic effect when it doesn't fit its surroundings and thus can't be taken very seriously. It also goes to mention its complete lack of depth, relevance to the series and its characters as a whole, and extremely vague explanations of events and character motivations, and almost every character is exactly the same at the end as they are at the beginning. It's a very uneven and loose story for something so short, while the manga stays within the modest confines the short length allows. Neither seem important to the overarching .hack story as a whole, so don't let thoughts of that sway your decisions. If Shugo went to my middle school I'd bully him.

Story 
Not a racing show like one might think. In other words this not a substitute for NASCAR racing. This show is more adaption with technology on cars and making sure everything 'runs' smoothly. Introduction was okay. Not quite a good transition from the prequel but upon watching the show you get the 'idea', which i took at as a time lapse. As for the conclusion beautiful. Not only does it go along with the purpose of the company in the show but the win wasn't settled in a common gloves off fashion. Confused by symbolism  think of dukes that should help. 
 
Art 
-beautifully done. 
-with the vehicles being the highlight of the show they did a good job with detail. 
-One of the drawing features they did that i enjoyed that was comical was the pin points eyes  from time to time character Endou, Lorna had. 
 
Sound- nothing worth noting 
 
Character 
-while the characters are indeed different from the original show the shame attributes are there. Lorna, is kind and smart. While her partner Lisa is reckless and rough. 
- If you came for comedy i suggest keeping tabs on lisa. While other characters are comical in their own fashion i feel most jokes involved lisa. 
 
Enjoyment:Why should i watch this show? I could say because i am telling you to. Not because i am being paid (*sigh, i am not). You should watch this for the powerful message behind it. I wont be very direct nor will i be distant with my explanation. The message is similar to how modern life reacts towards animals and babies but in terms of cars instead. Both are valuable and should be treated with careful consideration. Sure, one could 'drive' one of them to a higher level but because they can't see the proper emotions they have they would be doing more harm then good.

          
 
       Helpful When I first heard about this anime I thought It was going to be similar to Wangan Midnight, with street racing and tons of cars. I was wrong.  
 
Story: A future where cars are controlled by computers, and a team of gasoline powered classic car drivers chase them down when they go haywire, sounds like a very repetitive plot. But it turn out it's not, I wont ruin the plot, so ill just say there's events that keep the plot going. 
 
Art: The animation has a very 'mid-90s' feel to it, which isn't a  bad thing. The thing I like most is the cars. The animators did very well making the vehicals realistic. 
 
Sound: Now, I don't know if it was the copy I had or the series itself, but the quality at times was, not the best out there. To me it sounded fuzzy and almost like the voice actors where talking through a thick foam pad. But like I said I don't know if it was my copy or not so don't take the sound to seriously. 
 
Characters: Each character has there own defined personality and unique style to how they get the mission done. (Not much to say on that one) 
 
Enjoyment: For a six episode series (plus a movie) it's not a bad watch in your down time between other anime.

          
 
       Helpful When I saw this was written by Kōsuke Fujishima, author of “Oh My Goddess!” and “You're Under Arrest”, I became mildly interesting in eX-Driver. I've found parts in his other series kinda fun, so I went into this hoping to get some fun out of it too. After watching it, I can see why this wasn't as popular as his other woks. 
 
Set at some point in the 22nd century, people no longer drive cars themselves, instead of relying on a computer with an artificial intelligence to drive for them. But when the AI systems start losing control, a team call eX-Drivers (or eX-D for short) are formed, driven by actual drivers, chase down the cars that have gone crazy. 
 
And at this point is where I started asking questions about the premise for it's plot. 
 
How is there no one in the future that can drive a car besides the eX-Drivers? Are there no car enthusiasts that want the authentic experience? No people who don't trust the automated system in the cars and cites accident statistics, or at least talks about all of the news stories as a reason that they don't want to use this new technology? Not even a person who simply can't afford the AI cars, or simply doesn't care about the difference as long as they have a way of getting to where they're going? 
 
It would have been at least something to see one of these concepts are a story arch, along with the main characters being sent somewhere at some point to where these cars don't even exist, like some small town in the middle of nowhere. I'm assuming the lack of development for anything to do with it's story is probably due to a low budget that couldn't afford more episodes. I'd assume that having Kōsuke Fujishima behind this would have granted a few more episodes. 
 
While the plot leaks much to be desired, but what about the main characters. Our three main characters are Lorna, Lisa, and Soichi, three kids who are out titular eX-Drivers. And this is where the problems are compounded a bit. Why are out main three characters children? Why isn't there at least one adult character that is an adult helping them out? You could make that same argument about the world of Pokemon, but that's a fantasy world with fantasy creatures, and even adults appear every now and again in that franchise. EX-Driver is much more grounded in a realistic world. 
 
There isn't much to said characters either. They're cliched archetypes that you'd see in a lot of boring anime. None of them get character development as a result of the show being so incredibly short. Not even a basic and obvious moral lesson for them to learn from. 
 
The only interesting thing about this series is that it was weirdly predictive of the future. with cars that drive itself, along with it's own infrastructure. But since it doesn't really go into depth with the concept, it's not really worth watching because of it, and probably wouldn't get even much focus other than a brief mention of ""Oh hey, there was one series written by the guy who wrote Oh My Goddess!"" that predicted self-driving cars.” It doesn't even show off the cars all that well, and that's both the focus of the show and something Kōsuke Fujishima has a personal interest in. Again, probably because it's limited episodes. 
 
I know it feels like I'm complaining about this series, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. At best, it's incredibly forgettable, at worst, it will annoy you with it's lack of anything interesting happening and lack explanation of exploration of its subject matter. EX-Driver is now hard to find on DVD, and i doubt anyone is clambering for a re-release.

The story follows the titular character who is a genetically engineered super-soldier; one of the creations of Dr. Von Reichter's diabolic experiments. (The fictional) Von Reichter is actually a former Nazi who conducted horrendous experiments during the second world war. He flees to South America where he continues his experiments which culminate in the creation of the ""Cybers,"" one of which happens to be Cybersix. However, since the Cybers exhibit free will at an young age (an undesired trait), Von Reichter destroys all the Cybers to prevent a rebellion. 
 
In the present day, Cybersix is one of the Cybers who managed to escape and is living a quiet life under the alias of ""Adrian Seidelman""; however, she finds out that her survival is dependent on a special substance that Von Reichter created and thus she is forced to hunt down the ""Technos,"" a newer generation of super-soldiers created by him, in order to survive. Unintentionally, in the process, Cybersix becomes a superhero protecting the world from Dr. Von Reichter's creations and his evil plans.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Von Reichter is a surviving member of Schutzstaffel in World War II. He works on experiments in South America, creating the Cyber series of artificial humanoids with super strength and agility. The 5000 original Cybers became servants, mimicked human emotions and making their will. When they disobey orders, Reichter orders them all to be destroyed. After the death of Cyber-29, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther, Data-7. Cyber-6 (Cybersix) is one of the survivors, who escapes and arrives in the city of Meridiana. She disguises herself as school teacher Adrian Seidelman, after the real one is killed in a car wreck. Cybersix defeats monsters called ""Fixed Ideas"" – humanoids of the Techno series – in order to drink the green sustenance liquid contained within them. Along the way, she meets an orphaned boy Julian, Reichter's cloned son José, and high school teacher Lucas Amato.
","Growing up in Canada in the late 90's, almost every kid I knew watched Cybersix. After just rewatching it, I can see why. It's got this unique Halloween feel mingled with a French/European setting that just sets it apart from most other animated shows. It's beautiful to look at, and it's painful to know how little attention it's gotten since its completion. 
 
Cybersix is about a Genetically engineered woman named Cybersix, and her battle against the many monsters sent by her creator to cause trouble. By day she poses as a male literature teacher, hangs out with her BFF Lucas, and acts like a geek. By night, she's an ass kicking sex-symbol that frequently visits her love interest, Lucas. It's also episodic, so you'll never have to worry about a boring arc lasting more than one episode. Personally, I was never bored.  
 
The characters are cool, spunky, unique and likable. While the majority of the characters outside of the main four or five rarely get any screen time, they only add to the already action-packed story. Cybersix herself is one outstanding individual, being both tough and gentle at the same time. Awesome. 
 
The music isn't orchestrated, but man that main theme is catchy. 
 
I highly highly recommend this one! Since it's only 13 episodes, you have very little to lose. Be warned the ending is slightly unsatisfying.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Although surprised to find this series on MAL I'm really glad it's here as getting more people into this criminally under appreciated show is always a good thing. 
 
This series is an adaptation of an Argentinian graphic novel, that a Canadian company picked up the rights to, and contracted a Japanese studio to animate. The original graphic novel is much more adult orientated and while this adaptation isn't exactly for kids it's certainly been toned down a bit. Fortunately enough this doesn't hamper the story. 
 
This is one of those shows that's best to go into with little to no idea what it's about, so I'm not going to talk extensively about the characters or story but give a few reasons why you should check it out. First of all, it has one of the most realistic female leads I've ever encountered. While this isn't so much of an issue in anime as it is in western animation, authentic female protagonists are still rather rare outside of the romance genre. In an action or superhero series authentic female characters are almost unheard of and yet that's exactly what Cybersix delivers. A female protagonist that's distinctly female, simultaneously realistic and flawed, Cybersix deals with a variety of issues through a chiefly female perspective. 
 
Beyond the expertly crafted lead, Cybersix hosts a number of other strikingly realistic characters and a well executed story about love and loss set to the backdrop of a sleepy south american city. Stylistically and thematically Cybersix is an incredibly unique mix, there really hasn't been anything like it since, especially as far as international collaborations go. 
 
With all that said, if you're looking for a well done and unique series with engaging and realistic characters then I can't recommend Cybersix enough.

          
 
       Helpful Okey This is My first review and i'm sorry if I might spell something wrong.  
 
I really like This show for many reasons. I love the that the main charakter is crossdressing and still looks good in any form male or female (but i like the male version ""Adrian"" more...)  exept that she has to wear those ugly clothes as cybersix. But i like her And the other charkters, but the villan sucks!!!! Its an eight year old boy who just run Around like a chicken! And his father is also just another coward. So the story was kind of lame to a certan extent but the charakters made up for it.  
 
I give the story a 7. Like i said its loads of fun and cute moments. But When there is drama it sucks. 
 
I give the art a 8. Becuse i like it XD. 
 
Well i dont Care about the sound but the dub was great. So no worries. 
 
I give the charakters a 9. I like em. But a little childish 
 
I give the enjoyment a 9. Hey if you didnt like it then sorry but The serie just ended and i want to see more!! And the comic suck so i dont know if i should recomend or not. 
 
But overall i give it à 10. I like the combined artwork With the charakters and surrounding. And that the heroine is just awesome in all the ways she is. And that there is werewolfs in episode 10 ... And Adrian is the best drawn charakter ever.

","I have read the novel version and manga version of this story and I do enjoy how the story is played out along with the art style presented in the manga with it's sharp edges and how expressive the characters are along with the adorable character design. 
 
In the anime however the entire character cast has went thru such a drastic  character redesign that I barely registered them as the characters I know. The art is so simple and the redesign seem's totally odd to me as why is Kunai's hair so long, why does Zero look so generic, why are these characters so rigid. The background is so weird as well, not following that the world that they are in is a fantasy isekai which have woods, stones, and buildings from medieval times but some of those backgrounds are so generic and so modern and don't mesh well with the timeline. 
 
Some scenes I can barely register and the combat and character movements are so stale that I am a little upset. The movement of the characters do have some weight to them but it's barely there and some scenes wave principle for animation is really odd, there are a couple cute scenes here and there but the combat is so stiff that I just forget it after I watched it. 
 
The story however is good and I do enjoy how it is playing out. The Maou is someone who is heading to the other world but actually takes combat seriously and I do enjoy his interactions with the characters. It's sort of like Overlord in that he is OP and has a split personality on the outside and inside of his persona. The setting is different though and I do enjoy the fact that he actually fights and does his best for what he thinks is the correct choice for him. Along wit the fact that he has a pretty fun way of interacting with others. 
 
Overall I like the story of this series but I do not like the animation nor it's art style. I think this anime would have done much better if they just put in more time into their background and not make such a drastic character redesign. The anime story was okay but it's missing some critical details or not adding more emphasis on the characters interaction with each other which make the story more entertaining and some details which could have made a bigger impact on the story are missing. 
 
I would give the story of the MANGA AND NOVEL an 8, the art and character design of the ANIME I would give a 3. Over all I just give it a 5 for the anime. I'll just stick to the manga and novel versions.

          
 
       Helpful So why would I give this anime a rating of 7 overall, meaning that I find it good, while it mostly is cliche? 
 
The reason of it is the anime has embraced it so much that it became funny instead of trying to be good it became cliche, so cliche that it became funny... Yes this anime made me laugh made me enjoy those 20 minutes every Wednesday, it didn't have an epic story, the characters were simple, the budget was not high, the effects were nothing new often even bad, and yade yade yada... 
 
anime should not have top notch quality, the best story ever written, the best voice actors ever lived, the best art that was ever created to be good, it needs those to be outstanding, to be a masterpiece... 
 
But a good anime is one where the person watching it can enjoy the time they spent on it. And I loved watching the 12 episodes of this and got a great laugh out of it.

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the Worst Isekai Animes ive ever watched, let alone, one of the worst Animes ive ever watched. However, what else can you expect from EKACHI EPILKA? It's not like this studio has a big name for itself already but surely they could've done a better job. 
 
The art-style is probably one of the worst i've ever seen, the only thing unique being how poor it is. 
The sounds where honestly not that bad but the music was dreadful. The OP was alright as I've got to give credit where credit is due. 
Honestly, after watching this can anyone tell me what the plot is? The last episode was a bunch of fan-service with no connection what so ever. I probably wasn't paying attention but from what I was watching I couldn't ever say to myself: ""Oh yeah, that made sense"". 
The Characters weren't the worst however they had no development whatsoever. The main character was the only one I could relate to as you could even tell by his voice acting, he didn't want to be there. 
The Enjoyment was a meh. It was nice to criticise and it sort of shows everything an anime shouldn't do. Half-Assed harem, no character development, no plot etc. But like I stated previously, what else could you expect from the Adapting Studio? 
 
All-in-all, it's safe to say I won't be watching season 2 if there even is one (lets hope not). I think the studio could produce something better then they did because all I can see here is they jumped onto the band wagon of isekai, pumping it out as quick as they could making it dreadful.

","Firstly, i must state that i watched this anime with spanish dubs (latin) and this is important as it was obvious that most of the jokes were changed, and made reference to latin culture and mexican primarly i think. 
 
Story 
well, there was not a continued story, it was more like a sitcom of 6 minutes episodes, but each mini-storie was great and really funny and intelligent. 
 
Art 
Most of the characters were draw very simply, &quot;extras&quot; being just a grey body with eyes. And well the artwork was similar to that of crayon shin-chan but less ugly, often joking about that by drawing the characters in the more common anime style when they are acting cool. 
 
Sound 
All i can say about the japanese sound is that the opening was really funny and fit perfectly the anime. More than that i can't say but for the ones who know spanish i recommend the dubs, it was the best spanish dubbing i've seen. 
 
Character 
there are lots of characters in this show and none of them is boring. you have the four main characters high (a energetic guy who's always on fire, and has the personality of a leader but is not listened buy his mates ), nari (a millionaire that loves circular things and solves everything with money), moro ( the girl of the group who is always trying to be sexy and... nothing more really) and koni (the mysterious main character with the mysterious house). 
some of the side characters are a samurai fish, a talking tv, a teacher that has a thing for koni, an old woman's hand, and a talking dog. 
 
Enjoyment 
i laughed out loud all the time with this series and you can see each chapter a thousand times and still laugh the same way.

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I reccomend to watch this anime if you know Spanish and if you know a little of latin and mexicain culture. I did not watch this anime with subs, so I can't tell you how it was in Japan, but in latin america, when this anime was airied, it was amazing. The dubbing is outstanding and the jokes are extremely funny, sort of like what happened to The Simpsons (Latin dubbing is better than original). 
 
This is one of those comedy animes divided into three segments of 7 minutes, each one with a different story. I can tell you: The first segment is about ordinary life (sitcom), the second is sort of like romantic comedy, and the third is all about parody. There is no main plot, and the main characters don't have a goal per se. 
 
The characters are memorable. Koni, the main protagonist, is a obese twelve-year-old kid, and still, he is the most famous person in the world, the strongest person in the world, and the incarnation of all virtues in history. 
High, his buddy, is eccentric, hyperactive, and he starts a fire wherever he is. 
Nari, another buddy, is the richest boy in the world, he can buy anything that was, is or will be in this universe. 
 
And there is the moe-sexy-girl, Moro, who is in love of Koni. She is a exhibitionist, causing nosebleed to almost every human but Koni. 
There is no Evil Castrating Dark Horrible Powerful antagonist, but what could be the bad guy, is the boss of an organization called The Bad Guys, and he has two sidekicks. He is known for dating the wife of the armed-man, called ""Tal Iván"", whose name is a pun of the Talibans. 
 
The art is not so amazing but simple: The extras are drawn with cyan and magenta colors, and there is one character that is a purple man with golden sort-of-like glasses. 
 
The BGM of this anime is PERFECT for this anime, I'm still criying I can't found it on the internetz. 
 
Anyways, I don't think you'll enjoy this anime if you are not latin or if you don't know spanish and don't know about mexicain culture. But if you do, like me, you'll find this anime extremely funny, and you can rewatch it forever. 
 
NOTE: This review is based only on the latin-dubbed version. I did not watch it in japanese, but I don't think it was bad in Japan.

          
 
       Helpful I guess most of us watched this with Spanish (Latin American) dub, then! Most jokes and dialogues changed, but it was for good. No idea how it is in Japanese, but I guess it's full of Japanese jokes and popular culture. 
 
Either way, this anime is one of the most hilarious I've ever watched, it's so full of energy, and all characters are very very likable. I wish it lasted longer though, since they promised us a 2nd season that got canceled. It's funny to think this is way more popular overseas than in its own original country. 
 
One of the very very very few times I'll recommend any dub. If you know Spanish well and think you can understand all the Mexican jokes (I'm not even Mexican and I got most of them!), please watch it. Every episode has 3 short sub episodes, so watching it doesn't get heavy at all. 
 
Oh, and the rewatch value is very very very very high. I've watched some episodes like 5 times, and I still find them hilarious. 
 
-- 
 
Story: This lacks any form of coherent story, so I can't really give this a high score... but believe me, the craziness is what matters here. 
 
Art: Personally as a kid I loved it! And I still do. It fits perfectly with this anime, but I guess sometimes the drawing style gets a little lazy. Oh, but the character design is amazing! 
 
Sound: I can't really remember well the BGM, but the opening and endings are great. Energetic opening and calm ending, I really liked that. 
 
Character: The characters are the best, they're all so likable. They're all so weird and have their extremely sick obsessions. You'll definitely feel more normal watching this. 
 
Enjoyment: If I could give this a 20, I would.

Story: This episode ties together everything regarding Takanashi and Inami's relationships. Its initial story seems weird, and that teaser from the 13th episode doesn't help either, but the pacing of this episode allows for everything to close out on the right foot.

And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag. 
 
Animation: 
Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...

13,19067,76,7.1066794160427555,story with the main character transported to another world,Future Card Buddyfight,"An adaptation of the Future Card Buddyfight card game. 
 
Future Card Buddyfight takes place in a more futuristic version of today. The card game connects to a parallel universe through special cards (Buddy Rare Cards) that act as portals. They bring monsters to Earth in order for them to become buddies with humans. Through friendship and courage, they take on and fight challenges, known as Buddyfights, where people of all ages have friendly non-hurtful competitions. The main character, Gaou Mikado has just started Buddyfighting. As the story progresses, Buddyfights are seeming to become a little too real...",['Game'],none,"This isn't the bottom of the barrel. We're through the barrel and plunging into cavernous depths previously unknown to man. This is garbage. 
 
And that's the thing, too. There's no pretension of it being anything other than garbage. Everyone involved knew this was garbage pumped out to kill time on the airwaves and shill a third rate collectible card game. If the creators made a quick buck, I can respect their business sense. I can only muster respect for Future Card Buddyfight as a scam. 
 
This show is as creatively bankrupt as it gets. All the cliches that Pokemon and its ilk have worn into the ground for decades are on display, and somehow Future Card Buddyfight bungles every last one of them. Look, I'm not George R.R. Martin, I don't scoff if all the meticulous inner workings of a setting aren't accounted for. I can suspend my disbelief, especially for a kids show, but this is just stupid. There was no effort or thought put into any of this. That goes to the insanely cookie cutter characters, as well. 
 
I gave Aldnoah Zero's Second Season a 3 because, for as insipid as it was, it at least felt like there was some creative, artistic spark, even if the execution was terrible. Future Card Buddyfight doesn't even have that. It's just cynical. 
 
As far as positives go, a friend and I got a few good laughs at its expense. The main character's mom is obviously the best girl. It's sometimes animated. That's all I've got. 
 
As a show, Future Card Buddyfight is a turgid, rancid failure. Don't let any kids waste their time on it. They deserve better. We all deserve better.

          
 
       Helpful Yay! I have the honor of being the first review! 
 
Future Card Buddyfight is a brilliant TCG anime, that never takes itself too serious. I find this show a lovable mesh of Pokemon meets Cardfight!! Vanguard.  
 
 
STORY: 
 In contrast to other card-based animes, the characters can actually ""fight"" in the battles instead of only shouting commands. The characters keep one partner only (exception: Gao), so no time-consuming episodes of them trying to fill their fighting rosters.  
 
FCBF constantly uses the word 'buddy' in any sentence possible. This could potentially annoy you (along with Gao's victory one-liners), or it might make you laugh at the sheer cheesiness. In my case it made me giggle and try to count all the 'buddies' used in one episode. 
 
This is a kid's anime so it's lighthearted, but the battles can become dark when the (dun dun) dark cores arrive. One of the characters has a dead brother, who is fondly mentioned as well. 
 
There are few fillers in this anime unless you count the two cliché tournament arcs. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
I think this is one of the few animes where I loved all the characters and their magical creature friends. My favorite characters were Zanya, Gao, Jin, Asmodai, and Noburu. My least liked would be Tetsuya, who is annoying for the entire first season. Still, I found his character evolving from the annoying, dance guy entertaining and sad.  You can honestly sympathize with any of these characters! 
 
There is a serious lack of female characters and only four to five girls buddyfight in the show. 
 
The show slowly introduces its main characters and lesser ones appear often. FCBF never forgets its side characters because ALL the characters have a purpose. At some point, they reappear and contribute to the plot usually in a “Gao gains a new friend/foe”way.  This characteristic of FCBF has me eager for its sequel! I can't wait to see them expand my favorites' story-lines even more. 
 
Concerning Gao Mikado, our main character, he is an actual intelligent lead.  He is childish and eats a lot, like so many leads before him. He understands when the villain or one of the antagonists are trying to hurt him and OUTSMARTS them... By buddyfighing! Well, this is a TCG show! Some may find him too perfect due to his many wins and use of OP moves, whether you like or dislike him for that is up to you. Personally, I find it different having a character who is ungodly good the first time he plays a game. Almost every TCG or shounen anime has its main lead start out losing before becoming the best in the game. FCBF sets that trope ablaze and stomps and spits on it. You can argue other characters get more development than lovable Gao. 
 
SOUND: 
I have seen the dub version, and I can say they did an excellent job casting!  
Bushiroad is well-known (or notorious) for reusing its actors. You will recognize their voices in more than one role. I feel like one VA played at least five different characters! 
 
 All of the voices sound professional and unique. I enjoy three characters' voices in particular: Kyoya, Shido, and Genma. Although, all of the voices are satisfactory to my humble ears you could be disappointed by where the directors assigned them. Genma and Rouga, middle school students, have the voice of grown men. Another character, Zanya, who has an actual boy voicing him, takes time to like. Initially, his voice was too amateurish.  Zanya is considered the cool character, but his VA tried too hard to achieve that effect. I began to like his voice as the episodes progressed though. I think Zanya's VA really grew with his role until his voice became comfortable. His voice shines in the hilarious moments when Zanya freak outs! 
 
Kyoya's voice is my absolute favorite! His voice is angelic. It's like beauty in the form of sound. Ha! 
 
MUSIC: 
I LOVE the soundtrack! As soon as it is released, I am adding it to my music library.  
 
The music is rock-based and uses ample guitar solos. They also have some songs with electric bagpipes and organs! So cool! All of the music is not upbeat, there are even slow songs where piano is used.  
 
The theme song is catchy! It is one of those “either you love or you hate it” type of things. I don't think it has a neutral ground.  
 
The ending theme (Season One) is horrendous. It is just bad. I thought it was too cutesy and had a bad melody. You will have to skip past it or suffer for 20+ episodes.  However, the second and third ending themes are wonderful! They could fall under the “too cutesy” trope, but unlike the first I don't find them grating. 
 
The BGM works well to convey any of the scene's feelings. 10 out of 10! 
 
ART: 
I love the style and the character designs. Gao's design has a lot going on because he's extra special!  
 
OVERALL: 
Please watch this anime! I love spending Friday nights or Saturday mornings watching FCBF. All of the episodes are on Youtube, so go binge watch it! 
 
 “Can YOU open a buddy rare card?”

          
 
       Helpful Well time to review something different for once.  
 
Back when I was a teenager, I was re-introduced to card games thanks to little series called Cardfight Vanguard. The first season of Cardfight Vanguard was a pretty great show. I really adored the more grounded feel of the series as most of the Cardfight were won by still rather than lucky draws. It had great theme exploration such as not running away, communication, teamwork, redemption and understanding one another. The characters were the most part were nicely developed and likeable in they own way and the soundtrack while a bit repetitive at times was nicely executed. 
 
The only problems that I had with Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 were the gags, Kamui's junior love triangle BS and the limited animation other than that I really liked the first season of Cardfight Vanguard and I consider it to be one of the best children animes I have seen along with the first season of Gundam Build Fighters. However, notice I said the first season of Cardfight Vanguard. Why because after the first season the series started to lose a lot of charm that made the original season as it became another soulless cash grab by Bushiroad to sell cards. The series got worse quality wise to a point where they are now rushing the Cardfights themselves... When the series got to Cardfight Vanguard as well as G completely lost all respect of Cardfight Vanguard as the series along with the G saga is nothing more but a pretentious fanfic written mess that doesn't even respect the viewer. It was that point where I decided to find another card game anime that I watch weekly along with other seasonal anime and the first thing that pooped up was Future Card Buddyfight a fairly new card game anime that was meant to be a more enjoyable, entertaining child-friendly series compared to Cardfight Vanguard. 
 
At first, I was put off by the title of the series as it seemed too childish for my tastes however despite that I deiced to give the series a chance and after watching the first season of Future Card Buddyfight I have to say this. Future Card Buddyfight season 1 is a great and fun card anime. While it was it not in the same league as Yugioh 5ds and at times Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 in terms of quality and writing Future Card Buddyfight was still one of the more enjoyable anime I have seen in a long while. Now with that said let's begin. 
 
Story. 
The story follows Gao Mikado an eager young martial artist who becomes Buddies with the Hot-Blooded Drum Bunker Dragon. Receiving a Core Deck Case from Tasuku Ryuenji, a Buddyfight prodigy working for the Buddy Police, he takes his first steps into the fantastic world of Buddyfight. 
 
I really enjoyed the story of Future Card Buddyfight. Yeah, the story may be cliched and predictable in nature but the least the journey towards the destination was a fun one. 
 
For starters, this show is easy to follow as the show goes a great job at established its own setting as well as its characters to the viewer especially kids. 
 
The one thing I really liked about Future Card Buddyfight is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the things that plagued Cardfight Vanguard is that after season 1 the series went off rails where it devolved into an over-dramatic and contrived show series to itself too seriously. Future Card Buddyfight docent do any of this as the show from start to finish stayed true it's good roots which are being a light-hearted card game anime. The show did have some serious moments every now and then but it never went off rails. 
 
The comedy in Future Card Buddyfight is for the most part hilarious as they not only they are very funny but the comedy itself plays along with the shows lighthearted narrative. Some of my favourites include Zanya getting scared by girls, Shido failing his evil antics to Testua's gags. I will admit the comedy did somewhat repetitive as it progressed but never got annoying compare to Cardfight Vanguard comedy with the Morikawa Grade 3 stuff and Kamui's comedic love triangle antics. 
 
Despite Future Card Buddyfight being a more lighthearted show compare to Cardfight Vanguard the series did have some good theme exploration however unlike Cardfight Vanguard I thought the themes explored in this show were better executed here compared to Vanguard. One of the series recurring themes is adult corruption where the adults in the series seemed to have more power than the children an, as a result, the kids would only feel powerlessly unable to do anything. The theme also plays along into certain characters in the series manly Tasuku. Other themes that Future Card Buddyfight explores is friendship, confidence, pride and superiority. 
 
My favourite arc in this Season 1 of Future Card Buddyfight is the ABC cup arc due to engaging and entertaining it was. Most of the Buddfights in that arc was not only fun to watch but it's filled with good engaging strategies and smart plays. My favourite fight in that arc was Rouga vs Jin. That fight was such a joy to watch as both fighters battle out it restrive settings that they both set themselves. Some other notable fights include Tetsua vs Sophia, Zanya vs Rouga, Gao vs Gremlin and Noboru vs Genma. 
 
Now with all the good out let's talk about things some of Future Card Buddyfight flaws. 
 
First up is the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc. While the series is indeed being very well paced through most of it run the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc was too slow for its own good to a point where some of the Buddyfights drag on especially when all of the characters that were introduced in that arc were not all that interesting. Now if I think about it the Sengoku Academy arc was the weakest arc in the season. Minus the good character building for Rouga and Kiri, the arc didn't all that much to the overall plot. 
 
The second and final problem I had with Future Card Buddyfight is Gao's plot armour. It's such a shame because I really enjoyed Gao personality/development as well as his relationships towards characters. I just thought of his wins felt more like asspulls rather than legit victories thought I would admit it's not as bad as some of the asspulls from the Yugioh series as well as Cardfight Vanguard G. 
 
Overall, despite the show flaws, I thought the story of Future Card Buddyfight to be solid. 
7.5/10 
 
Characters. 
The characters in Future Card Buddyfight were easily the shows biggest strength. 
 
First, we have Gao Mikado. I actually really liked him. He may appear as this generic shounen hero at first but he's actually a pretty interesting character. Unlike Aichi Gao already has an established background 
 
His backstory was pretty interesting as he before used to be this ruthless guy who would do anything to win even if hurting others in the progress. However in order to make friends at all he to change his mind where he doesn't use ruthless techniques to hurt others in both martial arts and in Buddyfight. This really gives a pretty good insight about Gao's character as a whole as his actions were pretty reliable as he simply wants to escape from being a person that he used to be. 
 
Besides the backstory there's a bit more I have to talk about Gao's as a character. 
I really liked his character interactions and relationships towards the other characters as he wanted to support and help his friends take the right path but when he fails he gets pretty upset and he will end up doing anything just to save his friends from corruption and evil. 
 
The one cool thing about Gao is how he's able to use and master different decks and worlds. It really makes Gao think twice about the moves that he's going to play against set opponents using set deck. 
 
Now as much I enjoyed Gao as a character I have one problem with him and it's not about the character but rather how the plot treats him. You see despite Gao being a solidly written character who has character flaws there was a couple of instances where the plot wanted him to be this generic overpowered protagonist even though the series at various points showcases that he is a flawed character. I honestly wished the showed treated Gao a bit better because outside of all of the plot conveniences that the story gives his a likeable and fun character to be around. Overall, despite how the plot treats him at times, Gao is a pretty good character. 
 
Next, we have Tasuku. I really liked Tasuku. He's a friendly individual who is nice to everyone that he meets. However, despite his kindness he's want's to grow up faster as he works as a Buddy Police officer where he protects the world from crime done by criminal buddyfighters. 
 
(Spoilers ahead) 
 
Despite him being a successful buddy police officer, he feels that the buddy police force is corrupted as shown later on the series he gets very frustrated with the buddy police organisation as a whole as he quickly falls into darkness where he joins team Disaster as the Purgatory Knight. 
 
After getting defeated by Gao in the final match he starts doing through a mini redemption arc where he starts feeling ashamed and guilty of everything that he has done as the Purgatory Knight. (End of Spoilers) 
 
Despite the lack of screen time in the first half I found Tasuku to be a nicely developed and written character that I enjoyed from start to finish. 
 
I absolutely adored Kiri no am kidding I really like the show did with his characters. He starts off as this timid boy who would look up with his senpai being Gao. However, a couple of plot twists and plot aspects Kiri starts to grow as a character whereby the end of the show he's like a totally different person where it literally becomes a likeable badass. He's easily my third favourite character. 
 
Now we have Zayna. While I didn't care for him all that much in the beginning due to him being a solo who prefers to work alone rather than with other however as the series progresses he starts to become quite a cool character as he starts to open up to people as well trusting them. 
 
Despite him being a cool character overall the thing that hurts him quite a bit is he's afraid of girls and is not talking about his being afraid of girls boobs or anything but he literally cannot talk or go against a girl in a Buddyfight. I don't know why the writers didn't give him a 3 episode arc where he overcomes his fear of girls as that would have been interesting plus we got a backstory that showed how he became scared of girls. Don't get me wrong I still like Zayna as a character but him being scared of girls removes quite a bit of coolness about him. 
 
Tetsuya is an interesting likeable character. Unlike Gao and Zayna where they are dedicated to Buddyfighing Testuya is a dancer who doesn't devote his energy to Buddyfighting and because of those reasons he's basically an underdog and a very good one. Throughout the series people would gossip of how's he's a low rate fighter who cannot win however thanks to his buddy as well his determination he slowly moves up the ranks of being a pretty strong Buddyfighting where we end getting a lot of respect from his peers. If you remove the following characters that I will talk about next, he would be my favourite as he's not only a nicely written character but he's just so fun to watch and seeing improved at the game was so satisfying My second favourite character in the Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
If I had to pick my favourite character in Future Card Buddyfight, it would be Noboru Kodo. I absolutely adored this character from start to finish. 
He started off at this arrogant boy who had an inferiority complex where it always diminished Gao's Buddyfight as pure luck rather than actual skill. Typical rival stuff however what made him my favourite character in the series when he's starts to realise that he's not that special. When Tetsuya defeated Noboru in a Buddyfight, he didn't just lose the match but he's lost his pride and confidence to a point. A few episodes later he has gone so far that he was going to quit Buddyfight for good. 
 
However, thanks to El Quixote's advice defeats a criminal Buddyfighter and he started to become more confident about himself. From there he not only has the courage to be himself he also reconciles with Gao where he becomes his true friend again. Because of these reasons along Noboru is my favourite character. Thank you Buddyfight. 
 
Kazane was a fun charterer. While she didn't develop all that much when compared to the other characters in the show she still a lot of fun to watch. 
Now I have praised many of the characters in Buddyfight but now it's time to talk about the charterers that I have mixed feeling for and that character is Rouga. Now Rouga is a fun and entertaining character that I enjoyed, however, I feel like the writers did not what to do with him in the narrative as the writers keep on changing what type of character Rouga is. At times he can be lone wolf antagonist, while other the plot portrays as a misunderstood rival. The plot can also as times portrays him like the sword of Kyoya as he would do anything to defeat anyone who gets in Kyoya way while at others he's a typical badass student. This unfortunately really makes him an inconsistent character as I feel the writers had created a character that would have worked in Cardfight Vanguard or Yugioh Arc V. 
 
The other two charterers I have mixed feelings towards is Baku and Kuguru. Despite them being Gao best friends and deck builder/intel they didn't do all that much as characters. They aren't bad characters but any means, in fact, I found the humour to be decent but they didn't leave a lasting impact of the series compared to many of the characters like Kiri, Tasuku and Noboru. 
 
As for the villain origination Disaster, I thought they were pretty good overall. Some were better than others but that they brought enough entertainment to make them enjoyable to watch on screen. My favourite characters in Team Disaster were Sofia and the main antagonist of the season Kyoya. 
 
Finally, we have the buddies themselves and to be honest apart from Asmodai, Jack, Drum and El Quixote they are pretty one-note mainly because they only have single character trait and not much else. 
 
Overall the characters in Buddyfight were great for the most part and them easily my favourite thing about this series. If it weren't for the characters that I simply wouldn't have enjoyed it all that much. Great job Buddyfight. 
8.5/10 
 
Visuals. 
As for the visuals, I thought the show was pretty good. 
 
The characters designs were unique and fitted well with the personality of the characters especially Noboru who is far the best character design wise thanks hair resembling like an actual brown tiger on the top of his yellow hair. Other notable designs include Gao, Kiri especially his second form, and Tetsuya. The buddy designs were for the most part pretty good despite some of them being in full CGI. 
 
The one thing that I really liked about the visuals is how colourful it is. The series uses its urban smooth colour palette for the background scenery in the series. It really makes the setting of Future Card Buddyfight feel more alive. 
 
The animation in Future Card Buddyfight surprisingly pretty good. It is smooth, consistent, and nicely animated. The show did have some stock footage in certain moments but don't you worry the stock footage doesn't get abused as much compared to older brother Cardfight Vanguard Season 1. 
The only issue that I had with the visuals is the use of CGI at times and while it wasn't that bad compared to other shows of its genre it still pretty distracting to look at. 
 
Overall I thought the visuals were pretty good. 
8/10 
 
Sound. 
The soundtrack of Future Card Buddyfight is pretty good and memorable. It uses a selection of clam, thrilling sci-fi and ninja tracks pieces to enhance the setting and tone of the series. Some of my favourite tracks include Gao's theme, Noboru theme, Grim Reaper theme, I be mine and team Disaster theme. 
The first opening Card Of The Future by Psychic Lover is a catchy opening theme that fits well with the lighthearted tone of the series. While the first opening visuals were bland the second opening visuals were much better and engaging.The second opening theme ""Buddy Buddy BAAAAAN!! sung by the Seiyuus of Gao and Baku was decent at best. While the song itself was alright the visuals didn't fit the tone of the arc at all thanks to its bizarre tone.  
The first ending theme Buddy Buddy Fight!"" sung by Paruko Seiyuu Sora Tokui is an ending theme that is so bad it's good. The song itself was very cheesy and the melody wasn't all that good. The only redeeming theme about the first ending theme was the visuals which were pretty solid. 
The second ending theme Natsuiro Fighting!! sung by Paruko Seiyuu is a good catch that was a big improvement over the first ending theme. Not only the ending visuals were much better, but the song had a great and catchy rhythm. 
 
The third ending theme Shining Up sung by Hanako Seiyuu is in my top 30 favourite anime ending themes as it was a very sad song that perfectly showcases the lifespan of Gao brother. 
 
I have not seen much of the sub mainly because its most of the episodes didn't get an English translation but I what I remember I thought it was solid. 
 
The dub of Buddyfight is pretty good. The voice actors really did a job with the roles that they were given and it really makes these characters feels more live. My favourite performances were Bacchus, Patricia as Gao, Hannah Dickinson as Kiri, Slusar, Zoe as Noboru and Hanson, Cole as Tasuku. Overall very good dub. 
 
9/10 
Final Thoughts. 
There is no secret that I really liked Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The story despite being cliched at times was entertaining and interesting to watch. The characters were, for the most part, great and likeable. The visuals were solid and consistent minus the awarded use of CGI at certain points and the music was good. It did have a small couple of problems, though. The Sengoku Academy arc could have been better paced, the plot armour was out of control at times and a small handful of the supporting characters were not that good. Despite that issues, I still made it through the first season feeling a sense of satisfaction. Future Card Buddyfight gain a pretty strong following after it came out as it, not only card game anime watchers into watching it but it also converted many jaded Yugioh/Cardfight Vanguard players into playing the card game itself. If you're looking for a good card game anime that has likeable characters and has a fun addicting plot than I easily recommend Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The show may not revolutionise the card game anime genre, but I still think it's a great show that I enjoyed. 
 
Final Score 8.5/10

Story 
Bland and simple. An experiment that rises up when the chance presents itself. Story has some logic failures. Such as if the ____ works on brain eventually it will run out of brain. So how can you say a prolonged life? 
 
Art 
Nicely drawn. Animations are done well. Art is different then what the cover picture shows(depending which picture you are looking at here). Works well with the story. 
 
Sound 
Subtitles don't work well with English dubbed. The actors either use different words or the time is off. Better off keeping the subtitles off. Some, i would say about 1 percent of the spoken language is muffled. Which means makes sure to use the subtitles when needed to figure out what was said. 
 
Character 
Is mostly driven on the main male character. As for the main female character her bio is moderate. For example her origin is iffy.

Mad scientist lovers would likely like this.

First of all, yes, it's from the creator of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 
 
Personally I decided to see Baoh on the basis that he was the creator of Jojo's, I did not really want it, but although if his start is a little loose, the movie I finish liking quite a bit. 
 
Story: The story begins and does not tell you what is happening, later you discover why things are wrong, but the story is not the most interesting of the film, but I would have wished it to explain itself more. 
 
Art / Animation: The film is 89, so I can not demand much, okay, it is noted that they strived to keep Araki's drawing style as much as possible, which until the arrival of David Productions did not fit so well . 
 
Sound: Every time I started an action scene I sounded to the music that sounded in the ancient fighting arches, it was not bad, it gave a touch of emotion to the scene, otherwise I miss it a little, serious average The right word. Except Ending, that was fine. 
 
Characters: The characters are the worst of the movie, each and every one is flat, not that this bad and that damages the movie, but I would have liked more immersion of the characters, but it is only a movie and does not want to waste time In the characters to show more action. 
 
Enjoy: The film is quite enjoyable, it is very entertaining, I do not remember having comedy scenes, it is ok, since although they could, the story does not give much comedy, personally I say I liked it more than I should since I know Jojo's beforehand, but I have to say that even if you do not know Jojo's you might like it, my advice is to see Jojo's (David Production versions) and then see Baoh. 
 
Overall: Baoh is a good movie, not well known, but worth seeing, and more if you're a fan of Araki's works, and even if you're not giving this movie a chance it will not hurt you. If I give it an 8/10 even though in the other points none exceeded 7 points, it is because even with everything I have I like and I get excited with every fight, which has not happened much, that 8 more than anything It is by myself, if I were serious I would be a 7. 
 
PS: It has its touch GORE and there is a character that reminds me of Hokuto No Ken, if you do not know Araki is a fan of that series. Baoh is one of Araki's early works before Jojo's, and yet the series is good and it shows that even before Jojo's was a great writer. 
 
Español: 
Primero que todo, si,  es del creador de Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 
 
Personalmente decidí ver Baoh a base de que era del creador de Jojo's, no le tenia muchas ganas, pero aunque su inicio es algo flojo, la película me termino gustando bastante. 
 
Historia: La historia empieza y no te dice que esta pasando, tiempo después descubres el por que de las cosas, esta mal hecho, pero la historia no es lo mas interesante de la película, pero hubiera deseado que se explicara mas a si misma. 
 
Arte/Animación: La película es del 89, así que no le puedo exigir mucho, esta bien, se nota que se esforzaron por mantener lo mas posible el estilo de dibujo de Araki, lo cual hasta la llegada de David Productions no quedaba tan bien. 
 
Sonido: Cada vez que empezaba una escena de accion me sonaba a la música que sonaba en los árcades de lucha antiguos, no esta mal, la daba un toque de emoción a la escena, por lo demás lo pase un poco por alto, promedio seria la palabra adecuada. Excepto el Ending, eso estaba bien. 
 
Personajes: Los personajes son lo peor de la Película, todos y cada uno son planos, no es que este mal y que eso dañe la película, pero me hubiera gustado mas inmersión de los personajes, pero es solo una película y no quiere perder tiempo en los personajes para así mostrar mas acción. 
 
Disfrute: La película se disfruta bastante, es muy entretenida, no recuerdo que tenga escenas de comedia, esta bien, ya que aunque podrían, la historia no da para mucha comedia, en lo personal digo que me gusto mas de lo que debería ya que de antemano conozco a Jojo's, pero he de decir que aun si no conoces a Jojo's tal vez te guste, mi consejo es que veas Jojo's (las versiones de David Production) y que después veas Baoh. 
 
En general: Baoh es una buena película, no muy conocida, pero vale la pena ver, y mas si eres fan de los trabajos de Araki, y aun si no lo eres darle una oportunidad a esta película no te hará daño. Si le doy un 8/10 aun cuando en los demás puntos ninguno supero los 7 puntos, es por que aun con todo lo que tiene me gusto y me emocione con cada pelea, lo que hace mucho no pasaba, eso 8 mas que cualquier cosa es por mi mismo, si fuera enserio seria un 7. 
 
PD: Tiene su toque GORE y hay un personaje que me recuerda a Hokuto No Ken, si no lo sabes Araki es fan de esa serie. Baoh es uno de los primeros trabajos de Araki antes de Jojo's, y aun asi la serie es buena y se nota que aun antes de Jojo's ya era un gran escritor.

Subtitles don't work well with English dubbed. The actors either use different words or the time is off. Better off keeping the subtitles off.

Awakening alone under the tree, the previously blind Nunnally finds that she can see again and immediately spots a strange rabbit that resembles Anya Alstreim, the Knight of Six. The sight of this rabbit sends Nunnally falling down a hole, leading her to a colorful wonderland.

","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Fantasy']","
In an alternative timeline, the world is divided into three superpowers (similar to the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell): the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the Europa United (Europe and Africa). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain's North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.
Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.
Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld, the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.
","When starting the special, one might be put off by the mostly still frame animation. But the comedy of the story makes up for it. The special only works if one has finished both Code Geass series. The special right away shows that it is not a serious and intelligent story that the series is famous for, by having Lelouch break the fourth wall right away.  The story creatively blends the major characters of Code Geass with Alice in Wonderland and other stories. Much of the comedy is based on jokes on major plot elements of both series and making extreme of characteristics that made the characters famous(or infamous). There is also some fanservice for heterosexual males. After nearly 30 minutes of comedy, as the story wraps up, a quick but hilarious twist ends the special on a grand note.    
 
The comedy is well thought out and very funny. With so much references to the plot, fans of Code Geass are rewarded with not only comedy. By using nearly all the major characters, in roles that fit their personalities, one can tell the writers care for their fans. The very last scene is heartwarming and funny, ending the special in a fulfilling manner. 

          
 
       Helpful Hello, my name is Jack Smith/John Smith and I suffer from multiple personalities disorder. 
 
Due to my condition, I decided to write a review about Code Geass: Nunnally in Wonderland OVA that contains 2 different opinions of my first personality Jack and my second personality John. 
 
Please enjoy this review, and I hope you'll find it helpful!

Story : 10 
The story in NiW in is simply wonderful.  
Lelouch starts telling his blind sister Nunnally a picture book story about Wonderland, and Nunnally is magically sent into Wonderland, regaining her eyesight, and then meets with all the colorful Code Geass characters we have grown to love. Each Code Geass character gets a different role in this Wonderland picture book, such as Humpty Dumpty, bunny, Cheshire cat or Mad Hatter and so on. 
 
Animation:10 
Despite  being mostly stills with minimal animation, the art looks great. The drawings look fluid and it feels just like a picture book or like a visual novel if you're familiar with the VN genre. The idea is original, and saves money for the production studio. Kudos to you Sunrise! 
 
Sound:10 
All our favorite voice actors from Code Geass return to breath life into the characters. 
The music feels just like from a fantasy movie, and fits to the Wonderland story and atmosphere in this OVA. 
 
Character:10 
Each one of the well developed characters of Code Geass come back and have some part in the story, and they fit perfectly to their new roles as Wonderland characters based on their personalities and roles in the main Code Geass seasons. 
 
Enjoyment:10 
Extremely enjoyable. The length of the OVA feels like 10 minutes and not 30 minutes, as it flies by really fast. 
 
Overall:10 
Overall, I recommend it to all Code Geass fans, new or old. If you can get by the fact that it's not really animated and mostly stills, you will be immersed by the fantastical fantasy story. 
 
Enjoy!

John Smith - 
Sunrise, what have you done?! This is clearly an evil attempt to milk the Code Geass wide array of fans with zero budget and no substance. I really hope the new Code Geass Akito OVA will have a better quality than this OVA, and the quality of this OVA is extremely poor. 
 
Story : 2 
Story? What story? 
Instead of the regular great Code Geass story we get a cheap spin off about Nunnally, the least most useful character in the show that all her role was being blind and being useless. Lelouch was obsessive with her because she was the only good close family he had. In this OVA he still shows deep concern for her, but in this spinoff, not only Nunally is useless, Lelouch becomes useless too! The main character with 20k user favorites, the most likable character on this site by the fans, useless! 
All he does is reading stupid picture books! 
What the hell. 
 
Animation:2 
Sunrise, you lazy motherfuckers!  
You thought this idea of minimal animation is fitting to the story? No! It's simply shows how lazy is this neckbeard fatass studio! 
Most of the time, the animation is composed of still pictures, and when there is actual animation, it lasts for 2 or 3 seconds. 
This is an anime for Christ sake, it should be animated to it's full, just like the main Code Geass anime seasons. 
 
Sound:2 
The music is extremely repetitive and the voice actors sound they had to suffer because of the shittyness of this OVA. Why waste good talents on this crap?! 
 
Character:2 
All the well written characters of Code Geass come back, and are given retarded roles of Wonderland characters. Why did sunrise thought of making this? I have no idea. Even if you ask a grade school student if making such an OVA is a good idea, he'll tell you: "" NO! DON'T RUIN MY FUCKING SWEET CHILDHOOD HAPPINESS WITH BUTCHERING MY FAVORITE SHOW!"" 
 
Enjoyment:2 
Enjoyment?!?!?! From this?!?! HAH! Not in a million years! If you think this is enjoyable, you should get your head checked for suffering from some kind of mental illness. 
 
Overall:2 
Avoid. Just watch the main amazing 2 Code Geass seasons, and forget about this OVA alltogether. Your time will be better spent watching Mars of Destruction. At least it has animation.

          
 
       Helpful I was hoping to have time so I could watch this OVA. I loved the two seasons of Code Geass and I thought that I would love it. I have never been so disappointed with an anime/OVA. 
 
Although the story is a bit funny at some points (it has references to the TV series), is quite boring most of the time. There is no animation: 28 minutes of frames or drawings without even moving the lips when talking. 
  
I mark it with a 4 (despite the fact that it maybe deserves less) just because I like the characters and it reminded me of the anime, that was one of the first ones I saw.

13,13667,79,7.086548892299369,story with the main character transported to another world,Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 6 - Road to Ninja,"Returning home to Konohagakure, the young ninja celebrate defeating a group of supposed Akatsuki members. Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, however, feel differently. Naruto is jealous of his comrades' congratulatory families, wishing for the presence of his own parents. Sakura, on the other hand, is angry at her embarrassing parents, and wishes for no parents at all. The two clash over their opposing ideals, but are faced with a more pressing matter when the masked Madara Uchiha suddenly appears and transports them to an alternate world. 
 
In this world, Sakura's parents are considered heroes—for they gave their lives to protect Konohagakure from the Nine-Tailed Fox attack 10 years ago. Consequently, Naruto's parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, are alive and well. Unable to return home or find the masked Madara, Naruto and Sakura stay in this new world and enjoy the changes they have always longed for. All seems well for the two ninja, until an unexpected threat emerges that pushes Naruto and Sakura to not only fight for the Konohagakure of the alternate world, but also to find a way back to their own. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Super Power', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen']","Following his encounter with his mother, Naruto has returned to the Hidden Leaf. He and the rest of the Konoha 11, led by Kakashi Hatake and Might Guy, drive off a group of White Zetsu posing as fallen Akatsuki members. Upon their return, everyone's parents decide to have their children recommended to become jonin, with the exception of Naruto due to his parents being deceased, and Sakura Haruno, whose parents Kizashi and Mebuki dismiss her capabilities. Naruto begins to feel depressed about not having had parents growing up, leading him to lash out at Iruka Umino. Sakura, after arguing with Mebuki, later uses Naruto as an excuse to avoid her. Alone at the park, the two are confronted by Tobi (who at this point they believe to be Madara Uchiha), who proceeds to blind them with a great light before fleeing.
Regaining their senses, Naruto and Sakura discover the world around them significantly changed: their friends' personalities are the polar opposite of their original demeanors; Sasuke Uchiha never left the village and is now a womanizer; Naruto is referred to by others as ""Menma""; no one knows who Madara is; and Kizashi was the Fourth Hokage, him and Mebuki sacrificing their lives to seal the Nine-Tails inside Menma, leading Sakura to become adored as the ""Child of Heroes"". It is revealed that Tobi subjected them to a genjutsu-based, limited version of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, the Limited Tsukuyomi, in the hopes of claiming the Nine-Tails without resorting to the Fourth Great Ninja War.
Naruto and Sakura begin investigating the world in the hopes of finding a way back home, but Sakura begins relishing her lack of parents and newfound fame. They eventually meet with Tsunade, who reveals the existence of a masked ninja who has been attacking villages in order to obtain an object called the Red Moon Scroll; Jiraiya found and hid the scroll before being killed by the Masked Man. With the location known, Tsunade assigns a mission to find it, being led by Naruto's parents Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, who never died due to the Harunos' sacrifice and are active, regular ninja. Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, and Guy also join the mission (the former two hoping to use the scroll to escape the Limited Tsukuyomi), but Naruto becomes enraged at his parents' presence, believing Tobi to be taunting him, and refuses to reciprocate when they show him affection.
During the mission, the team is attacked by Jiraiya's toads, who never developed a kinship with Minato and Naruto and thus treat the group as intruders. In the ensuing fight, Kushina injures her ankle trying to shield Naruto from a poison attack. Minato eventually obtains the scroll, and Sakura heals Kushina. Naruto's parents lecture and console him over the turn of events, overwhelming Naruto with emotion. Upon learning the scroll can only be activated during a red lunar eclipse, Naruto and Sakura realize they have to wait till then. Sakura soon begins to realize the loneliness Naruto felt as an orphan, while Naruto accepts the fake Minato and Kushina as his parents and begins enjoying spending time with them.
The village is then attacked by the Masked Man, having allied himself with Tobi, who has used an incorporeal form to observe the Limited Tsukuyomi, The Masked Man captures Sakura to hold ransom for the Red Moon Scroll, then proceeds to destroy the village. Naruto attempts to leave to save Sakura, but Minato and Kushina hold him back. Realizing they are not like his actual parents, Naruto reveals his true identity to them and thanks them for spending time with him. Wearing Kizashi's Hokage cloak, he takes the Red Moon Scroll and leaves to save Sakura and face the Masked Man, finding them at an old training ground used by Jiraiya and Minato.
While the Akatsuki - a group of mercenaries led by Itachi Uchiha in this universe - dispatch the Masked Man's puppets, Naruto battles against the Masked Man, who is revealed to be the real Menma. Menma absorbs the defeated masked beasts to manifest the Black Nine-Tails, with the Nine-Tails making a temporary truce with Naruto to defeat its counterpart. However, this all plays to Tobi's plan as he possesses Menma so he can personally extract the weakened Nine-Tails from Naruto while completely wiping his mind. Sakura saves Naruto before the Nine-Tails is extracted from him, and Naruto regains his memories from looking at the scroll. Naruto and Sakura, along with assistance from Minato and Kushina, then force Tobi out of Menma and undo the Limited Tsukuyomi. Once back in their reality, after informing Tsunade of their ordeal, Sakura tearfully reunites with her parents while Naruto makes amends with Iruka and realizes he already has a family in his friends.
","Highlights: a Blonde Naruto fighting a black-haired Naruto, Sakura's rare moment of understanding Naruto's feeling, and some Uzumaki's family love. 
 
In this movie due to a jutsu done by Madara, both Sakura and Naruto, are sent to a parallel world, where their wishes are granted. Sakura is granted the wish to live by herself with no parents, and Naruto is given the chance to spend some rare moments with his parents, Minato and Kushina.  
 
The film has some very funny parts where the characters' characterstics are all reversed, we see a player Sasuke, a shy Ino, an idiot Shikmaru, a Kiba who loves cats, a Guy who's lazy, and a -kinda- good Akatsuki. 
 
The Nine-tails fight was great too, but what got me was the whole Naruto's family moments. 
 
All in all, the film is definitely great! not action-packed, but it's a nice breath of air. 

          
 
       Helpful I'd have to say out of all the movies that I've seen thus far this was probably one of my favorites because it wasn't a completely different universe or theoretical country we never heard of but rather an extended development of the on-going TV series. 
 
The strong-points of this movie focuses entirely on that development regarding Minato and Kushina. If you enjoyed watching episodes including backstory on them because of the powerful emotion involved than you'll definitely enjoy this movie.  
 
The story was predictable in it's outcome from beginning, middle and end. So there wasn't really nothing of note. The art and sound were actually pretty good at times and I loved some of the dramatic parts and emphasis they created with the art style and animation and sound. I'd have to say the worst part of the series was the characters..not necessarily because they sucked..but this movie's take on the characters were amusingly average. 
 
Overall I enjoyed the anime, for some of the good art and sound but mainly because the plot elements at the end and character development was good for the two main characters.

          
 
       Helpful This is the ninth Naruto movie, made around the time when the Ninja War began. The main idea behind the plot is interesting, as Naruto and Sakura are sent to an alternative dimension where there is no war. That is supposed to show what Madara plans to do if he plan succeeds and thus excuse his satanic plans. 
 
Sadly this is still a kids’ show, thus the whole thing ends up being nothing more than a badly written fanfic. I mean, really, you are watching this just because you are aware of how one-dimensional everybody is and want to laugh with a “what if” anecdote. You are presented with an alternative dimension where everyone is supposed to act differently and all you get is them acting in the exact opposite way than they do in the normal world. Hell, they don’t even wear different clothes. Do you know what that means? That the Naruto cast is so simple in personality that the only way they could be presented any differently is by reversing the one and only character trait which defined them. Hell, in some cases that trait couldn’t even be reversed and all they did is removing it. Like, the dog dude now being bad with dogs, the insect dude hating insects, and the scroll girl being bad with scrolls. And that doesn’t even happen with all the characters as many others such as the Akatsuki (yes they are present too) have retained their personality for no given reason. 
 
What makes it even worse is that the script was not written by some retarded 10 year old narutard but by the very creator of the show, Kishimoto himself. Really now Kishi, is this how low your writing skills dropped? People usually improve over the years you know; you are given a fresh new canvas and all you do is reverse the colors? 
 
Anyways, this is all a big excuse to see Naruto’s parents and the Akatsuki members being still alive. I mean who cares about story continuity if you have a dozen cool cameos such as those on screen doing their stuff? And we got a second evil Naruto to fight our hero to boot. Where did he appear from? Who cares! Oh, there is also that side story where Sakura is the orphan in this world and she starts to feel as bad as Naruto for growing up alone. But that is thrown away in, like, 10 minutes and she is useless as always so who gives a damn. 
 
Ah, I find so little to write about this. Seriously, by the time the “what ifs” are over, so is most of the film. It is definitely more mature as a concept than the rest of the movies since it’s supposed to be more about the psyche of the protagonists and less about some global threat. Naruto still ends everything with a Rasengan as always but that was not the point of the film. They could have definitely done far more if they had spent more time on the drama of parenthood and had skipped all the silly reverse personalities. I mean, jeez, what was the point of presenting all the reversed rookies if none of them mean anything to the plot? They literally disappear from the story towards the end. And Konoha ends up being nuked again but this time nobody gives a damn about it; thus trashing the whole idea of the world not being better after all. 
 
Damn you Kishi; all these good ideas, trashed by the ridiculous fanfic flavor.

That's it I'm done, I can't write anymore I'm sorry. 
 
This is the worst anime I have ever watched... 
Soul Eater Not! ... No. It doesn't deserve to share the same name as Soul Eater. 
Let's just call it NOT! okay? 
 
NOT! starts off as a backstory prior to the events in Soul Eater. It focuses around 3 main characters whom are the most meta, useless, over-troped, stereotypical, over-used; fan-service overridden, drull, incapable anime characters I have ever seen. I'm really trying to be civil here, but it's just not possible. 
NOT! takes the Soul Eater universe and takes a big dukie all over it. 
The things we loved about Soul Eater, the atmosphere, the music, the plot, the characters, all gone or re-shapen to fit the mold of this monstrosity.  
Death City is gone and replaced by this mediocre Attack On Titan looking district; you will physically get angry.  
What were they thinking? You might ask. 
The correct answer is they weren't thinking at all. They applied the Soul Eater brand and assumed we'd eat it up. 
Well my friends, please, don't touch this dog ****.  
 
If you do decide to watch this anime, you have no right to judge it if you do not watch the entire show. Because this horrible anime really tries to be like Soul Eater near the end, and fails miserably. 
This was torture to watch. 
If you do watch it I suggest alcohol. 

          
 
       Helpful I really loved Soul Eater,  so at first I was a bit biased about this anime. I watched in one sitting but I was a bit disappointed by this anime. The plot is overall pretty bad, at first it didn't have much plot.  In the last few episodes it threw in a sloppy plot and didn't give any nice twists or excitement.  
 
The characters didn't have any room for development. The main characters formed attachments, but we didn't.  there wasn't any firm backstories and I was disappointed with the lack of supporting characters.  
 
As for the sound track I have always loved the soul eater sound track, and I found this to be pretty different. The soundtrack doesn't completely suite me tastes, but it was nice and each song played their part well. 
 
I wasn't a huge fan of this anime. 

          
 
       Helpful I don't understand why so many people disregard this series. There is absolutely nothing bad about it. I thought it was a lot of fun <3 
 
Story: 8/10 
The basic plot follows weapon Tsugumi and two miesters, Anya and Meme as they get used to the DWMA and learn about the powers they possess. Along the way they meet the main characters from the original and learn about true friendship and strength.  
Sure. Soul  Eater NOT is not exactly like the original Soul Eater. At least, the first 8-10 episodes are not. However, this show isn't really supposed to be. It's a prequel to the Soul Eater story, and we learn some things like how Sid died in Soul Eater, and about the lives of Liz, Patty, Kim, etc. before hand. The last few episodes were really intense, and I really wanted to see everyone turn out okay! And one of the episodes when one character was possessed by the main villain at the town festival had me so hyped up and I was really scared for her safety.  
 
Well, yeah, the story isn't always this intense. Most of it is slice of life stuff, but you learn a lot about Liz and Patty's situation, Kim's personality, and how she befriends Jackie. I give it an 8/10 .  
 
Art and Sound: Both 8/10 
The art style is moe and very cute. It definitely fits the tone of the beginning of the story, and even hen everything was dark and intense, the colors and the sound did well to make us feel worried or scared.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
This rank is mostly based on the supporting characters and the things we learn about them, as well as the main trio obviously. So I'll go individually, kind of. Tsugumi is a typical protagonist. She's determined, kind of shy, but very friendly and has a good heart. Nothing spectacular, but you can see the worry she has trying to make the big decision in the show, and you feel sorry for her when she puts herself down because of her more athletic friends. So she's not boring, just kind of typical. Anya is a typical tsundere rich girl. She wants to learn about ""common life"" but doesn't really like showing her vulnerable side. She's a fun and really cute character. Meme is my favorite of the three. She's funny, kind of stupid, really cute, and just brings a lot of the comedy between the three. Plus once you find out why she forgets so many things, it really does make sense and tie into the main plot. She really makes the trio so interesting for me.  
 
As for supporting characters, they're great. Liz and Patty are shown as their previous rebellious selves that care about nobody and will pick a fight with anyone they see on the street. You slowly see them turn to their more well known selves and it's really heartwarming. There are a few other characters in the show, like Akane and Clay, who guide Tsugumi through learning more about herself and what she wants to accomplish at the DWMA, and are really fun as well.  
 
Kim and Jackie are awesome too. You get to see Kim go from a total bully to a more cool, yet compassionate girl. You also get to see Jackie try to figure out of she loves Kim romantically, or just as a close friend and possible partner. Both of them work well of each other, and I ship it REALLY hard.  
 
The other main characters are not in it much other than Maka and Soul, but they are all the same as usual, so there isn't much to say.  
 
Overall, I really like this anime. I do not understand why so many people think it's bad, but I feel as though people are just angry because the art is different from the original and so is the tone. But it's really not. It gives good characters, a good story, and it keeps very faithful to the things within the cannon. The ending is even pretty good, maybe not great, but it still wraps the story up really nicely. I recommend any Soul Eater fans to at least give the show a chance and form their own opinions.

When they find them, they will be able to return to Japan.
The Elf Hunters travel by means of a Type 74 tank, which has been transported to the magical world with them.
The reaction of various elves as the team attempts to strip them naked is a primary basis for much of the show's humor, and are more ridiculous than suggestive. The series is also known for breaking the fourth wall, mostly from Junpei.
","Wow… this is, um, different. It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over.  
 
Lets talk about the characters, shall we? There is a young high school girl named Ritsuko who seems to have a tank and tons of guns and ammo. How a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Her character is a bit duncy and slightly annoying at times because she is a natural high school student with a military fedish. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he takes the cake. All he seems to care about is food and his high and mighty actress, Airi. He always fights Ritsuko and just… I can’t deal with him. Airi is so high and mighty about being an actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well for the comedy that they are trying to keep.  
 
Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2. Seriously, I just feel they did what they did at the ending to make more money with the second season.  
 
The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously.  
 
The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I don’t know but it feels way too serious for what it actually is. I love the dubs script since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script a lot. The voices on the other hand really fail at times making characters hard to take seriously when they need to be or just plain annoying. Sometimes characters seem to of been given given new voice actors who have no idea how to actually act. Many times they end up yelling way too loudly. They seem more like Bible Black in some aspects but luckily they don’t go into sexual stuff… well, not that badly.  
 
It’s fun to watch, but trust me that it isn’t the best. It’s rather laughable that works with the comedy but they can’t do a serious scene when they really need it. Even though I can’t actually give this a really good rating, its still fun to watch. 


          
 
       Helpful This anime, probably more appropriately titled ""Those Who Strip Elves"", is not horrible or unwatchable. It's just bad. While some of the recurring gags are actually funny, the story is completely contrived and repetitive, and the characters are rather unlikeable. Add annoying opening and closing songs, and the eye cancer that is late '90s anime design, and the end result is the kind of series that one watches because they're bored and have nothing better to see. 
 
The positives here are cartoony violence and seeing the inept characters deal with bizarre situations before they strip the female elf of the week. I don't really care for elves, but if you're into that kind of thing, well, there's plenty of elf nudity to satisfy your desires, as well. If this all doesn't appeal to you though, then don't even bother with this series. 

          
 
       Helpful Altough it`s an very old anime, it`s realy good to watch if you want to laugh a lot. 
When you grow tired of the same gerne you have been watching over and over again, watch this anime. 
The story is funny, and you never know what is going to happen next. 
I still need to see the second season, but whenever i need an break from the anime i`m watching, the second season will be the first thing to watch  for me. 
Ps. i loved the Tank (just watch the anime, you will know why)

When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.

","If you go to my profile you can see my top five favorite anime's, however, MAL  only lets me put down five. If I could pick two more shows to put on that list, they would be Fighting Spirit and Bleach. Now, Fighting Spirit is a 50 episode boxing anime. Which means there is a lot of fighting and action. And Bleach of course, is over 200 episodes with lots of characters and lots of battles. What I'm getting at is, its nice to see all those boxing punches and sword fights, but every once in awhile its nice to just sit back and enjoy a relaxing anime.  
 
""Spice and Wolf"" does that for me, I remember watching it and feeling at peace. The characters, the world that brings us back to middle earth  and of course the AMAZING music. A man's journey is immedietly put to a halt, when finds a girl in the back of his cart, he thinks she's normal, but then he notices her tail... There are a lot of Slice of Life anime's that put you in that moment, and ""Spice and Wolf"" is one of the greats.

Character is very cute, and story is very good!!

       Helpful Spice and Wolf is a difficult anime to rate. Even before watching it i was unsure how i would feel about a dialogue heavy anime in a medieval setting. I really enjoyed this anime, most episodes captured my attention so well they were over before i knew it. 
 
The plot primarily is about Kraft travelling around trying to make money through trade whilst dealing with the Pretty, high maintenance wolf girl Holo . It seems like a simple concept but it is done surprisingly well. There isnt really any major battles or arguments but the show does feel adventurous and clever. I loved the methods in which Kraft and Holo bartered and traded, it left me with an appreciation and better understanding for the art of trade. 
 
When it comes to Characters there really are not many to discuss. Kraft the trading obsessed traveler,  Holo the wolf in a girls form and to some extent Nora the shepard girl are the only characters with any development. The interactions between Kraft and Holo are clever and funny and builds the foundation of a good Partnership. Spice and wolf does not immediately start with a romantic interest between the characters but naturally leads into one, which is really highlighted in the second season. 
 
One of the highlights of this show is the art. Some of the background scenery are beautiful and overall the designs and color are great. The background music is well timed and helps promote the medieval setting. 
 
This is an anime i would recommend watching if you want an adventurous sort of romantic anime without the need for much action. Spice and Wolf is a great anime if you can appreciate economics and business. The only shortcoming i have with spice and wolf is that it wont blow you away with an amazing story or characters, but it is definitely enjoyable.

Wow, easily one of the coolest anime out this season.  Akanesasu Shoujo delivers on all fronts and pumps on all cylinders at every moment, with deep character development, perfect pacing, and well-executed action scenes.  The dialogue is always on point with the characters displaying a deep, human understanding of each other.  Some people may question the idea of the show represented in the first episode, however I think it's a more accurate reflection of realistic high school girls than what we normally see.  The character models are absolutely stunning, and each action sequence is a visual spectacle. 
 
That said I didn't give this show a 10, for the following reasons.  I felt Mia was particularly shallow in her character development, and kind of feels out of place in general.  Also, there was a non-zero amount of ero-fanservice, which personally puts me off, and which probably could have netted the show a 9 had it been replaced with more tasteful shots.  A swimsuit episode is not a necessity.  Finally, the plotline, while engaging and overall very good, left nothing to the imagination and sort of played out as expected. 
 
Definitely one of the best shows this season, which is saying a lot considering how many good shows came out this season.  I'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes Magical Girls and really visually-stunning anime.

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, LA picked up Akanesasu Shoujo because Nao Touyama was in it. But even so, is Akanesasu Shoujo any good?..well... 
 
Akanesasu Shoujo has a quirky premise to it, that of the Crystal Radio Club that Asuka Tsuchimiya viced by Tomoyo Kurosawa started. They do a ritual every now and again of chanting some gibberish with a cassette player and random frequencies and expect things to happen, however one time they do and they are transported to a parallel world but is plagued by yellow bunnies...that bite. From then on, Asuka and the Radio Club becomes intrigued and goes to other parallel worlds where a bigger plot lies, that of the King of Twilight that destroys worlds using those yellow bunnies or Noizies and humanoid version known as ""Clutter"". 
 
Now Akanesasu Shoujo for the better part of half the anime, Akanesasu Shoujo follows a character focused arc as it were with the members of the Radio Club. Like Nana Nanase voiced by Ami Koshimizu and her dilemma and problems with her stepfather and what that does to her as a person, Mia Silverstone voiced by Nao Touyama, wanting to have the courage and be a hero but she's always been painted as a shy girl that can't do action because of her surface-level personality barring her, Chloe Morisu voiced by Marina Inoue known for being a loner and thinking that's her most efficient yet actually longs for friends once Chloe came into contact with Asuka and finally Yuu Tounaka voiced by Lynn who puts on a facade and yet one of her alternate self is anything but that. Oh yeah there's alternative versions of the characters, being an anime setting with parallels worlds it's to be expected. There are only two however due to this, Sexy Yuu and Seriousuka based on an alternative Asuka who's able to fight the Twilight. 
 
Each of the character arcs follows with their character development but it always ends in the character focused in the arc in question to fight and defeat a Clutter that is plaguing their alternative worlds before that Clutter swallows that world in Twilight rinse and repeat...it's formulaic but it makes sense as each of the main cast and their dilemma's in the real world taken a different form in an alternative world and once they awaken their ""Twilight Selves"" they not only get superpowers that reflect their problems but they also self-improve as a result due to how the Clutter links with the character in question's dilemma and thus the character in question defeating the Clutter has a narrative meaning. LA's favourite character however did become Mia by default, however LA did have a bit of relatablity with Chloe by the end of the series, while Asuka probably gotten the longest and most development of all the main cast but that is both because of her screentime and being the main protagonist. 
 
The bigger plot of Akanesasu Shoujo hits near the final 3 episodes and changes from it's usual character focused arcs (in a ways) and really digs deep into some plot twists and spoilers of what and who the King of Twilight is and how this links to both Asuka as well as Asuka's lost brother to all this and it gets crazy yet sane in a ways, yes sure alternative worlds, alternative selves and whatnot but it still makes sense by the end of it. Overall the plot is decent, slightly formulaic but the character development helps ALOT to all this to the bigger picture of Akanesasu Shoujo. 
 
In terms of animation by DandeLion Animation Studio and Jumonji. See DandeLion Animation Studio are the one sin charge of the 3D CGI, YUP , this anime implements it in, mostly when the girls transform into their twilight selves and it's janky yet fluid. Janky through how clashing to the background the 3DCGI is, BUT the action and fighting is oddly fluid, it's a weird balance but it kinda works. The character designs and backgrounding for the anime was actually pretty decent, both DandeLion and Jumonoji were in the animation for this and being a joint venture...well it worked out. Overall, the animation of Akanesasu Shoujo was decent enough if you can stomach the 3DCGI, it'll grow on you... 
 
Now the voice acting, well we have a good cast if anything and no it's not just because of Nao Touyama. Tomoyo Kurosawa shows her extremely wide range of cadences as different alternative version of Asuka, this also applies to Lynn with her alternative Yuu's as well. Ami Koshimzu, Nao Touyama and Marina Inoue also does well even if they don't have their alternative selves, as their character focused arcs helps with their voice work in that respect. If anything the voice casting for Akanesasu Shoujo was good. 
 
The finale at the very least resolves Asuka's situation with her missing brother. How the final episode itself takes itself with an introspective look at Asuka as a character and her journey through multiple Fragments and meeting the ""King of Twilight"" and how this entity links to both Asuka and her little brother is resolved though felt like the resolution was done too quickly, trying to cram in Asuka's development all into one episode but to it's defense, we do get most of Asuka's development helped by the rest of the main cast's arcs as well so the ""rushed"" flaw becomes only slightly detrimented. The finale was nonetheless all Asuka but nicely tied itself together, giving us hints as to other characters' fate as well.  
 
So was Akanesasu Shoujo good?...well Akanesasu Shoujo is a decent venture with some interesting and in-depth character development from the majority of the cast while Asuka herself being a bigger link to the bigger plot of Akanesasu Shoujo tying things together. Sure the plot is pretty formulaic for the bulk of the anime but many of the plot twists were actually pretty unexpected BUT the 3DCGI was altogether meh to balance things out. Akanesasu Shoujo's strengths and weaknesses all and all just made Akanesasu Shoujo and what LA watched as LA experienced it was that it was ""ok"", nothing too great but nothing too awful either...it goes right down the middle and that is completely fine as middling as it was...it was a fun and decent experience in all it's quirkiness.

Diseño de personajes no del todo convincente, personalidades lineales y desarrollo escaso y forzado durante los capítulos para justificar los powe-up de las protagonistas. 
Estructura de capítulos repetitiva: capítulo de planteamiento del nuevo escenario y conflicto en él junto al conflicto de la personaje destacada de el mini arco -> capítulo de resolución del problema en el nuevo escenario, obtención de más poder por parte de la personaje principal del arco justificado por la resolución de sus problemas.

","Just another male protagonist hitting it off with every other girl he comes across.  At this point, most of us probably know quite well what to expect from anime of the ""ecchi"" and ""harem"" genre.  A mediocre story at best, the oversized flapping breasts (or not), attacks that seemingly only strip girls, the facepalm dialogue, and the recycled female archetypes among others.  To which, the selling point of this sort of anime becomes its quality art that one can usually expect.  Which in actuality was anything but.   
 
The premise of the story was actually not all that appalling.  Everyone seems to live forever through a perpetual cycle of reincarnation, monsters that seemingly appear out of nowhere just to harass the protagonists, inconsistent plot/characters, and the ever-so-appealing-power-up catchphrase ""I Remember Now.""  Okay maybe not, but with a little more direction the plot could have easily been good.  Probably. 
 
The art was far from onpoint.  The appearance of monsters resembled that of cardboard cut-outs, there was no fluidity in movement, battle scenes were choppy, over usage of still frames, the whole thing just felt clunky.  The only somewhat detailed scenes were fanservice segments, but hey that is supposedly a norm by this point right? 
 
The BGM in this series seems to have had one goal in mind.  Make already annoying and shrill voiced characters ... sound even more annoying.  OP and ED were normal.  As normal as could be as far as ""harem"" and ""ecchi"" series go anyways.     
 
Character development was.... well, let's just stop there. 
 
If you can get past the inconsistent plot, art, and characters, then feel free to give this series a go.  If you can't, you should probably move on to the next anime lest you pull all your hair out and go-for-bald.  I for one managed to plow through this series unscathed, but that may be that I'm simply overly callous from repetition.   
 
 
     

          
 
       Helpful Plot Devices is something that exists in any given entertainment medium in order to move the plot forward.  Plot armor is where a given character can never be hurt or killed simply because the plot demands that he doesn't.  Like any other form of story, anime utilizes these two aspects to a certain extent in order to tell its story and move along in plot progression.  But what happens when they're...overused?  Well, I believe Seiken Tsukai no World break answers that question quite easily. 
 
Story (4.44/10): In the world of World Break, this fantasy rendition of the world has a special twist to it.  In this world, reincarnation exists, and it is here where we have Haimura Moroha, the our main protagonist enter the school that specializes in harnessing the power that people wielded in their past lives in order to fight the mysterious creatures known as metaphysicals.   
 
As far as story setup goes, World Break doesn't particularly do a well and proper explanation.  In the first couple episodes, the show attempts to explain the ideas that it wants to establish, showcasing how exactly the idea of reincarnation and how it corresponds to the weapons and abilities that these students wield.  While the explanation is subpar at best, with some things not getting a complete explanation, the first few episodes do give some insight as to how the world of World Break actually works.  But apart from this though, the story falls VERY flat, entering into the void of lazy writing and predictability.   
 
Let's start with cohesion.  Throughout the runtime of World break, the series never really puts its plot points together.  With the series spanning over the course of six in-anime months, the events within that timespan aren't really told in the most fluent of manner.  The series is made in an arc-like setup, with different arcs and events that pertain to each small set of episodes which make up the entire series.  The problem with this though is just how clunky the transitions are.  Simply put, after finishing a specific event, the World Break jumps headfirst into the next arc in the next episode without word or warning, creating a very awkward transition and overall, a very distasteful experience. 
 
As far as actual plot goes, every individual arc is quite separate from one another, with some of them bordering on sheer ridiculousness and the simple question of ""why is he doing this?""  (Like seriously, bastard goes to war BY HIMSELF in one arc.  That's just...why?!)  Not that the stories are particularly bad per say, since each one does have to do with the series and contributes some progression, but I feel as though each one was done in a spur of the moment feel because of how dramatic the situation can and will change in any given arc.   
 
But overall though, I think the biggest problem with this series is the plot device known as ""reincarnation"".  Yes, the central thing of World Break is its main problem.  Throughout the whole series, our main protagonist faces problems and issues that pertain to the series, aka metaphysicals terrorizing the world, or people wanting to kill him for reasons unknown, you get the idea.  Because of how the series presents these battles, the impact of said conflict is little to none.  And this is all because of the little phrase ""I remember.""  Just two words, everybody.  As the series explains, Moroha is someone who has two past lives (I'm not really sure what the significance of that is because I'm pretty sure every savior in the series theoretically has reincarnated a bunch of times according to the show's logic), being our overpowered main character who shares the same level of power as SAO's Kirito and Mahouka's Tatsuya.  During the course of any given battle, Moroha CAN AND WILL utter the phrase ""I remember"", as he randomly remembers something that occurred in a past life, thus giving him the ability to win a battle without any kind of repercussions.  Basically, this means that this guy's very existence has the ability to turn the tide of any battle.  I find this a very lazy way of writing a story for several reasons. 
1.  This makes the plot extremely boring and predictable because there is no way that this guy will lose. 
2.  None of the tension the show gives us will have any impact because we already know he's going to pull out the MC card and win. 
3.  Conflicts become resolved extremely easily.   
 
Overall, the story of World Break is one of the more lazier things I have seen to date.  While the setup of the story was decent enough to at least establish what we were watching, the rest of the story fell very flat.  With lack of story cohesion, easily resolved conflicts, plot convenience that comes WAY too easily, and above all else, an ending episode that looks nothing like the beginning two minutes of the series in a flashback, the story of this series made my blood boil more than anything else. 
 
Overview: 
+/-  Somewhat decent explanation of the fantasy elements (still don't understand where they metaphysicals come from or why they exist.) 
-  Lack of story cohesion 
-  Way too much plot convenience 
-  Ridiculous story arcs.  (You go to war against the biggest country in the world BY YOURSElf just because a girl was tricked into believing she had a brother?  Seriously?) 
 
Characters (5.87/10): While the story by itself was poorly done, the characters of this show followed that to a certain degree.   
 
Up first, we have Haimura Moroha, or as I like to call him, walking plot armor.  Following the traditional MC character traits of being nice to the girls in his harem, swearing to protect people and not let anyone get hurt, and being OP as all hell because harem/fantasy MC's area always like that.  As far as change in character, this guy changes none.  But his impact to the series is a completely different story altogether.  Because of his existence as walking plot armor, literally every issue the anime has is resolved because of him.  Because of his signature phrase ""I remember"", any technique that existed in his previous life can and will return back to him and take down whatever is before him.  A gigantic hydra terrorizing your harem?  He just remembered something and take it down.  A British knight making your life hell?  Just remember something to take him out.  A russian tyrant tricked one of your harem members?  Just go up to her, remember something, and knock her off her throne.  Because the conflicts of the series are wrapped up THIS easily, nothing in the series really has any important impact.  It is guaranteed that the situation will turn in the MC's favor, and there's simply just no enjoyment in my opinion to be had seeing someone just plow their way through like that without any drawbacks.   
 
And then we have Ranjou Satsuki, the girl who plays off as the little sister troupe with the combination of the girl with the irritating laugh.  Being Moroha's blood-related sister in their past lives, Satsuki spends the entire series trying to prove herself to her ""older brother"" by trying to obtain strength so that she can be praised.  The only problem about this is the fact that she doesn't really have much of an impact.  Throughout the whole series, Satsuki doesn't particularly do much but be a character that you can just love to hate because of how arrogant she comes off and how little she actually does in the grand scheme of things.   
 
Next, we have Shizuno Urushibara, the main girl of the series that plays off as the level-headed girl with the big chest.  As Moroha's wife from a different past life, Shizuno similar to Satsuki, she doesn't really come off as very important in the series.  While her impact to the series overall is more so than Satsuki due to the fact that she received an arc to herself, she doesn't really go beyond what we as the audience knew of her, and thus doesn't really stray from the traditional characteristics that her kind of character has.   
 
Side characters for World Break are expansive and plentiful.  Apart from the loli member of the harem, Maya, the rest of the characters serve one of two purposes.  One, they are recurring characters that exist purely for the background, or two, are characters that are only important in a certain arc and don't have much reach beyond that.  The side characters have varying importance and screentime, all of them with a good deal of personality to them.  While not perfect, they do hold their own in some sense.   
 
Overview: 
+/- Decent side cast 
-  Generic harem MC 
-  MC is literally plot armor 
-  Main girls are troupe characters for the most part 
 
Art and Sound (7.00/10 and 6.49/10): Art for World break is very colorful and bright.  While I have bashed this show on its more technical aspects, its aesthetic aspects do make up that somewhat.  Because of it more or less being standard animation for this day and age, there really isn't much to say about it.  But the action is quite fluid and nice, I'll give it that.  (Still don't understand how the way spellcasting in this series is effective.  You have to stand for three-five minutes at a time just to cast one thing.)   
 
There are however some flaws within the show's artstyle.  For one thing, the metaphysicals don't really work well with the series's standard animation at times.  Sometimes, things go into what looks like CG, and it just looks kinda awkward when it does.  It doesn't use it very often, but when it does, it can become prominent.  In addition, there is one glaring character design flaw which I feel needs to be addressed, that being concerning the character Elena.  Hair...does...not...work...like...that.  Within this character's design, her right eye is supposedly being covered up by the large bang that she has over it.  The only problem with this is the fact that the eye shows right through.  Because of this, you can see both her eyes even when one is being covered up by hair, and it just looks so weird.  It's only a minor detail, but it's very obvious and glaring when you watch it.   
 
As far as ecchi goes, World Break doesn't really capitalize on the idea all that much.  While it does showcase some ecchi elements, it doesn't really come up all that often.  That being said though, there is one specific character that creates most of the fanservice-esque scenes, and those scenes have earned a cringed look from me, and left me with a scarred memory. 
 
The sound for World Break is simply split into three tracks.  The OP, the ED, and the battle music because as far as I'm concerned, these are the only three songs that this show actually has.  The OP is a song that I would regard as irritatingly catchy.  It has that tone to it that makes to me, a sound that is equivalent to nails of a chalkboard as the entire thing is sung by someone with a very high voice in addition to a beat that suddenly speeds up at times.  Personally, I hate the OP.  While it is insanely catchy, I personally don't like it.  The ED is forgettable, so there's not really much to say about that.  As for the ""battle music"", the show uses an opera style track with a mystical sounding flair to it that sounds rather pleasing.  While the rest of the soundtrack wasn't particularly stellar in my opinion, this song in particular did song very pleasing to me. 
 
Overview: 
+  Decent art 
+  One good song 
-   Some artistic flaws 
 
Personal Enjoyment (4.33/10): During the fall 2014 season, an anime by the name of ""Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance"", a series that I saw as one that was written very poorly but somehow deserved the ""it's so bad it's good"" rating on account of people saying the show was actually good, even if I saw otherwise.  Likewise, ""Seiken Tsukai no World Break"" while sharing a similar sounding title, is one that I regard as a spiritual successor to that series.   
 
Did I like this anime? 
 
As far as aesthetics go, (ignoring Elena's eye), the series didn't look too bad visually.  While there were some choice moments I would like to forget, overall, the look of the series was one that I would regard as a higher point in the series, even if the designs of some of the female characters made no sense biologically.   
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
I hate just how lazy this series felt.  Because of its reincarnation idea, the series exploited that idea by creating a very poorly written story where everything was solved simply because the MC could remember something that could help him in the situation, and giving the excuse that because he has that to back him up, that writing up something like that was ok.  You know what?  It's not.  Every time he uttered the phrase, there was a sense of rage inside me simply because of how ridiculous and how common this plot device was used.  Use it once, shame on you.  Use it twice?  Shame on me.  Use it 10-15 times?  Ok, that's just bullshit now.   
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
While I personally didn't enjoy this anime, I wouldn't say that this show isn't enjoyable to some extent.  If you're a fan of overpowered MC's, this show is perfect, because the entire show just capitalizes on just how ridiculously overpowered this guy is.  Hell, even the best fighters from other countries, who are seasoned, adult veterans, cannot stand up to a guy who hasn't even finished high school.  If that isn't OP, I don't know what is.  But because of its lazy storytelling, troupe-filled characters, and several aesthetic flaws, this show doesn't come close to being good in my book.

Poetry is an interesting form of writing when you take a step back and appreciate what it does. It can be a beautiful piece about a long lost lover or a depressing description of the death of a family member. It can be anything it wants to be because it’s, well, poetry. Some do it for fun while others do it as a hobby. Others still base their entire careers on crafting words together in intricate ways – most music is composed of lyrics that are themselves poetry. But what if it was instead used for something a bit more avant-garde? Maybe, instead of just fighting with swords and spells, people fought with words, too? Seiken Tsukai no World Break does exactly this, and it is as ridiculous as it sounds. 
 
 
STORY 
 
World Break follows young Moroha Haimura who finds himself attending Akane Academy. There, he meets two girls from his “past lives,” Shizuno Urushibara the ice mage and Satsuki Ranjou the dependent sister. Together, they fight as Saviors, defeating evil one line of prose at a time. 
 
Whether or not it can be deemed a “feat” is questionable, but World Break does something that most anime wouldn’t have the guts to do: have their entire narrative’s foundation based on a plot contrivance. Feat or no, this is atrocious. This isn’t just a hole in the tale in the sense that they forgot to mention some important detail or they outright refuse to give it relevancy. No, what the anime does is give Moroha the capability to simply “remember.” He literally, while fighting a giant hydra or a mutated behemoth, just happens to have a recollection concerning with some part of his past, providing him with newfound knowledge in order to defeat whatever monster he happens to be fighting. This goes beyond being over-powered; main characters that are similar in strength at least have some background in regards to where their skills come from. But here, every battle involves the same unfair, random power-up at just the right moment to swing the battle in favor of Moroha and the good guys. 
 
Yet it’s not only this broken crutch that the anime leans on. Many of the other aspects of the show don’t work because they’re unfounded or unbelievable. The aforementioned poetry is one such issue; besides being a completely silly premise, it’s nonsensical to have to write poetry in the middle of a fight in order to use one’s own abilities. Another example is the “Big Six,” a league of Saviors who are the heads of their respective countries. They seem to hold large influence, but either don’t do anything despite their positions, are uncharacteristically evil, or even become incapacitated for no other reason than to add on to the list of ever-growing coincidences. The “Transportal” being usable once a day, everyone besides Moroha being useless at what they do, Urushibara’s and Satsuki’s miraculous, deus ex machina recovery near the end of the series; there are countless instances that continually make the anime more incoherent than the last. 
 
This all sounds like rather niche entertainment, the kind of “so bad, it’s good” media that at least provides some semblance of direction. But that’s not the case; in fact, World Break is essentially mindless in what it sets out to do. There are no themes, there is no focus, there doesn’t even exist a solitary arc that means anything to anyone. This is because our main lead is already destined for greatness, no matter where life takes him. Meaning, not only do we see that he is over-powered but it’s already predetermined that he will be. The idea that past lives have similarities across each other works against the anime, and not just there; it can be seen with Urushibara and Satsuki ending up with him. Even when there are obstacles preventing them from being with him, we “know” that they will eventually be together, and we know they will be by his side because the show’s premise dictates it being so. The finale also doesn’t have any merits. The notion that camaraderie and togetherness can change fate not only goes against everything it’s always been stating otherwise but it’s the only instance where anyone besides Moroha actually does anything, giving us no precedent for such a development. All together it’s a bunch of pointless plot points that contain zero value whatsoever. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
While the quality of the art for World Break is usually low – there are serious camera issues, lighting is an afterthought, and the choreography of the action is pretty poor – it does at least give itself the chance to showcase a wide range of abilities. Various, large scale attacks such as the beasts made of thunder and lightning, the diverse kinds of magic used by the students, and the other weapons that are wielded provide the show with the opportunity to break up the monotony when it comes to not only the story it “tells” but also with the boring locales that are chosen. That last point mainly stems from where the battles take place; most of the time, they are forced to be airborne, causing the backdrops to always become cloud-filled skies. Worse still, and even though the anime is given the chance to demonstrate different skillsets, it always has to fall back on its poetry. Meaning the foreground is often littered with words and writing, which gets in the way of everything else. 
 
The character designs tend to be hit or miss. Urushibara’s long purple hair, green eyes, and nice figure define her as the cool beauty that she is. Satsuki, likewise, has her spunky personality showcased through her fun, pink hair, yellow ribbon, and constant smiling. And Elena’s medium-length white hair and gray eyes mirror her emotionless and mysterious demeanor. The flip side contains Moroha with his single strand of silver hair to make him somehow unique, Mari’s (the principal of the academy) witch attire, and Sofia only being known for her enormous bust. 
 
Actual animation suffers greatly for nearly the entire series. Sword swinging is often simple swipes, running is jerky and off-putting, and even when characters are sitting or talking with one another, there is hardly any movement to be had. The only portion of the show that sees increased attention is, once again, the word writing: the hand and finger motions are given nice detail since they are what take center stage at nearly all points in the show. But waving one’s hands around here and there doesn’t add up, leaving the animation in a less-than-stellar department. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
What’s astounding about some of World Break’s characters is that, despite the large focus on the past, there is very little learned about any of them. And not just in the sense that their past lives are filled with nothing, for that is partially true, too. Satsuki’s only claim to fame is being Moroha’s past sister. That’s it. She isn’t strong, she isn’t fast, and she isn’t even friendly. Her personality is as one-dimensional as it comes, with her being extremely clingy and defensive of anyone getting close to her loving brother. Moroha doesn’t fare much better, either. They make passing references to his relatives’ deaths at some point in his life, as a means to demonstrate that he is “unable” to protect the ones he loves. But outside of one, one-second clip, they’re importance is insignificant. His past lives are also filled with improper explanations concerning who he is as a person; all that is shown for the longest time is that he is a really strong guy. In a way, his obtuse lack of characterization defines him as someone without a past, as a boy whose only prevalent feature being the remembering he does on a semi-frequent basis. And looking at nearly anyone else besides these two shows a glaring issue: nobody is given their past. Again, when a core facet of the anime isn’t even applied to the majority of the cast, it only serves to weaken its overall value. 
 
“Nearly anyone” was used because, as the phrase implies, not everyone is averse to such a problem. More specifically, Elena and Urushibara do manage to use the show’s focal point to their advantage. Elena is a woman who originally worked for the Russian branch of Saviors as a kind of spy. However, she was more or less forced to do others’ biddings due to her brother being held captive. What’s interesting about her case is what is later revealed: that her past wasn’t real, or in other words, she never had a brother to begin with. In a sort of roundabout way, World Break argues that one’s past shouldn’t control what you do. It is, after all, the past, and nothing from it can be changed. Meaning, instead of letting past transgressions haunt your person, fight in the now and for the future; for it is there where the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, Elena’s character and the message she carries isn’t around for long; after her mini story-arc halfway through the series, she is subsequently pushed to the side and barely looked at again except for the occasional fan-service. 
 
Undoubtedly the strongest character from the anime is Urushibara. Her past is mired in violence and darkness, which may be a factor that contributes to her cool and icy behavior. Having been a slave, she’s no stranger to chains, torture, and loneliness. This last detail is important, because it also highlights where her caring attitude comes from. For while she teases Moroha, Satsuki, and the others while remaining composed, it’s her previous lack of relationships that causes her to cherish the ones she has now. Initially, she finds herself in the same situation, with no one to turn to but herself. It’s not until Moroha saves her, as he did back then, that she remembers that there is always somebody there watching over you, that there is somebody thinking about and loving you. This, once again, ties back in to her keen understanding of others and the kindness she shows towards those near her. 
 
SOUND 
 
The opening theme has a strange vibe about it. It’s weirdly “scary,” given the instruments and the other, ambient sound effects. This may be due to World Break’s reliance on the past; learning or investigating one’s background can sometimes be filled with rather frightening details. It’s oddly paced, adding further to its unsettling tone. The ending theme is beyond generic – regular singing segments and a used-too-often beat. Overall, the OP is a step-up from the ED, but not by much. 
 
The soundtrack is laughably forgettable, save for one piece: the more choir-like track that plays during Moroha’s “past remembering” phases that adds a sense of sadness and longing. Other than this track, nothing else stands out or is even remotely memorable. 
 
As for voice acting, that sits somewhere around average. Special shout-outs are in order for Aoi Yuuki as Urushibara for her calm yet sexy way of speaking and Ayana Taketatsu as Satsuki for never wavering when it came to giving the peppy girl her hyperactive way of talking. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Despite all of my harsh critiquing of the anime, I still found myself laughing during certain segments, particularly those involving Urushibara and Satsuki. Not only were their interactions with Moroha pretty funny and rather cute, but the relationship they had between each other – with the constant fighting, joking, and one-upping – were typical harem antics that easily put a smile on my face. Even Elena managed to get in on the action whenever she was around, adding one more girl into the equation. 
 
But when those three weren’t around, the show took a dive. The action was never engaging due to the poetry-usage being quite silly, the “drama” didn’t move me, and the rest of the characters were tiresome to watch. I found myself not liking anything else it was doing that wasn’t dealing with Urushibara, Satsuki, or Elena’s humor and personalities. And since the show (understandably) couldn’t focus on them all of the time, I subsequently found myself not finding satisfaction all of the time, too. 
 
Seiken Tsukai no World Break is a show that didn’t have much to begin with. While some of its characters are entertaining by themselves, everything else – from the story to the animation – drags it down. Unfortunately for this one, there will be no poems ever crafted in its honor. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, narrative is founded on contrivances, nonsensical world aspects, and mindless plot elements 
 
Animation: Bad, art is boring and distracting despite some variety, mix of good and bad character designs, with below average actual animation 
 
Characters: Bad, Moroha, Satsuki, and the majority are very weak, Elena is okay, and Urushibara is good 
 
Sound: Bad, okay OP, bad ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Fine, Urushibara, Satsuki, and Elena were fun but that’s it 
 
Final Score: 2/10

","This is my first review! Although there is no a big fight with powerful enemies I felt that this special was just to bring the anime back to life in the memory of many fans, after 11 years. I loved the way they redid the opening ""Chala-Head-Chala"" introduced the current characters (Goten and Trunks). The comic side still remains, with the ""brawl"" between Goku and Vegeta. At the end everyone ends up participating in the battle. is a great special, more not as interesting as the ""Episode of Bardock"".

But all in all it is something good to give fans another piece of DB!:)

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review, so please don't take it too seriously. This is the first Dragonball animation in 11 years. I don't know about you, but I was really looking forward to this when I first heard about it. 
 
-Story- 
Nothing too revolutionary, But not as boring as the older Dragonball Z movies. Its kept the Dragon ball Z fighting and humour style. 
 
-Art- 
I thought this was going to be just like the old Dragonball Z series, but I was wrong. They re-did it, it now looks new and clean. The animation is great and the fights are good also. 
 
-Sound- 
At the beginning you get introduced with the classic music, but with a new opening. It still has the same good punching, kicking and energy blast firing sound effects. The Japanese cast (this isn't dubbed in english...yet) did a very good job, although I wasn't too fond of Goku or Gohan's voice. 
 
-Characters- 
It has the original cast. Goku is still funny and always hungry, Piccolo is a loner, and Vegeta is still really angry at something. Master Roshi is still the same old pervert too. There's a particularly funny scene where he pulls up a lewdly shaped turnip. Goten and Trunks also fuse into Gotenks to fight the invaders. 
 
-Enjoyment- 
I got a kick out of this. It was good to see Goku and friends in another adventure, even though it probably will be their last (unfortunately). 
 
-Overall- 
I recommend this to any Dragonball Z fan. If you are new to the series, you might want to watch the Episodes before going into this movie to know all the characters and their personalities. I give it an 8/10

(Source: FUNimation) ","['Action', 'Military', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Drama']","The film opens as the Earth flagship Blue Noah leads the First Emigration Fleet to Amare. Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The warships of Earth's Fleet (EDF) counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but she vanishes mysteriously afterwards.
Thirty-eight-year-old Susumu Kodai, having quit the EDF sometime after Final Yamato, becomes captain of the cargo vessel Yuki. He picks up the distress signal from Blue Noah and quickly arrives at the wreck with a boarding party. Without warning, three enemy ships arrive. With Kodai at the helm, Blue Noah has just enough power to cover a small distance and fire one shot. Kodai's precise timing and maneuvering destroys all three ships.
Later, at the headquarters of the EDF, Commander Sanada discusses with Kodai about the approaching black hole. Kodai also learns that his wife became lost in the battle. Sanada wants Kodai to lead the Third Emigration Fleet, saying he should follow his wife's example of volunteering.
Kodai returns home, and is met by his daughter, Miyuki, who blames him for the supposed death of his wife. The two barely speak, and before Kodai can attempt to talk with her, he is called back to HQ with news about the Second Emigration Fleet being destroyed by three different fleets, the Beldel and Furide and Ethos, not including the enemy fleet earlier. This means Earth now has four enemies. Kodai accepts command of the Third Emigration Fleet without hesitation, and Sanada reveals his ship: the Yamato itself, newly rebuilt in the Aquarius ice asteroid. After arriving at its drydock and taking his seat in the captain's chair, he makes a solemn vow to find his wife, refusing to believe she is dead.

The Yamato takes off and joins the Fleet, taking its place at the front as Flagship. In the planning room, the crew lays out the mission. The plan is to slingshot around a small black hole, BH199, and boost the arks and warships into high warp, propelling them to Amarh much faster than usual. There is no other option, as there are enemy ships lurking around them and the previous fleets were destroyed at this area. Gouri watches the first group of arks slingshot and warp, and then, still unsure, orders an attack. Soon, the Yamato detects the Alliance Fleets and Kodai promptly orders all fighters on board to launch and the Emigration Escort Fleet to split into two groups to fight the Beldel and Ethos Fleets while the Yamato will fight the Furide. Soon the Furide Fleet begins their attack with the Yamato drawing first blood on a Furide Ship, the enemy responded with a barrage of missiles only to be stopped by Shield Rockets fired from the Yamato. On the other side of the battlefield the Beldel Fleet is faced with a group of Emigration Escort Ships,  both sides begin firing on each other in fury blaze of beams the Beldel launches their squadrons of fighters to battle, the squadrons of fighters from the Yamato intercepts the enemy squadrons and a dogfight ensures. The Furide Fleet begins a massive bombardment on the Yamato and the battleship responded with all guns blazing but 3 Furide Ships, the Furide Flagship among the 3, strayed off from the battle and straight for the Vulnerable Unarmed Arks and begins a bombardment of missiles,  the Yamato notices the stray ships but is under heavy fire preventing the Battleship from moving, with quick thinking the Battleship deploys 3 docked heavy bombers and managed to successfully destroy 2 of the unsuspecting Furide Ships, one of the heavy bombers continued firing on the last surviving Furide ship which was the Flagship of the Furides and succeed in destroying the alien vessel killing the Furide Commander  before they can cause more harm to the fleeing arks, meanwhile the Second Group of Escort Ships confronts the Ethos Fleet and started fighting taking losses on both sides, the Yamato was continuously hit hard by the Furide, thinking quick, Kodai orders a Missile Barrage which destroyed a large portion of the Furide Fleet, on board the Ethos Flagship Gouri notices the ferociousity of the Yamato in battle which inspires the Escort Fleet in battle, Gouri then orders the Fleets to concentrate on the Yamato, meanwhile the SUS Fleet which didn't participate the Battle, on board the SUS Flagship with Meltzlar onboard was quite surprised to see many Alliance Ships being destroyed, soon enough Escort Ships came to assist the Yamato in fighting the leaderless Furide Fleet, with majority of the arks successfully slingshoted from the black hole, Kodai orders the Escort Fleets to regroup and head for the black hole with the Yamato covering their escape, many ships were damaged while escaping, the Furide and Beldel Fleets turns their attention on the Yamato punishing the Battleship with barrage of fire, Ryo Kamijo, the Gunnery Officer of the Battleship prepares the Wave Motion Gun in anger only to be stopped with a slap from Kodai, explaining to him that if they fire the Gun, the Yamato will be drained of Energy leaving the Battleship Defenseless, obeying the Captain, the Gunnery officer turns off the Wave Motion Gun.

He contacts Kodai and tells him that they were misled, twisted to do the bidding of the SUS. Seeing that the EDF Escort Fleet fought honorably, Gouri allows them to go in peace. It had some repercussions — he is later threatened by Barlsman, Commander-in-Chief of the SUS. However, Gouri holds his ground and states that it is the Ethos code of honor to let go an opponent who risks their lives in battle to let others live. Angered, Barlsman gives Gouri a very stern warning if he ever fail him again, the SUS will destroy the homeworld of the Ethos.
The Third Emigration Fleet and Escort Fleet successfully arrives at Amare, much to the joy of the Survivors of the first two Emigration Fleet, the Yamato descends to the Ocean and was greeted by a huge crowd with loud cheers, soon enough Kodai reaches land and spoke to an EDF Member who is a survivor of Yuki's ship, they entered a large hangar where the remains of destroyed Escort Ships from both the First and Second Emigration Fleets is kept, the survivor told Kodai what truly happened, Yuki's Ship found was completely empty, the Survivor passed Kodai a destroyed Captains Hat which belongs to Yuki. As the sun sets in the evening, the Bridge crew of the Yamato wondered if the people of Amare will call their Moon, Earth.  Soon enough on Earth, EDF HQ was happy to hear that the Third Emigration Fleet successfully made it to Amare. Meanwhile, far away from Earth, the Black hole continues its journey to Earth. Back at Amare, Kodai spoke to Queen Iriya of Amare and she told Kodai about the Origins of the Alliance, they were then, the Victims of many Interstellar Wars fought by many Alien Species and as a result they were devastated, the devastation continued over generations and the devastation stopped when the SUS called for peace which gave birth to the Alliance. Kodai now realising the SUS is the leadership of the Alliance which the Queen confirms and stated that the Alliance is more of a Tyrannical Dictatorship under the guise of ""Peace"". The Amare came to hate the SUS but couldn't do anytjing as they were supplying the SUS with resources revealing that the Planet of Amare contain a rare Material which is sought by the SUS, in return the people of Amare receive protection from the SUS, after talking to the Queen Kodai was confronted by an Armed Amarean who is revealed to be General Pascal the leader of the Amare Military, he forces Kodai into a room, Kodai obeys the order only to be faced with 3 Armed Royal Guards upon entering, General Pascal demands that the Humans leave or they will be punished by the Alliance or destroy Amare, kodai refuses, the Royal Guards threats to kill him but the building shakes, realizing the SUS is attacking the City, General Pascal demands Kodai not to interfere, as it would make Amare-SUS relations worse. The SUS launches an Airstrike on the Amare City, dropping bombs on the streets killing numerous civilians, two Massive SUS Tanks and one Colossal SUS Siege Tank plowed the streets destroying buildings, the Amare Police along with armed citizens fought back, the Yamato floating at the distance, The Bridge crew was shocked, Ryo kamijo the gunnery officer demands the First officer to launch the Yamato to battle but they notices the SUS Bombers retreating, Kodai arrived on the bridge after returning from the City, he explains to the Crew of what he learned which stunned everyone, the Yamato goes on standby, the Yamato detects a second of wave of Bombers, this time with fighters among the groups of bombers they began their bombardment on the helpless city killing more civilians, the Amare Army now joining the fight against the SUS. The SUS War Machines firing at everything in their path destroying more buildings and killing countless. Above the skies the Ethos Fleet along with the Ethos Flagship arrives, seeing the devastation the SUS have created, Gouri contacted Metzlar asking why the SUS are attacking Amare, an ally of the Alliance, which Metzlar responses that Amare is sanctioned for defying the Alliance, horrified by the fact the SUS are attacking indiscriminately, Gouri confronts Metzlar that the Alliance wouldn't commit such acts which Metzlar finally reveals to Gouri that the SUS's decision is the decision of the Alliance and demands Gouri to start his attack on Amare which Gouri refuses, the SUS Fleet led by Metzlar descends from the sky to confront the Ethos Fleet, Gouri having enough of such Barbaric decisions, he insulted Metzlar ending the transmission, on board the Ethos Flagship the First Officer was surprised at Gouri insulting the SUS Admiral, Gouri, in an attempt to reclaim his honor and save Amare, orders the Ethos Fleet to prepare for battle. Back on the Yamato Kodak received a message from Gouri, both former enemies greeted each other with Salute, Gouri explains to Kodak of he's intentions on turning against the SUS and the Alliance, being pressed by the Alliance in exchange for ""peace"" which is how the Alliance operates, ending with a Salute, on board the SUS Flagship, Metzlar gives a big thumbs down and the SUS Fleet begins descending on the Ethos Fleet, both sides open fire on each other in a fury blaze of beams, Gouri aims for the Flagship of the SUS Maya on a Suicide Run, the Ethos Flagship bursts in speed towards the Maya in a final charge of honor, Kodai was shocked at what Gouri is doing, a vengeful Metzlar orders the Fleet to target the Ethos Flagship but the Resilient Ethos ship absorbs large amounts of fire and even ram pass a SUS Ship scaring Metzlar, the Ethos Flagship rams the Maya destroying the massive SUS Flagship killing Gouri and he's First Officer along with everyone else on both ships, but Metzlar managed to escaped with some surviving crew, both sides disengaged...

Back on the Yamato Kodai remembering that his wife always fought injustice, is inspired and informs Queen Iriya of his intention to declare war on the SUS. The Yamato fires volleys of missiles, destroying the SUS Fighters and Bombers and blowing up both SUS Tanks and the Colossal Siege Tank. The Queen is brought to tears and thanks Kodai and his crew for their bravery. As the arks return to Earth with a token force of escorts,  the Escort Fleet follows the Yamato into battle, General Pascal is also inspired by Kodai's decision, the Amare Navy led by General Pascal on board the Amare Flagship joins the Escort fleet for one final battle: an assault on the nearby SUS space fortress. If it is destroyed, then the SUS will lose control over everything.
On the SUS Space Fortress, Metzlar meets with Barlsman and informs him of recent events and Barlsman assures him that there's no reason to panic.
Outside the Fortress, a massive combined Furide and Beldel and SUS Fleet stands ready and waits for their opponents to arrive for battle. The combined Fleet led by the Yamato and the Amare Flagship warps in, the Yamato deploys its Squadrons of fighters and heavy bombers, both sides starts firing on each other losing ships, the Squadrons of the Yamato faces off with Squadrons from the Beldel Fleet in a massive Dogfight, the Yamato then suffers damage from enemy Fire losing one of its main gun turrets, the ship's Warp Core starts to malfunction but was quickly fixed by the Chief Engineer Saving the Battleship from destruction, as the Battle rages into dangerous close quarters, kodai orders the Yamato To break off and aim for the center with cover for their  squadrons, behind the combined enemy fleet, the SUS space fortress reveals itself from the mist of red clouds, surrounded by 5 massive pillars, Kodai surprised by the size of the fortress, orders Maho the Chief Navigator to analyse the fortress, inside the fortress, Barlsman was disappointed with Metzlar's tactics which he replied by ordering the Fortress Crew to prepare the Neutron Beam Cannons to fire on the Combined Earth and Amare fleet, the crew refuses as Allied ships were on the line of fire but Metzlar forces them to fire, outside the fortress, the 5 pillars are revealed to be the neutron guns, 2 of the pillars deployed its massive Gun barrel and fires a massive surge of neutron energy at the Fleets destroying almost all of the alliance ships, General Pascal orders the Amare Fleet to defend the Yamato the beam destroys the entire Amare Fleet and a large portion of the Escort Fleet, the Flagship of the Amare fleet was severely damaged defending the Battleship from the neutron beam with its shield, on board the burning Amare flagship, a dying Pascal bids the Yamato Good luck, the ship explodes, the bridge crew of the battleship was in total shock that the SUS fired on their own and was not so surprised when the surviving ships of the alliance turns and retreats from the battlefield, inside the fortress Metzlar requests they fire all 5 of the Neutron Guns on the Escort Fleet which Barlsman approves, the other 4 Pillars deploys their gun barrels and fires in unison, the Yamato and her Squadrons managed to escape the beam as they tear through the battlefield destroying the remaining Escort Ships, the Yamato fires a massive barrage on the fortress but they were deflected by its impenetrable shield, kodai orders the squadrons back to the ship, Maho reports to bridge about her findings and reveals to the crew about the inner workings of the space fortress, realising that the 5 pillars are also the shield generators for the fortress, the Yamato's First Officer requests to borrow the Shinano, Yamato's auxiliary ship but kodai refuses but the First Officer deliberately volunteers himself for this which kodai agrees, the Shinano fires a barrage of Wave Motion Missiles but they were ineffective, the Shinano was greeted with a massive barrage of anti air fire from 2 pillars damaging the Shinano, the First Officer already wounded, sacrifices himself and disables the defensive energy shield around the fortress by ramming destroying the Shinano shattering the shield like glass, inside the fortress a fearful Barlsman and Metzlar watch in horror while Kodai gives a Salute, he then orders the Crew to start up the wave motion gun while the fortress aims its Pillars on the Yamato, with the Wave Motion Gun ready, the Yamato unleashes five powerful shots, destroying the pillars revealing a massive sea and the main SUS Fortress sinks.
On board the Yamato, the crew celebrates but suddenly, an immense ship emerges from the sea, and bombards the Yamato with heavy beam fire before retreating into the sea and coming out from behind And bombarding the already damaged Yamato, the Immense Ship fired a Neutron Beam but the Yamato narrowly missed the shot, maho was in shock that such ship is Abel manipulate dimensions and wander them freely, the Damage Teams reports to Bridge of the damage the ship has suffered, the SUS Ship emerges from the front and pummels the Yamato with heavy Fire, when Kodai, realizing that the power source is the artificial sun behind it, uses the final available shot of the Wave Motion Gun on it, two small ships peeled off from the SUS Ship towards the Yamato pummeling the Battleship with fire but was swiftly destroyed by a missile barrage, the Yamato fires its last remaining Wave Motion Shot on the artificial sun collapsing the sun and turning it into a black hole. The Yamato escapes, while the enemy ship—with Metzlar and Barlsman in it—is torn apart and sucked into it. Metzler escaped the destruction of the SUS space fortress, and appears to the Yamato crew and reveals himself and the people of the SUS as energy beings that can change form, being sent to this galaxy from another universe. He then disappears.
The Yamato warps back to Earth, and the energy being Metzler appears again. He reveals that the black hole headed for Earth is artificially created and controlled: it will serve as a portal to ""steal"" Earth and take its resources, since they cannot be found in his world. Kodai realizes that it must have a power source. The Wave Motion Gun automatically reconfigured to enable it to fire all six shots in one go, a risky decision that could destroy the ship, but the crew unanimously agree that saving Earth is more important. The Yamato dives into the black hole, and as it reaches the core, the Wave Motion Gun fires, destroying the artificial weapon in a gigantic implosion. The blast from the Wave Motion Gun had ruptured and damaged the Yamato bow and front section; the third bridge (where the ship's navigation room resides) also suffers serious damage and is exposed to space, killing Chief Navigator Maho Orihara, who was working in it, and her assistants; but the ship is still space-worthy and orbits Earth in triumph. Earth can now be repopulated and the arks can return home. Kodai also reconciles with his daughter in the end.
","-This review may contain spoilers from the movie and from the original series- 
 
When talking about anime classics, there are not many series that rank higher than Uchuu Senkan Yamato, and with good reason, as Yamato is one of the greatest space operas out there. 
 
This movie takes place in the year 2220, 21 years after the original series (which also has a remake now), and it's a direct sequel, where Kodai will again be the main character and will be in charge of leading an inmigration fleet to an other planet because a black hole is approaching Earth, and the days of the blue planet are counted. 
 
This completely remade story shows us how CGI can actually be an incredible tool in animation when used well (and when having good budget). Yamato's animation, which uses CGI A LOT, is really mindblowing. Throughout the whole movie, there is always consistent great animation, with very well made battles between spaceships. Yamato is second to none in this. 
 
Music also plays a big factor in this movie, which uses a lot of beautiful classical music such as Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave, Chopin's Nocturne #1 or Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Besides that, there's always the classical Yamato theme played in grand fashion and in various ways and a very nice ending to close the movie. 
 
The story started good, but it did get worse by the second half. Still, thanks to great animation, sound and action, the movie never ceased to entertain one bit. The first half of the movie was pretty good story-wise. Kodai had a clear mission, we got to meet a great enemy general and, while not very complex, things were very good. Things got a little worse when we suddenly got a rather plain villain, making the series almost a simple evil vs good thing. Still action didn't drop one bit, and the Space Battleship Yamato proved to be as awesome as ever, showing its upgraded power to the fullest. The movie put the ship in some dire situations, which resulted in some of the best space action I've ever seen. 
 
Besides Kodai, who enters the movie as a memorable character already, there isn't really any character that stood out much to me. They fullfilled their role well, but they were definitely not as good as the original Yamato crew. 
 
Another slight problem is that for flashback scenes, they actually really just used things from the 1983 movie, which of course, looked very out of place in this 2010 movie. Still, that was just at a very specific moment of the anime, so it's not something that will really hinder the experience in any way. You can actually be positive and use the moment to see how anime has evolved in the last 30 years. 
 
You will notice that some major events happened between the original series and this movie... that'd be Kanketsu-hen, which hasn't been remade. While it's impossible not to notice, and while having watched Kanketsu-hen before would make the experience better, you don't really need to watch it. Just with the original series you should be fine. 
 
This movie's definitely not as good as the original series, but it's still a very nice sequel, and some of the main strong points of Yamato are kept intact. It is something very nice how Kodai has matured as a person between the original series and this movie, as you can see how, little by little, he's becoming more like the legendary Juzo Okita. 
 
And even if its not as good as the original series, if you enjoyed that one, Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Fukkatsu-hen should be one hell of a ride. But again, watching the original series is a must in this case.

13,1168,87,7.004612737357769,story with the main character transported to another world,Musekinin Kanchou Tylor OVA,"Six long months have passed. The Raalgon Empire has developed a horrible new type of weapon, and Tylor has been charged with the duty of intercepting it as it is being transported. But when all that could go wrong does go wrong, the crew members of the Soyokaze find themselves at the mercy of their enemies. As the hours tick down toward their execution, the crew wonders: has their irresponsible captain misled them? Or is this all a part of some greater strategy? 
 
(Source: RightStuf)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","In a distant, highly technological future, Tylor, the title character, is a mysterious young man without a real purpose in life, a state of mind that is very hard to determine, and a knack for accidentally getting out of near-death situations with a childishly cavalier attitude. He sometimes does not even seem to realize when he is in danger, which is actually an asset to him on many occasions.
Tylor stumbles his way into the United Planets Space Force and soon gains command of a destroyer after resolving a hostage dispute and saving a retired admiral. Despite being given a decrepit and underpowered ship (the Soyokaze), thanks to brilliant strokes of luck, Tylor manages to destroy a patrol group. This is quickly followed by a sneak attack on another patrol group, performed while Tylor was playing the role of a consummate, professional soldier. The admiralty, attempting to kill Tylor, present him with a medal modified with a device to trick the Raalgon fleet into believing the Soyokaze is an entire fleet. Tylor loses the medal in UPSF HQ, and the Raalgons destroy the admiralty's super-weapon instead.
The Soyokaze is then sent to a demotion sector, despite the fervent hopes of its crew. There, Tylor and Yamamoto encounter the ghost of the former captain, who vanishes due to depression after seeing Tylor's behavior. The Admiral of the fleet, who actually drove the prior Captain to suicide, rescinds Tylor's demotion after seeing Tylor with the former captain's pipe, thinking he is now aware of the admiral's crime. Tylor is then captured by the Raalgon fleet, who plan to execute him to boost morale. After escaping his cell, Tylor encounters the Empress of the Raalgon, Azalyn, in plain dress, and spends the day entertaining her. She stops his execution, and his jailors implant microchip in his brain to control him.
Meanwhile, the crew of the Soyokaze has been imprisoned by the brass. They manage to escape captivity and invade the Melva, the main Raalgon ship, to get Tylor back. During the fight, Tylor saves Azalyn from a bomb that her treacherous Prime Minister Wang had detonated to gain power for himself. Tylor is badly injured, and Azalyn tells the Raalgon that she is going with Tylor back to the Soyokaze in order to make sure he is all right. After the doctor saves Tylor, Azalyn returns to her people.
Tylor then rendezvouses with the main fleet, where he is branded a traitor for letting Azalyn return. He is sentenced to death by a firing squad. However, Tylor convinces the brass that he can defeat the Raalgon, and they reluctantly allow him to take complete command. After coming to a stand-off with Dom, Tylor manages to spill no blood and stop the fighting for the time being. After the death of Admiral Hanner, whom Tylor had adored and talked with, Tylor becomes sullen and announces he will leave the military. Lieutenant Yamamoto is given command of the brand new ship, the Aso. In the final episode, the former crew of the Soyokaze, who are supposed to be on the Aso, join Tylor on the Soyokaze as they fly out into space.
The two major powers in the story are the UPSF (United Planets Space Force) and the Raalgon Empire (the extraterrestrials), who resemble humans with pointy ears and unusual haircolor).
One of the largest points of dispute in the story is the competence of Tylor. Several characters say of Tylor, ""I can't decide if he's an idiot or a genius."" Whether he is a genius or an idiot is up to viewers.
","Well, how to begin... Let me start by words that this OVA was rather disappointing. It isn´t bad, NO ! I enjoyed it quite a bit but,  I enjoyed the original series a lot more and once I watched this I just felt like this OVA should get a second title: The deleted Scenes or The Alternative version. Why ? Let me explain... 
 
Story: 6-7/10 
The story of the OVA is set after the happenings of the original series but you´ll rarely get the feeling it really is taking place after everything because except some small differences the whole OVA looks more like something that didn´t fit into the original story rather than its continuation. Testimony to this argument is the fact that only a half of the entire OVA has actually something to do with the story and its “continuation”. The other half can be described with one word: “filler”. Approximately 5 of the 10 episodes are fillers portraying individuals in either everyday life or describing their backgrounds. It´s not necessarily bad, but it kind of confuses the whole feel of the entire OVA. Were they trying to continue the story or bring depth to the characters? Looking at the OVA one might think both but that proves to be not the smartest solution if you ask me. The OVA would be a lot better if they went only with one of the two possibilities and concentrate on it, rather than having both but each being half-assed. The worst part of it all is the fact that like the original series, even the OVA ends with a cliff-hanger but unlike the original where the ending could be interpreted as a kind of “open ending”, the end of the OVA literally demands another season that would continue where the OVA left off (but let´s be frank, the possibility of there ever being a continuation is nearing absolute zero so the OVA leaves a certain feel of incompletion thus disappointment). 
 
Characters/Art/Sound: 8/10 
Aside from the story, not much has changed. The characters kept most of their traits (with some changes here and there but nothing major) and even the sound and graphic quality remained on the pretty much same level considering how old the show actually is. Even the humour remained. Maybe not so much of it as in the original but you still can find yourself smiling at some parts.  
 
Enjoyment: 7-8/10 
Since I liked the original to the point of giving it a 9/10 I was really happy to see the old faces of Tylor and co. once again. Despite the problems I had with the story the anime proved to be not that bad as a whole but due to its nature I just couldn´t bring myself to like it as much as I did the prequel. In short, the OVA is enjoyable but don´t expect too much. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
Due to the rather weak story (and the way it ends) the OVA is far from home when it comes to comparing it to the original series but as the saying goes: “It still could have been worse”. It isn´t bad or anything but it definitely could have been better in more aspects than one. If you liked the original you might probably like even the OVA with its ups and downs and if you won´t put too much hope in it you might find it to be a not so good but still nice sequel. 
 
Re-watchability:  2/5 
(5)- Anywhere, anytime, as many times as you like! 
(4)-Definitely worth seeing more than 3 times… 
(3)-Once for regular viewer, 2 (or even 3) times for a fan. 
(2)- Seeing once is more than enough. 
(1)- Impossible to even reach the end… 


          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the tv series is just a notch below the tv series. 
 
I won't go to far into the show, my review for this OVA would almost be the same for the tv series.  It again follows Captain Tylor.  At the beginning of the show the crew of the destroyer all have been reassigned.  Then adventure ensues as a unknown enemy appears. 
 
As I stated in my review for the series this is a show I recommend and think everyone will enjoy.

","An anime that spans the length of 101 episodes but actually ends in 25. Had the potential to rival that of Major and Kuroko no Basket but failed abruptly. 
 
 
The music score is very pleasant and catchy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=143U6jyU6AM 
 
""My girl [hum this part because it's Japanese]. My girl .."" 
 
 
The artwork and animation is amazing considering the age of the anime. 
 
The characters are very lovable. Each having their own unique traits and even catch phrases. Those were my original thoughts until the development went downhill for certain characters, but with that said some character development was well done. The voice actors matched their character roles to a tee. 
 
 
It was an enjoyable anime and had me hooked for.. 25 episodes. The potential for this anime went down the drain like pouring down an entire glass bottle of newly purchased expensive foreign aged chardonnay. Not that I know how much that costs but people sure do make them sound expensive in books and movies. 
 
 
This anime could have easily been a 10/10 masterpiece, but I heavily disagree on the plot therefore dropping the score to a dreadful 2/10. I recommend only 23-24 episodes. Any further is up to your own discretion.

          
 
       Helpful spoiler ahead, but it is must for this review. read at your own risk  
 
it is very exciting up to episode 24 but after the death of kazuya usegi I couldn't help but feel sad at the down fall. 
 
why? we all knew adachi is the writer who mostly likes to kill off one of the characters, i have expected this but I never imagined how he would present the character in such a worst way that is about to die. 
 
kazuya and tatsuya are twin brothers who are madly in love with minami a childhood friend who grew with them and is also their neighbor, if I have to say kazuya was the one who is more in love with minami than his brother.He played baseball and worked hard to become an ace pitcher just to get appreciation and win the heart of minami even though he is not a naturally talented like his elder brother. 
 
On the other hand minami is in love with tatsuya who never shows interest in anything and is a lazy bum. but has natural talent. 
 
i didn't like the character of minami, the female lead of touch. from the first we got hints that she is in love with tatsuya but whenever there scenes of her and kazuya, they have shown her flirting and way her character representation around kazuya always secured hope in kazuya heart that one day she will fall in love with her and not only that she asks kazuya to fulfill her dream to koushien. it gives him further hope that she will love him one day and he works all his life to achieve her dream. 
 
while this continues, kazuya and tatsuya are aware that they both are in love with same girl, for the world kazuya had better chance with minami but kazuya knows his brother had the potential to steal minami away. so he works harder and harder for this girl, while tatsuya doesn't try to show any interest for sake of his brother. 
 
now after you reach 20 episodes later, minami is been shown she is completely aware of kazuya feelings towards her and is also aware she is love with tatsuya. so now no matter how many times kazuya throws hints of her love she never comes to him with a clean reply that she doesn't love him and is in love with his brother instead but still asks kazuya to fulfill her koushien dream and in turn rising much hope in kazuya. 
 
before kazuya died, he gets to know minami is in love with his brother tatsuya and yet he doesn't give up and challenges his brother on this matter.  
now this got worse, when he challenged everyone expected to be a love triangle and rivalry comptietion but the next episode itself kazuya who is on the way to final match which leads him to fulfill the dream of minami's koushien gets killed by a truck. now what the fuck is this I have to ask. 
 
i felt really sad and sympathy with the character. from the beginning kazuya was shown giving all his life for a girl he is in love, while she is completely aware of it and is also aware she will never love him back and yet asks him to fulfill her dreams in name of friendship or childhood friend (which I say is really bitchy of her part to use him like that). she should not rub of her dreams to a guy just because he is in love with her and give him false hopes. 
 
kazuya death was so meaning less and pathetic, i felt sad for the poor guy who lived all his life for this girl only.  
 
later the anime showed that elder brother tatsuya will adopt dream of kazuya which is going to koshien, but seriously I have to ask when it is kazuya dream. it was a dream he just inherited from minami and he died for nothing and the day before he died he even got rejected indirectly by the minami who he loved all the years of his life. 
 
it was quite a injustice, story wise you may cope up and think it is best anime, but I can't bear how unnecessary was the death of kazuya was. without his death too you can create an heart touching anime, it is just his death was meaningless and really sad for viewers.. i hated this anime after kazuya death and I mostly hate minami who is like a two timer bitch and uses the useigi boys to fulfill her dreams just because they are in love with her. 
 
overall I say the characters foundation is itself weak, the brothers had a beautiful relationship which was destroyed in episode 26 by killing one of the brother. 
 
but if you can get over kazuya death you can enjoy anime, I could not because I liked kazuya and feel sympathy and I hate minami for being so flirty with kazuya when she is completely aware of his feelings. 
 
and I also say the the main lead is now achieving his brothers dream to koushien and it is the center pillar concept of touch, but like I said when it is his brothers dream, his brothers dream is always to be loved by minami and marry her which he couldn't because he is dead. 
 
All i say is the central concept is itself a fact less and lie and that is why it is much annoying and I couldn't bear to watch touch.  
for those who didn't watch just watch up to 24 episodes and you will understand what I am saying. 
 
  


          
 
       Helpful I started watching thinking I would only watch a couple of episodes of this sports anime in old fashioned drawing style, but unexpectedly I finished it rather fast and wishing there were even more episodes. 
 
The story is slow paced and character development driven, it is all about the relationships between the main characters. Before I knew it I was sympathizing with each one of them, as they all have a lot of depth. 
I don't care about baseball and have no clue about its rules, but the baseball parts are never boring, on the contrary, they were very exciting to watch and I really got into them. 
The voice-acting was good and I thought the sugary music suited the anime really well. 
 
It was 101 episodes long, yet surprisingly enjoyable from start to end. 
 
Hotness: Although the anime is not packed with huge amounts of romantic scenes and over the top sweet lines, there is nevertheless a lot of electricity in the air and it has its hot moments. 
 
Bishounen:  I'm not a fan of the character design, but somehow I got used to it. Together with the character design, the twins grow on you. Later in the story Akio Nitta, the star batter for Sumi Tech, comes along.

Story 
-pro: a new character is added 
-negative: Character's contribution is minimal at best. 
-negative: no underlying message, at least one that isn't clear. 
-negative: ending is rather abrupt.  
 
Art 
same art style as the original show. If you had not seen the original the artwork is fair, characters along with background is drawn nicely. 
 
Sound 
no complaints 
 
Overall/enjoyment: this episode was a foolish run. If there were follow up episodes i could see potential but this appears to be the last at least for this season. The only feature this episode brought in was a hinted dance teacher. Which works but one could say that position was already filled by another member of the original trio. If you ask me the funniest moment was how the ending was not only questionable but it happened at a moment where certain characters were confused as well. Not many things work well with confusion then more confusion.

13,33531,91,6.977261671355873,story with the main character transported to another world,Juushinki Pandora,"The series is set in a near-future world where the boundary between human being and AI is vague. A rapid biological evolution, similar to ""Cambrian Explosion,"" is caused by one incident. This incident turns into the genesis of a new jostle for supremacy, and the influence of the evolution goes beyond biological framework and spreads to various kinds of materials and technologies. The era of massive evolution involving diverse existences, such as human, machines, and biotechnologies, is coming. Characters fight an existential war in such a world. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Mecha']","The series takes place in the year 2038, seven years after the Xianglong Crisis when a quantum reactor exploded and caused a chain reaction that destroyed civilization. It also spurred a rapid evolutionary process that turned most animals into bio-mechanical creatures called BRAI (Biological Revolutionary of Accelerated Intellect), that gradually become a threat to humanity as the city of Neo-Xianglong establish the creation of MOEV (Multi-purpose Organic Evolution Vehicle) mecha to fend off the BRAI. Leon Lau, a scientist previously exiled from Neo-Xianglong for his role in the Xianglong Crisis, provides a stable quantum reactor called the Hyper Drive to enable the MOEV of the established Pandora Unit to combat a series of BRAI that are being enhanced by a similar device created by the mysterious Sieg.
","Shoji Kawamori, the creator of the much beloved Macross series of the 80s and 90s, has created another flick to his name, the latest project called Juushinki Pandora, an omage to his works of past of the sci-fi-mecha genre which as of late, has seen much flack due to the many issues with his directorial work. 
 
Oh...how the mighty have fallen. To be fair, the honest takeaway is Shoji Kawamori's mech designs which still look good...at the expense of other areas of the show that quite honestly, isn't a good sales-pitch anymore going forward. 
 
Juushinki Pandora is set in an alternate universe where human beings and AI, or much rather, the B.R.A.I, which are machine-made beasts made out from the cause of biological evolution, was spearheaded from an unforeseen explosion by one man who goes under the name of Leon Lau. Formerly a scientist working on the time-space mechanics to maintain mankind through the quantum reactor (which is mainly used to regulate time-space control), his ambitious work came with a high cost, one that would take a long period of time to assimilate the full extent of the damage that is the Neo Xianglong crisis. 
 
Fast forward some years after the crisis, and Leon Lau is called back from exile to help the city of Neo Xianglong (after the rebuilding) to combat the events that have once happened with his major blunder, and also to deflect the evil forces that have culminated to this day, just to see mankind perish under their egoistic dreams and ambitions to see a new breed of mankind under the control of B.R.A.I. Together with the Pandora dream team of Queenie Yoh and Doug Horvat, the trio must pilot their mechs, with their souls beaming across the time-space mechanism that gives the mechs power and push back evil forces to maintain what's known as the ""Last Hope"" of mankind. (And yes, that' the main English subbed title of the series). 
 
My pointers: 
1) Going through 26 episodes seem like a horrendous waste of time, but it comes with the trade-off that for about 80% of the series, it's primarily based on the world-building, built between the connection of mankind and B.R.A.I, and the direct consequences that of the result which happened prior. The wonky part is that the storytelling isn't done by Kawamori himself, but at the hands of Toshizou Nemoto, who did the overall series composition AND script of Macross Delta and the Towa no Quon movie series (so for people who have watched Macross Delta, your shots are fired), so the whole show felt like a chore to go through THIS MUCH where improvements to cut unnecessary filler could be a wise choice and bring this down to a max of either 16 to 24 episodes. 
 
2) As if the production staff ain't competent enough, we have another series of misfires: Director Hidekazu Satou, with the incompetent works of Aquarion Logos and Nobunaga the Fool. Having Kawamori-san as the chief director is heartening enough for anyone who wants to venture into the series, but having Satou-san helm this project is off-putting to say the least (at least that's from Kawamori's perspective). The stories that this series strings out pale in comparison to many 2-cour shows that take advantage of the runtime to showcase everything it needs to and succinct to the point, honestly, if it can be dumbed down to just storytelling juxtaposition and pure action scenes alone, I can live with that. 
 
Overall: just another failure on Shoji Kawamori's part to entice more viewers to his legacy of mech-based anime (of which his forte haven't changed since then, to draw mechs). 
 
Characters: 
The Pandora team main fighters: Leon Lau, Doug Horvat and Queenie Yoh. 
All 3 of them have their problems and issues that when merged as one, serve as the main driving force for them: 
Leon Lau, having to lose a colleague (Dr. Long Wu), his aide in working together to understand the quantum reactor and its various reactions, now striving to understand through the entire process through the many various illusions of Long (which form Sieg the final boss) to question the many purposes and intentions of evolving mankind. 
Doug Horvat, primarily a fighter and sniper of the best you could find around, amidst his crude and good-looking personality lies a past that he is tempted and forced to face: the love of a scientist, Dr. Emilia Vally, so much so that the tainted relationship forces them to enclose questions within each other for the sake of building the both of them forward. 
Queenie Yoh, the story of clans and promises, the many rivalries she has from young, starting with Mr. Gold (and then Wong) and the foreboding that the clans' past have all but been wiped out with numerous betrayals and backstabs that both sides have come to lament about each other for the growing-up years, until this moment with the help of B.R.A.I to harness power unimaginable. 
 
The Pandora support team: Cain Hasan Ibrahim, Glen Din, and Leon's (adopted) sister Chloe: 
Despite appearances, Cain is as calm and collective as you would expect an army general to be, deep down to the point and not wasting any effort in getting things done. Along with comrade Glen, who is a crude fighter and the ""don't think twice on actions"" guy, his devotion and loyalty is the most annoying part, but yet serves as the resting point for everyone to mock and joke at. 
 
As for Leon's (adopted from Long) sister Chloe though, she holds him dear as to everyone like they are a family, more than just a fighter team. Along with the idiosyncrasies of the ""family contract"" (which forebodes good intentions at the ending) of which there are many unlisted and vaguely conceived (just between Leon and herself alone), she makes for a good sibling to be taken care of and lead on with her brother's consistent fight with cooking Leon's favourite and go-to twisted snack Mahua and the like. 
 
Neo Xianglong's pilot team: Jay Yun, Cecille Sue (and Fiona for the 2nd cour) 
For the most part, I thought that Jay as a commander, he relegated his skills well and was able to discern situations to the best of his ability. Along with the Princess Cecille, keeping the city of Neo Xianglong afloat with the many controversies that it has, because with the city itself being an area that is loft for B.R.A.I to manifest, enemy advantages are aplenty, so the city's protection falls under their heavy shoulders. 
Fiona herself is pretty much a human-spirited catalyst waiting to happen, the series of happenings that foretell the future of mankind. Essentially, a plot-mover and nothing else. 
 
Overall, characters here display their usual cliché-ness, and needs a lot of work to be refined with. 
 
Art and animation: 
For once, while the overall production was good, Kawamori's parent company Satelight took some liberties at trying to envision his idea come to life in anime form, most notably the China-Shanghai reference of Neo Xianglong (Kawamori DID went to China for an interview and proposed the idea as the background art and animation) and the B.R.A.I designs, which are done by Hidekazu Satou and the mech designs by obviously Kawamori himself. 
 
Whilst the animation quality really took a substantial hit by dropping some frames here and there (especially with the action scenes), I'd say that at least it's on par with past Kawamori's works. The pacing however is quite messy and sometimes stuff just don't mesh well together, but that is forgiven (a teeny-weeny bit) due to the story progression with the overall feel of the series. 
 
Music: 
This is the first time I've ever heard to BUMP OF CHICKEN (aside from favourites such as Sangatsu no Lion, Kekkai Sensen), and it still holds up within the 6 months of just showcasing the same OP and ED, just broken down into the usual verse and chorus within the songs, and they sound good for the most part. By far the best part of the show. 
 
Overall verdict: 
For anyone still living on the promises that Shoji Kawamori would promise whatever he tries to cook up, please don't. This anime is the result of his work, and judging from everything, is still an awful misconception that this would be anything groundbreaking of today's standards. 
 
This show is completely average all around, with nothing to spare. Not something I would recommend, but with a few screws loose.

          
 
       Helpful Neon Evolution EvangeTransformers...Shoji Kawamori you kinda went crazy with this one... 
 
Juushinki Pandora gives us something of an Attack on Titan ""last of humanity"" while monsters named B.R.A.I (or animals that evolved into mechs) invaded the land due to the Cambrian Explosion and needing Hyperdrived vehicles named M.O.E.V in order to defeat them, but for LA's main reason as to why this anime interested LA......Nao Touyama was in it. 
 
So to brass tax, Juushinki Pandora somewhat excels in character and story integration which makes the increasingly crazy plot twists apply and oddly enough given enough leeway and hinting as such, where the anime does falter however comes in in terms of structure, pacing and execution, but that a bit later. 
 
Character-wise due to the major development and screentime with the core cast, we go in-depth with the Pandora Team and world building through Neo Xianglong and the Hyperdrives due to the link the main protagonist Leon Lau as well. Leon Lau voiced by Tomoaki Maeno is the typical nerd, absent minded yet a genius but was dubbed ""the man who destroyed the world"", as he joins the Neo Xianglong Pandora Team, he opens up to the core cast and less aloof to not only protect everyone but is something of a hybrid of system controller AND frontliner in the fight against the B.R.A.I. World building-wise, Leon and his rival villain brings us many of the finer detail to the newly evolved world, the Hyperdrives and really how he's linked into all this. Nonetheless being the main protagonist and being the narrative focus...this was a given and nonetheless a good narrative focus character who just like the audience is trying to figure out the craziness alongside him. Chloe Lau voiced by Nao Touyama is Leon's ""little sister"" and really is for the majority of the anime and is the pillar of support, there is a bit of screentime to her, only because she's something of a satellite character but only has one plot point that isn't really in focus. Queenie You voiced by Kana Hanazawa is the tsundere of the core cast but loves ""cute things"" and as such, she connects with Chloe really easily, she's also a kung fu artist and it incorporates into her M.O.E.V and she's after someone who killed her master and is her main focus in terms of subplots. She actually became LA's favourite character...yeah it took a bit (as in past half way through the anime as well as her character focused arc) but yeah...LA picked Kosaki instead of Chitoge this time. Next is Doug Horvat voiced by Kenjirou Tsuda a sniper and has something of a tragic backstory with a ""former lover"", he's the brooding nonchalant ""womanizer"" of the team. For supporting cast, we have Cain Hasan voiced by Unshou Ishizuka the gentle giant papa of the group who's looking for his family after the Cambrian Explosion. Next is Cecil Sue voiced by Ai Kayano, the leader of Neo Xianglong and.......Ms. Fanservice of the entire anime (no seriously), nonetheless she has a stake in this as one of the major villains has MAJOR beef with her and her clan. Jay Yun voiced by Yuuichirou Umehara is Cecil's secretary and he also has a connection with Leon in his past but it's not a major plot point. Glenn Din voiced by Yuuma Uchida is the ""normal guy"" of the group and he's ONLY known to be the hot-blooded abrasive and highly protective character with his only annoying running gag of ""I'm not a delinquent, It's CAPTAIN"".    
 
The cast do have good chemistry only because the anime seemed to thread the characters with ""family"", whether it be Leon and Chloe's situation, Queenie's revenge against her personal villain for killing her ""family"", Doug and his ""former lover"", Glenn's desire to protect Neo Xianglong and Cecil's clan traditions that created Neo Xianglong that caused a mess later on with her major villain. All the core cast have a villain that opposes the themes of the core cast of ""family"" have and makes us get used to the characters as well as the character chemistry as the core cast have something of a core goal, protect one of the last bastions of humanity, Neo Xianglong. 
 
As for the villains, well to say that they don't die easily is an understatement as they mostly fuel the protagonists development as well as world building as to what even the B.R.A.I's are and what the Cambrian Explosion came to be, with one of the major villains that has a link with Leon. To say ALL the villains are hamfisted or delightfully snarky is an understatement but nonetheless, the villains were a nice constrast to the rest of the core cast and the obvious shaking up of the plot and their theming of evolution or just their own selfish self-destructive interests that is in direct contrast to the protagonist's ""family"" theming and how they dealt with it, you know as a sorta yin and yang. 
 
The world building is just as solid as it's characters, as LA aforementioned with Leon as the majority of the plotlines with it's characters as well as the smaller details towards many of the concepts of the anime is explained, yes quantum this and that but this works effectively well with it's plot twists...the MAJORITY of it at least. Not only that but we do get in-depth to Neo Xianglong, the B.R.A.I, the M.O.E.V, the entire Cambrian Explosion being explained, how all this affects the characters and villains motives. Juushinki Pandora doesn't handwave things away as ludicrous as it becomes as the hints were there, it's just more or less if you can suspend your disbelief with the craziness and for LA, 98% of the time it worked for LA.  
 
In terms of animation, done by Satelight, well the animation was for the most part, consistent, with some good character designs, almost exotic especially from Queenie and Cecil. The CGI use was decent as well, blatant especially with the B.R.A.I but LA thinks that was the point of them being unearthly yet alien-like but heck even the Transforming M.O.E.V CGI use was decent, yes even the battles using the CGI was great especially with Queenie's M.O.E.V and her kung fu robot moves. Backgrounding is mostly barren wasteland but we do get some psychedelic moments that counters all this. Yes the animation does reuse ALOT of scenes mainly from the M.O.E.V transformations but really this is kinda the thing LA knows from Satelight, gorgeous animation and it's sometimes crazy battles and even OST Power Up *cough* Symphogear  
 
And on speaking of which, the voice cast..well we have ALOT of well known voice actors, from Kana Hanazawa, Nao Touyama, Tomoaki maeno, Ai Kayano, Mamiko Noto, Asami Seto, Unshou Ishizuka, Yuuma Uchida and Akira Ishida. Really LA isn't complaining in the slightest with this voice cast, they did great in their respective roles. 
 
So, Juushinki Pandora does have it's flaws as much as LA does praise it, as such the multiple plot threads and how exceedingly proceeds what with it's character plot threads, makes the structure sometimes hard to follow, as it either focuses on a character, a major event, or an isolated incident that latter ties into something bigger and because of that, if you can suspend your disbelief to how batshit insane it gets, but Juushinki Pandora still has some validity thanks to it's solid development of it's characters and world building, another words, there a certain method to the madness. BUT as much as most of it's plot twists does makes sense, one does not for LA and that lies in Doug's plotline especially near the finale, LA won't spoil but thanks for the elongating his plotline a bit too long that just reinforces almost blunt-force like of his backstory, but that was just LA. The only other flaw is the overuse of running gags, yes it's for ""character"", but for annoyance, not really, this is especially the case with Glenn and his ""I'm not delinquent, It's CAPTAIN"" schtick, yes Chloe has something similar but Glenn has this almost every appearance he gets. 
 
The ending takes the logical conclusion of Leon's major villain into focus and yes the buildup to all of it and the villain ""had it all according to plan"" was something of a double edged sword but it was still decently concluded to say the least, cliche with the entire ""nakama""...or in this case ""family"" surpasses the darkness but LA will give it leeway as it concluded ""decently""...ALMOST half-assed. 
 
Juushinki Pandora...was ""decent"", yes as much as it gets REALLY crazy, the anime does have a solid ground what wiht it's solid characters and world building, good to almost great animation and a great voice cast. yes the anime does go bonkers crazy but even then, with the foundation it gave itself and with the 26 episode length, the anime planned itself quite well to the point the craziness and plot twists becomes a given. Yeah, it's an Evangelion/Attack on Titan clone but Shoji Kawamori put in enough effort with it's characters and world building in which LA can really forgive it's much more crazier elements. Schrödinger's Cat and Pandora's Box.....it's either a evolving cat or a dead one 
 
Shoji Kawamori....Juushinki Pandora is an evolving cat...a decently evolved cat.

          
 
       Helpful I'm a bit of an oddity when it comes to watching anime. I judge a show based on how well it immerses me into it's world and how deep the story is. When I watched this, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story was fairly deep and wasn't very predictable like other animes I've watched. The art style was interesting and well executed, with the 'quantum' effects really hitting right how it should. The sound, while not particularly special, was used to further emphasize the emotional impact of scenes and the mystery of the quantum realms. The characters were a little typecast at times, but despite their personalities being a bit trope-y, it never felt forced. 
 
The main thing is that this is a slow-burner story, not some long adrenaline high like most mecha animes. Theres more time spent on creating the world and telling the story than mech-versus-kaiju fights, which makes the fights hit a little bit harder. It's pacing is slow and methodical, but that isn't a bad thing. 
 
If you go into this expecting action and excitement in excess, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into this with a goal to experience a story  deeper than ""we have mechs and there are monsters to kill"", you might find yourself enjoying this a lot more. 
 
Going a little deeper, the lore explaining the quantum mechanical 'magic' that goes on in this story resonates surprisingly well with actual quantum theory, although handwaved a fair bit to make it more digestable for the common audience. 
 
The only real complaint I have is the way they ended the story; it was a bit abrupt and felt like it was forced into a direction different than the story was heading up to that point. It still closed everything up nice and neat, but it felt a little bit like a deus ex machina. The ending dinged my score of the story a little bit, I would have scored it an 8 for story otherwise. 
 
If you like an intellectual story that forces you to think a little bit instead of vegetating on the couch (or wherever you watch anime), then you would probably like this.

       Helpful El Hazard The Magnificent World is a seven episode OVA series released from mid-1995 to early-1996. It is also one of the first anime in the now exceedingly popular isekai genre. For the uninitiated the term isekai refers to a sub-genre of fantasy anime in which the protagonist or protagonists are originally from present day Earth, but get pulled into another world that is generally better than ours. It is one of the premier escapist fantasies that dominate today's anime landscape and as such they tend to put a spotlight on all the ways the new world is better than ours and don't focus too much on the main character, leaving him a blank canvas onto which the viewer can project. 
And with that opening paragraph I've explained El Hazard The Magnificent World pretty well. The anime doesn't break any new ground today because of how very basic it is for an isekai. Now it wouldn't be quite fair to be hard on the anime because of this, after all, back when it was new the market wasn't flooded with all sorts of other anime, manga and light novels like it. So keeping in mind the time period in which it was released does the anime hold up today, and is it still worth watching? Well, the archivist in me says yes because this anime has undoubtedly influenced many that came after, but that is not a satisfying answer since many might not care about remembering the past. Here's the long answer: 
 
To start off, the plot of El Hazard is, as mentioned before, extremely basic. A group of students and a teacher get sent into another world called El-Hazard by a sexy anime lady that looks a bit like Griffith from Berserk. There our protagonists get mixed up in a fight between the friendly alliance and the menacing human sized bugs called the Bugrom. To help them in their fight every one of the earthlings gets some sort of superpower. 
Immediately I noticed that the anime was intent on flip-flopping between almost stone-faced seriousness into goofy comedy. This mix can be made to work if done right, but El Hazard sadly does not do it right at all. Each time a comedy segment interrupts a more serious bit and vice-versa you get some whiplash from the sudden and sometimes downright weird change in tone. Luckily the middle part of the anime is mostly comedy-centered so there's not a lot of flip-flopping there. There is, however, a certain charm to this inneptitude to properly keep the tone, it's mostly a harmless blunder that makes it feel distinctly like a 90s OVA that was made on a budget. Speaking of feeling like a 90s anime, the studio behind El Hazard is the same studio behind Tenchi Muyo Ryououki and it definitely feels like it. Besides the fake harem that builds up around the main character, the character designs are extremely reminiscent of Tenchi Muyo. 
Now, why did I say fake harem? Because, you see, this anime not only predates isekai but it also predates most harem shows and the tropes that formed around them in the early 2000s. The girls around our main character Makoto are not all interested in him they're there because of happenstance and don't all instantly want a piece of him. 
 
I suppose this is as good a time as any to talk about the characters in our story for a bit. As mentioned above you have the main character Makoto who is your average slightly wimpy high school kid that we're supposed to project ourselves onto. A problem with the characters in this show, I feel, is that they don't show any form of progression as the show goes on. And it is most evident perhaps with Makoto who despite all he's been through in the end is basically the same. 
Along with Makoto a few of his classmates and a teacher were transported into El Hazard. His school crush Nanami and his teacher Fujisawa are ever present in his adventures through El Hazard, but despite them being useful in the plot they don't feel like real characters. Their superpowers are always used as a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card. They feel more like caricatures that exist to either serve the plot or more often than not deliver some comedic moment. Even the main villain of the series, Makoto's self-declared rival from high school, Jinnai feels like he's just a few evil laughs away from growing a moustache for the sole purpose of twirling it while pulling off some relatively well thought out plan only to be foiled by the heroes again and again. 
Though to give credit where credit is due, the anime does manage to humanise the Bugrom through the various interactions Jinnai has with them. Towards the end of the series you may even remember some of their names, even though they looks mostly the same, and you get a small sense that each one of them is an individual. Whether this surprising humanisation of what would be in most other anime just a faceless and nameless monster army was fully intentional or not, I don't know but I do know that I enjoyed it. 
 
I've mentioned above that the party winds up in the titular world El Hazard and I think that the world the anime builds is it's strong suit. Through gorgeous background art and beautifully designed environments El Hazard is made out to be a sort-of paradise world that, unlike many more generic looking isekai world, I genuinely would like to visit. Everything in the world has this middle-eastern vibe while also incorporating copious amounts of green into the designs. Most of the buildings in the world seem to be built by man with a lot of aid from nature. From fountains and indoor ponds that add beautiful splashes of blue in buildings made mostly from yellow and cream colours in conjunction with vibrant greens, to the bright blue sky and the enourmous plants and vines that some outdoor areas have the world looks stunning all around. Then there's places like the Bugrom HQ which has a distinctly insect-like precise design that could only be achieved through by a race with perfect cooperation. Here you don't see anything natural inside or outside the buildings, everything being replaced by precise angles, hexagonal designs and dark colours. It's a great contrast to the 'good' side of the world and an equal delight to witness. I think that the main reason anyone would want to watch the show is because of the world that is being built. Oh and if what I've said so far has not impressed you, El Hazard is no slouch when it comes to exciting fauna either because this world has LIVING ARMOUR CATS. Yes you heard me, the world has cats which can become living armour for someone. And they also talk. LIVING ARMOUR CATS. I still can't get over it, if you haven't noticed. 
 
I can't quite give the same praise to the story of El Hazard The Magnificent World as I did to the world. As mentioned before, the story is quite tone deaf and doesn't know when to jest and when to be serious. Furthermore, there are some slight pacing issues here and there, which I think would be mostly due to the seven episode format since they needed to cram as much in there as possible, nevermind the fact that both the first and final episodes are double length. The characters occasionally go from location to location based on very loose reasoning just to move the plot forward. There also is never any sense of danger towards any of the main cast, all throught the story you know that none of them are going to come to any serious harm. The plot armour here is quite obvious and the anime makes no effort to hide it. But maybe I can give it some slack considering the genre and the fact that the entire anime is basically a power fantasy and as a power fantasy the anime is decent. 
There is a small romantic subplot in the latter part of the anime, but it doesn't really mean much in the end. It affects nothing and the 'winner' is spoiled by the very beginning of the anime anyway. The only reason I could think of why it's even there is because having multiple girls fighting over you is one of the things that every high school boy dreams of. Oh and there's also an even less inefectual lesbian romance subplot in the anime that goes nowhere at all and just brings into the anime a character which many might find irritating based on voice alone, to speak nothing of personality. 
 
All in all, I somewhat liked El Hazard. I didn't have the greatest expectations going in and came out relatively pleased. The anime didn't ever really bore me, but neither did it do anything too grand. 
So back to my original question: 'Does the anime still hold up today and is it worth watching?' 
When compared to some of the isekai anime that are released today it seems very basic, but it has something that those anime don't: a certain charm and a feeling that it was made for more than to just be another isekai anime that will hopefully sell. Maybe I am giving the studio too much credit, but I do feel like they liked working on this project and tried making it the best it could be. Now, that 'best' isn't really all that fascinating but that isn't such a big issue. I would say you should watch this anime if you're in the mood for a different kind of fantasy world, or just want to go back in time to one of the original isekai that started it all or if you like Tenchi Muyo Ryououki then you'll probably like this too. I personally enjoyed my short time with El Hazard and am glad I gave it a chance and I'm looking forward to eventually taking a look at the sequel OVA.

          
 
       Helpful El Hazard is an anime franchise from the mid 90s. It was written by Tsukimura Ryoe with production by AIC. You may remember them from their work on OreImo, Solty Rei, Blue Gender, Sasameki Koto and several others I've reviewed. The first entry in the El Hazard franchise was Magnificent World, a seven episode OVA which gained enough popularity to spawn two tv anime series, and more OVAs. So, was this OVA actually good enough to warrant that? Let's take a look at El Hazard The Magnificent World and find out. 
 
Story: 
 
We begin our story with high school politics. Because don't all great fantasy tales begin with high school politics? Any way, student council President, Jinnai Katsuhiko is accused of using underhanded tactics, like promising clubs more funding, to attain his position. Around here, we'd just call that a campaign promise. The chief witness against him is Mizuhara Makoto. Rather than, say, call Makoto a liar, Jinnai develops the brilliant strategy of taking him hostage so that he can't testify. Surely, nothing could go wrong with that plan. Just when Makoto finds himself cornered, everything freezes. Makoto tries to rouse Jinnai, with no success and makes his way to the recently discovered ruins in the school's basement. A silver-haired beauty emerges, seemingly recognises Makoto and uses a magic technique to send him, as well as everyone else on the school premises that night, to the world of El Hazard. Once there, Makoto and his friends become entangled in a conflict raging betwixt an alliance of humans and the bugrom. A conflict which some third party seems to be manipulating. 
 
Let's look at the flaws of the narrative first. The big one has to do with the powers that our major characters develop as a consequence of crossing dimensions. For most of them, their introduction comes as a matter of plot convenience, showing up exactly when they're needed. In the case of the teacher, the rules establishing the strength of his power are added to near the end of the series, right when the characters are in a corner. Honestly, the series could have benefited from adding some hints to Makoto's power earlier and fleshing out the rules for Fujisawa's before the climax. Although I will credit it for having both Makoto's and Nanami's abilities revealed, though at strangely convenient times, before their major climactic uses. 
 
On the positive side, the narrative is really compelling with some strong sources of tension. The idea of modern day people being sent to a fantasy world was nothing new when this came out, but the world is well enough developed and different enough to keep it interesting. Actually, I really like the way that technology and magic get blended in this world. The plot elements are brought together really well for the climax and the story has a solid progression. I also like that the antagonistic groups are given actual motivation behind what they're doing. The comedic elements generally work quite well, albeit being distracting at times, such as when the great Demon Goddess has to be powered by the turning of a crank as though she were a wind up soldier, during a largely dramatic moment. 
 
Characters: 
 
This is one of those series where there are a lot of strong, compelling side characters but the protagonist, Makoto, is completely bland. This kid is pretty much the quintessential pure, in over his head and well intentioned, type of protagonist. Princess Fatora only gets a few lines of dialogue but she still manages to be more interesting than this bloke. That being said, there are quite a few compelling side characters. The priestesses, Nanami, Alielle, Ifurita, Fujisawa even Jinnai has some compelling characteristics. 
 
As I mentioned, I like the antagonists in this. I like that Jinnai actually seems to care about the bugrom, even naming several of them, and that his alliance with them is shown as mutually beneficial instead of one of them using the other. The phantom tribe's motivation, once revealed, is actually really strong. Then we have Ifurita and her really good arc. I also do love Alielle and how completely shameless she is when it comes to pursuing other women. She's a delight. I also do appreciate that the women she pursues react differently to her attention based on their personalities. Shayla Shayla gets annoyed. Nanami finds it odd that she's pursuing both of them but also seems completely not bothered by it. 
 
Now, let's talk about the romance element. This one is a bit mixed. The dynamic with Ifurita and Makoto actually works really well, in spite of him being blander than soggy cardboard. It makes a lot of sense for her character and actually has some really strong scenes. In contrast, the dynamic with Miz & Fujisawa seems really forced. They meet and she instantly starts planning their wedding while he just kind of goes along with it because... Bandora sacrifices the souls of children. Seriously, Fellows, if someone starts offhandedly talking about marrying you when you've known them for all of an hour, scarper. The love triangle they establish with Shayla Shayla and Nanami both being interested in Makoto is just pointless and takes time away from better things they could be doing. I have no idea why they even bothered with it. 
 
Art: 
 
The visuals in this are actually really impressive. Even by modern standards they hold up really well. The background details are strong. The El Hazard technology is really superb looking. The character designs are nicely unique, mostly. Interestingly enough, the bugrom are more varied and intimidating than the roaches from Terraformars. 
 
That being said, there are some things that could have been better. There are a few visual effects that get recycled and the series does delve into fan-service for no real reason a couple of times. Although, to its credit, it is largely subdued about that. I've certainly seen much worse. It's also a bit strange that Diva looks so humanoid and none of the other bugrom do. I'm sure it has nothing to do with AIC wanting to make her attractive. 
 
Sound: 
 
This series did get some strong actors. Amano Yuri does really well. Sakurai Tomo, Soumi Yoko, Natsuki Rio & Kozakura Etsuko all do really well. Ootomo Ryuuzaburou gives a really interesting performance as Galus. The biggest issue is that there are some exaggerated lines, particularly from Okiayu Ryotaro. Iwanaga Tetsuya's performance is a bit bland but so is his character. So, fair enough. The music is quite good. Nagaoka Seikou knows how to score a fantasy piece to have scale. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
The big source of les-yay in this is Fatora's lover, and generally flirtatious Alielle. I swear, she flirts or gets really touchy with half the ladies in this cast. Shayla Shayla and Nanami get the bulk of it, but Afura gets a bit of love too. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
So, when all is said and done, how well does Magnificent World hold up? Well, the story is interesting and it has mostly strong characters. The art is really good. The acting and music are both strong. So, I'd say it holds up fairly well. However, it does have its issues. The fan-service scenes, the boringness of the main protagonist, the abilities that first manifest at times of dramatic convenience. It's by no means a great OVA. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. It's a solid series. If you're interested in fantasy works, consider giving it a go. Next week I'm looking at a more recent fantasy work with Rokka no Yuusha.

13,917,93,6.889478032121367,story with the main character transported to another world,Riding Bean,"Bean Bandit and his partner Rally Vincent are couriers for hire - transporting clients and delivering goods in his custom sports car ""Roadbuster"" for a hefty price. But when they are hired to escort a kidnapped girl named Chelsea to her home, they don't realize they're being framed for kidnapping as their former clients Semmerling and Carrie plan their escape with Chelsea's father and the ransom money.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Cars', 'Police', 'Seinen']","The anime follows one day in the life of Bean Bandit and Rally Vincent, as they find that they have been framed for the kidnapping of Chelsea Grimwood, the daughter of Mr. Grimwood, President of the Grimwood Company/Grimwood Conglomerate. However, it is Semmerling, by way of various disguises, tricks, and manipulations, who is the real kidnapper — and the real target is Mr. Grimwood himself.
While the police are in hot pursuit of Bean and Rally, along with Chelsea in tow, Semmerling and her helper Carrie plan to make a secret getaway with Mr. Grimwood as hostage.
","What I initially thought would be an Ender’s Game porno turned out to be a ridiculous eighties action story with healthy doses of blood, cars, and pedophilia to appeal to every possible demographic. Riding Bean was the precursor to my last review, Gunsmith Cats, and even contains Rally Vincent as a secondary character. But unlike Gunsmith Cats, Riding Bean kind of sucks. 
 
In what I assume is Chicago, Bean is a courier who, along with his partner Rally, get framed for kidnapping a young girl while the actual kidnappers take her father hostage and steal the ransom money. In a fit of testosterone laden action, Bean takes out his anger on the actual kidnappers, a woman and an eleven year old girl. 
 
What’s instantly noticeable is the violence is a lot more graphic than Gunsmith Cats, somewhat pointlessly too. We’re given to believe that this is going to be a show focusing on shoot-outs but by the end of the forty-five minute episode, Bean is basically using sheer strength to lift cars and wears bulletproof everything to keep him invincible. As usual, the godliness of the main character means the action has no drama to it and instead comes across as silly. So the earlier, realistic violence is cast aside for the cartoonishness of Superman. 
 
But it’s not just the action that’s silly. The music is pure eighties cheese, the kind of background noise you’d expect in Commando. Then there’s the dialogue, which is pretty awful, and the voice acting, which is bad too. 
 
A moment of terrible dialogue comes with the maid service from the loli who gives the kidnapped father a hamburger and asks if he takes mustard with it. American maids are cool! But then she decides to suck his dick which he doesn’t take too kindly to. He slaps her away and she takes a knife threatening to cut his dick off. To which he responds that a little girl shouldn’t do that! If the anime had just been this forty-five second scene, it would have been a perfect ten for giving me a good laugh. 
 
Bean himself is like a Schwarzenegger character. He’s ultra-strong, can’t be defeated, and has the speech capacity of Austria’s favorite son. As for Rally, she’s not at all like her counterpart in Gunsmith Cats and suffers from being too one-dimensional.The bad guys and other characters are not even slightly memorable. 
 
What this adds up to is an unintentionally funny show that’s God-awful in nearly every regard aside from the animation. Riding Bean is stupid, underwhelming, and you won’t benefit from a viewing.

          
 
       Helpful As a person outside of having to review the show, this show is pretty awesome for vintage anime and I truly injoyed it. As a reviewer… I have to nit pick. The problem with that is that the story is really very good and I believe it has the workings of becoming a whole series is the Manga-ka Kenichi Sonoda had not had a falling out with the studio. After the OVA was created, Kenichi created the manga and the manga ‘Gunsmith Cats’ where Rally Vincent was the star though her design was altered.  
 
Anyway, going back to the story, it’s pretty awesome in how it shows the action scenes and everything. It feels like an American made movie more then just an anime with how many guns and vilence is in the show. It starts out with Bean being the get away driver for a bunch of thieves and then ends him being the hero of the show. It’s not making him an anti hero and has him as a regular guy getting money. He actually is rather strong, almost like Superman strong as he had picked up the front end of a car and also rammed his fingers into the metal door of the car to rip the door right off its hinges. Rally on the other hand doesn’t really do much in the show although she is a quick shot. The only thing I really noticed her doing when she didn’t have a gun in her hand was tell Bean to keep cool or try and take care of the little girl.  
 
Going onto the cops side, the cops are damn idiots and Detective Percy should be placed into a mental hospital. Seriously, Percy is infatuated with trying to catch Bean at all cost and goes crazy when he thinks he can. He is the definition of a bumbling detective who gets into a hell of a lot of trouble but I guess I have to give him being smart enough to actually not get fired from his job. The cops don’t help the matter, always crashing into things or sounding like complete idiots or children as in the the small chant they do close to the end of ‘Bean, come out and play’ thing. And yet, in that all that’s said and done, it seemed to sort of fit to me. 
 
The animation becomes really sloppy at some points, using many speedlines and odd movements that feel a bit stiff. The times that it doesn’t have these problems though, they are ether still shots or some very detailed action scenes. The eating habits are rather laughable though. It’s very exaggerated as though the animators had no clue how to show them eating so they slowed them down and made rather huge mouths. It becomes almost discusting at how they did it. Bean was designed rather interestingly with a little to large of canines making him look rather beastly. 
 
The English voices are laughable at most, feeling mostly stale at the most intence times. It’s as though they were reading a script rather then playing the part. The words really don’t feel like they fit the mouth movements and sometimes the characters move their mouths when no one is talking. The only one that seems alright is Percy and he shouts almost every other sentence. The little children also seem to shout as though they can’t be heard any other way. Dispite that, the people that were picked to play the parts were actually what I would see for the type of voices coming from the characters. If they acted a bit more then shouted, it would have been even better.  
 
I think everyone should at least watch this one once. Even with the flaws, the show is rather action pact and won’t leave you bored. Because of the flaws, the times that it does go into a slow pace, they feel a bit comedic and the script can be rather tounge and cheek at points. 


          
 
       Helpful Riding Bean is one of Kenichi Sonoda's early works, and though it was originally planned as a series, only one episode was ever released. 
 
The anime follows the exploits of the legendary courier &quot;Bean Bandit&quot; (a truly unfortunate moniker), and his partner Irene Vincent. They are framed for the kidnapping of a wealthy heiress, and are subsequently hunted by the police and various other parties. 
 
The art and animation of Riding Bean is quite typical of it's time, and bears a resemblance in places to the style of Lupin and Giant Robo. Riding Bean does however have something that sets it aside - the chases. Very few animes are able to convey the feeling of a high speed pursuit, and Riding Bean is amongst the best. 
 
The sound is of a very good quality, and all the gearheads (a.k.a. car fanatics) out there will love the roar of the engines in the anime. 
 
Riding Bean has some memorable characters, and ironically enough, the most memorable is not Bean Bandit. It is in fact, the cars. The Bean Bandit drives a customised sports car called &quot;The Roadbuster&quot;, and if you're like me (in other words, you like cars and racing), then you'll understand me when I say I WANT THAT CAR! If you watch the show, you'll understand why. I watched the showed at the young and impressionable age of 14, and The Roadbuster has been flitting around in my head ever since.  
 
On the flip side, the police also have a car with which to hunt Bean Bandit - the Shelby Cobra GT500 **drools** 
 
One other thing that needs mentioning is the character of Irene Vincent. I hope the name sounds familiar because Kenichi Sonoda later evolved her character into the famous Rally Vincent from Gunsmith Cats.  
 
This is an enjoyable romp through the streets of Chicago, and the chases are truly memorable. If you're a fan of classic anime, or better yet, a fan of Gunsmith Cats, then this is a must watch. If you like action and adrenalin, then Riding Bean is well worth viewing. 
 
If you're after romantic comedies, slice of life, etc, then this may not be to your tastes, but it never hurts to give it a try :) 
 
Riding Bean is effectively a prequel (and dare I say - a pilot), of the legendary Gunsmith Cats, but it is just as enjoyable as GC. The chemistry between Bean Bandit and Irene Vincent is marvellous, and Inspector Percy is a hoot. 
 
I found Riding Bean to be fast paced and highly enjoyable. The mixture of action and comedy is just about right for me, and I've rarely seen chases that match the ones in this show.

 So, we have 13 episodes, each one has a total diferent story from the others, and this is the first point that i analyze. You ´ll never get bored from the stories, as a said, they are all diferent, and the stories are all about situations, that we live with it every day, or some special ocasion. Even once, when you see the anime, you think, that you saw, or lived that situation one time, or more.

Yeah, 3D as it is but the character's movements weren't fluid at all, they moved too slow and you could tell the missing frames.  
Backgrounds looked very well and deserve some credit, characters looked good too with the positions being a little more realistic than expected. 
 
Characters: 
They we're cute. Yet couldn't take the opportunities and be a little clever or deductive. Also, the MC in the OP looked like Arararagi. This anime doesn't have originality at all, just balls. Eh, the least I can say is that the characters are, somehow, honest. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Music was really good, art didn't look bad at all and characters we're honest, with a somewhat interesting and empty story, but I can't ask much for a total of 25 minutes in a show, can I?

the STORY isn't well formed yet but we know there's 2 worlds: a Normal Japan, and a strange high-tech futuristic one. in the High Tech Japan a guy is executed and (I'm guessing here) members of a cell discover something. cut to a funeral procession in Normal Japan and a boy is left all alone because his father just died. a man offers to let the boy live with him. some mourners leaving the funeral home tell the audience that his entire family is now dead. cut to his school and there's a cute girl, his cousin, who's trying to be friendly with him. his classmates don't understand him at all. later on a guy saves the boy from an attack. the episode ends there.  
 
ART, yes there is a GREAT DEAL of CGI in this episode! but there also is some normal cel animation. everything looks great and blends perfectly!  
 
SOUND, pretty good! I'm not all up on J-pop/Electronica but the music's pretty cool. the other effects and actors are good too.  
 
CHARACTER, not much just yet. but what's there is INTERESTING!  
 
I could only rate 1 part of the episode lower than perfect and that's the characters. the story grabbed my attention, but a single 16 minute episode is not enough to tell a greatly detailed story. I really REALLY like this and I hope it comes out with more episodes soon!

","I&rsquo;ll admit I was quite biased when I heard that Sunrise was going to make yet another mecha anime.  One day I said &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; and watched the first episode afterwards I knew this was something quite different than your usual mecha fare.  One of the major things that struck me was the OP (disguised as the ED in the first ep), &ldquo;Kimi e Mukau Hikari&rdquo; sung by Akino Arai.  This was not a fast paced song with intense mecha action in the background.  Instead the OP featured a slow, beautifully sung ballad predominantly featuring the characters of the series, not the giant robots.  This really sets the tone for the entire series. 
 
Many people say that the beginning of Zegapain starts off very slow and doesn&rsquo;t really start till a few episodes in.  However, for me I was quite intrigued by the many subtle hints found in the first few eps.  What is Shizuno&rsquo;s relationship with Kyo?  What was the deal with that scene?  What is really going on?  The story effectively builds upon itself and builds several layers of complexity.  Each episode flowed quite well with each other, thus making many cliffhangers.  Although, if I had to complain about the pacing it does somewhat falter a little in the midteens.  In addition, the story features several classic philosophical ideal from Descartes to Berkeley (?).  However, unlike other anime titles Zegapain doesn&rsquo;t bog the viewer down with its ideas.   
 
Animation-wise there really isn&rsquo;t anything to complain about, it seems Sunrise put a decent about of money into producing this anime.  CG for the fight scenes at least in the beginning was kind of weak however, they managed to fix that mid series.   
 
In terms of sound, I really like the OST and it really accents many of scenes while not being too forward and in your face.  However, it&rsquo;s the OP and EDs which really stick out for me and are constantly appearing in my playlist.     
 
In general there is an overarching sense of sadness throughout the series and quite a bit of drama.  However, not so much as to make the viewer go numb.  Do not watch Zegapain for the action, watch it for the story and characters.  While the action scenes are nicely done there are far better shows out there if that&rsquo;s what you are looking for.   


          
 
       Helpful Zegapain is a strange show to watch and a stranger one to recommend. The delicate opening ballad, the goofy mecha action, the character designs which are not only derivative but swing between plain and tacky, the disappointing backgrounds which are especially frustrating in a show which frequently attempts to set mood and even communicate information via landscapes and the weather, the generic bits of fanservice amid truly compelling dramatic scenes... To be perfectly honest, it's a bit of a mess. Luckily, said mess is greater than the sum of its parts, and it has something that a lot of prettier, sleeker shows don't: a story strong enough to draw you in, and if you have any interest at all in concepts such as artificial intelligence, transhumanism, and the ghost in the machine, to make you stick around till the end. 
 
There's not a lot that can be said about Zegapain without spoilers. There's a necessary big reveal very early on, though it's possible to work out the basic premise for yourself even earlier. Things are never quite what they seem, though. The world the characters inhabit is as elusive as their memories and impressions of it.  
 
While none of the characters stand out as particularly original or interesting on their own –  the hotheaded boy who's just sensitive enough to feel bad about his insensitivity towards others, the mysterious older girl, the adorable childhood friend, the student council president (whose glasses might just strike you as a hilarious choice at some point); we've seen them all before – it would be unfair to dismiss them as lazy writing when a major goal of the story is to explore how malleable yet resilient these seemingly “simple” personalities are.  
 
Our personalities are by no means static; they are constantly changing, shaped by our experiences. Two people might come together under a specific set of circumstances, but not under others. Zegapain not only recognizes this, but uses it to its advantage to spin an intriguing psychological/philosophical/romantic tale within a solid sci-fi/action one.

          
 
       Helpful An anime filled with a mysterious feel to it and a neverending feeling of sadness. Those are the words i use when thinking about this anime and why is that well now i will tell.  
 
So why do i feel that a sadness filled anime is great well because of it more of less i feel like it. The story is well made in my opinion getting a step away from much of the mainstream but also introducing a new consept to the entire anime world. What is real what is fake what are we might be something even those who watch this anime think about as they start delving into the story and if thats so then its great. The opening and ending to the anime is also something i dont think i can get enough of due to how it captures much of the anime in it. Well it should i guess considering all but the music just couldnt get much better in it. I do love the characters in a way since they bring out what it is about this anime that makes it so nice to watch. They give you the feel for it in every way. Also having a mc who has a selfish side on the almost negative way is also one point i like considering he shows a certain originality in some ways that i feel sorely lack in some anime.  
 
Since this is a personal opinion overall i will say that if i had something to dislike then it would be that it somtimes tend to be a little overly dramatic in dialoges and show but that would be the only thing. And the reason i dont give it a 10 is because there isnt that feel to it that this can be given a grade that high.  
 
But i will say this at the end that if your looking for something different and which might give you a slight mind and heart ache then this is deffinetly an anime worth watching. You might expect what will happen or you might not watch it and find out.

Arashi wo Yobu Den-O vs. Shin-O 60-bu Special!!,"A sixty minute special of the Crayon Shin-chan anime featuring a crossover between Shin-chan and the live action tokusatsu series Kamen Rider Den-O, as well as three normal summer-themed episodes. The Den-O characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters.  
 
Another thing of note, inbetween commercial breaks, clips of a live action Shin-Chan onboard the Den-Liner or with characters from the Kamen Rider Den-O Series were shown. In most of these scenes it involves the Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel uncomfortable. ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Seinen']","When Misae is trying to get Shin-chan ready for the bus on time, he suddenly has to go to the toilet. As Misae pleads to him to hold it in until he gets to school, Shin-chan manages to get inside, but instead of the toilet he finds himself on the DenLiner and on Ryotaro's face. He quickly becomes smitten with Hana and Naomi, much to their chagrin, while everyone tries to figure out why Shin-chan has managed to get on the DenLiner. Back in the Nohara house, Misae bangs on the door as the Fatmass Imagin tries to grant Misae's wish, which is to get Shin-chan to the bus on time.
Back on the DenLiner, Hana realizes that it must be due to an Imagin, which Shin-chan mispronounces as ""Himajin"" (ヒマジン, ""Bored Person""), including calling Momotaros a red Buriburizaemon, who Momotaros identifies (and summons) as the legendary Imagin. When Ryotaro transforms into Kamen Rider Den-O Sword Form so they can defeat the evil Imagin that has appeared, Shin-chan jumps up and manages to transform with him into Kamen Rider Shin-O. When the door opens on Misae, she is insulted by Momotaros just as the Fatmass Imagin attacks the group. Den-O takes a beating until Shin-O glues the Fatmass Imagin's three fat masses together, leading the Imagin to want to go back in time to erase any day Shin-chan was on time, only to find none exist.
Den-O destroys the Fatmass Imagin, saving Shin-chan and Misae who leave just in time to find that the bus has left without them. The Owner, impressed by how Shin-chan has helped them protect the flow of time, allows Misae and Shin-chan to go back in time to just before the bus arrived. Bidding farewell to their new friends, Shin-chan realizes he still has to use the toilet, but while fighting with Misae to get to the toilet, soils himself just as the bus rolls up.

       Helpful I use the following system to calculate the final score: 
In each of the five categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character(s), Enjoyment), a score can get 2, 4, 8 or 10. 2 for something I find truly bad, 4 for something that just isn't good enough, 8 for fairly good and 10 for outstanding. 
 
The sum of the score is divided by 5 and the score is rounded to the nearest integer (More than or equal to .5 rounds it up, less than .5 rounds it down). 
 
STORY (2): 
The story is very simple and very bad. A kid running around yelling about his mom being constipated? Yeah, great fun. I may be a bitter and old, but I remember childrens shows being better than this. 
 
ART (2): 
Crayon Shin-chan's typical style. As dreadful as always. Truly, this is an insult to many other childrens shows. Even though kids don't care that much about this particular area, can't they at least try to do something good? Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it. 
 
SOUND (8): 
Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music. They do it all just fine. 
 
CHARACTERS (4): 
Would've been a 2 if it hadn't been for the Den-O cast. Shin-chan is intolerable and annoying. 
 
ENJOYMENT (2): 
Not so strange, seeing how I'm a TAD too old to be watching this in the first place. Not that I'd show this to my nephews. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 
18 * 0.2 = 3.6, rounded up to 4. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
I'm aware this is childrens show. I show my nephews (of mixed ages, the youngest one is 3 at the time of writing, the eldest is 7) various shows at times, this is not something I'd bother showing them. But if they enjoy either Crayon Shin-Chan or Den-O before this, sure, show them.

13,12611,99,6.765290292080819,story with the main character transported to another world,Sengoku Collection,"Sengoku Collection revolves around many samurai who are accidentally removed from a parallel universe inhabited by well-known historic characters. Unlike the historical war period known to us, all inhabitants in this unique world look like high school girls. Coming from the medieval era and finding themselves totally amazed by everything they encounter in modern day Tokyo, the girls become best friends through their adventures.  
 
(Source: Crunchyroll) ","['Fantasy', 'Parody', 'Samurai']","GameThe story is set in the tumultuous Sengoku Era of historical Japan, when military masters circle the figurative throne of Japan's first shogunate. In the game, ""God of War Cards"" have been sealed in six hidden treasures, and fighting breaks out among those who seek the treasures. As a new military master, the player embarks on a journey to obtain the treasures by clearing quests and fighting bosses.

AnimeIn a different timeline, female versions of generals from the Sengoku period vie for power. One day, a mysterious light sends Oda Nobunaga and several other generals to the modern day world. As each of the generals adapts to this new lifestyle, Nobunaga goes on a quest to seek out the other generals and retrieve their secret treasures in order to return home.
","Sengoku Collection is a series of mostly unrelated short stories about samurai from another world wreaking havoc in this one. They do this not by fighting, but by being extremely eccentric. 
Each episode focuses on one character who is usually not seen again after that, but they are all complete stories, so this is not really an issue. 
There is an overarching plot, but it's sort of in the background for the most part. 
Sengoku collection is full of yuri, so steer clear if you don't like that. Otherwise, it's a beautiful, if strange show, and I highly recommend it.

          
 
       Helpful If you were expecting a battle showdown with nobunaga getting  legendary powers and destroying all the enemies in a parallel world expect to be disappointed ( like me) 
Story -4 
Ok I expected that to get the treasures to return back to the past Nobunaga would fight and destroy enemies and obtain the treasures and end up fighting some super boss dude who set them up to go to the future. Who knows, I may be right. However from reading the sytopsis and checking the number of main characters(25) I would bet that I am wrong. Basically there is just a bunch of random stories about different girls accepting their positions in the new worlds and nearly no action. 
Art -8 
Ok the characters designs are not my favorite but not bad either. 8 for quite nice 
Character-7 
Switching to a new main character every single episode could get on to some people's nerves. Well I got to 3 and I just assumed it would be like that but I really couldn't care less about the backstories of random girls. 
Enjoyment-5  
I enjoyed the first episode and expected greatness but the next episode was cute but not exactly what I wanted. Then I started the third episode and I couldn't bare to watch anymore. 
Overall-j6 
It really depends on your tastes. If you want to watch 25 different backstories of random girls from the sengoku period- go ahead. It has cute gitls and moderate humor and ecchi. However if you are expecting more of a plot( as I was) expect to be disappointed. I personally cannot stand things without a plot but everyone has their different tastes.

          
 
       Helpful Despite some decent sales and a large number of fan art in pixiv of Sengoku Collection, this little show has gone relatively unnoticed. Practically no advertisement,  unappealing art, and other shows taking the spotlight and it isn't too much of a surprise. That said I'd still like to make a decent review for people who might want to try it out. 
 
The show is overall mediocre. One of the main problems of Sengoku Collection is that it lacks any appealing or interesting plot. Sengoku warlords come to our world; they live their lives, some wish to stay while others want go back to the old world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well. Each episode is centers around a Sengoku-period warlord and each episode deals with said character's problem and how they cope with their new life. The problem is that the episodes are very loosely related to each other nor do they serve much semblance to main story, leaving the viewer with a show that is practically just slice-of-life. And really, some people might be fine with that, but why even attempt a main plot when you choose to not properly work on it? There is a certain nagging feeling once you finish the show that tells you this show could have been much more. 
 
The episodes and characters themselves are problematic as well. Some of the episodes are fantastic, some are mediocre, and some are just plain awful and a chore to go through. The good thing is that you might find a jewel of an episode you love while going through the muck; but you have to go through that said muck. The same can be said of the characters, some of which are horribly written and have so little relevance to their Sengoku image that they might as well not have been a Sengoku expy at all, while others are created with good thought and creativity. 
 
You may notice a number of parodies throughout the show as this was the little gimmick the show tries to play out. Probably something a lot of people will recognize is the Bowling for Columbine parody, one of the fewer funny and good episodes of the series. A lot of the parodies however are Japanese-related media so the average English viewer most likely will not get references. 
 
It probably doesn't need to be said that the animation and art is pretty low-tier. Just look at Kanetsugu Naoe's face and tell me you can actually take that seriously. It's even noticeable that in some episodes the production values and art drastically drop. Expect harsh disappointment for those who need grand visuals to keep you entertained. 
 
The music is fair and good in most regards. Dependent on the episode and parodies the music will have different styles and ensemble, and diversity is always a good thing. If you bother with the character songs that are still being released, they are pretty standard J-pop. 
 
Overall, Sengoku Collection is just average. There are episodes you will love and episodes that will having you sleeping from boredom. With poor visuals it makes it hard for an average viewer to be interested in finishing the whole 26 episodes. It really isn't something I can recommend to someone that doesn't have free time to spend.

Overall all I have left to say is 
-10/10-

          
 
       Helpful Afro-Ken is certainly a weird little OVA; it's not really about anything in particular, and yet still manages to be entertaining. Based on a line of toys by the people who brought you Hello Kitty, Afro-Ken is about a cute dog with an afro and all of his friends, most of whom are also cute dogs with afros. The &quot;story&quot; introduces the different dogs and features silly little elements of their lives... and that's it. It's not really a story at all, but it does what it needs to do: look cute and advertise toys. 
 
And look cute and advertise toys it does. Afro-Ken covers dozens of unique character designs, but features little else in the way of characterization. On that note is the way these characters appear: the entire OVA is done in 3-D, but rather than going for a more realistic look, the animators appropriately chose a simplistic, silly style. While not particularly remarkable, (the movement of the dogs is often choppy) again, it does what it has to. 
 
That's not to say that Afro-Ken is without it's merits. The first lies in the music: the one prominent song (used for both the opening and closing) is fun and extremely catchy, with silly lyrics such as &quot;there is a dog with a big afro / that follows me around wherever I go / my daddy says it don't exist / but I can see it in the sky and even in my rice bowl dish&quot;. You gotta love it. 
 
The other good point of Afro-Ken? It is dang fun. You can't help but crack up at the jokes or &quot;awww&quot; at the cute little dogs with crazy hairstyles and their antics (my personal favorite is probably Afro-Ken swimming across a photo of the Statue of Liberty). As a matter of fact, this is one of the only anime that my three siblings and I all enjoyed, and it left us all wanting Afro-Kens of our own. It's certainly a pointless experience, but it's one of those shows that satisfies your need for the bizarre and the cute all at once, without confusing you or making you feel like you need more. And at one episode of less than thirty minutes, how can you deprive yourself of that?

          
 
       Helpful One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

","Comedy is, usually, a hit or miss genre for many people. Since there are several different styles of comedy, and several different opinions on exactly which style is the most humorous. Comedy in anime, from what I’ve experienced, usually falls into one of three styles: The slapstick style of comedy, where the humor comes from the clumsy and or stupid decisions and actions made by the characters, the more sarcastic and witty style of comedy, where the humor comes from the characters wit and sharp tongues, and will probably feature a decent amount sarcasm, and, finally, the parody style of comedy, which derives its humor from the many references it makes. Usually, those references refer to other anime. Outbreak Company uses the parody style of comedy, a style of comedy that I can’t say I’ve ever been the biggest fan of. Was Outbreak Company’s comedy spot on, or did it just miss the mark? 
 
Story:  
 
The story revolves around the Shinichi Kanou, a hikkikomori (or shut in) and otaku who, after a period of deep reclusion, has decided to get a get job. After acing an online test, and performing well in his follow up interview, Shinichi was offered a job. Right after accepting the job offer, he is drugged and wakes in an unfamiliar room. He discovers that he’s been transported to an alternate dimension, to new world, by the Japanese government. He has been hired as an ambassador to the Holy Eldant Empire, a kingdom in this new world. His mission is to bring otaku culture, anime, manga, etc., to the Holy Eldant Empire in order to strengthen its relationship with Japan. 
 
As mentioned earlier, this story is a parody comedy series, and it makes several references to other anime, manga, and other things in otaku culture. The series also pokes fun of, and pays homage to, several anime tropes. These references are not only funny, but they manage to always keep the series interesting. I not only enjoyed the references that Outbreak Company made in its dialogue, but I also liked the more subtle references, such as posters and figures of some of my favorite characters in the background. 
 
While this is a comedy series, it actually does have a pretty interesting narrative that touches on several different themes. The story addresses issues like racism, classism, and politics, which makes it that much more entertaining to watch. 
 
Unfortunately, the story doesn’t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While there is an “ending” it still leaves some things unsaid, and some questions unanswered. And the last couple of episodes did feel a little rushed, as they tried to kick the story into high gear. 
 
Animation:  
 
Outbreak Company’s animation was really well done, with well-defined characters and good-looking background scenery. There are some scenes, specifically some action scenes, that I would’ve liked to actually see the actions taking place, but they decided to just use a shaky background image instead of actually animating it. While the animation isn’t great, it’s definitely good, quality animation. 
 
Characters: 
 
While Shinichi Kanou is the star of Outbreak Company, the series does feature two other main characters, Myucel Foaran, Shinichi’s maid, Petralka Anne Eldante III, the empress of the Holy Eldant Empire, as well as several other supporting characters. Most of the characters in this series suffer from a lack of a proper background story and development, including our main characters. The amount of information we get about each of the characters varies. While some characters will have a fairly detailed backstory, others’ backstories will be only briefly mentioned and explored, if they are ever mentioned at all. Also, while there are some characters that do develop over the course of the series, others tend to either stay the same, or change very little. 
 
With all of that being said, all of the characters are very likeable and enjoyable to watch. The character’s interactions with one another are also entertaining. The relationships between the characters do have a decent amount of development, and it was entertaining to see how each of the character’s relationships changed over the course of the series. 
 
Sound: 
 
Outbreak Company’s soundtrack (OST) is large and varied. It features several orchestral sounding songs, some that are more epic and grand, and others that are more peaceful. The OST also features songs from other genres, from folk sounding pieces to march. It has a good balance of fast and slower paced songs, as well as a good balance between songs that are more grand and complex, and other songs that were incredibly simple. There are also some songs in the OST that are just, for lack of a better word, quirky, but very catchy at the same time. While watching this series the OST can get buried, and you might not even notice how many songs the OST actually has. This isn’t helped by the fact that there are plenty of songs in the OST that sound very similar to one another. But, all in all, Outbreak Company has a very good OST. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I had a really fun time watching Outbreak Company. Everything from the funny and interesting references, to poking fun at anime tropes, to the very likeable characters made this series entertaining to watch. 
 
Verdict & Breakdown: 
 
Story: 4/5 
 
Animation: 3.9/5 
 
Characters: 3.7/5 
 
Sound: 4.2/5 
 
Enjoyment: 4.1/5

       Helpful Militaristic war can be a deadly thing with the loss of countless lives in the dominance over territory. However there is a kind of warfare that can be even deadlier when used over a period of time but yet doesn't take a single life. Cultural warfare. 
 
The story of Outbreak Company is japan introducing the culture of the ""otaku"" to a new world they found the portal to one day. Their many efforts had failed as the many managers lacked an immerse knowledge of the ""otaku"" way. So the hired a shut in with a life completely dedicated to manga and anime in hopes to reap a large profit from spawning a Japanese entertainment industry to this new, under developed world they've stumbled across. A very straight forward story with the occasional twist that keeps things interesting and never lacking in entertainment. 
 
Styles for scenery and background are astounding with detail that really capture the environment of a medieval style timeline. However for characters and other minor animated objects, the lack of detail with facial expressions when put at any distance, is very disappointing. even the use of cell shading is limited on things. 
 
Sounds for the use of magic are something to be credited for as they are well used and each spell has a very different sound to it. as for background music, its mostly either very faint or blends in to the scene so well you hardly notice it except for lewd/fan service scenes where the music is in your face to the point where the beat of it can ruin the humor value. 
 
Characters are played out and portrayed decent for the most part but as for back stories, not much at all is explained for anyone other than the single main character. Light topics of explanation are occasionally told but only in scattered spots throughout the 13 episodes and nothing really gives you a clear idea of how from there did they get to where they are today. Other than back stories, the play out of each character bar a few, was well thought out as everyone had their deeper purpose and some didn't find theirs until after other sinister ones were revealed. 
 
Enjoyment factor was, on a personal note, quite high for myself as the references to countless other anime and Japanese idols are so high I would almost think it impossible to count them all. It was played out perhaps too quickly in some parts but its the lesser parts are skimmed over as needed. Many times the main character see's himself as an anime's main protagonist due to all his years of being an otaku shut in, and tends to relate a lot of his experiences with moments from his excessive manga database.

I wish more anime series would be like this. This is one of the balanced ones. I mean, not too much sexistic scenes (Ecchi), not too much weird scenes, its showing how it really was in times of king, knights, princesses etc. (Offcourse things like dragons, birds used to be horses werent in medieval times, but that is minor (i think)). One aspect I like about this anime is showing a real otaku culture (half of it), a lot of references to games and other animes. And when i say: a lot of, I really mean a huge amount of refenences (at least two in every episode). One aspect i didnt like about it is, the main point of this anime is revealed like nearly at the end, but I have to say in some ways its original (never saw something like that). Would I recommend it? Yes! Some viewers will like it some viewers will just watch it, say something about characters that are kawaii and go watch another anime. So yeah, watch it if you want... 
 
Part 2. As I mentioned earlier this will take a short look at the story. 
 
So, main character is taken, throught an magical portal, to the magical medieval world where he is tasked to popularize otaku culture, as it looks from outside. But from inside, Japan goverment have something other in their minds, but i dont want to spoil that, only thing I convinced myself to say, as I said in Part 1, is it will be revealed at the end. So our character Shinichi was met with circumstances, in other words, what he have to do. By his side is an maid Myucel (aaah so cute.... i meant KAWAII) what will do everything he want, but she started to be addicted on him, something like she felt in love with him buuuut there will not be any kiss (yes gents, there is no kiss... goddamn!!!). Some scenes are funny, some scenes are something between funny and normal (not too bad actually) and there is not much action sequences. There are a lots of good ideas, like: build a school where Chinichi and others will teach that enthusiastic elves, dwarfs, ware wolfs and humans  of Otaku culture. Soccer between elves and dwarfs etc... There is so much thing that makes this anime so good.                If you made it throught my english to this point... Thanks. But.... there is two goddamn things that wont let Chinichi get laid with girls: 1. That barely teen Majesty Petralka, and, 2. Circumstances...

It gives an abundant harvest on the land when sleeping, but brings a disaster when it is awake. 
In every decade or hundreds of years, the dragon moves its body as if it tosses about unconsciously. The movement becomes the distortion and causes impurity. This “impurity” forms the corrupted being known as Magatsuhi (マガツヒ, Magatsuhi), which lavishes an evil on people.　And now, there is a huge indication of a distortion as Magatsuhi outbreak were now spread across the prefectures of Japan. Gods foresaw the greatest harm would happen to Japan, divide own power and give it off as a messenger of God (御先神, Shinshi) in Japan to gather mediums, or “Magica” who can expel the “impurity” and exorcise Magatsuhi. With the magical weapon the power of Gods, the “Magica” will fight to stop evils in Japan.
","This is a show that more people should appreciate. 
 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen (or as my friend used to call it, 4 minutes of disappointment) is a series of shorts that is currently airing weekly. We called it disappointment because we expected it to be full 24 minute episodes, but it turned out not to be. REGARDLESS, it's turning out to be unexpectedly wonderful. 
 
The show contains arcs of about 3 episodes, each highlighting a new character from a new region of Japan. The entire premise of the show is that each region of Japan has a magical girl protecting it and its traditions. Each arc focuses on the magical girl fighting off a ""magatsuhi"" that invades her territory. They have a very small amount of backstory, a relatively interesting battle scene, and a happy ending where the magatsuhi explodes and food rains from the skies. Sounds like a great day to be in Japan. 
 
No one aspect of the show is fantastic, but altogether, it's very entertaining. The fight scenes are interesting but not overblown. They only have 4 minutes at a time, so they can't draw it out too long. And they don't pull a Dragonball Z and extend them for multiple episodes either. They get to the point and have a good time with it. 
 
The one problem that I have with the show is that they don't really go into the details of the culture of each Japanese prefecture. They make a point of noting which prefecture the story takes place in, but nothing truly stands out to an American audience at least. All of the scenes tend to look similar enough to me that I don't really notice they're in different prefectures. 
 
All in all, though, the show is good and deserves more attention. It only has 4 minute episodes, so it doesn't take much time, and it provides enough enjoyment to justify watching AND MORE.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen is a compilation of stories based within different Prefecture's of Japan. Themes of nationalism are represented throughout the work, and it doesn't try really hard to be anything different. I'll list the arcs and my responses to them below: 
 
1. Miyagi Prefecture // Ep 1-3 : Nothing special and completely forgettable. By the time I was halfway through this work I'd forgotten everything about it other than, like, 2 jokes in it. It's a great start to showing off the animation style. Other than that, the story is nonexistent. It tries to make you care for the lead at one point but fails horribly. 
 
2. Shizouka Prefecture// Ep 4-6 : Better than the previous but still very boring. It's pretty and flashy and cutesy but there isn't anything worthwhile here, and it almost feels like it's intended for kids younger than 13, despite the age rating saying 13+. 
 
3. Tokyo Prefecture // Ep 7-10 : Pretty cool, I must say. I wouldn't have minded if this arc was extended. This is around the time you realize there was actually some lore put into the work, as well as surprisingly depthy characters. However, this depth is barely touched upon and the arc is finished before you know it. 
 
4. Ishikawa Prefecture // Ep 11-14 Perhaps my favorite. This one starts out strong and ends on an equal note. I enjoyed the main lead and the conflict she had to face was more than an unknown enemy that was bad because reasons. If you don't watch anything else from this anime, at least, watch these episodes. I do wish this one was one episode longer, though. Oh well~ 
 
5. Mie Prefecture // Ep 15-17 : Pretty weak. It's like the first two but it has some sense of urgency to it. However, it fails to translate properly and I feel like I wasted my time watching these ones. 
 
6. Kumamoto Prefecture // Ep 18-20 : Not as good as Ishikawa, but definitely my second favorite of these little stories. The story is interesting and there's even some expansion on the very light amount of lore within the world. It is, perhaps, the most nationalistic. 
 
7. Kyoto Metropolitan // Ep 21-25 : Third favorite. Very cool. Has a return character. Starts with an interesting perspective and then slowly returns to the normal Magical Girl fighting emphasis. Still neat. 
 
Episode 26 is a teaser towards a potential second season. 
 
Arc ranking order: 4>6>7>3>5>2>1 
 
 
Art: 
Very Gainax. They animate really well what matters, and don't care very much what doesn't. Motions feel fluid and the combat looks pretty neat. It's definitely eye-popping, and there's a cool sense of modern pop artwork going into this. Also, the costumes are pretty sweet. 
 
That said, can't ignore cheap workarounds when it comes to animation. There are a few repeat animations and the barren backgrounds are pretty boring. 
 
 
Sound: 
I couldn't help but feel like some of the songs were meant to be in a video game. There are references to game mechanics in this anime so that kind of makes sense, but the songs that they would have chosen to use from a game are like, pause menu music. Some songs suffer this, like the transformation theme, but the other songs sound kinda good. Doesn't go above and beyond, but it helps with the setting where it needs to. 
 
 
Character: 
Despite having those 2 really sweet arcs, there's a plethora of boring and uninspiring characters. The majority of them are bad and tropy, and the tropy aspects used are checked off a list one by one. It's a shame. I understand that with such a short amount of screen time there isn't much that can be done, but what takes place is almost an individual character arc for some of them, and there isn't enough time for this to be believable. 
 
The two decent arcs have enough time in them for the characters to have some sort of depth while also not going overboard with their personality. It's probably what made these 2 stand out. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Boring at times, but pretty interesting at others. I was glad that the first 4 arcs had an incline in quality. It's what kept me going. I'm also interested to see where things go if Gainax chooses to continue with their subtle nationalist propaganda. I'd support this campaign if it meant more cool magical girl fights and stuff.

The characters were so well-received that they received their own line of character merchandise starting in June 2016.
","Sanrio Danshi is like Free! if instead of swimming they bonded over commercial corporate mascot characters. It's weird. 
 
It's super weird how there’s SO MUCH commentary on this show is about soft masculinity or something because of how much ANN/etc hates harsh masculine men and not on the weird emotional connection to corporate products that is MADE by that same corporation in order to push MORE emotional attachment.  
 
Listen, I'm not the type to preach to you that capitalism is evil, but a show that's entire purpose is to attach sentimentally to corporate product is weird. And I kind of hate how good the character design, art design and color design is for it. It's great. It's absolutely beautiful to look at. 
 
Man, it's weird seeing a show attach real emotions to straight up corporate products. Attaching positive feelings of your dead grandma to a corporate product. At least when it's The Products Are Characters, you're attaching sentimentality to the product THROUGH character. You like the keychain because you like the character.  
 
This show is just straight 'here's characters who have entire emotional journey and emotional attachment is to Straight Up the product itself.' It's weird. I'm going to KEEP overusing the word weird because I can't find any other way to describe it. 
 
They cement their bond by going to a real world location store and they tell you what it is I think. It's just. Weird. 
 
Episode 7 was an okay ad for Puroland I guess.

          
 
       Helpful If you took a show like ohshc or free!, crammed it into 12 episodes, and sucked everything likable or exciting out of it, you would be left with Sanrio danshi. While nothing is particularly egregious about Sanrio danshi, the lack of passion and cliche dependency is glaringly obvious.  
 
I don't want to say Sanrio danshi is bad just because it's essentially a glorified advertisement.  Pokemon, one of the most beloved anime of all, is basically an ad to sell the games and merchandise. What sets Sanrio danshi apart is not that is an ad - but that it is ONLY an ad. Without sanrio, absolutely nothing sets sanrio danshi apart from any other show ever. It feels like a robot made sanrio danshi, which was able to make a story but not able to give it feeling. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Sanrio Danshi has a simple plot. Boys meet, bond over Sanrio, make a play. Story beats are hit methodically, and of course the old favorites are here: a beach episode AND a school festival. Nothing stands out, and the plot is pretty boring. A pet peeve of mine is when something happens, and we are shown the reaction of every single character, one at a time. Pointless, boring, and annoying filler. 
 
Art: 3 
 
Sanrio danshi's art manages to be repulsively adequate. Character designs are forgettable (besides perhaps Yuu), backgrounds are plain and there is very little detail. Almost all action scenes are replaced with slowly panning still shots. Weirdly, whenever the characters take off their shirts they become hideously muscular and just kind of gross to look at. Fanservice gone wrong, I guess. Some backgrounds look like photographs, which was cool, but this was only for Sanrio backdrops - so instead of being an artistic choice, this was all about the advertising. Ultimately underwhelming. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound is fine. The OP and ED fit the theme, the background music sets the tone well enough, and the voice actors are nice. I was expecting Shunsuke to have a deeper voice, but his voice actor was fine nonetheless. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. 
 
Character: 3 
 
Even calling them 'characters' feels too kind. Nobody in sanrio danshi feels even a little bit real. The MC kouta has No Character Traits besides he likes pompompurin, and uhh..... yeah, that's kind of it. When compared against a main character like, say, haru from free, his blandness becomes even more apparent. The only character I liked was Yuu, but that's just my soft spot for romantic long-haired bishis. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
 
I wanted to like sanrio danshi. I will continue to watch it to the end. But man, it could be so much better. 
 
Overall: 3 
 
Sanrio Danshi is boring and uninspired. While technically adequately drawn with good sound and music, there is no soul to the series. Instead it feels like a paint-by-numbers cash grab. Which it is.  
 
TLDR: Don't watch this show. Go watch cute high earth defense club love instead. Or literally anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Now this is the peak of marketing, using bishounens and gap moe to sell your products, Sanrio sure know what's up. I'm not complaining, well I am, where's Gudetama??

You see, this is nothing but a huge Sanrio ad trying to increase merch and sales. However, I do appreciate the message behind this, it's true that you can love cute things and still be a MAN surprise surprise masculinity is weak. 
 
Can you believe they chose Little Twin Stars who ranked 6th over Gudetama? I'm sorry I can't.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']","
During the Heian Era (794–1185), Abe no Seimei was a close childhood friend of a noble named Masayuki, and his wife, Mune. While he was away from the palace, Masayuki often asked Seimei to stay by his wife's side, guarding her and keeping her company. However, during the time that they spent together, Mune and Seimei fell in love and became increasingly romantically involved. Unbeknownst to them, Masayuki soon learned of the affair, and became overcome with grief and jealousy. One day while Seimei was on a trip to Kyoto, Masayuki snapped, murdered Mune and committed suicide. Guided by a premonition, Seimei rushed back to his hometown only to find out that he was too late. Overcome with guilt, he decided to perform a forbidden onmyō, ritual to resurrect the dead, by transferring himself and the bodies of Masayuki and Mune into a completely different world in which they were still alive. In doing so, Seimei soon found himself as ""Mr. Abe"" in mid-20th-century Osaka, where Mune Imamiya and Masayuki Asahina were pre-existing residents of this alternate world. Now, Masayuki was an ambitious, but largely unsuccessful young man who had enlisted Mr. Abe's assistance to build the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade. He was also madly in love with Mune, a local girl whom he tried to woo (with little success) at every possible occasion. It was not long, however, before Mune fell in love with Abe, constantly pursuing him and offering him a home-made lunch. Abe tried for a time to resist her advances, but eventually he was unable to contain his feelings, and made love with Mune in his apartment. Unbeknownst to them, an instantly-jealous Masayuki accidentally discovered the truth. The next night he became staggeringly drunk and invited Abe to meet him at the Abeno Shrine, planning to murder him with a hidden butcher knife when he arrived. At first unsuspecting, Abe arrived on the scene, but once he saw the decrepitly drunk Masa he knew what was afoot. He promptly bid Masayuki farewell, then disappeared, going back to his job in the Heian Era, leaving a pregnant Mune behind him; her child is Sasshi's father.
Childhood friends Arumi and Sasshi are residents of the Abenobashi commercial district in Abeno-ku, Osaka. After an accident, they find themselves transported to an alternate sword and sorcery world. Their attempt to get back to reality finds them traversing a series of nonsensical worlds built on science fiction, war, fantasy, dating sim games and American movies. Each alternate Abenobashi is a surreal manifestation of Sasshi's otaku interests, populated by analogs of the protagonist's relatives and acquaintances and a blue-haired stranger known as Eutus.
Their quest to return home is at its core a bildungsroman because the Abenobashi dimensions are mostly hobby worlds of increasing sophistication. Sasshi does not want to go home, and in fact is the sole force that is propelling them between worlds. While chasing a cat in the first episode, Arumi's grandfather fell off a roof and was hospitalized. With this new trauma pressuring him in addition to his apprehension about the eventual destruction of the shopping arcade and the Asahina's moving away, Sasshi was no longer willing or able to cope with reality, and unbeknownst to even himself, he had caused their dimension to rewrite itself into worlds echoing his escapist obsessions.
","Ohh...how do you begin to define something like Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi? To me, this show is a perfect example of a good idea that was poorly executed. The idea of trying to get home via world jumping from genre to genre in a parody attempt--that's some fun shit! But this show tries way too hard to have it both ways. It wants to have both its genre parody, AND its 'shocking' and serious drama. So, as you can imagine, SPOILERS AHOY!  
 
I'm gonna start with the ART, because it's the most positive aspect about the show imho.  
 
ART: 9 
For what it is, that being a 13 episode sort-of parody show, the animation in this is pretty great. It's not necessarily perfect, and in some shots its flat out lazy, but it works for the character design and the fast-paced manner that most of the jokes are given in. We get to see a wide range of expressions, designs, and even different styles at some points. None of the designs stick out as being badly done, unless they were purposely made to look bad or ridiculous. 
 
 This show is also one of the instances in which Gainax actually managed to spread the budget properly across episodes so the show consistently looks good, aside from maybe the opening which is made almost entirely of shots lifted from the first episode of the show.  
 
 
STORY: 5 
This is probably the biggest downfall of the entire show so I'm going to be discussing it at length. It's a good idea, and for a little while, it's executed decently--albeit with some fairly lowbrow humor.  It's fun, it's fast paced, and tends to consistently be interesting despite the idea of just jumping from genre Abenobashi District to genre Abenobashi District becoming repetitive. Even with the flaws of the first few episodes it still knows what it is and successfully sets out in doing that.  
 
But...then about halfway through it takes a sharp turn into trying to be a drama. It reveals a bunch of information about the history of Sasshi's and Arumi's families, the history of some doomed romance that involved a bunch of suicide and attempted resurrections, and that SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Sasshi doesn't want to go back to the real world not because his friend is moving away but because Arumi's grandfather actually died in an incident prior to them moving dimensions to the first time--and she doesn't know about it.  
 
Now, I want to be clear, this is a LOT of shit to pack even into a thirteen episode run but it doesn't really start getting introduced until halfway through. So there's even less time to cover all this familial bullshit and drama that is packed kind of oddly against a backdrop of over the top parody comedy. I'm not saying that the two genres cannot mesh--they've done so successfully before--I'm saying that they don't mesh here. The comedy is simply too bonkers to really work with this backdrop of relationship drama and death. But more insultingly than that, possibly the most insulting of all, is that the ending pretty much renders all of that drama to be completely meaningless when SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Sasshi essentially resets the world so that the death doesn't have to be dealt with and the relationship drama was somehow resolved off-screen. Even Arumi moving away to Hokkaido is reset by him.  
 
 
SOUND: 7 
I like the opening. I really do. Treats and Goblins is one of those poppy tunes that you hear a lot in anime, but the tune itself is recognizable and catchy. With both a mixture of Japanese and Engrish, it comes out sounding very 'hip' like the show itself sort of is intended to come off as at the beginning. The ending doesn't fair so well, being one of those generic nostalgic sounding songs you hear at the ending of...well, a lot of cheap anime soundtracks. It's forgettable as soon as it is heard.  
 
Then there's the rest of the soundtrack. I'm not sure what to say about it. The best term is 'eclectic'. The bgm is either absolutely unmemorable, or clearly composed to be reminiscent of a famous movie (examples being Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and many others that I'm sure I just am not recognizing). Some of the tracks sound SO much like the original track from the movie being referenced that one ends up wondering if they just flat out lifted the original track (and who knows, maybe they did).  
 
CHARACTERS: 7 
Arumi would be pretty atypical of the slap-happy anime girl, but she's mostly portrayed as the more logical of the two kids. In this, they mostly succeed at making her a likeable character. The closest thing the show has to a 'straight man' character, as it were. That said, she does kind of fall to typical anime girl pitfalls such as being concerned about her breast size and being angry about women flirting with the protagonist. Still, with her catchphrase ""Havin' your health, bein' human, that's what matters"" she comes off as pretty appealing.  
 
MuneMune and Eutus are probably the second most tolerable characters--she's batshit insane and wild while Eutus is more calm and flippant. MuneMune is wild, rapid, and always there for rapid-fire and silly jokes. Even when she goes to her more calm and controlled state she's likeable because despite how annoying the drama is, Mune's sorrow IS sympathetic. Eutus' approach to things is more distant and unapologetic, which would come off as annoying if he wasn't dealing with the protagonist Sasshi. In that he's much more amusing, since Sasshi's childish antics and approach throw him off his cool to a degree.  
 
And this comes to the protagonist, Sasshi. This characters starts off as amusing, goes briefly into sympathetic, and then comes out as flat out deplorable. This is a kid who is selfish and childish and despite everyone making it clear that he needs to grow up and face reality, the show pretty much gives him all the freedom to do the exact opposite. We are shown Sasshi being admonished for his selfish behavior only to pretty much get his way in the end. He is asked repeatedly by the show and the characters surrounding him to stop being so immature but he simply will not, and thusly is rewarded for it. Character flaws that were once funny, his obsession with the constant and his fanboyism, go to shit when he is essentially rewarded for it.  
 
 
OVERALL: 5 
I liked this show at first, and I wanted to like it all the way through. But it feels like it was being written by two different people at the same time who both had very different ideas of what they wanted to write. One wanted to write a crazy comedy, one wanted to write a serious drama, and then some third guy butted in and tore apart the built up message about facing reality as it is. I mentioned earlier that Gainax actually spread its animation budget across all thirteen episodes in this show--it's just too bad they couldn't spread the writing budget in a similar manner because this could've been a lot better show.

          
 
       Helpful This had the potential to be a really interesting anime. I liked it from the start, it succeeded in pulling me in with its odd art style and mind-fckery, but it had absolutely no staying power. I got tired of the old, ""find a new world, discover rules of new world thereby showcasing all the common tropes of anime type x, and then figure out how to beat it based on that and restore order/solve the problem."" I dropped the show after the 7 episode once i realized what was going on an that it wasn't changing. Was it entertaining at first? Yes. Did it keep my interest? No. Is the ending worth the payoff? I may never know, as I dropped it at the 7th episode. But I had plans to finish it for the story, but I simply stopped caring. And I read Atlus shrugged, a book that is 2000 pages long, and I suffered through the boring parts, and the 50 page monologue (no exaggeration, I counted), but could not get through this series. 
 
Final Rating: 6/10 watch if bored, don't if not. There's not enough there to make you want to finish.

Ok, there really is much about the art, I mean everything about the way the fanservice were drawn is still the same, you still see the usual boob flashing, panty shots, foreplay's and booty calling which is usual of the entire Queen Blade Franchise. The only thing lacking is the full frontal (you know what I mean) which is probably the only part that is censored. And I'm guilty of enjoying seeing it. 
 
Sound: Good 7. 
 
I'll be honest here, the moaning, the grinding, and boobs dribbling were very stimulating, so say what you wanna say, I don't give a damn.  
 
Characters: Mediocre 5. 
 
Well, it is not unusual for the Queen Blade Franchise to shuffle the characters from every season or OVA, so it safe to say that the character are still you typical hot babes duking out with each other whether they're fighting or doing foreplay. But among them characters it is Annelotte that I find good in a sense that she has the potential to play in wholesome role.  
 
 
Enjoyment and overall: Pathetic 1. 
 
Tbh, I did said before that this special ain't for those who expect a lot, so if you like to enjoy the sexual foreplay that this special presents, then enjoy. Frankly this is only for those who would watch it and having one hand on the keyboard or mouse and another hand on his.......................I think I'll leave up to your imagination.

","*This review contains spoilers 
 
It begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented. 
 
That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended. 
 
What is this “interesting” creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down. 
 
The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a “supernatural detective agency” to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events. 
 
Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode. 
 
The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found. 
 
The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several “minor” details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright cliché. For example, we learn  that the demons “feed on the darkness in the human heart” and that “all humans have darkness within them.” There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here. 
 
The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus. 
 
The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them—a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same—were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than “we needed more characters.” The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful. 
 
Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between “atmospherically dark” and “too damn dark to see anything,” as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum. 
 
Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA. 
 
In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the “Friday the 13th” franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere.

          
 
       Helpful Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.  
 
Story 
My biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn’t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the “meaning” of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing – just missed potential. 
 
Characters 
Again there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained. 
 
Art/Music 
Both the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn't strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. 


          
 
       Helpful Just finished watching, so I thought it was time for a full review. It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.  
 
Story: 
 A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that's true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.  
 
8/10 
 
Art:  
 Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren't anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds. 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn't feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn't actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn't even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn't much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic. 
 
6/10 
 
Characters:  
One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVA 
 
Enjoyment: 
I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn't notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch 
 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn't take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.

El-Hazard is threatened by a possible war between the human nations and the insectoid Bugrom tribe.
","With 2010 coming to a close, I decided I'd end this year in reviews by talking about one of my favorite anime television series of all time that's just as equally frustrating. If one anime franchise has been the very definiton of a mixed bag for me, it's been the El Hazard series, spin-offs, and sequels. Brought to us by the same production studio that brought us the Tenchi franchise, another show I've been indifferent about for almost 20 years, might have something to do with it. 
 To start, I'm a huge mark for both the TV show and the Magnificent World OAV (El Hazard 2 was mediocre at best and I really hated Alternative World a lot) and I have no problems accepting their differences. Most of the changes made for The Wanderers I would assume is because a lot of material from the Magnificent World wouldn't fly on television (the profanity, nudity, lesbian titillation), so I was very confused when I began watching the OAV after finishing the TV show first some 14 years ago, buying the VHS tapes from Funcoland (later called Gamestop, there's one on every corner now).        
 For the most part, I thought the changes were very clever and ultimately put to good use for Wanderers. I really enjoyed Ifurita as a bumbling air head as opposed to the nearly emotionless robot from the OAV. Her cold demeanor in Magnicent World made it way too predictable as to what would happen with her and Makoto near the climax. I called it way back then and I still think dark Ifurita is the glaring weakness from the OAV and put a damper on the experience for me. There are other very major changes made that affects the path of the plot to the point of a script overhaul, but seriously, if you accept the differences, you can enjoy both in their regard. 
 Even with comparisons aside, The Wanderers is one of the best (if not the best) fantasy anime TV series I've seen. I used to be a fan alternate demonsion-based stories until Fushigi Yugi ruined everything, and El Hazard's universe is vast with vibrant colors, other-worldly monsters, unique settings, and a fun cast of characters.  
 Man, do I love the character's. It follows the Tenchi protocol of harem syndrome (one doofy guy and some hot girls), but this formula worked well in the 90's, as every joke doesn't have to be perverted to a ridiculous degree. The three priestesses are all still the same, the rivalry between Shayla Shayla and Afura Mann is a little more fleshed out, Miz I think is a little wackier in this version, but it's still played for laughs. Alliele, Fatora's lesbian lover, is toned down consideralby and reduced to being a guide for Makoto and co. and has adopted a more ""big sister relationship with Nanami"". Makoto himself is still one of the most original male characters in a harem-ish themed show, as he actually DOES stuff and is very scientifically inclined. His brains adds a great deal of personality to him and keeps him from being ""every guy"" that populates harem titles. And I strongly accept a relationship with teenage shy girl Rune Venus rather than Plank-O-Wood Ifurita.   
 One character that stays virually the same, regardless of the version your watching, is Katsuhiko Jinnai, and thank the heavens for that. Jinnai is my all time favorite anime villain and he is a blast to watch. Petty, vindictive, psychotic, manipulative, greedy, selfish, and meglomanical, Jinnai is everything a successful franchise needs in a good villain. It's like if you took Team Rocket, combined them with Light Yagami, added a dash of Dr. Wily, and garnished it with the Ginyu Force. And that bloody laugh, man I love it! It seems like the only thing he's missing is a Snidley Whiplash handle bar moustache to twirl! I can gaurantee that anyone will get a kick out of this guy, even when babysitting the brainless Ifurita! He's the glue that holds this series and it's incarnations together. 
 IN CLOSING: Not many OAV to TV show transitions go really well in anime, but I think this is one of the better offerings. It seemed to be handled with a certain amount of care and detail and all the changes were overall pretty good to build a substantial television program. Even if the plot has a mild overhaul to it, I still really enjoy this version of El Hazard a lot, and while it's not quite better than the OAV, it does a few things that I really like more, and in part, keeps both of them fresh and entertaining in their own right without running too similar to one another.

       Helpful I put this at dropped for after watching it whole some time ago I really disliked the series, not wishing to add to my collection. a very poor alternate version to a real masterpiece. Characters are changed and highly simplified, new pairings are made for no really valid reasons and nothing interesting is added, erasing what was already well done and making this childish and uninteresting. 
 
All the drama and love is taken out, leaving a really poor and simplistic story. And the final episode is a very poor substitute to the beautiful end the original El Hazard has. 
 
Funny is I saw this one first, and that made me look for the other iterations of this series, for the images I saw were not matching this anime.  
 
I added a real masterpiece with El Hazard: The Magnificent World... 
 
About Wanderers....I advise to stay away from it.

Story and Characters 
 
The year is Universial Century 0079. The series is mostly seen through the eyes of Oliver May, a technical officer in the Zeon 603rd Technical Evaluation Unit , in charge of testing new military technology. Stationed in the Jotunheim, a civilian transport ship that was converted into military use, Oliver must head into battle and experience the One Year War, only this time from the perspective of a weapon tester who struggles to make an impact on an evolving war during changing times.  
 
The 3 OVAs tell stories of 3 different weapons and their technical champions. The first is about a mass cannon who quickly finds a champion in the Jotunheim's gunnery master. The second is a tank which showcases its best power in the hands of an experienced artillery instructor who has a little bit of a drug problem. Finally there is the Zudah mobile suit piloted by a handsome war hero, but all is not what it seems to be. 
 
If I had to rate the OVAs separately, I would have to say the second episode as a standalone would deserve a 10, with the other two being between 8.5 and 9. 
 
The way the plot played through was very good. Each character had their point of view and was fully fleshed out in a very short period of time. I got to like them all very quickly and before I knew it I was emotionally involved. It's the characters more than the weaponary that makes this series great, even though the protagonist(s) all have an affinity and passion for their favorite weapon. Let's just say shedding tears is possible during Gundam. 
 
 
Art/Animation 
 
CGI type similar to Final Fantasy Spirits Within/Advent Children. Some details are unbelievable (can see individual eyelashes and strands of hair) while others look very obviously CGI'd (repetitive explosions) which seem chunky and blocky. Overall, this was well done compared to most of the older gundam series which has dated animation. The animation is more of a personal preference as to whether you like the CGI or cell drawings. 
 
Sound 
 
Sound was the weakest part of this anime. Voice acting was good but music was so so. Except every time they play that sad violin music the viewer gets so well trained that they inevitably expect someone else to die ...  
 
Enjoyment 
 
I was very surprised by how good this OVA was and thoroughly enjoyed it. It packed more emotional punch in 3 episodes than the entire of Gundam Seed Destiny. Just goes to show that length does not necessarily make a good or bad anime.

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR: I can only imagine die hard Gundam fans watching this and enjoying it ironically. 
 
Oh man. This was a complete mess. From every standpoint. The CGI doesn't hold up at all. Everything looks like a bad PS2 cutscene. The facial expressions where so exaggerated at times I bursted out laughing. 
The story is non existent. Because this is supposed to show us the OYW thru Zeon's eyes I thought we would get to know the principalty and it's people better. Nah. Just a couple of battles only from Zeon's POV. The episodes are so boring when it's not being funny by accident because of how incompetent it is. 
The only good thing about this is the Mobile Suits in action, they're the only part where the animation is actually pretty cool and ejoyable. Sadly this only happens in the last couple of minutes of every episode. In a brighter side, it's only 3 episodes long, so it won't be too insuferable like the 47 episodes from ZZ.

          
 
       Helpful ""What's that? You can't catch up to the worlds largest fool?"" 
 
There was so much that could have gone right with this series. 
 
If I was to sum up MS IGLOO, the words that would be best used to describe it are ""It was a complete disaster"". 
 
The concept sounded promising, a re-telling of the One Year War from the Zeon's perspective. Sounds great, I mean, finally we get to hear what the One Year War was like from the Zeon's point of view. Already you have me hooked, I mean we've seen what it was like from Amuro's point of view in the original Mobile Suit Gundam, 8th MS Team showed us how the One Year War was for a group of conventional Mobile Suit pilots and 0080 effectively shows us how the war is for a little child. So when I found out about this series, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to hear what the Zeon's thought of it. 
 
Oh what a bad move that was. 
 
If there is one positive from this OVA's story, it's that we at least get some backstory on Operation British and the Battle of Loum (aka Char's big moment when he destroyed 5 Magellan Class battleships, and when Mobile Suits where first used in actual combat) but aside from that? Nothing. The story is a complete and total shambles, in fact I'd be hard pressed to call weapons testing a story when placed in a meta-series that is thick with mythology.  
 
Its not that MS IGLOO's story is bad; it's terrible. An episodic series about weapons testing does not work in a series that has become well known for its large scale mech battles; and to be honest its not like the story would be able to stand on its own two feet as a completely stand-alone series either, the reason? It doesn't have its own two feet to stand on, it constantly tries to place itself in the Gundam continuity and fails. Another problem that the series has is its evident lack of character development, even if it is an episodic series, a lack of character development is inexcusable. If I wanted a show where the characters are worse than wafer-thin cardboard cut outs I'd just go off and re-watch the entirety of the crap half of Tsubasa Chronicle. But I'll get onto the characters later. 
 
Now the interesting thing about MS IGLOO, is its decision to put the entire series in CG, if done right, this could have worked so well for Sunrise and Gundam in general. I mean, can you imagine? CG Gundam eh? Now THAT sounds like something special, definitely would have put an interesting spin on things. But no, Sunrise managed to completely squander that opportunity as well. The character models in CG look awkward and flat, here's an example, they look like a bunch of rejects from Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and even that film had the decency to opt for photo-realism. As for the Mobile Suits? Hah, don't make me laugh. Try imagining a bad looking game from the PS2, imagining it? Now think about how bland and flat the textures in that game looked and then compare that to the Mobile Suits in MS IGLOO, done that? That bad looking game from the PS2 era doesn't look so bad now does it? 
 
I suppose that when they're actually in motion they at least look the part, the one benefit about those bland Mobile Suit models is that they at least animate smoothly, the same can't be said for the characters though, I mean we have a salute here and there and odd bit of walking now and then, but most of the time they stay in one place at one time, Sunrise can't even create the illusion that these CG models look even remotely good. Talk about a wasted opportunity. 
 
The voice acting in MS IGLOO is appalling. There is no other word that I can use for it without going into obscenities and its never a good idea to use too many of them in one place. Hideo Ishikawa may have managed to impress people as Itachi Uchiha and Juushirou Ukitake, but in MS IGLOO, he sucks. Voice acting tends to make a character more convincing, of all the characters, Oliver May manages to at least make some sort of impact but that doesn't mean he's good. However the real cretin of the voice cast is Miki Nagasawa, I've heard bad voices and I've heard annoying voices, very rarely though do I ever see a cross between the two. Nagasawa is unforgivably bad, her Monique being one of the most annoying female characters I've ever had the displeasure of viewing on my computer monitor, I actually felt bad for the poor thing; no not Nagasawa's character, the computer monitor, there were a few occasions that I swear it was going to start breaking down on me because of how bad she is. 
 
If I was able to say anything about the characters, it would be...they certainly know how to leave an impression, and no that isn't a good thing. They are hard to watch, a lot of the time I felt like giving up on MS IGLOO because of how bad it was, and the characters are the main cause for it - at no point do you ever feel a connection with them, they're just there, on your screen, wasting your valuable time, I could have accomplished so much in the time it took me to watch an episode of MS IGLOO, something that would have actually been productive rather than wasting goodness knows how many minutes/hours on this travesty that I know I will never get back.  
 
At the end of the day, it's easy to say that MS IGLOO is one of the worst Gundam side stories available, it fails at being a re-telling from Zeon's perspective, it fails at being a stand-alone series, it fails at making you connect with the characters and it fails at showing weapon testing, its original aim. 
 
If this was the first Gundam series you watched, I feel sorry for you. You wasted time, and probably got a sour taste in your mouth of what is usually an excellent mecha show, you're better off forgetting this disaster and going off watching something that's actually good in the Universal Century like 8th MS Team or indeed the original Mobile Suit Gundam. I'm pretty sure most long time Gundam fans will agree that this is definitely ranking up there as one of the worst Gundam series out there. 
 
And to those who have actually watched and enjoyed this series, I have to ask: Are you mental?

","I've seen far more worse and better anime OVAs  in the 26 years that I've watched anime. Dragon century is for me quite in the middle and since this was like other OVAs a one-shot title it was '' bearable"" but as well it seemed a bit unclear if you don't watch it several times to get it. First of all part 1: 1990 AD, I was surprised by the violent content and would have LOVED IT if I was like 12 years old or something :).  
Clearly there you can see how the human dominion comes to a crash course once dragons appear with very bloody consequences (don't be a bitch by the amount of blood if you can't stomach it) and a girl gets involved by saving a dragon egg that hatched. 
But as the story progresses there is a meaning to the dragons appearance when a demon god fucks up the human world and needs to be stopped and in some way the girl and dragon do it, leaving some destroyed buildings around, and a timerift opens so dragons can enter the human world. 
Part 2 on the other hand, you will be confused the 1st time because it starts in a new era named R.C 272 ( Ryuu Seiki translated to Dragon Century) . 
It appears that the human world is changed in to a human/dragonworld where 
dragons that lives far longer than humans are used as pets, fighting in arenas for fame. 
The young hatched dragon from part 1 is now a few hundreds of years old and encounters a young girl that possibly is a grandchild in the future related to the girl in part 1, and for some reason the demon has be revived or whatsoever which is time for the dragons to stop and save their world, and it felt unfinished. 
The animation was 'respectable for its time', it was cheap but not THAT cheap, but hey what do you expect from one-shot 2 part ova. 
The characters themselves were quite good, I had hoped that a bit more attention was given to the dragons since they are the main part of the story, but I had no problems with the female character, she had an  undaunted, non airheaded, strong believing and understandable personality that drops heavily in part 2. Part 2 had more dragon characters and human characters but was all about it. 
It was enjoyable on the basis that it's just a short popcorn OVA and was good to me but could have brought soo much more potential on the goddamn table, but after so long it is forgiven. So yeah in the end its up to you to make a opinion.

          
 
       Helpful It's the present day, and suddenly dragons have been appearing in the skies!  These giant creatures are soon feared and killed on sight, as they become more numerous and destructive.  But a young student runs away with a dragon's egg, and raises the young dragon in an abandoned school.  But this cannot last forever, and she is discovered - but at the same moment, we learn that the dragons may not be the enemies that we once thought, as another apocalyptic threat emerges.     
   
And that's just the first half.  The second episode jumps hundreds of years into the future, to a different society where humans and dragons fight in cage matches.  But even as the times change, age-old threats still remain.     
   
This two-part story is nothing special, but it doesn't drag, either.  In fact, if anything, it jumps from point A to point G pretty quickly, and probably could have benefited from a longer running time to flesh a few things out.  The art is decent, the animation is a little bit weak in places.  Be aware there is a decent helping of gore.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, My review is going to be very biased, as the first episode could be taken on its own, and could very well stay that way on your list without losing much. 
 
Story:  
The story is unique, something I haven't seen before in monster shows, or science fantasy or science fiction. Suddenly, a string of violent deaths occur, and dragons are discovered on earth. This is where it gets interesting, as dragons neither seem to be able to breathe fire or do magic, or any of that, which I very much like. It turns out that things like guns are effective, and we are fully capable of hurting them.  
 
A girl, probably in high school, begins caring for a dragon, beginning to raise it under the impression she can work beside him to take out her angst against the world. Grey and edgy, but with touching moments. It has a nice emotional range, and I hold the first episode close to my heart. 
 
the second episode? ever watch dune? it'll remind you of that, with some Rocky and a dash of Eragon. it's a 180 degree shift in tone. it still has decent story and sci-fi elements, but with a post-apocalyptic theme. 
 
Technical, art, sound, etc: 
Sound design is amazing for its time. ever hear someone trying to stab an office window with a fork, then drag it along the glass? you will, and you'll cringe. simply stunning for what it was. I'm not biased on a medium's age though, and have to give it a very good rating. music was great, but some room tone couldn't hurt. the art, on the other hand, is amazing. many scenes could be paused and put on a wall as a painting, and the characters are well rendered and thought out. A sunset washes the colors in reds, pinks, and yellows, and SHADING IS NEVER SKIPPED ON ANYTHING. seriously, today's animes do that a lot. not too much panning, and shots with less animation don't stay too long. it holds up against today's stuff well. 
 
Characters: 
Characters are a solid part of this show, enough to say telling you what they're like could be a spoiler, so I'll leave what's above, and that this show doesn't idealize anything. The characters feel they have depth, and you aren't given their life stories, and their past clearly has an influence on them. outstanding characters. 
 
overall? 8/10, underrepresented, and wish each episode was a 24-52 episode series. it didn't have enough time, but definitely was set up to be anywhere between Death Note, Shingeki no Bahamut, and Grave of the Fireflies, and I want a remake that goes to all those places! 
(but never made good on them, so that wasn't spoilers)

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

","How not to Summon a Demon Lord is a near textbook example of how to properly execute an ecchi anime. And let me tell you, it’s about freaking time. Call me perverted if you will, but sometimes I just want to sit in a secluded location and listen to 2D girls moan in pleasure as they’re put in ridiculously lewd and comical situations. Of course, I’m not so shallow as to completely disregard all other aspects of an anime and call it “da best evah!” just because it has a few cute babes and sexy scenes. The characters have to be bearable to watch and, now I know I’m asking a lot here, an ecchi anime with a decent plot wouldn’t hurt, right? Unfortunately, modern ecchi anime just haven’t been cutting it for me for a variety of reasons. I just don’t get that satisfying BOOSTO anymore, if you know what I mean…anyway, Demon Lord on the other hand is actually pretty good for what it is, and I’m here to tell you why. 
 
Not only is this show an ecchi, but it’s an isekai anime as well, because we definitely don’t have enough of those! And you can tell that creators are running out of fresh isekai ideas, because this anime’s first episode alone stole so many things from other isekai anime that I’m not actually sure whether it was intentional or not. You got references to KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Overlord, and so many others. I actually found this to be rather ridiculous, yet quite amusing. And we now arrive at one of the primary reasons as to why I like this anime: it’s actually pretty funny! Now I know that taste in comedy varies from person to person, but for me, the lewd humor and Diablo’s plain awkwardness were relatively enjoyable to watch. I found myself laughing during every episode, which for me was just refreshing.  
 
Now here comes the question that I’m sure is the most important to you: are the ecchi aspects of this show any good? Well, I can happily tell you that they most certainly are. You got the bouncy boobs, slimes that melt clothes, naked in bed scenes, fondling of breasts, and so much more. In fact, there’s a really memorable scene in episode 10 (If you’ve watched it, you know what I’m talking about ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ), that goes to borderline hentai levels of lewdness.  
 
And I really dig that. 
 
There are two primary girls in this anime. Shera is a large chested, blonde elf princess with sparkling eyes who likes to rub her breasts up against the protagonist. Yep, we got a winner here! Though she’s actually not a one dimensional character like you might expect her to be, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying her story arc, despite its simplicity. Rem is a flat chested animal girl with long, charcoal hair, fluffy cat ears, and a petite body. Right off the bat viewers are presented with Rem’s tragic secret, and I honestly started feeling an emotional attachment to her from there on out. Also, thanks to this anime and Re:Zero, I discovered that characters named Rem are doomed to unjust torment. I won’t spoil anything, but just know that being named Rem is suffering. The differences between these two characters’ physical traits are like night and day, and they’re each obviously designed to appeal to different fetishes. But you know what? I ended up appreciating both of these girls, and not just for their features, but for their character depth as well. 
 
Diablo is your typical overpowered isekai protagonist who crushes all opposition. However, unlike Kirito and his army of clones, the writers gave this guy some personality which made him enjoyable to watch. Diablo’s socially awkward nature combined with his attempts to role play as a demon lord resulted in some pretty comedic moments. And viewers even get a glimpse into his past to see why he is the way he is, which helped increase his relatability for me. But let’s not forget his most important trait: he’s a total chick magnet! All of the girls love him, and he’s wise enough to understand the merits of both large and flat chests. What a prophet.  
 
I also loved how this anime handled the Demon Lord Glebsklem. Instead of just making her into a giant final boss monster for Diablo to dispatch of with his hax protagonist powers, after her theatrical summoning, she was revealed to just be a kawaii loli with twintails. And she freaking loves biscuits. Plus she wants to go on a quest to consume all of the world’s biscuits. I can’t express in words how freaking amazing I find this to be. My only problem is that biscuit loli wasn’t introduced earlier in the anime so that she could get more lewd sce- uh, I mean character development.  
 
Visuals are generally quite standard, though they do one up similar shows in several regards. For one, they actually have some pretty great monster designs, with the hydra being the standout one for me. Sure, it wasn’t around for long, but it looked great and had fluid movements, which is a stark contrast to the poorly constructed and uninspired monsters from other isekai anime. Also, the visual quality improved dramatically during some of the ecchi scenes, which are OBVIOUSLY the most important moments in the anime. During these sacred moments, the girls got animated in very seductive ways that FIRMLY GRASPED my attention. 
 
The instrumental portions of each of the two theme songs played what I thought to be really catchy melodies. The songs’ vocalists had a nice cute sound to them, probably because they were performed by the show’s female seiyuu. The voice acting is about what you would expect. Diablo talks in a deep, menacing voice, but sounds a lot less intimidating when viewers hear his thoughts. Rem has that cute, soft voice that I simply adore, and Shera has a higher pitch, ditsy sort of voice that sounds adorable. 
 
While this show isn’t even close to top tier when compared to all other anime, it does manage to be one of the finest isekai anime that I’ve seen, as well as the best ecchi anime that I’ve watched in awhile. Where it excelled at for me was its sheer entertainment value. There was never a dull moment in the anime, and I both laughed at the comedic antics and felt for the characters during the more serious moments. The anime flows quite well, and it’s a perfect concoction of ecchi and story elements. All I can do now is hope that future installments in both the ecchi and isekai genres follow a similar path to How not to Summon a Demon Lord.

          
 
       Helpful In truth it is a good adaptation, although it seems to be an ecchi of the pile. Its animation is above the average of the genre, mainly the character designs. 
Being a manga reader I consider it worthwhile to see this adaptation if you expect an isekai in which the protagonist is a ""villain"" learning about human relationships (because he has been a hikikomori in his previous life). 
 
Due to its genre with fan service, I recommend not to wait long and read the novel or the manga first. Finally I hope you can understand that the genre isekai and echi are complicated to enjoy today, but I think this anime can give you laughs and an entertaining moment if you dont expect so much of it.

          
 
       Helpful all the hype was for nothing it is just another cliche isekai,fan service,harem i was excited for the ending but that was a disappointment not that big a fan of the script.Overall i would rat this a 5 star if it were made 3 or 4 years ago it would be a big hit,  but i now just gaze upon it as a overlord rip off with more fan service.Another aspect i think the show acts is combat scenes in every fight Diablo(the main character) wins by an exponential amount and over time gives the viewer less enjoyment in fights like the grand demon lord vs demon lord fight the show premiered up to was only about 7 minutes long, in other shows like overlord they keep you interested by adding contemplating ideas like the mystery of what Ains will do next but Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu is just leaving you wondering about the shows potential.I believe the episode that really messed this up was the last episode, 12 they end the show off not with a lingering question, or anticipation but with a cliche ending that looks like beginner material

To show the school how much she wants to lead the student body, Manami begins to sing Seioh's school song after hearing it for the first time the day before. At the conclusion of the song, Manami is inducted as the student council president and received well by the entire school. The story that follows Manami working with Mika, and three other classmates—Mutsuki Uehara, Mei Etoh, and Momoha Odori—in student council matters, despite Manami and Mika initially being the only official members. After some remodeling of the student council room, Manami and her friends set forth to plan for the upcoming student festival.
","Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! is a classic example of looks over substance. While not totally devoid of any redeemable qualities, it's hard to recommend Manabi Straight to anyone, as it is simply outclassed by too many other choices. 
 
The story revolves around the Seioh high school student council and its attempt at organizing the school fair. Underneath that lies a story of friendship between the five girls who takes part in student council activities. However, neither of these stories succeeds in gathering much interest for one important reason: the characters. 
 
Simply put, after the initial impressions, the characters of Manabi Straight get stale very quickly. You have Manabi, the hyperactive student council president; Mikan, the mousy and insecure treasurer; Mei, your typical tsundere in an all-girl setting; Mutsuki, the cheerful tomboy, and Momo, the side character with the attention span of a goldfish. There's not much to the characters beyond that, and if you have watched any significant amount of anime, none of the characters would strike you as original; but more importantly, the key flaw is in the lack of meaningful character development. Viewers are never given a glance behind Manabi's over-excitable disposition, hence they never come to understand her zealous passion for the school. Mikan's growth from her shy self is done in the ancient formula of &quot;confidence through friendship&quot;, the kind of stuff you would expect from series aimed at younger children, such as Digimon. The only meaningful character development happens with Mei, but most of that takes place in one episode during the first half of the series, leaving the rest of Manabi Straight rather dull. 
 
The underlying friendship story concerning the student council as well as the rest of the school is just not very compelling, partly because of the caricature-like main characters, as well as the cliche developments that you would be able to see coming from a mile away. Because of this, it's very hard to actually care for  the personal struggles of the characters or the school fair, which accounts for much of the overly simplistic plot. 
 
On the bright side, the art style of Manabi Straight definitely scores it some much-needed points. The colors are very pleasantly vibrant, both in the backgrounds and on the characters, producing an unique sheen. The characters are drawn in a slightly chubby style that is probably cuter than their actual personalities will ever hope to be, though trying to pass them off as high school students is a very long shot. Beyond that, the animation in the movements and mannerisms of the characters are above average, though the detail is never too high when dealing with the simplistic (but pleasant) character designs. 
 
In the terms of sound, the seiyuu of Manabi Straight did a fine job, though Mikan's mousy voice may get on some viewers' nerves at by the end of the series. The musical score consists of nothing too memorable, but nothing offending either. The opening, ending, and insert songs are also commendable, but once again fail to leave much impression. 
 
In the end, beyond the refreshing art style, Manabi Straight fails to impress. With a story more suited to younger audiences, yet a concept that appeals to older viewers, it suffers from a sort of identity crisis. The comedy is sparse, the drama is weak, the plot is cliche, the characters are generic -- reflecting upon these facts, Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! probably turned out better than the sum of its parts. Of course, that's not saying much, as Manabi Straight remains merely a mediocre experience. 


          
 
       Helpful What can I say about Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!? This is the first review I have submitted in MAL and it's for this awful anime. I gave it a go due to the rating it has an the other reviews and I regret that decision. 
 
If you are interested in a soft anime to past the time give Gakuen Utopia a chance, you might like it who knows but if you are interested in getting a good laugh stay away from this.  Rest assure this is not going to be a full of hate review not at all, there are a couple of good things in this anime for example 
 
* The characters *Manabi is a straight forward girl that has a unique way of acting and doesn't take things seriously giving problems to everyone around her. In each episode we see them supporting each other and also learning a little about the secondary characters past which is something that is not often shown.   
 
*Story> I got to admit that it caught me. The ideal of a school life anime which is involved about school life almost ending is something that I have not seen before, the main issue is that they focused on how to make those days joyful instead of the reasons why those specific characters decided to go to school. 
 
The sound it has it's not the best but due to the environment it takes place it makes sense. The art style it's an not so bad  but it could improve. 

          
 
       Helpful Education is considered one of the most important tenets of civilization. In many ways, education has helped people understand each other; for example, reviewers write about what they like and dislike in a work and the masses can respond to them by either clicking those two buttons below all reviews, or directly thanking/criticizing them.Thank an English teacher every time you f-bomb a reviewer. Language is the greatest tool invented by humankind. Without language, we will not be civilized. We will not be able to watch anime or invent baconnaise. 
 
Many parents and teachers claim that school is a forum for thinking. School is the place to learn how to collaborate. In the real world, most projects require more than just one person. If one cannot work together, one loses many opportunities. Chefs have to work together with assistant chefs and waitresses to serve the best food; delays and a lowering of quality can happen if the employees are obtrusive and inexperienced. There are many cases that the teacher-student relationship blurs and this is why school is so great; namely, we all can learn from each other. There is no other place for learning many things besides a school. 
 
Manabi Straight’s setting argues that the quality of education, the importance of school, and teamwork will degrade in the future -- it is set around 2035. Some viewers, interested in the field of education, may also argue that this is happening today. Colleges are becoming more expensive and it seems more practical to start in the workforce; my mathematics teacher said that an experienced plumber will earn about the same revenue as a doctor in a lifetime. In America and Britain, education systems are on the verge of a revamp. Japan’s student scores on science exams has steadily decreased, but the students feel less stress; this is quite unlike its neighbor, South Korea, which has problems with student suicides. What should the education systems do? What is the meaning of school today? These are great questions to ponder for politicians, people in the education field, students, and parents. Without a doubt, this is a fantastic setting that asks us to think about the future. 
 
Manabi, a new student, has elected herself as the Student Council President and, inspired by the school anthem’s lyrics, has started creative projects to vitalize the school. If there is one reason to watch the show, it is to watch Yui Horie’s fantastic Kushieda Minorin-like performance. Her character personifies the idealistic view on the meaning of school. She is a genki girl that believes in the power of friendship; her humor and gregarious personality is admiring. A natural-born leader, Manabi manages to lead the student council despite her status as a newbie. Her struggle as a character is awe-inspiring and drives the story forward; if you are a college admission officer, you should immediately accept her into your college no matter how prestigious it is. If you did not feel any emotion from her singing the school anthem in the first episode, you have no soul. She is just that awesome. 
 
Like Azumanga Daioh, the work also has a character people can relate to. Voiced by Haruhi, Mei personifies those students with a strong sense of responsibility. Everyone knows at least one Mei in our lives; we also have different opinions on people like her. She is a fantastic character because her archetype appears in other works. In Manabi Straight, we see her archetype through a sentimental lens. This is to provoke our minds into changing our perceptions of characters and people like Mei. Thus, Mei is the most realistic and human character in this whole series. 
 
Takako, as well, deserves a mention. She should have been a main character. A mentor to Manabi, Takako is a bored student council president in a typical rich girl’s school. Until she meets Manabi, school is nothing more than a place before work. Her character becomes dynamic and more humane. Thus, her character is complimentary to Manabi’s. Both characters develop the themes together and their interactions are the most interesting ones in the show. 
 
Sadly, this is the end of positive aspects of the show. Everything else is as stale as a live-action Disney show. 
 
The story is hampered by the other characters: Mika, Momoha, and Mutsuki. Mika is the shy girl character and her path to adulthood is predictable and pointless. Momoha is one of those characters that is “unnecessary, but oh well, let’s add her because she is moe”. Mutsuki is genki and that’s about it; she is clearly Ritsu from K-On!. These three people slow down the story to a snail’s pace, using terrible jokes that people really don’t care about. 
 
Thus, this brings up another point. What is the focus for this show exactly? Manabi Straight has an impressive setting and this work has the potential to be deep and thought-provoking. This reminds me of a work like Sora no Woto, a combination of K-On! visuals and antiwar environmental themes. Why can’t this work do that? Instead, it goes back and forward. Pacing is abysmal. Mika is not the main character; Manabi is. Why are we hearing her thoughts instead of Manabi’s? The story and theme feel underdeveloped thanks to teetering and its most dramatic moments succumb to it.  
 
Art direction is generic and the lighting feels underexposed. This is probably a stylistic choice, but it makes it hard for viewers to see. Character designs are standard lolicon. It does not venture into more creative territories. There is nothing daring or expressive that ufotable did. It is just so bland that words can’t express it. 
 
Any anime enthusiasts will figure out the clock tower’s bell. It is a commonly used sound effect, which also appears in the Umineko visual novel series; I assume the Golden Witch is rolling her head in her grave. Manabi’s OP and ED are standard forgettable j-pop songs. Sound, as a whole, is ordinary at the very best. 
 
Sometimes, I think too deep into many things; Manabi Straight’s setting is one of them for sure. Thus, it is a pity to say that I am disappointed in such a promising setting. For a work with such a huge potential to be more than just moe, it feels lacking. A bore, most of the characters should have been cut out. It focuses on the wrong things at the wrong times and there is no limit to its genericness. Manabi Straight is just a slice-of-life show featuring lolicons doing cute things. It does not sit well with me.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

However, he unexpectedly runs into ""the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level""—Taiga Aisaka—who just happens to be Minori's best friend.

","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

(Source: ANN)","['Dementia', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Psychological']","The story involves a country doctor who describes his urgent call to look after a young patient.
More and more, the doctor gets involved in surreal experiences as he is transported to his patient by seemingly ""unearthly horses"" in a blink of an eye. While treating the patient, he fails to find the fatal wound which results in humiliation by the villagers and an endless return trip, losing everything.
It tells the story of the continuous pressure on doctors, and the never-ending impossible expectations laying on their shoulders.
","“I really want to scratch your eyeballs out.” — Terminal child 
 
Not satisfied with the limited selection of the in-town whores, the Doctor (who?) decided to turn toward pedophilia — and LSD — to quell his pent-up sexual frustration; unfortunately, Gandhi (the child) wasn’t having any of it.  Not easily deterred, the Doctor (seriously, who?) rubbed his wrinkly shlong all over an unsuspecting horse, in what can only be described as a bizarre case of sexual assault.  
 
Franz Kafka, an Austrian-Hungarian writer, wrote A Country Doctor in 1917, during a period where he suffered from stress, migraines, depression, insomnia — SOCIALIST INFLUENCES — and anxiety.  This explains why the main character, the Doctor, exhibited a psychosis of sorts, and seemed unable to rationalize in any coherent manner.  The 2007 reinterpretation of A Country Doctor (by Koji Yamamura), accentuated the Doctor’s psychosis by distorting the viewer’s perception of what is truly happening on the screen; hence, the stretching of characters beyond reasonable limits, the unwholesome aesthetic, and the peculiar symbolism.  In essence, Koji Yamamura attempted to engage the viewer by having him/her share in the Doctor’s twisted experience.   
 
This is all well and good, mind you, but it doesn’t change the fact that A Country Doctor is severely lacking from a narrative and character perspective.  Yes, the Doctor’s delusions are beautifully portrayed through the “crude” artwork, but it’s not entirely understood why the Doctor suffers from these ailments (besides Kafka superimposing his own mental illness on Doctor).  This lack of detail prevents the viewer from creating a meaningful connection with the Doctor — making his absurdities, seem exceptionally nonsensical.

          
 
       Helpful From the beginning of its great opening sequence, Inaka Isha catches its audience with a raw humanity right from ""Go"". This harrowing narrative acquaints us with an experience similar to Teshigahara Hiroshi's ' Suna no onna (Woman in the Dunes) or the opening scene of Alain Renais' Hiroshima, Mon Amour : we see beautiful animation in the way the snow envelopes the screen and in the sketchiness of the lines, making this seem more like a painting than an anime. 
 
Also, pay attention to the wonderful shadow work in the left most corner of the screen, reminiscent of early silhouette work of Lotte Reiniger (also seen in the chorus of Revolutionary Girl Utena ). 
 
As we are introduced to the character of the Doctor, by way of his two smaller, darker shelves who serve the film as narrators, he looks as if he were a force of nature - a tornado - or perhaps made of smoke rather than a human of flesh and blood. With wild eyes and a distperportion of size, we become engrossed in his woe of a faraway patient and stranded with no a horse or means to reach him. We are flooded with questions the longer this work progresses: How will he get there? What will happen to Rosa in the meanwhile? What's really going on here? Well, it's Kafka, so just look deeper and the answer *might* be there. 
 
However, it's the movement and shadows that are the real protagonists here and their job is done masterfully. From the shadow work I mentioned earlier to the wonderful transistions made from human to landscape, darkness to possibility and therefore, light.  
 
Movement is used in several skillful, clever ways in this anime, the first being to set and change the pace and perspective as needed. What's interesting here is that there wasn't one set pace that the director decided on, it changes from somewhat slow to incredibly fast rather quickly, as though you and the doctor can't quite keep up with what is happening in the events and surroundings. Which leads me to the second method of using movement in the anime, which is to convey the various feelings the characters are dealing with, from panic or sorrow to feeling stretched too thin -- literally. We are seeing these character's emotions (even those of the movement itself in certain scenes) from the perspective of their emotions rather than from the point of view of the characters themselves and the effect is nothing short of chilling.  
 
Speaking of chilling, the music brilliantly created by Hitomi Shimizu (found also in Yamamura Koji's other work Atama Yama) fits this animation perfectly, setting an eerie mood almost immediately. As an audience we have no doubt how stark and bleak the path that lies ahead for  Ein Landarzt is, because this spectral music is leading the way through the darkness, horseless and blind, while the cold and snow obstruct our path. It actually reminds me of an old production of Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale, however it carries a much heavier role in this short film than the uplifting song of the latter. 
 
For the part of the ""Country Doctor,"" director Yamamura Kōji chose accredited Kyōgen star and national treasure, Sensaku Shigeyama, a true story teller if there ever was one. Something very powerful was happening on the screen as I watched this man with so much finesse; the music, Sensaku Shigeyama's performance and even the unadorned, severeness of the setting all gave the suggestion of early Noh performances which I stood watching, mouth agape.  
 
Although I found myself re-watching this 3 or 4 times, I would say this is not an anime for the typical viewer but one who loves the obscure -- anime as an art form. While the presentation is stunning, the anime itself is as stark as the music that leads us and the story in true Germanic-Slavic form is both fascinating and bleak. Kafka himself was Austrian-Hungarian born to German-speaking Jewish parents, so all that struggle really comes through here as is typical with Kafka's other works. And while I gave this animation a 10, the average seems to be a 7 by other audiences and I suspect most will feel this way, despite the talent that resides here. Inaka Isha is teeming with it if one only seeks it out. 

          
 
       Helpful Making sense of Kafka`s work is difficult enough in its original form as prose, but trying to throw a theatrical spin on something as introspective as Country Doctor makes it even more confusing. The story starts with a distraught country doctor who`s horse has died the night before. His maid runs around town trying to borrow a horse so that the doctor might make his urgent appointment, but no one is willing. In frustration, the doctor kicks the door on his pigsty, and he finds a groom inside, and two horses as well. The groom prepares the horses but the doctor realizes he is after the maid, Rosa. Before the doctor can do anything, the groom sends the horses off, which basically teleports the doctor to the patient`s house, though it is supposed to be 10 miles away. This is but the beginning of the surreal ordeal that the doctor will endure. 
 
In the written story, there is a progression of the surreal. It moves from being a rather normal predicament to something vaguely inexplicable, to complete nonsense draped in metaphors and symbolism. The animation though, is trippy from the start. Strange camera angles are used, and bodies are not only out of proportion, but in constantly shifting proportions. It`s not exactly how I would have imagined Country Doctor in my head, but it provides a buffer of sorts that makes some of the more surreal events and images more tolerable, less out of place, in the already surreal looking world. The animation also sticks very close to the text, making sure to visually capture all the little described details. In the longer bits of narration, it adds some unmentioned, original imagery. 
 
In an attempt to create the same effect as the first person perspective of the story that enlightens readers on all of the doctor`s thoughts, two black, mini versions of the doctor are used to narrate. The coldness of this narration, along with a general inability of the characters to express emotions makes this film more confusing than the story, which is already painfully confusing. In the story, it explicitly states that the doctor kicks the door to his pigsty in frustration. In the animation, he just slowly walks up to the door and kicks for no apparent reason, almost as if looking inside was his intention. Similarly, lines of narration are rendered meaningless because the cynicism and bitterness of the doctor is replaced with a completely matter of fact tone. 
 
The sounds and animation bring to the foreground a haunting atmosphere that is very subtle in the original story, and I appreciate this. A discordant clang of triangles is one piece of music the film used. Though it can hardly be called music, it is certainly creepy. Even when there`s no music, the howling winds, and the creaking of the house just gives a feeling of unease. 
 
In the original story, with all the inexplicable insanity that occurs, the one grounding, sensible piece is the doctor himself; the piece that gives you hope of making sense of everything through the confounding events. As ambiguous as his character is in this film, even reading an interpretive analysis of the story will only provide a detached and unsatisfying understanding. It will be little more than animated gibberish without reading the short story first, but the eeriness that pervades the film does make it an interesting representation for those that have.

13,48,122,6.495412169198239,story with the main character transported to another world,.hack//Sign,"A young wavemaster, only known by the alias of Tsukasa, wakes up in an MMORPG called The World, with slight amnesia. He does not know what he has previously done before he woke up. In The World, the Crimson Knights suspects him of being a hacker, as he was seen accompanying a tweaked character in the form of a cat. Unable to log out from the game, he wanders around looking for answers, avoiding the knights and other players he meets along the way.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS. The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","I tried watching this anime when I was in high school, but couldn't get into it. Nearly 13 years later, I decided to give it another shot.  
 
The art style is good, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Sadly, that's all this anime has going for it. The story is alright...I do really like the premise, but how the producers carried it out onto the big screen is pretty lackluster and almost seems half-a$$ed. The dialogue was ghastly, and cheesy in most cases. There were a lot of..hiccups in the story progression that made me feel like I missed an episode somehow or that the episodes weren't consistent, and things that didn't make sense...like a character that was with the group a second ago is now elsewhere almost as if they were never in the group in the first place.  
 
And the ending was terrible. We're left with a huge cliffhanger and things left unexplained. 
 
Overall, this anime was a big disappointment.

          
 
       Helpful Well I almost don't know what to say about .hack//Sign, there was so much I loved about this show and then so much that made me want to claw out my eyes. Lets just dive into this. 
 
STORY: 
.hack//Sign takes place in a virtual reality MMORPG called ""The World"". Players in the world have different classes and play styles that they choose from and play. They all can play the game differently. We focus in on a player named Tsukasa who is trapped in The World, unable to log out. Tsukasa doesn't know why this is happening and neither does anyone else. The story progresses as Tsukasa meets other players who all become interested and worried about why Tsukasa can't login. They embark on and EPIC journey to find out the mystery behind this... they don't seem to be in any rush what so ever because they seem to like sitting around talking.... 
 
This has to be one of the WORST paced stories I have ever seen in anything ever. I get that the writers wanted to make the story and places feel real but this anime could have easily been around 14 episodes long, but it is dragged out way to much. It had such a great and interesting premise, but it just lacked any since of urgency. There were times were I could have easily just dropped the show but.... 
 
CHARACTERS: 
The characters in .hack//Sign are very very well done and flushed out. Despite the horrible pacing of the shows story I didn't drop the show because the characters are just so good. They are all very real, I've played MMORPGs before and I would have to say I have encountered basically someone who is like each and every character in .hack//Sign in a MMORPG. I found myself very attached to the characters because the way they interacted with each other felt very real. They all have their own reasons for wanting to help Tsukasa, and most of them felt very believable.  
 
SOUND: 
Yuki Kajiura... that is all. What an absolutely beautiful soundtrack! It made the moods of the show feel more passionate. It gave The World a feel of mystery, fantasy and scale. If I go on anymore I'll be rambling. I watched the English dub of the show (shut up you Elitest and Weeaboos) and I have to say I was fairly impressed. Brianne Siddall did an suburb job in portraying Tsukasa and Paul Mercier smooth fatherly voice was a perfect fit for Bear. Every time Mimiru talked I thought that Rei Ayanami was on crack LAWL (share same VA) A solid performance from all the English voice actors. Oh and I'm sure all the Japanese VA's made reading the subtitles just ""grand"" For as much talking as this show has you owe it to your eyes to watch .hack//Sign in English plus it was a good dub. 
 
ART: 
The art in .hack//Sign was kinda meh. They made the world look nice, but nothing really stood out to me as WOW THAT LOOKS AWESOME. Same thing on the animation side, since they don't move much it was hard to really judge the animation quality, but for the few times there were ""action scenes"" it looked almost out of place. Not much else to say, it works but nothing really to brag or complain about. 
 
ENDING: 
I just had to put this in don't worry there are no spoilers. The ending of .hack//Sign ranks as the all time worst ending to any anime that I have ever watched. It just sucked and offered no closure at all. The story was just building up and up and up and the it ended in kind of a ""LAWL NOPE CTRL ALT DEL"" fashion.... I don't care if it's a lead into the games THE ENDING IS PARAMOUNT!! So yea that pissed me off. Don't get me started on the filler OVAs, an anime should be able to stand on its own without having to have OVAs or movies fill in the holes. 
 
OVERALL: 
Despite my hatred for the ending and the pacing of the show .hack//Sign was actually rather enjoyable. The story does pick up in the last 6 episodes and there is enough interesting aspects of the show to consider watching it. The music is great, the voice actor spot on and it is easy to relate to the characters. I enjoyed .hack//Sign but honestly to someone who wants something fast paced and action heavy (I.e SAO people who want to see more of SAO like stuff) I would pass on .hack//Sign. It's a great watch for someone who is wanting really a character drama and for those people, you will enjoy .hack//Sign.

          
 
       Helpful This series has a lot of good ideas in it and I understand the importance the anime has, being one of the first Isekai anime before the landscape became inundated with them (looking at you SAO). But the pacing of this series is just awful. This was a decent enough story that could've been told in half the time and was stretched thin to the point where my patience was on its last legs.  
 
A lot of potential that it just didn't live up to in my opinion and I was left being utterly frustrated with the anime and my watching experience. I'll still be watching the OVAs but it's mainly because I like the ideas .Hack has and because they are far shorter.

  These series takes the chance to joke and goof around, hyperbolizing the behaviour of these said characters, or poking at their strange quirks. The gags vary in execution, but in general it's an enjoying and satisfying watch, BUT ... in order to get them you need to know some major knowledge of the games  involved  ... varying from random, often useless knowledge conceriing the game's lore or straight up jokes from the fan community, which basically means you have to be dedicated fan of either Trails in the Sky, or the Ys games, and preferrably to both, so you can safely say that show appeals to really small niche of people. In order to ease the fans of the developers, I'd like to include a list of the referenced games, which may help you figure out if you actually played a game from these series, or even better, to guide your attention to these two franchises, which are totally worth everyone's time, in my personal opinion. From Trails in the Sky - First, Second and Third Chapter, as well as Blue and Zero Kiseki, and from Ys - I and II, III (Oath in Felghana), IV (Memories in Celceta), as well as Seven. 
 
  To say that these series are not for everyone is an understatement, since this show is only aimed towards the dedicated fans of this franchise and is not really inclusive enough for non-initiated watches, who can honestly feel they're losing their time with this show, and I would get them. For the very few who actually are fans in some way, I do think you'll enjoy your time.

I&rsquo;m guessing you need some familiarity with the manga to get some idea of what&rsquo;s going on more directly, maybe such as why Gun races on motorcycles and why he obtained such skill. Gun and Hideyoshi just have your typical rivalry like Inuyasha and Kouga from that respective anime and it&rsquo;s mostly used for comic relief. Ai seems to be more of the token cute girl, and Hiro is there to help Miyuki, while Miyuki was just the token fan service girl with some descent substance.  
 
But if anything is going to stick out to you, it&rsquo;s definitely going to be the ending. I can&rsquo;t describe it, you&rsquo;re going to have to see it for yourself because it totally affected me and took me by surprise. Even though there is limited material, it does a descent job of making you care for the characters and the foundation is good enough to understand their characters and to produce development.  
 
Well, the art style does somewhat resemble some of the character designs in Initial D, but during the publication of this manga, Morikawa Jyoji, the creator of one of my favorite mangas, Hajime no Ippo, was a staff membe,r and I really see more of his style in this anime than really the Initial D style except for Gun&rsquo;s character design with the way Shigeno draws diamond eyes to make them slanted in an Asian style and he tends to draw faces at a slanted angle as well. But there are some 1980s characteristics of Gun such as the semi-big hair.  
 
The rest of the designs are really just generic and that&rsquo;s it. I mean, the way Shigeno draws his lips sometimes is not yet prevalent and I guess he hadn&rsquo;t established his style like that yet. But the way Morikawa draws the eyes and how he draws rectangular faces at times seem to be more present so I&rsquo;m guessing the way Shigeno did things during this time was a major influence in Morikawa&rsquo;s style. For the races, there&rsquo;s really no novelty environmental factors that really make any impact on the race such as gutter gripping, but what makes up for it is that risk factor I talked about in Wangan Midnight. The races are portrayed accurately with the designs of the motorcycles, the postures, the steering and everything. When you see the races in a more 3rd or 1st person perspective, you can see the road and the rest of the foreground and track zooming in on you as if you were driving yourself. Granted it&rsquo;s 1980s, I think it bring a genuine sensuality to the races.  
 
As for Suzuka, you might be able to recognize the name from the Gran Turismo games. What's cool is that it times it does give an aerial view of the course, and you'll be able to recognize it from the course maps.  
 
But back to the risk factor, there will be some wicked crashes, so if you want to see some crashes, check this out.  
 
Despite this being an unknown anime, the featured seiyuus are pretty big names. Starting with Hideyoshi&rsquo;s seiyuu, Nakao Ryuusei, the voice of Freeza from Dragon Ball Z. He does speak in Osaka dialect, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authenticity to the aggression and accent as the voice actor of Sendo does in Hajime no Ippo. But I think the voice does contemplate his small size at some capacity like how it did with Freeza. And Gun is played by Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing and Rayearth in Magic Knight Rayearth, I thought he had a good deep voice, but I thought his performance based on how he was written was of course more one dimensional and I thought he sounded too old. Next Miyuki, our pink haired cutsey fan service racer played by Toda Keiko, who is probably most famous to Gundam fans as the voice of Matilda-san from the original Gundam series. She does an excellent job as playing a more cutsey and innocent girl, but with an adrenaline edge at times.  
 
The last seiyuu I want to get into is Ai, played by Jpop sensation Oginome Yoko, who also sings the theme songs. The theme songs are very upbeat in an 1980s manner, and the singing is a little feminine but energetic. Though the music isn&rsquo;t really Eurobeat nor is it really close to the nature of the soundtrack of Initial D, the music ranges from all kinds of beats and styles whether light hearted sounds or intense guitars to set the atmosphere of a funny scene or a last mile race.  
 
Well, I found this anime interesting enough to hope that one day I can get my hands on the manga. I would like to know what parts of the manga I was reading as well so I know where I am to understand some of the foundations that are going on. Also, I would like to see one day hopefully a remake of this series because I personally like realistic anime nowadays. I enjoy the careful use of risk factors, and the interactions and relationship developments. But I personally recommend this more for people already familiar with Initial D mostly because it&rsquo;s by the same creator, so you get some understanding of what he does and why. I also recommend this to Hajime no Ippo fans mostly because of the character designs. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Gun resemble Miyata? And to conclude, if you know where you an get the manga, hook me up.

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.
The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, who, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate Red-Haired Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a amorous but chivalrous cook.

Once the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, Franky builds the Straw Hat Pirates a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
","Back at it again with another One Piece special, god I love these, and who wouldn't want expansions on the already existing adventures of the straw hat pirates? 
 
- Story (8.0/10): 
The straw hats, while sailing the new world, they stumbled across an oddly hand-shaped island known form its renowned artists of all sort of stuff, to only find out some trouble taking place there, an abusive Marine officer that forces the citizens to work for his selfish needs then gets them involved in his ambitious plans. 
While roaming the island, Luffy gets to meet this guy, a wax artist that admires the pirate life and has a collection of wax status for all sorts of great pirates that he met, and so it happens that one of them is red-haired Shanks. 
Across this special spans multiple flashbacks concerning Luffy, seeing how the special is focused on him, as well as some other character that I don't want to reveal. 
 
- Art (8.9/10): 
Stunning, not breathtaking, but at least better than decent, the art style looks so crispt and not as lazy as the anime's, the animation was fantastic, almost movie-budget. 
They weren't cheap with the vegetation where you'd mostly have them put some cheap oil-painted background, no, this was all very detailed and it's obvious how much time they production team have put into it. 
 
- Sound (8.0/10): 
I love the original soundtrack, believe me, I do, and we got a lot of it here, but the voice acting for a specific character was just a let down for me, he/she seemed so immature and childish for that voice, but because this is his/her first appearance after the time skip, they must not have put a lot of thoughts into it. 
 
- Character (8.0/10): 
As always, the straw hats are in the middle of the action, we get to see them interact more with each other, something that's rare to happen lately, the side characters were at least deserving my attention, their backstory (while not that complex) was relatable and touching. 
And lets me not forget the start of the special, that character. 
 
- Enjoyment (7.0/10): 
In term of enjoyments, I must say I've seen better specials, this one while not having so many flaws, I didn't get so invested or too interested in the mini-story told, it felt more like just another decent filler, to be honest, a well-done filler. 
 
- Overall (8.0/10): 
I wouldn't normally recommend this right off the bat, probably if you're already caught up, and been a while since you last seen the early parts of the story, this can be a good refresher to the mind. Also, the atmosphere is a lot less serious than what we have lately if you're up to some giggles, there you go.

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I wanna thank rickylrico (http://myanimelist.net/profile/rickylrico) for reviewing episode of Luffy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have created this review or watched the episode/movie in the first place. 
 
So let's begin! 
 
Story: It's great.. It's like a movie because it runs for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. It begins when Usopp announces the ""Strawhat Crew Fashion Show"", it's basically just an intro, then they get blown to an Hand Shaped Island by a huge cannon ball. The Strawhat Crew help an old man get a special doll back to his son that is currently in the Navy and they stop an ugly, evil man/woman/other/not specified from destroying the island with a huge cannon.  
 
Art: A bit of the new style, it's like One Piece Movie 10: Strong World's art if you've seen the movie. If you haven't, then you'll be surprised.  
 
Sound: Same soundtrack and amazing as usual. 
 
Character: Everyone is funny and the same as always. I'm pretty sure you get the gist of it if you've watched One Piece before. 
 
Enjoyment: You WILL definitely enjoy this movie/episode, considering you're into One Piece. 
 
Overall: It's really really good! 10/10!!! 
 
The credits are nostalgic af-! You'll see why.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story is good, but a little basic. I don't want to give spoilers, but a town is being terrorized by marines, and in the story you get two flashbacks of the first episode of One Piece. 
 
Art: The art is not as good as in the anime, it sometimes looks like the characters are flat. Also the faces look sometimes kind of weird. 
 
Sound: The sound is just as good as always, especially at the end. At the end you here a song, that all of you know, and you will get really fired up. 
 
Characters: The characters we also know from the anime are amazing. There are a few useless characters in the special. But you will love to see the progress Coby has made in the timeskip.  
 
Enjoyment: You will enjoy yourself with this anime. The most important thing in this special, are of course the flashbacks. The flashbacks are really enjoyable, because they are not the same as in the anime. You will also learn how Luffy got the scar on his cheek

And the Americans have bases on Okinawa and southern great Japan. The story takes place at Buou Academic School (武應学園塾, Buō Gakuen-juku), an academy located at the base of Mount Fuji where children of military families train to become samurai warriors. The academy is in the middle of a power struggle between Yukimura Sanada and Matabei Goto of the Toyotomi faction and the powerful student council that rules the school, and Muneakira Yagyu, the owner of the Yagyu Dojo, and the mysterious Jubei Yagyu are dragged in the middle of the conflict.
The series features the female warriors descended from the famous historical figures from Japan's Sengoku period and early Edo period. The character Charles d'Artagnan also comes from the same age in Europe.
","Samurai After it's 2 OVA's meant to be just enjoyed with good drinks and a bag of chips, If you are here you already saw Samurai Girls and Bride. Being an OVA the Ecchi went up a Notch. 
 
Story 8/10 
It's basic enough for an OVA, One episode deals with should you win a wife or should that method be used to gain a partner and a lot of saucyness happens till the cast finds out that what they were doing was not good. 
 
second OVA dealt with the marriage rabies and how princess took the wrong magical dress that was meant to get her married but got a different one by mistake, It creates a harem instead...Whoops!. 
 
Art 10/10 
As always, This Franchise it's unique on it's art and frankly any artist will look at it with either admiration or envy. 
 
Sound 8/10 
Pretty good. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
Any Ecchi fan would be more than pleased with these OVAs, Personally I enjoyed the first one more. 
 
OVERALL 9/10 
It's well rounded for an  Ecchi OVA more so than your utmost known series with OVAs for sure. This coming from an Ecchi fan that has seen all with the word Ecchi.

A two hour episode of Death Note, mainly a compilation of the confrontations between Light and L, re-edited from Ryuk's perspective with new dialogue and soundtrack along with additional animation that could not be included in the original series.  An Unnamed Shinigami comes to Ryuk to question him about his new story in the human world. 
 
2. L o Tsugu Mono (L's Successors) 
This story continues where the previous left off, continuing the story of Light. As the previous special told Light and L's battles, this story does the same with the conflicts between Light, Mello, and Near.   
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the ""Death Note"", a mysterious black notebook that can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""shinigami"" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him ""Kira"" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word ""killer""). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that ""Kira"" could have family ties with members of the ""Kira"" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.
Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture.
Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as ""boring"" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.
","Those two movie long ""episodes"", the anime Death Note is shown us once again. Death Note is one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. 
 
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind. This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. 
10/10 
 
Characters: Light and L are two of the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development sometimes lacks. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, Light changes barely from the beginning of the series. This bit change can be seen in various other characters as well, although a bit more notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting. 
8/10 
 
Sound: Yet another amazing aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. Sometimes overused, it still is on a very good level. 
8/10  
 
Art/Animation: Again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the scenery are all done amazingly well. Seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well.  
8/10 
 
Overall: I was watching the series as one of the first anime, and those weeks are still great and heavy in my memories. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would think and do in the world. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
 
----------- 
 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
 
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
 
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
 
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
 
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
 
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
 
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
 
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.  
 
Rating: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful okay.. death note rewrite. 
part 1: Visions of a God 
from what i gathered from its title, i thought it'd be something different but it was not (see synopsis) but nonetheless, it was nice. i kind of regarded it as an overview of DN. i was kind of interested only because of the new character but there wasn't any development either. the story stops right after L and Watari died. 
 
it's pretty much the same DN, only compressed. which leaves us now to just one question: should you watch it? uhmm... let's just say you wanted to rewatch DN.. then i'd rather watch the rewrite. other than for that reason, i think you'd find yourself disappointed like i was. 
 
oh, but wait! i think there is a part there that you souldn't dare miss! hahahaha. yeah. another face-writhing reaction from Kira. other than that..no more :) 
 
part 2: L's successors: 
the second part is definitely better than the first..or so say. haha. i have a personal bias for L. if you like L, you'll like the second part.. or not; he does the narration for the first ten minutes. i watched it english dubbed, and it still is good. 
 
it's the continuation of the first part, nothing changed except for a slight flashback at wammy house. i was expecting more of near's and mello's perspective but there wasn't enough. i think this version was easier to understand compared to the original. 
 
my review doesn't justify for my rating, doesn't it? that's just me. haha.

After a brief clash with one of the attackers, the distraught Hitsugaya pursues the escaping thieves, leaving behind Matsumoto and the disoriented squad. Following the incident, the Seireitei brands Hitsugaya a traitor for abandoning his post and puts Squad 10 on indefinite lockdown.

Soon learning of the situation, Ichigo, Rukia Kuchiki, Renji Abarai, and Matsumoto set off to prove Hitsugaya's innocence and uncover the truth behind the theft of the Ouin. Meanwhile, a ghost from Hitsugaya's past haunts his thoughts as he chases down the true culprit. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","Soul Reapers of the 10th Division—led by its captain Tōshirō Hitsugaya and vice-captain Rangiku Matsumoto—are sent to escort the ""King's Seal"". The rare artifact is stolen during transport by the deviated Soul Reaper Sōjirō Kusaka and two girls known as Ying and Yang. Hitsugaya seems to recognize the Soul Reaper, who wounds him and leaves, and abandons his post to pursue the man while leaving his squad behind to fend for themselves. Later, Soul Society suspects Hitsugaya of treason, orders his immediate capture, and puts his whole squad under house arrest.
In the human world, Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki is informed about the events happening in the Soul Society, and finds Hitsugaya, who passes out. Hitsugaya wakes up in Ichigo's house, and they are attacked by Ying and Yang. Ichigo fights, while Hitsugaya escapes and continues to avoid an attempt of capture by Soul Society. The suspect on him increases when Kusaka attacks a Soul Society's captain using Hyōrinmaru, a zanpakutō—special swords used by Soul Reapers—with identical powers to Hitsugaya's. Hitsugaya's capture is then made top priority and his execution is approved.
Through his wandering to avoid capture, Hitsugaya eventually manages to track Kusaka down, and it is revealed that the two managed to manifest the same zanpakutō. Because Soul Society does not allow the same zanpakutō to be wielded by different people, the two were forced to fight to the death. Hitsugaya did not wish to fight, but had no other option as Kusaka attacked, claiming that he was the only one worthy of Hyōrinmaru. The authorities concluded that Hitsugaya was the true owner of Hyōrinmaru and carried out Kusaka's execution. Kusaka died and was reborn as a Hollow in their world, Hueco Mundo. Once he learned of the King's Seal and its powers—which allows the user to freely manipulate time, space and matter—he started his plan of revenge against Soul Society.
Using the King's Seal, Kusaka teleports Hitsugaya and himself to Soul Society, needing Hitsugaya's power to break the seal. The Soul Reapers find and attack Hitsugaya and Kusaka, but are thrown back when Ichigo intervene. As Hitsugaya refuses, Kusaka breaks the seal himself, after which he transforms into a giant dragon-like creature made of ice. However, because he lacks the control which Hitsugaya possesses, the power goes berserk and threatens to destroy Soul Society. A hoard of Hollows appears out of Kusaka's castle, which he had generated out of the Kings' Seal. While several Soul Reapers face the Hollows, Ichigo and Hitsugaya storm up to the central tower. After they destroy Kusaka's dragon-like form, Hitsugaya impales Kusaka. Hitsugaya is cleared of all charges and the King's Seal is restored. After the credits, he and Rangiku visit Kusaka's grave.
","Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion is definitely worth watching.   
 
The plot of the movie is very good and it focuses on a character that is obviously very popular but never gets any screen time, A.K.A Toshiro Hitsugaya. The movie also has some very memorable fights and most of the worth mentioning soul reapers are in it and they have lines of some sort. 
 
The art in this movie, if anything, is better than that in the anime.  There are a lot of details and you can tell you're watching a movie and not just a very long anime episode.  The only real problem is that it gets a bit blurry during fights 
 
The sound is the same, if not slightly better, lots of actiony things happening and the sounds suit the scenes.   
 
The characters in the movie are very well developed and all characters introduced early on have a relatively prominent role in the movie and are not just there to fill up the scene.  And also, as I said before, a lot of worth mentioning soul reapers are in it.   
 
I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  The art was done really well and I liked the way that it focused more on Toshiro than Ichigo for once, because I'm pretty sure everyone gets sick of seeing Ichigo from time to time.   
 
Overall the movie isn't perfect but it is a very, very, very good movie and definitely worth your time.

First off, as a quick and painless summary, I must say that this movie does not  in any way measure up to the quality of the first. By the end, I can honestly say I was bored. View a breakdown of the various subsections below. 
 
The plot was not overly interesting. I, being a rather strict advocate of manga canon, was not overly enthused by &quot;One zanpakutou, two owners&quot; idea. In the movie's defense, however, I appreciated their portrayal of the Central 46 as strict and unwavering in their ideology. There were plot holes, as well as various cliched themes which recur commonly in anime, which would not have required that much effort or good writing to fix. 
Ichigo going to Soul Society to fix all their problems for them is a theme which has been much overdone by this point, and frankly, is no longer interesting.    
 
The animation was very underdone. At several points during it I found myself saying aloud, &quot;Is this not a movie?&quot; Let alone other animes, Bleach itself has had better animation during certain episodes. A large portion of the movie had standard &quot;Bleach filler&quot; animation quality. Even the more high budget scenes could have been better.  
 
Why does Yoruichi pop into Soul Society whenever she feels like it? 
Character stereotypes were whored to the point of being annoying. Yamamoto was a thick-headed idiot until the truth had clearly come to light. Soi Fon was still a Yoruichi fan girl who seemed to enjoy ripping off her robes every time something provoked her slightly. Hitsugaya was cold and unfriendly. Ichigo yelling at people solved all their problems once again. Ikkaku would NOT use bankai in that situation. And of course, the enemy is ridiculously powerful by some unknown means or by very little effort.  
 
I did not particularly enjoy this movie. Compared to Memories of Nobody, I would consider it a near write-off. Memories of Nobody had a solid story, a worthy enemy, and emotional connection, all of which were simply absent in DiamondDust Rebellion.  
 
Fade to Black, I shall hope you don't disappoint me.  

          
 
       Helpful The second Bleach movie! Will it be better than the rather dreadful first one? Which had romance down to a T &amp; nothing else.  
 
... 
 
Nope. 
 
Seems not.  
 
Story? The little bit of story that there is, is confusing as possible. Mainly because some things just make no sense at all. I can't tell you what those things are, for they are spoilers. But trust me, it does the fantastic Bleach fashion of raising random things &amp; never explaining, just pushes them to the back of the pile. Hell a guy has a fox head for fucks sake.  
 
Art = Terrible. Why has everyone been drawn either cod eyed, boss eyed or cross eyed? And why do some of the fights look like they were done in flash? This is meant to be a bleach movie, it looks like something made by fans. (If it was, good work). 
 
Well Bleach has a great music &amp; cast anyway, so you can expect good things from the sound. However some of the writing &amp; lines these people had to say were so cheesy it looked like they stole some of the material from the He-Man cartoon (original one).  
 
The characters are good in Bleach. All your favourites are here &amp; a few new characters. None of the new ones should really WOW but they certainly aren't bad, passable.  
 
The fights are what Bleach is all about right? The fights are crazy, fast-paced &amp; intense. Yup, they are thrill rides in a way only Bleach can do, brilliant. Plus it's nice to see some of the lesser characters getting a few moments, such as Hisagi &amp; his kido &amp; Ikkaku &amp; his bankai. Even if it's really out of character him doing that in front of anyone other than Yumi.  
 
Don't watch this film for the story, or the new characters. But this film is totally worth it for the fights. And the fights are what Bleach is all about.  
 
Even if the assault on the castle looks like a final level from DMC (enemies &amp; all)...

The story is about the confrontation between several galactic powers. Among them there is the Omega Confederation (of which Earth is a member), the military Republic of Cassiopeia (led by General The Pest) and a powerful supercomputer which controls an army of robots. A group of super powerful creatures called the Humanoids later appear in the series.
The show follows the adventures of space police members Pierrot and Mercedes (aka Psi). Pierrot is the son of Colonel Pierre and President Pierrette. The series has a more egalitarian message than its predecessor as the supreme leader of the good guys is a female President and Psi is a co-protagonist. The previous series instead focused on male protagonists.
The scenarios of several episodes adapt elements of Greek mythology, other mythologies, and European legends. Among them are the Apple of Discord, Atlantis, David and Goliath, the Olympian Gods, and Prometheus. Other episodes deal with the existence of God, the relationship of man with modernity and machines, the limits of technology, comparisons between armed peace under the rule of a dictator and the difficulty of maintaining order in a democracy, higher spiritual beings encountered at the beginning and the end of the series etc. Some planets visited by the characters are replicas of the Earth at a specific era in its history, thus allowing some didactic interludes over the nature of these eras.
The series contains little to no violence, the heroes mostly use non-lethal stun weapons in combat. The exception is the use of disintegrating laser beams against wild animals.
The Earth does not play a central role in this series. The capital of the Confederation is on the planet Omega, far from Earth. The Confederation consists of multiple allied powers: Aldebaran, Auriga, Cassiopeia, Hydra, Scorpio, and Vega. The Confederation has a democratically elected government and a President.

Once upon a time... there were men. They explored the world, science, their own body. A very long time later, they were exploring space. The heros of our story witnessed other beings on different levels of technical and ideological progress to finally meet the witnesses of themselves. 
 
This is a review about 「銀河パトロールＰＪ」, also known as ""Once upon a time... space"", ""Il était une fois... l'Espace"", ""Ai confini dell'universo"" or ""Es war einmal... der Weltraum"". I have watched the German version and I highly recommend NOT to watch the english one. (These series live of things told between the lines. The english version just leaves many information out.) As you might know, this series was co-produced by a japanese and several european companies, the producer is french. Thus the art is not comparable to that standart anime, but has a very own style, kept throughout the other six series by Albert Barillé. 
 
The style of how the story is told varies a lot between episodes. At the beginning, the episodes seem not to have any relations, but in progress, most things piece together. 
Aside the main charakters Psi, Pierrot and Métro, there are several side charakters of which some are very flat und undistinguishable. 
Albert Barillé is mostly known for writing educational stories, so it seems odd, he chose the science-fiction setting. And although there are many episodes containing lessons about humanitiy, physics or history, it does never get to much. 
The fantastic music creates the perfect atmosphere; With two Mecha battles and several space battles, extrasensory powers and many odd aliens, Barillé's journey into the future can be called a success. 
 
All those speaking German really have to watch this, it's great! 
 
All those only speaking english should ignore the show and watch ""The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" (Live action TV series) or ""The Animals of Farthing Wood"" (ファージングウッドのなかまたち) or something else. I'm sorry for you.

","Gundam Age is not very well-received by the Gundam fanbase.  Nobody even cares to remember it. I dropped it early on and never put it on my list. That said, this Gundam entry is not without its good points. The animation is consistently good and it definitely tried to be different. Unfortunately, the execution is not good enough.  
 
This OVA, on the other hand, solves a lot of the original's problems. As a retelling of the Asemu arc, widely considered the best part of Age, it is actually pretty well-written. Two main characters' friendship and rivalry is engaging to watch. The characters are more Shounen-esque than the typical Gundam, but it's not a bad thing. Top-notch animation quality and great directing provide some of the best mecha action I've ever seen. The story, unlike most Gundam, never drags on. 
 
Unfortunately, most of the necessary background information was explained in the original anime, so you need to either watch that or read the wiki. With a runtime of only two and a half hours, this OVA is extremely focused.  It tell the story extremely well, but much information is left out. Thankfully, if you have watch enough Gundam and mecha, you can understand most of it with minimal explaination. 
 
Overally, I enjoyed this OVA a lot. Watching this anime,  I believe that a three-movie remake can turn Gundam Age into one of the best mecha anime of all time. Shame Gundam Age flopped hard, so we are left with an incomplete retelling. If you are a fan of Gundam Age (all 5 of them!), or have somehow watched all of Age despite hating it, this a must watch. For others, it a good way to waste 2 hours.

The story in season 2 started with a fresh opening but didn't live up to one's expectations. It had got many cliches you can see in other anime, and a lot of themes had already been done in season one too.  
 
This series depicted more on character's relationships. It became a drag and annoying when it failed to get across what the main character was actually thinking and deliberately went to the extreme at some points.  
 
However, if you are looking for romance and drama, it might just be your cup of tea. 


          
 
       Helpful One could write about how this is just a continuation of original series and has continues with the same format of ""adventure of the day"".  For the first half, yeah, you can say that.  Then something happened for the second half, they actually wrote a multi-episodic story with some major character development.  Thus I will focus on that part. 
 
Like I said earlier, the first half was the standard, but the second half was very good.  It all starts with Natsumi getting an invitation to join a police special forces group.  This made all the her co-workers/friends, esp. Miyuki really question how each other are part of this group.  Even Ken started having doubts about himself because of a situation with Miyuki.  Even the ending strengthens the characters with each other. 
 
I do enjoy this series because they characters are adults instead of being there as comic relief for junior high/high school students.  We adults have problems also. 
 
So to break it down: 
Story - 8:  I had to give it an 8.  The average of the first half and second half. 
Art - 7: This will never be as good as the details from the OVAs of the first season.  The artwork did take a hit.  I wish more time was given to make the characters and scenes look better at times. 
Sound - 7:  Felt overpowered by the background sound.  I do miss the sounds of the motors that Fujishima puts into his creations. 
Characters - 9:  All were great!  We got to see more of everyone, including the rookie Saori and Nakajima's dad and step-mom. 
Enjoyment - 9: Of course.  Just seeing an adult cast in a slice-of-life series was worth it. 
Overall - 8: It had it's weaknesses and strengths.  You will enjoy this a bit more if you enjoyed season 1.

And conclude everything it does, till it has engulfed all of humanity's future in a brilliant blue tint of regal oppression, covered over with a sweet, crooning romance. 
 
Let me get two things out of the way, so you can walk away if you feel offended: 
1) I believe the Abh are the real villains of the show, and there's actually a genuine reason the people hate them so much: these people are blindly self-justified aggressors at heart. 
2) Worse still - the show is actually aware of this, and deliberately distorts the picture to make Abh-haters come off as terrible or pathetic human beings. In this regard, this show is shameful on a level that no other anime I know could possibly match. 
 
Given the above points, there's actually a good reason I decided to pursue the sequels after witnessing the moral horror that was Crest of the Stars. The thing is, I happened to catch a glimpse of the end-credits of this show, and they seemed to paint an entirely different kind of picture - it seemed to end on a tragic and poignant note that finally seemed to acknowledge that the Abh and their ways weren't so noble or beneficial after all, and that people were suffering because of it. This one admission would have given the show's developments an entirely different meaning, and redeemed the entire franchise completely. That was what made this show seem so promising. This is also the reason I even bothered with Banner I, because it seemed to build up to this deconstructive conclusion (however, I skipped Banner II as just reading the synopsis made me want to throw up). Long story short, it proved to be an extremely misleading picture, yet again. 
 
A brief introduction - the show starts in the aftermath of yet another battle between the Abh Empire and United Mankind (the humans aligned against Abh expansionism). Our protagonist Lin Jinto seems to have suffered some injuries from the war and wants to take a break from the fighting. Our other lead, Lafiel the Abh (also Jinto's girlfriend by this time), decides to join him. Jinto is an ordinary human appointed as head of his conquered homeworld by the Abh overlords due to hereditary circumstances, and Lafiel is a member of the Abh royalty, one of many individuals directly in line for succession of the throne. Jinto's homeworld Martine is vying for independence from Abh rule, and at the heart of this movement is Teal Clint, incidentally a close confidante of Jinto's now-deceased family. This is the backdrop in which this roughly hour-long OVA begins. 
 
For much of this brief show, Jinto revisits old places and old acquaintances. Everywhere he goes, his well-wishers try to stuff some sense into him, to no avail. Jinto is convinced that what he is doing is for the best. The show also reveals the final clincher about the Abh that should leave no doubt in anyone's mind about just how sinister the whole setup had been all along. And in the face of all this, the show puts up a loving, smiling face - as though it just treated you to the most wonderful developments ever. 
 
Now, I've reviewed the first two installments without having to drop any spoilers, but here it's simply impossible to criticise the show without getting into plot specifics, because not only is it here that it indulges in its worst ever dishonesty, but it's actually far worse than the previous installments, and stoops to a level so low that it needs to be explicitly pointed out to be appreciated. With that in mind: 
 
----SPOILERS FOLLOW---- 
First he meets his old childhood friend Que Durin (the sole friend who saw him off to Abh country in the first series, if you recall), offering him a post where he can assist Jinto with various administrative matters. When they meet at his place to sort out the details, Durin confesses his reason to distrust the Abh in what is a stakes-changing shocker of a revelation  - to eliminate the possiblity of revolt or in-fighting, the Abh are genetically hard-wired never to be able to turn on their superiors, and despite any possible grudges or resentment find it practically impossible to disobey orders (the phrase ""I was only following orders!"" gets taken to a whole new level of creepy...). Jinto himself reveals the final piece of this puzzle - which is that by mandate of Imperial Law, any ethnic Terran (i.e. ordinary human) members of the Abh nobility are only allowed to conceive genetically-modified children who would be physically full-fledged Abh - blue hair, body implants and all. The picture that emerges is a system where everyone born into nobility (and therefore important positions of power) are blue-chipped humanoids who have more in common with a random Abh than with their own parent, and effectively no free will....this is even worse than I could have ever imagined. I'm simply at a loss for words here. And it's no coincidence that this vital piece of information was withheld until the very end of this franchise. But the even more horrifying part is that the show makes his apprehensions out to be ultimately unfounded, and that it's precisely these qualities that actually make the Abh GREAT. Give that a minute to sink in. 
 
In the middle of all this, there is an even more crucial development. Jinto's home planet Martine has been vying for independence from Abh rule (and the show has the bloody audacity to refer to the Independence party as the ""Feudal government""). The Abh retailate by destroying their planetary defenses under the pretext of a drill-exercise goof-up due to miscommunications. And then - here's the singular worst part - the blame is shifted on the Independence party for forcing the Abh's hand, and they are accused of ""coercing the dissenters into submission"" by activating the defense system and thereby forcing everyone to get on board with the independence movement because there's ""no turning back now"". ""No civilised person with a decent undertsanding of the galaxy would do this - these are the ignorant actions of an isolated Lander"" is how an Abh conveniently puts it. The show tries to suggest that only ignorant and misguided individuals would want to try and seek independence from a forcefully-occupying power that they never wanted any part of in the first place. It also implicitly suggests the most singularly bald-faced lie ever, which is that the majority of the population would NOT want independence from such an invading/occupying force, because of which one would have to resort to such underhanded measures to get the population on board...I can no longer help myself here, I just need to vent out that this is singularly the most shameful, two-faced and obscene notion that this show has so far hurled at me. 
 
Anyways, things being what they are, Jinto decides to do damage control and visit Teal Clint - who is the acting Prime Minister at the helm of the independence movement. A decent man, an honourable man, someone with spine to stand up to the Abh. Someone who saved Jinto's hyde (sorry about the pun) when his very life was at risk. Jinto ought to be grateful to this guy. And also to his wife Lena who doted on him as a child and went just as much out of her way to make sure he was safe. Instead, he has chosen to side himself against the very people who saved his life (whereas the show makes it out that it's the Abh whom he owes his loyalties to). But the two don't care about any of that right now, they just want to see their boy again - such is the love they have for him. The most heart-wrenching part for me was when Jinto replies that he has responsibilities now, to which Lena tearfully retorts, ""Responsibilities as an Abh? As an Invader?"" She speaks for all decent individuals with that line. Anyhow, Jinto agrees to visit, and they are tearfully overjoyed to see him alive and well - and desperate, Clint suggests what I personally had been practically yelling all along (in my review of Banner of the Stars I, if you recall) - give up the Abh title and return home clean by seeking political asylum. The Martinian people would have understood - the title was forced upon him when he was too young to consent, and he was personally not guilty of any wrongdoing at the time.  
 
But it is here that the show gives its singularly most insincere pretext in the entire series so far for Jinto to side with the Abh hegemony, and moreover for Clint to give up on independence - if Jinto steps down, any other person appointed in his place will ""not be so generous"", and so a war might break out, putting Martine's very existence at stake. I might even have agreed with that stand (on a strictly short-term and tactical basis, mind you) if Jinto was portrayed as being CRITICAL of the Abh at heart but just playing along so that his homeland can have a future, but it's abundantly clear that he has been completely bought into the Abh way, and is very much in line with their program (there is a telling scene right before that meeting where Lafiel tells him, ""This is Your battleground""...). This is where I think that the rationale is deeply insincere and two-faced - it seeks to present Jinto as a neutral and unbiased player in the game when in fact he is anything but, and thus give more credibility to that line of argument. And in any case, just by taking such a stand, Jinto has all but explicitly incriminated the Abh to be coercive thugs ruling with a velvet glove covering an iron fist. But does the show even acknowledge this? Nope. It diverts your attention to how Jinto feels sad at no longer being allowed to return to the forests and the beautiful landscapes of his homeworld, but it pales in comparison to the peerless, radiant beauty...of Lafiel. ""Life's too short to live in depression and regret"", the show croons. How sweet, how romantic....someone please kill me right now, I can't take any more of this. And as if in answer to my prayers, the show ends, right there. 
 
----SPOILERS END----- 
 
Ultimately, the show actually voices legitimate criticisms of its own premise through these two associates of Jinto, but then covers over them with the most shamefully insincere rationalisations. The blame is shifted on those who refuse to go along with the Abh hegemony, as always. Even at best, the scenario is portrayed as an unfortunate or unavoidable outcome of unfavourable circumstances when in fact the Abh are completely to blame for what has happened. And all of this is glossed over very expediently, and the focus very quickly shifts to some other issue before you realize anything is amiss - and in this department, Banner III operates far more slickly than its predecessors. Come to think of it, the only reason for this made-on-the-quick OVA to exist seems to have been to coyly deflect the most threatening of legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against the show's basic premise. 
 
So...back to Earth - Banner of the Stars III does end on a tragic note, all right. It is the tragic end to all human freedom, not just Jinto's privilege to visit the planet that he unilaterally lords over. But who cares, because he is ensconced in the sweet and caring arms of the most beautiful, wonderful Abh princess, for the rest of his boot-kissing life. And the Abh will take over all planets (because that is their ""destiny"", and one they themselves daren't question) and thus finally bring about lasting peace to all of mankind. The End. Seriously, am I the only one here who needs to throw up? 
 
Anyhow, it's getting late now - here's my final verdict on the entire Stars franchise: the Stars aka Seikai series isn't Love in the Time of Cholera - it might as well be called Love Cholera. Fans of good Space Opera ought to look elsewhere - the appearance of intriguing political complexity  was an elaborate facade to intellectually overwhelm more casual viewers into passively accepting something they would otherwise have puked at. Fans of good romance ought to look elsewhere - all the coy romance between the two leads takes place whenever the show needs to blindside you to the utter and complete hypocrisy of their interactions with the outside world.  
 
Heck, fans of good Sci-fi should look elsewhere, because what actually seemed like a genuinely intriguing and promising sci-fi concept about (seemingly) progressive-minded genetically-modified space-faring humans, turned out to be so creepily monstrous and subversive that it makes even the most depraved eugenic ideologies of the past seem tame by comparison. If you look at it closely, its premise is actually closer to those presented in classic dystopic literature - except here it's presented as something wonderful rather than horrible. Its status as something of a ""classic"" among old-school anime circles is, IMO, an unfortunate case of people being taken in by its serenely operatic atmosphere and its fairly engaging and believable character dynamics, and failing to see that it's all in the service of some especially sick and reprehensible ideas. The people who made this show ought to hang their heads in shame. Seriously.

          
 
       Helpful Banner of the Stars III OVA is easily the best of the entire series. It comes full circle back to the planet Martine, where Jinto was born. He is returning to govern the planet but Martine wants independance, not to mention that half of their population hates the Abh. Banner III is about this conflict, as well as Jinto's relationship with Lafiel who has taken a leave of absence to be with him. 
 
I cannot reveal too much more about the series without giving spoilers but the character development in this 2 episode OVA is outstanding. Every character has grown up and changed, even Diaho the cat. The plot is tight and the pacing is just right.  
 
The ending is outstanding. Many loose ends are tied up but there is always room for further sequels in this universe. This is how a good franchise should end, if it is indeed the end. With people wanting more, but not really needing more because it is a &quot;satisfying&quot; ending. 
 
If future ones are as good as Banner of the Stars III then I hope they make a 4th, 5th and 6th series.

","Ok so im reviewing a hentai here. 
Id like to point out that there are two version of this that I have seen. 
One is the edited UK DVD version and the other is one I downloaded. 
So id say download it, but why would I be recommending a hentai anime? 
Why would i be reviewing one? 
WELL HOLD ON!!! 
Ill get to that later 
The plot is the usual pap. 
While some kind of government mission far from civilization, the all-female crew of the spaceship Muze finds what looks like a deserted ship, named the Zogne, drifting in space. They in true Sci-fi style go round to have a look  and stumble across numerous dead bodies as well as a single survivor  Flair, an innocuous-looking girl, who is diagnosed with amnesia after being found in a sleep chamber. The crew bring the girl back to the Muze and treat her (but not in a sexual way). Computer expert Hikari begins attempting to decrypt the computer records of the Zogne to find out what happened to its crew. then some kind of alien shows up and starts on with what a alien dose in a anime like this. (Tip there's no ET crap here even though there are a few fingers involved). 
Well since its a hentai with no blokes to be seen (well apart from a poster in the background) your eyes are on all the totty on display. 
Theres all the usual ones A buff one, a slutty one, a younger one, two lesbians (that have a ""meting"" to discuss things) and the female lead and her sister. 
None of them stand out as far as designs go. 
""Action"" wise its aright. Nothing new there. It trys to be really good, but most of us have seen it before. 
 
One sentence summary 
Alien meets Star whores meets hentai 
 
Who is it for?

Nar its a hentai so its for those that like hentai that has no school girls.

13,24909,136,6.268977836253544,story with the main character transported to another world,Kaitou Joker,"In the story, there is nothing in the world that the mysterious phantom thief Joker cannot steal. He goes after one treasure after another in unpredictable capers with seemingly miraculous tricks. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Shounen']",none,"This review is based on the fact that I have not watched the other series, so I cannot compare the two. This review is just for the show itself, and nothing else. 
 
This anime is fairly recent and there is only four episodes at the time of this review. I can say that I haven't enjoyed an anime as much as I did watching Kaitou Joker.  
 
In the pros, the characters are all amazing. The creators made a good decision by not making any of the characters really perfect. The show's protagonist (or however you want to consider him), Phantom Thief Joker, makes miracles out of thin air. But he also has flaws. He is also hot headed, sometimes denies his shortcomings and can't come to terms with his rival. 
 
Another thing is that all of the characters are memorable. Phantom Thief Joker and Spade probably have the best design in the entire show, but the supporting characters also get some love. Like for example, Detective Oniyama is over the top and has a burning passion to capture Joker. Mister Kaneari is a self-absorbed snob. Spade is what you would probably call a gentleman of sorts. Hashi, Joker's sidekick, just wants to help.  
 
This is not a perfect anime, mind you. While there are only currently four episodes, it would be understandable that some things wouldn't be explained. But there are some mentions of groups or organizations that we are not completely aware of. There is also the problem that sometimes, the characters could get a little annoying to listen to. This was meant for a younger audiences, and you will probably hear some catchphrases being thrown around here and there, which depending on your view, could be tiresome. 
 
But don't let those cons ruin the show for you. This is not a show you can take extremely seriously. It is a fun, humorous show that lives in its own little world, and it executes its characters very well. Sure, sometimes there will be some annoying parts, but that shouldn't deter your experience with it. 
 
Give it a shot, and you might be surprised with what you have.

          
 
       Helpful Honestly, I freaking love this. Although others compare it to Magic kaito, it isn't the freaking same! Just because both are phantom thieves doesn't make them copy cat one another..  
Kaitou joker is a thrilling, comedic relief, adventurous anime that will set you on your toes to cheer for Joker. Although this anime may not seem ideal for those who are looking for a more ""mature and serious"" atmosphere, the anime does have its serious moments. Joker is a magician who has a lot of tricks up his sleeve, from balloon gums to flashing cards and joker's funny disguises, there are even times where he runs out of items to showcase his tricks.. Joker with his sidekick Hachi they embark on adventures to steal the finest artworks..and treasures, in the while they find old friends and defeat the rich who are up to no good.  
 
The art is adorable and very animated. Not stiff.  I quite like the art style. Sometimes there may be a mistake (joker going out in disguise in public) or missing a mark, but rarely do they appear and because of all the things going on it's easy to overlook it.  
 
Sound. Can I just say how much I love the opening? I sing to it. It's very catchy and makes you want to dance. Also there are a couple seasons so you can check up on those too. 
I love jokers voice acting as well. As well as the other characters Hachi, Spade, and Queen. Their voices match up to their character. 
 
Characters: the characters each have their own story to them and it is interesting. Joker, queen and Spade are childhood friends who share their story of becoming phantom thieves. They often appear as well, but they are no companions most of the time. Because Hachi is the main sidekick. The villains are your typical rich guys-but since it's a gag, they are more comedic. 
 
Overall, I really liked this. And I watched all the seasons which I recommend you do if you are taking up this anime because it makes it EVEN better.  
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This review kind of includes SPOILERS. 
 
Kaitou Joker is a good anime in my opinion but why I'm rating this a 6 is the story doesn't make sense in season 1&2 and about 3/4 of the series is a filler episode.  
 
Also Joker freakin is a time traveler, although they don't mention he's a time traveler but in the whole series about 1/4 of the tricks aren't even tricks and just prediction/already knowing whats happening. Just watch episode 52 on crunchyroll and you'll know what I'm talking about. 
 
I've got the manga of Kaitou joker and the story and tricks are sooo BAD the tricks are so predictable and has even less meaning. at the start it was really bad. At about volume 8 they revealed the main villain of the story line but how it introduced it was really bad so I didn't realize it was a villian. Near the end of the Manga the whole series got better I rate the Manga a 5 or 4. 
 
At the end it's and ok series.

13,5802,137,6.267533096254793,story with the main character transported to another world,Fantascope: Tylostoma,"A man who appears every 700 years. 
Streaching before the man's eyes the world rusted away to monochrome and gray. 
Once before the town flourished that is now in ruins. 
The man now, has a chance meeting with a person, a prositute. 
A story of passion curling like smoke....Tairosu Tomah's story has begun. 
 
(Source: Animenfo)","['Fantasy', 'Supernatural']",none,"If you've heard of Yoshitaka Amano or if you've seen some of his artwork elsewhere (and you likely have), you probably have an idea that Fantascope Tylostoma invites you to an artsy, experimental, uncommon viewing.  
 
Particularly in an age where fluid movement and colorful palettes are some of the main characteristics of a praised or popular show, we are just not used to an anime that is visually told the way Fantascope Tylostoma is: highly stylized monochrome paintings accompanied by narration. I don't think a modern viewer can be entirely blamed for finding something like this OVA ""boring"" or just ""weird"". To some, that will be the nail on the coffin. But others might be willing to give it a try, and embrace this unusual journey. 
 
This story uses the narrative device of ""Story within a story"". The narrator tells us the myth of the immortal Man who appears every 700 years, and the mysterious Man tells a joyful prostitute he meets his own story of how he came to be that way. There is some interesting playing of this device, but I will not spoil it for you. The meaning of the title is the first thing explained, and is a thread all too interesting to follow; I was immediately intrigued and this feeling remained for the entirety of the episode. As perhaps it's expected from an experimental movie so tied to its visuals, not every character action and not every thought is clear. The narration functions as a fine anchor and although its presence is a tad excessive sometimes, its existence is thoroughly justified: Fantascope feels very much like a tale, told verbally to you by someone else.  
 
As for the characters. As I want this to be a spoiler-free review, I'll try being brief about this point. The (few) characters are appropriate for the setting they're in, and I think they're well-done for such a short story. The Man is a jaded and taciturn person, but he also doesn't shy away from telling his story, and to share his past actions (not all sympathetic, by the way). It would've been easy to have him be a distant, alien-like voyager, and I thought interesting that he's a more approachable protagonist and generous narrator than one might think. The prostitute who takes an interest in The Man is a charming character, and has some great lines of dialogue and an interesting form of enunciation that I talk more about below. The Goddess in the Cave is what you expect from a divine character: uncanny, passionate, and hard to fully grasp.  
 
There isn't much in the way of character development, not only because of the running time, but also due to the very nature of this being a ""legend"" of sorts; in those, the tale and setting tend to override the characters and their psychological aspect. 
 
The art is an imperative aspect of Fantascope, and any other artist would make of this an entirely different thing. Liking an art style or not is of course subjective, but Yoshitaka Amano's flowy lines and his ghostly, otherworldly characters so perfectly fit the post-apocalyptic and wavering gray setting, that it's hard to dispute its efficiency in introducing us to this world and the characters in it. The subtle movement of hair and water in static scenes was one of my favorite details to catch while watching the episode. 
 
Another interesting point that I mentioned by passing above is the voice acting. I do not know if this was an artistic choice or a matter of budget, but the characters' voices in this OVA don't seem to come from trained or experienced voice actors; they feel bare, like real people talking. It's something I've seen used in ""down to earth"" anime movies (the adult segments of Ghibli's Only Yesterday come to mind), but in fantasy is rarer. It's a positive stand-out in my opinion, and it adds to the aura of mystery and unorthodoxy.  
 
Honestly, I too was expecting no more than 30 mins of an out-of-my-comfort-zone experience, and was ready for a healthy amount of boredom, but Fantascope was actually quite enthralling  to me. I'm not sure if it's a gem of storytelling or a must-watch for obscure OVA's. It's a fairly simple story (with its layers of complexity being open for interpretation), but it competently sets its atmosphere and aesthetic and maintains it firmly to the end. It'll probably give you, at least, an interesting half hour of entertainment.

Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least. 
 
This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter. If you watch this, you won't be disappointed pyo~

A group of adventurers are led by Irmina to Diaros, where they become acquainted with its past and future.
13 Million Years Ago, on Diaros, the High Civilization of the Mora Clan flourished thanks to the Noah Stone. However, other groups seeking the stone began persecuting the Mora Clan, and they were forced to relinquish control of the Noah Stone. 
In the Present Age, there are three powers present in Diaros: Elgadin, country of the Dragon Knights who value law and order; Bisque, a country where according to the Lal Fac Faith, various clans are given the autonomy to regulate themselves; and Sasool, a country where therianthropy plays a leading role. These countries vie for control of the Noah Stone.
Ten years into the future, due to the ensuing events, war has erupted, the Age of Darkness predicted by Irmina. The war is the result of secret manoeuvers by the Mora Clan's Igo, who has put various strategies in action to take possession of the Noah Stone.
The game also takes place in the Future Age, 3,000 years after the rule of Igo, and the Chaos Age, at the beginning of everything, 45 Million Years Ago. Players pass from one age to another, addressing a variety of obstacles, attempting to prevent the coming Age of Darkness.
","Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best: 
 
Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll... 
 
Master of Epic does quite well in the humor department. Although it is based on one particular MMORPG, it does a very good job of satirizing many of the small idiosyncrasies common to most RPG's. Some examples include going AFK, being resurrected from death, random monster spawn, combat and non-combat skills etc etc. It has some other jokes too, but really you will probably want to be somewhat of an RPG fan... or at least understand RPGs to find a lot of this funny. Still, as a fan myself, I found the humor to be quite simple but effective. 
 
Ummmm and that's it really. The music isn't that great, but the art is pretty good for a little known show like this.  Its sad to see that so few people have managed to find this little gem, because its really quite good. As a sketch comedy, I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. Characters are simple but memorable enough, the comedy is funny, there are 7 or 8 repeating sketches that you can enjoy every time they come back. All in all, if you like RPGs, and like this kind of un-connected random comedy, then you'll definitely like Master of Epic. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I personally watched the hell out of it a few times already, but this show is utter garbage. The characters are flat one dimensional, even when they are portraying different archetypes of people you encounter in  games. 
 
The show is set as skits, and they are very nonsensical, and they draw on the nonsense to go about getting you to laugh, I didn't laugh much at the skits and their premises much, however, they did have one segment i enjoyed a lot and those where wenever the Waragetcha 5 showed up. 
 
The art... honestly is pretty bland, definitely felt like a low budget anime, but then again when i did check out the game the anime was promoting... the art style matched the game well. 
 
Music was not really worth mentioning as it wasn't really memorable... maybe except the intro to the waragetcha 5 only because it is such a self poking song. 
 
All in all, the humor and the premise of this show caters a really narrow number of people, and i can't say i know people who could enjoy this show... unless they are into bad gags and some weird slapstick comedy. The show doesn't take itself seriously, almost as if it knows it's bad, which is probably what drew me into watching the show...  having a feeling that the staff did the show just for the giggles.

Adventures ensue in both Sandy's world and Koalawalla land. Among the characters met are 2 men after the ""magical talking bear"", a lizard that bounces back and forth from the magical realm and the real realm, and kangaroo police officers. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Kids', 'Fantasy']","One day, 12-year-old Sandy Brown receives a package from her long-lost grandfather containing a stuffed Koala named Blinky that was lost in a shipwreck 38 years ago. Sandy gives the koala a Noozle (another term for an Eskimo Kiss) and it revives him from ""magic sleepytime"". His first word is ""Blinky!!"" in response to Sandy thinking out loud what she should name the bear right before she awakens him. They are soon joined by Blinky's sister Pinky, who appears out of thin air soon after Blinky is awakened, and demands immediately that Blinky returns with her to KoalaWalla Land. Blinky refuses however, and the trio go on to have many adventures together. Blinky is able to sustain himself while living on Earth with Sandy because of the Eucalyptus trees that Sandy's grandmother had planted 38 years ago when Sandy's grandfather, an archaeologist who had mysteriously disappeared while on an expedition to Ayers Rock, just before the ship was lost, told her that he was sending a Koala as a gift, as Sandy's grandmother had expressed that she had always wanted one as a pet.
It takes Sandy some time to determine that the ""noozle"" is the action that revives Blinky from magic sleepytime. She does this several times without thinking about it, and gets frustrated over the fact that Blinky falls asleep repeatedly (during which time his appearance is similar to that of an ordinary stuffed animal) and stubbornly refuses to awaken until she realizes what she must do to revive him. Early in the series, Sandy decides to introduce Blinky and Pinky to her grandmother, but decides to keep them a secret to everyone else.
About halfway through the series, Blinky and Pinky bring Sandy to their homeworld of KoalaWalla Land. KoalaWalla Land is a parallel dimension inhabited by anthropomorphic koalas, kangaroos, platypuses, cassowaries, kiwi, and frill-necked lizards. It is ruled by a wise old koala known as the High Dingy Doo. Humans aren't allowed in KoalaWalla Land (and in fact a human will be arrested and jailed on sight just for being in KoalaWalla Land), so Sandy has to wear a koala mask during each visit (though some are able to see through her poor disguise). A portal to KoalaWalla Land can be found at Ayers Rock. Pinkie also has the ability to create instant portals to KoalaWalla Land at any point, as well as portals back and forth through time, by utilizing the red lipstick in her magic cosmetic kit to draw an interdimensional hole in the time-space continuum.
Meanwhile, Sandy's father Alex, who is also an archaeologist like his father before him, is exploring Ayers Rock and trying to solve the mystery of what happened to his father 38 years ago. While there, he discovers a cave, and on the wall of the cave is a message that his father wrote 38 years ago, saying ""I must leave on a mission of great importance. The little koala will know where I'll be.""  Alex stumbles into the portal to KoalaWalla Land at the end of the tunnel, where he is chased by the KoalaWalla Land police. Sandy, Blinky, and Pinky travel to KoalaWalla Land to rescue him. Alex stumbles upon a crystal planetoid in KoalaWalla Land, where he sees a shadowy figure resembling his father in one of the crystals. There, the KoalaWalla Land police find him and place him under a sleeping spell, but Sandy and Blinky and Pinky arrive to rescue him. They bring him back to Ayers Rock. Alex wakes up, convinced that the entire experience was a dream.
When Sandy hears that her father saw her grandfather, she and Blinky and Pinky decide to go back to KoalaWalla Land to look for him. They decide to look in The Crystal Place, which is connected to the crystal planetoid where Alex saw his father. The Crystal Place, which lies at the very core of KoalaWalla Land and helps hold the universe together, is a giant crystalline sphere filled with brightly colored orbs, which when touched by bare hands immediately entrap that person's essence forever with no escape. Sandy, protected by Pinky's magic bubble, enters The Crystal Place, and finds the spirit of her grandfather imprisoned in one of the orbs, trapped in a limbo-like state. He tells her to learn from the creatures of KoalaWalla Land and to understand how their community has come to survive in a world of love and companionship. Finally, he delivers the cryptic message ""as the world of KoalaWalla Land goes, so goes the world of mankind."" Sandy wants to know what he means, but that's all he can tell her, and he tells her that more will be revealed in due time.
Some time later, Alex is exploring Africa. He is scheduled to return home, but when he hears the story of a magic stone called the ""wiseman stone"", he decides to stay in Africa to search for it. Sandy and her mother are disappointed when they hear that Alex is staying in Africa, so Blinky and Pinky travel there to try to find a way to convince him to come home. They attempt to scare him back home by making ghost noises, and even create illusionary dinosaurs in an attempt to scare him away from the dig site, but nothing seems to work. Finally, Sandy's grandmother appears. She has traveled to Africa to scold her son for running off to look for the wiseman stone when his wife and daughter are waiting for him to come home. Alex decides to come back home with his mother. Shortly after arriving back home, Alex receives a phone call from his assistant Lionel who says that his team has found what they believe to be the Wiseman Stone, but they need Alex to check if it's the real deal since he's the expert on the subject. Later, during a visit to Sandy's grandmothers house, Blinky uses his magic powers to teleport an unknowing Alex to Africa. Confused as to how he got there, Alex checks the stone and confirms that it's authentic. Alex still has the stone with him when Blinky transports him back. Alex is still confused about the whole thing. When he shows the stone to his mother, she tells him that he must have found the stone in her attic, and that it is a stone that his father had found many years ago. After Sandy and her Parents have gone home, her grandmother brings the stone up to her attic, and it is revealed that there are two wiseman stones, one that Alex found in Africa, and another that his father had found years before.
One day, during another trip to Sandy's grandmother's house, Alex finds the two Wiseman stones in her attic. Alex is confused as to why there is now a second wiseman stone. His mother tells him that his father found one, and that he put the other one there when he came back from Africa. It is then that Sandy decides to tell her parents the truth about Blinky and Pinky. Shortly afterward, they receive a surprise visit from the High Dingy Doo, who has come to ask Alex a very important favor. The High Dingy explains that KoallaWalla Land and the Earth are destined to one day separate from each other naturally. However, because of Seismic Testing in the Australian Outback, the trans-dimensional axis that binds the two worlds together has become severely shaken, speeding up the process so much that both worlds could be destroyed in the separation. The High Dingy Doo also explains that Sandy's grandfather knew that this would happen someday due to his research of ancient Australian folklore. He entered The Crystal Place and became trapped there while trying to unravel the secrets of KoalaWalla Land. The High Dingy Doo says that Sandy's grandfather likely knows how to save the worlds from destruction, but that his spirit can only communicate with someone who is related to him by blood. The High Dingy Doo asks Alex to come to The Crystal Place so he can speak to his father's Spirit. Alex, protected by a magic bubble created by the High Dingy Doo, enters The Crystal Place and tells his father's spirit of the impending disaster. His father tells him that the only way to restore the balance between the two worlds so they can separate safely is to give the wiseman stones to Blinky, who will know what to do from there. After returning to earth, Alex gives the wiseman stones to Blinky, who now remembers what it is that he must do. Blinky teleports himself, Pinky, Sandy, her parents, and her grandmother to Ayers Rock, where the separation has already begun. Blinky and Pinky bring the stones to the top of Ayers Rock and place them in a predisposed altar, where Blinky manipulates them in a joystick-like fashion to keep the two worlds from destroying each other. Blinky and Pinky return to KoalaWalla Land in the process. Because the two worlds now exist as completely separate dimensions, Pinky's magic is no longer able to bridge the ties that formerly bound them meaning Blinky and Pinky must now forever remain in their home separate from Earth.
","Fushigi na Koala Blinky, or Noozles, as it was know in the U.S. Is an old anime that aired on Nickelodeon in the 1990's. If you're cynical in anyway, an serious adult, or a heartless, unimaginative fool, you won't like this anime. Noozles is a kids show and if you grew up watching it like I did, you could probably watch it again several times because there's no way any kid out there wouldn't like this. Seriously, it was that frickin entertaining. The story itself is utterly ridiculous which is probably the best thing about the series. The art is good for a kids show, certainly better than children's programming these days. The theme song will be stuck in your head for DAYS. The characters are actually well thought out and interesting, too. If you're looking to get your kids into anime, this is great. It certainly isn't asflashy as some other children's anime these days but smaller children will enjoy it.

       Helpful Cool Devices is one of the classic Hentai-Animes that was worth watching it. CD itself Has 11 Episodes which are independent from each other. In each Episode you will experience a new kind of story, characters and fetishes. The Stories itself aren't really stories since there is just one episode and its more about the different kind of desires humans can experience. All different kinds like orgies, yuri, costumes, bondage, slavery, public sex etc. are included here. You surely will find your type of, even if you might dislike some fetishes.  
 
This series doesn't include vulgar things like scat or gore though. If you would like to enjoy some special and a little darker sides of Hentai, without mainly brutal vulgarity, you should give Cool Devices a try. Like i said, it covers the most of common fetishes and will be worth watching it. Even to get some new ideas for your sex life ;9

There is no actual story, no dialogue of any kind, this is purely fan service nudity.  Of course, it is very well done nudity, and I almost wish that the whole series was done in this well-polished 3D style.  So the actual animation looks amazing, and even though areas are censored (for obvious reasons since it is a Japanese animation), the censorship is well done and does not take away from the actual beauty of the subjects.

The Special storyline has very little to do with the original series outside of having some of the same characters, and has a completely different storyline which does not fit into anything which came before it. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Dementia', 'Slice of Life']","The story is about the relationship between freelance photographer Kouhei Morioka and Hazuki, a young girl who descends from a royal vampire lineage. At the beginning of the story, Kouhei travels to a castle in Germany to take photographs of paranormal phenomena for his friend Hiromi, who is the editor of an occult magazine. At the castle, Kouhei meets Hazuki, who feeds on Kouhei's blood and claims him as her unwilling servant. Although this ""blood pact"" is supposed to bind Kouhei to Hazuki as her obedient slave, her act has no effect on Kouhei. Following an action-packed sorcerers' battle in which Kouhei and his cousin manage to free Hazuki from her captivity in the dreary castle, Hazuki travels to Tokyo, and takes up residence with Kouhei in his grandfather's house in Japan. Hazuki claims that, because she fed on his blood, Kouhei is now her servant, but Kouhei continually refuses to obey her, especially when he thinks her requests are unreasonable. Despite their fighting, the relationship between the duo progresses over time—even in the face of repeated attacks by opposing vampires—until Kouhei becomes determined to protect Hazuki from the vampire servants of her family, who are determined to retrieve her by whatever means necessary.
","I can't recommend this episode at all, it's bizarre to the point of being incoherent.  I'm guessing that it's supposed to be ""funny"" but it completely misses the mark. And that's saying something as I actually sorta liked the humor in the original show. If you were hoping it would expand on or develop the characters more, it doesn't. It doesn't have the same charm a lot of the original slice-of-life episodes have, which is really disappointing since I think that was the strong suit of this series.  
 
The only reason I'm not rating this a 1 is because I understand some people might like the whimsical nature of this episode. Also there is one nice moment between Hazuki and Arte (who was horribly underdeveloped in the original series) but that's pretty much it.  
 
It left a bad taste in my mouth about the series as a whole though. Bad note to end on. 

          
 
       Helpful One of things that bothered me about Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase was the mood. When a show opens with Neko Mimi Mode, an incredibly silly and lighthearted song with such silly animation, along with all the falling basins added for comedy effect, you wouldn't expect the dark atmosphere the show had. What makes this special enjoyable is that from the outright, it lets the viewer know that it's not meant to be taken seriously. For me, it was a pleasant way to end the series after the awkwardly dark tone of the main series. 
 
Story 9/10. 
You want a story? The Tsukuyomi cast is lost at sea in their house, the Marumi, which somehow became able to float. Why? Because. That's why. It's obvious that this show has thrown out the plot and is just being plain silly. Aside from Hazuki and Art solidifying their sisterly relationship even further, this special doesn't really provide much for the Tsukuyomi universe. 
 
Art  7/10. Sound 6/10. 
Having seen a few SHAFT works already, I already knew what kind of things to expect artwise. It's nice to see that Shinbo and SHAFT still had their surrealism even in their early days. Other than that, I didn't particularly care for the art and sound one way or the other. 
 
Character 9/10. 
It's nice to see the cast of Tsukuyomi when they aren't fighting THE FORCES OF EVIL as they're quite funny and likable. The best characterization in this special is the breakdown of Seiij: He is the sole voice of reason when everyone is carrying on their daily lives as if being stuck on a floating house in the middle of the sea is nothing. Other than that, it's nice to see what I thought was the best part of Tsukuyomi remain mostly unchanged where as some other comedy specials throw out the main personalities of the characters in an attempt for comedic effect. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10. 
Mileage will vary on this one. Those who found the dark and brooding mood of Tsukuyomi to be one of its best part will be disappointed. Those who enjoy a good laugh, such as I, will find this special to be quite enjoyable. It doesn't take itself seriously for the most part and will keep on finding ways for the viewer to wonder what the hell just happened. From Grandpa's experience with Octopus, to Anzai's surprise appearance, to the battleship full of Vigos, this special will keep you cracking up. 
 
Overall 8/10. 
At the end of the day, all this special will be is just a silly thing to laugh at. It provides nothing new or substantial in relation to the main plot of Tsukuyomi. Those who found the end of the series to be unsatisfying won't find what they're looking for in this special. Those looking for just a little more Tsukuyomi or just a good, lighthearted laugh will satisfy their desire in this special.

          
 
       Helpful I have to admit I did not really enjoy this special as much as I did the series. The artwork seemed to be very different to what I had seen previously, and they did use some strange techniques in the special. Gladly the characters were still recognisable, except for Seiji who seems to have aged considerably.  
 
There were some odd moments, especially with grandfather and Elfried and an octopus (dont tell anybody), and poor Haiji gets the short end of the stick from Art. I did like Haiji as a character throughout the series and I had to admire her pluckiness once again. 
 
The Twinns are still complete opposites and if Hazuki had not overshadowed everybody else in kawaii factor they would easily have come out tops.  
 
Hazuki... what can we say? still a brat, still cute and still precocious but she seemed so much different to the anime and manga in this special. I did feel she matured a lot from before, and she was very likeable. But, being Hazuki she does drift from one extreme to another.  
 
The story is medicocre, the ending lousy, and there is very little that makes this a closing of the series.  When viewed on its own it is barely watchable, when viewed as episode 26 of the series it is pretty poor.

The star players of the team became known as the ""Generation of Miracles"". After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was another player in the ""Generation of Miracles"": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the ""Generation of Miracles"", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of his youth in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, and Seijuro Akashi.
Seirin High team faced Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami skills with added strength and speed, Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. They then met Shintaro Midorima's school Shutoku in the preliminaries of Interhigh. The game was much more difficult; not only was Midorima considerably stronger than Kagami, but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. Seirin managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, whose basketball team included the Ace of the ""Generation of Miracles"" - Daiki Aomine. After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team. They spent the entire summer training for the Winter Cup, even coincidentally meeting Shutoku while training.
In the preliminaries, they met team Shutoku again. This match ended into a tie, so Seirin needed to defeat team Kirisaki Daichi in order to advance. Kirisaki Daichi's captain was Makoto Hanamiya, a member of the Uncrowned Kings well-known for his underhanded methods to win a match. However, they won and gained a ticket to the Winter Cup.

I continue my review of the god awful Violence Jack trilogy with Violence Jack 2: Evil Town. Despite the hilariously cheesy title, this movie is...fairly dark. What do I mean by fairly dark? I mean that depraved weaboos on dark corners of the internet praise this movie for its prevalent use of rape, ""guro"", and ""vore"". If you don't know what the latter 2 terms mean, you obviously need to lurk MOAR. Or you could choose not to lurk and keep your sanity and humanity. I leave the choice up to you. Anyways, time to review another shitty old anime! 
 
Plot and characters: 1/10 
 
Violence Jack doesn't really have much a plot. In a post apocalyptic future, an underground town is controlled by an evil gang that likes to rape, kill, and eat people, but not always in that order. One day, some coal miners are digging with old pick axes and one of them discovers a man entombed in the wall of the mine shaft. Why the hell is he there? Because fuck logic, this is Violence Jack! This is what you watch because you want to see a 14 foot tall Wolverine look-alike murder rapists with a Crocodile Dundee knife. Once free from his never explained and nonsensical tomb, Jack decides to help the weak and punish the evil doers. Of course Jack never arrives in time to stop a rape or a murder. He only arrives in time to punish those responsible. Jack is the kind of guy that would somehow show up late to his own funeral. The only challenge for Jack is a 12 foot tall cannibal that appears to have been the inspiration for Todd McFarlane's character The Violator. Violence Jack came before Spawn, so I am assuming that Violator is in fact the ripoff and this guy is the original. The resemblence is so uncanny though that clearly one ripped off the other. At first Jack kicks the Violator's ass, but then Violator eats the corpse of an evil, child murdering transgender woman. After eating the transgender woman's corpse, Violator randomly transforms into a huge demon thing for absolutely no reason. FUCK LOGIC! This is BIORENSU JACKU! Jack loses more blood than even a 14 foot tall body could contain, but still kills the transformed violator and leads the surviving chicks to safety. The chicks all hang out in a field with their breasts exposed and the movie simply ends. 
 
Art: 3/10 
 
Like the first Violence Jack, Evil Town excels at showing carnage and intestines. The blood and gore is far more realistic than most other old anime. People are actually filled with organs, guts, and bone fragments instead of just red paint. One thing I found hilarious was that the artist REALLY loves to draw tits, but sucks at drawing them. The nipples are placed at random locations that seem to change in every shot. It would be easier to predict the exact location of an electron orbiting an atom (and its momentum) than predict where the nipple is going to show up next. At least Heisenberg would enjoy this anime, because it would give him the excuse to make another long math formula. If you didn't get that last joke...go take a physics course. 
 
Sound: 1/10 
 
Violence Jack 2 doesn't really have a soundtrack. It just has god awful sex sounds that play during the MANY rape scenes. I'm 99% positive they just used the sound of someone stirring macaroni and cheese in a bowl. 
 
Overall: 2/10 
 
Violence Jack 2: Evil Town...is not a very good anime. Maybe if you have some really odd fetishes, then it is enjoyable, but I am not one of those guys. I watch it because I have a different type of fetish. I am an anime masochist and I derive pleasure from watching the worst anime ever made. That is pretty much the only other reason that someone would watch Violence Jack. If I get 15 thumbs up I will review Violence Jack 3, otherwise I think I am done with good ol' Jack.

Katsu!! , where they give their own personal feelings about their past experiences with the show, as well as their working experiences with their fellow cast members.","['Ecchi', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Supernatural']","The protagonist of the series is the monk-in-training Ikkou Satonaka, who transforms into a super-monk with the ability to perform mass exorcisms for the girls he lives with (Note: In the anime, he transforms from seeing a naked girl). He lives in the Saienji Temple as a Buddhist priest in training with six other nuns: Haruka Amanogawa, Sumi Ikuina, Hinata and Sakura Sugai, Chitose Nanbu and Yuuko Atouda, each of whom represents one of the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology. Chitose is the main love interest and has a love-hate relationship with Ikkou which is somewhat typical in many other anime, involving numerous misunderstandings, beatings, and angry tirades where the male is clearly at a disadvantage to the female. A side effect of Ikkou using his ultimate power is that immediately afterwards he turns into an even bigger pervert than he normally is. The subject matter of the series is Ikkou's self-destructive power and the powers of the other nuns and their training to control these powers, as well as their (mostly non-romantic) relationships.

If you like season 2 you will like this special. as you start watching... try not to be fooled(laughs knowing the inside joke) 
 
there is a point or question rather to what the main genre is... there are two choices given i have to say Romance. You can agree or disagree. Although, think hard before going with option two and don't think of option two that way you perverts (hint hint). 
 
art is kind of the same with the seasons... the slight difference is not due to different staff it is because in my opinion how they decided to plot this special. 
 
Overall i gave this special an 8... even though it is not a 10 does not mean it is not one in my mind... when i review i will give a 10 to those that go for the extra credit... you know those hard teachers we all hate.

13,29,149,6.056514114926429,story with the main character transported to another world,Zipang,"Mirai, an improved Kongou-class Aegis guided missile destroyer, is one of the newest and most advanced ships in the entire Japanese Self Defense Force (SDF). Her crew, also one of the newest, is lead by Capt. Umezu Saburo and Executive Officer Kadomatsu Yosuke. While running scheduled training exercises one day, Mirai encounters a fierce storm that throws their navigation systems into temporary disarray. After a few minutes of recovery, the crew is shocked to discover that they've been transported back in time to June 4, 1942—The Battle of Midway, during World War II. Letting history take its course for this battle, they manage to avoid the conflict firsthand and make a vow to remain anonymous, changing history as little as possible. However, when the crew comes across the dying Lt. Commander Kusaka Takumi, XO. Kadomatsu's instincts to save lives takes over, changing the course of history more than he could've imagined. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Seinen']","The newest, most advanced destroyer in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, the JDS Mirai, sets sail from Japan on a training exercise with the United States Navy. En route, they encounter a strange meteorological anomaly, causing the Mirai to lose contact with her sister ships. After a short time, the crew detects a fleet approaching, but can barely believe their eyes as a massive battleship passes by them. The crew soon identify it as the Yamato, a ship which was sunk in 1945. As the crew scans with their radar, numerous other ships, including a Nagato-class battleship, are sighted. Two destroyers from the unknown fleet attempt to intercept the Mirai, but she manages to escape.
After examining the situation, the crew realises that the ships they passed are part of the Imperial Japanese Navy and that they have somehow been transported back in time more than 60 years to June 4/5, 1942, the first day of the Battle of Midway. Knowing that an American attack will soon devastate the four aircraft carriers of the Kido Butai, some Mirai crew members believe that they should intervene, to save the carriers and the 3,000 Japanese lives that will be lost. With the Mirai's advanced technology and weaponry, which is far superior to anything possessed by the United States (or any other nation) in this era, the crew realize that they could potentially alter the course of the Second World War. However, they agree that their top priority is to return home, and to ensure that they have a home to which to return they decide to do nothing that will change history.
Despite their initial intentions not to alter history, they soon find themselves gradually drawn into the war, though they continue to refuse to choose one side over another.  The struggle of the crew from a modern, peaceful, and wealthy Japan to resist the nationalistic appeal of defending their country, knowing that in this time it is ruled by a brutal, totalitarian and militaristic government is the central theme of Zipang. Their rescue of an Imperial Japanese Navy officer from the past, Lt. Commander Kusaka, who would have perished in the normal timeline, causes unstoppable and devastating changes in the past when he seeks to create a stronger Japan no matter what the cost.
","I watched it for the war type battle scenes. Although there weren't many (for a 26 ep series), they were well done and accurate. As one who watched military docudrama growing up, I've seen a few dogfights and bombing flights. Zipang does a good job depicting the ships and planes in combat. I watched subtitled version and did kinda give up on story after a while. It was pretty good from what I did see, but subtitles lost me. Maybe I would score dub version higher, but it was too expensive and this collection was alot cheaper. I was afraid it would get boring and it did. Boredom is boredom in any language. Animation quality was good and characters were good and easy to like. Most military fans might like this one, otherwise I don't think the FullMetal Alchemist or Sailor Moon crowd will like this one.

          
 
       Helpful If you had the ability to go back in time in era where the world was on the brink and entire populations dying would you go back in time to prevent that from occurring even if it means that the future that came after it could be erased forever? That is just one of the Dilemma the crew of the Mirai must tackle in this time-travel/Military Story. 
 
It has been awhile since i wrote a review for anything but since this series left a bit of an impression on me and is extremely under the radar i thought i might give some insight so that others might check it out. 
 
So to give a basis of the story, the story focuses on the crew of the Mirai the Japanese naval force newest and most advanced military vessel and as they were conducted a naval training excersize they encountered and anomaly that displaced the crew to travel back in time by almost 60 years into the middle of the Battle of Midway during World war II and along the way rescue a naval officer who should of perished in that battle and thus a series of events unfold that begins to change the course of history.  
 
Well that is the basic premise, i have to say thought it is an interesting take on the genre and whoever wrote this, knew what he was writing as there is a lot of historical detail despite this being and alternate timeline and the fact that focus on heavily on military and political ethics. The thing i find most fascinating is the writers ability to remain quite impartial as to who is in the right and wrong, there is no clear definition and every individual encountered has there own ideas and goals but there characters are well constructed that you can sympathise with each individuals position and decisions so  you can just about root for anyone. 
 
The Military combat action is well done and is the military and political dialogue. The Animation is very good it may be somewhat outdated as this was released nearly 15 years ago but not that much and can still hold on its own. The soundtrack is somewhat weak as there is not much of a diverse amount different tracks but it is fine with what was shown. The Sub dialogue is in tune the Dub is somewhat of a mix bag. The Dub has a lot of dialogue that is more in line with what an American solider would sound like or talk and that might be somewhat off putting to hear a Japanese naval officer speaking in heavy southern american accent, it is aright once you get used to it but i recommend the sub for more authenticity. 
 
Overall this is a great series to watch , especially for someone who has an interest in Military, Naval and Time Travel conflicts and i would recommend just about anyone to give this a try. Keep in mind is that while there is plenty of action the story is also somewhat slow paced and dialogue heavy which is fine if you like that sort of thing but  if there are people who might find that a bit boring i would not sit this one trough. Give it a try, it is an almost forgotten classic that should receive a bit more attention. :)  


          
 
       Helpful Who are your enemies? Who are your friends? What does it mean to be at war? How much is one life worth? What would you do if you could change the past? War & Fighting are a genre that anime are a euphemism for entertainment. That was not the case here.  
 
Zipang is a show that brims with both regret and hope. It's a historical-fiction/action anime; one of the rare few that tackles real-world history. 
While there are plenty of tense, thrilling moments make no mistake: actions have consequences.  
 
Much of Zipang is spent answering the aforementioned questions. A crew of a Japanese (SDF) cruiser from around the year 2000 finds themselves adrift back in the 1940's during World War II w/ highly advanced technology and armament. How do they survive?  
 
I personally enjoyed Zipang, because, while slow-moving it is not a show in which the protagonists are in a position to judge their actions carelessly.  Zipang is a show that leads up to a climax of tough decisions.  
 
On another hand Zipang is a critique of the state of military affairs between Japan & the United States during World War II. Zipang reflects on the attitudes, mentalities, capabilities and the capacities for both benevolence and malevolence.
