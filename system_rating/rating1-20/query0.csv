Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris (アメストリス, Amesutorisu). In this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who work for the government are known as State Alchemists (国家錬金術師, Kokka Renkinjutsushi) and are automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by Truth (真理, Shinri), a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.
Attemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the Gate of Truth (真理の扉, Shinri no Tobira), where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis, heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosopher's Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones are used to create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins; Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other, and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.
There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of Central City (セントラルシティ, Sentoraru Shiti), along with other military cities such as the northern city of Briggs (ブリッグズ, Burigguzu). Towns featured include Resembool (リゼンブール, Rizenbūru), the rural hometown of the Elrics; Liore (リオール, Riōru), a city tricked into following a cult; Rush Valley (ラッシュバレー, Rasshu Barē), a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and Ishbal, a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is Xing. Heavily reminiscent of China, Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris's government-controlled election of a Führer. It also has its own system of alchemy, called alkahestry (錬丹術, rentanjutsu), which is more medical and can be bi-located using kunai; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.
Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter having left without reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. But the transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.
The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar, who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people's genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward's limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, Winry Rockbell, the Elrics meet Dr. Marcoh, who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher's Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang's friend Maes Hughes continues the Elrics' research and finds out about a government conspiracy, but is killed by the homunculus Envy. The Elrics learn that Izumi also performed human transmutation, having attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Greed, but is rescued by Amestris' leader King Bradley. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi's creator, Father. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 
After meeting the Xingese prince Lin Yao, who seeks a Philosopher's Stone to cement his position as heir to his country's throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes's murder. Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes' murder, so Mustang fakes Ross's death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills Lust. Lin captures Gluttony, who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony's stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father's plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as ""human sacrifices"". Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess May Chang, fires the corrupt official Yoki, and kidnaps Dr. Marcoh.
The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General Olivier Armstrong. They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher's Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the ""Promised Day"". Forced to work with Solf Kimblee, a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee's chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Riza Hawkeye discovers that King Bradley's son Selim is the homunculus Pride. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an immortal when Father arranged the fall of Cselkcess four centuries ago and had been working since then to stop Father.
The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an eclipse and ‘human sacrifices’ — alchemists who have performed human transmutation — to trigger the transmutation, with Wrath and Pride forcing Mustang to perform human transmutation to make him a sacrifice. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father's minions, with Kimblee and almost all of the Homunculi dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle and absorbs the superior being. Hohenheim and Scar activate countermeasures, draining much of Father's absorbed souls, and rendering him unstable. The Elrics and their comrades face Father in a final battle, in which Greed sacrifices himself to protect Lin. Alphonse, his armor almost destroyed, sacrifices his soul to restore Edward's right arm. Edward defeats Father, who is dragged into the Gate of Truth, from which he was created. Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to fully restore Alphonse from an impressed Truth, while Lin receives a Philosopher's Stone. Hohenheim goes to visit Trisha's grave, where he dies peacefully.
The Elrics return home and separate two years later to further research alchemy. Years later, Edward and Winry marry and have two children.

Fullmetal Alchemist is a mega success, specially the Brotherhood anime. Proof of that is the fact that it's ranked number 2 in this page, since who knows how many months. And, as with any successful product, OVA, specials and movies are created. Unfortunately, in most cases, these products tend to be mediocre at best, therefore, prudent consumers often face these creations with skepticism, or directly not expecting much. So, i watched Brotherhood's special with the intention of having fun, but not expecting anything great or mind blowing. I mean, four fifteen minutes long self conclusive episodes? What could you get of that?. A lot. This is one of the few cases in wich the product took me by surprise. Let's see why... 
 
Like I said, there are four episodes, each with a different story. 
The first episode, ""The Blind Alchemist"", shows us the Elric brothers arriving to a mansion, attracted by a strange rumor about Jude, the blind alchemist. Like the brothers, he also broke the taboo and tried to revive someone... but unlike Ed and Al, he was more successful... 
 
The second episode, ""Simple People"", is about how Ed want to give a present to Winry, so she doesn't get too mad (and by mad, I mean wrench assault) for his usual automail wrecking. So, the brothers try to buy her forgiveness with some earrings. 
 
The third episode, ""Tales of the Master"", is about the training of an 18 years old Izumi in Briggs. Maybe less experienced than in her adulthood, but healthier, and badass as usual, we'll see how exactly she became a legend/nightmare for the soldiers of that place.  
 
The fourth and final episode, ""Yet Another Man's Battlefield"", is the Mustang chapter (because, come on, could you imagine a special creation of FMA without him? That would be a commercial suicide!). Not the adult, full prepared Flame alchemist, but the 18 years old student in the military academy. We'll see his studies, his problems, and his rivalry with an equally young Maes Hughes. 
 
The interesting thing about these stories is that are so very well written, that they could be a part of the manga (or the Brotherhood anime). Episodes 2 and 3 have lots of comedic and touching moments, while 1 and 4 are more dramatic and serious. I want to highlight the first episode (my personal favorite, by the way), which touches the reason that motivates the Elrics to do what they do (you know... try to recover their bodies without dying). 
 
The animation is superb, as in the main series. The character design is excellent, changing from ""normal"" to ""SD"" in a totally normal, funny way (specially noted with Ed, Al, Winry and Izumi). The alchemy is colorful (with bolts of electricity flying in all directions, buildings structures that changes, or are directly destroyed), and the landscapes are equally beautiful and colorful (especially Risembool, with the fields, prairies and all that... Ishval, on the other hand, is quite brown, which according to the current cultural parameters, means that it's very realistic xD). 
 
The voices are the same form the Brotherhood anime, so good job there. As for the new characters the more destacable is Jude seiyuu: Show Hayami (Aizen in Bleach, Devilman in Devilman, Zarbon in Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka in Fate/Zero, Archer in the first FMA series, and a long etc). The music is also the typical in FMA, although there is no opening nor ending. For any of the episodes. That's weird... but hey, not that serious (although, it would have been awesome if Yui, Asian Kung-fu Generation or L'Arc~en~Ciel were involved in this project...). 
 
So... what do we have here? A surprise and a very nice one. The episodes are truly in the league of the original creation. I cannot imagine a greater compliment. In four chapters we have comedy, action, drama, alchemy and lots of emotion (and sadly, nothing of Armstrong...). As I said before, this really looks like a part of the series, especially Izumi's training (which is mentioned in the manga) and Mustang's education. 
This is not recommended, this is mandatory for any fan of Brotherhood (and seeing the ranking of this page, there are a lot of them n_n). Watch this and enjoy, since high quality specials/OVAS are not that abundant... 
-------- 
Fullmetal Alchemist es un mega éxito, eso es innegable. Prueba de ello es que en esta misma pag esta rankeada número 2 desde quien sabe cuánto tiempo. Y como con todo producto exitoso, se crean OVAS, especiales y películas. Desafortunadamente, en la mayoría de los casos, estos productos suelen ser inferiores a la obra original, por lo que, los consumidores prudentes suelen verlas con cierto escepticismo, o no esperando gran cosa. Yo encare los especiales de Brotherhood de esa forma: esperaba divertirme un rato, pero no imaginaba que fuera nada del otro mundo. O sea, 4 capítulos auto conclusivos de solo 15 minutos? Que se puede esperar de tan poco?. Mucho. Este es uno de los pocos casos en el que el producto me tomo por sorpresa. Veamos por que... 
 
Como dije, hay cuatro capítulos, cada uno con una historia diferente.  
El primer capítulo, “El alquimista ciego”, nos muestra a los hermanos Elric arribando a una mansión, atraídos por un extraño rumor acerca de Jude, el alquimista ciego. Al igual que los hermanos, el también intento revivir a alguien... pero a diferencia de Ed y Al, el tubo más éxito. 
 
El segundo capítulo, “Gente común”, trata de cómo temiendo por las represalias de Winry por haber roto su brazo tan rápido, Ed y Al deciden comprarle a su mejor amiga unos aros, con la esperanza de apaciguar su ira (que usualmente involucra agresiones con llaves inglesas). 
 
El tercer capítulo, “Cuentos de la maestra” es sobre el entrenamiento de Izumi (de solo 18 años) en Briggs, y como fue exactamente que se convirtió en una leyenda/pesadilla para los soldados del lugar. 
 
El cuarto y último capítulo, Yet Another Man's Battlefield, es sobre los días de Mustang (personaje que no podía quedarse afuera de estos especiales, o varias cabezas hubieran rodado :P) en la academia militar, sus estudios, y su rivalidad con Maes Hughes.  
 
Lo interesante de estas historias es que no solo están muy bien escritas, si no que tranquilamente podrían ser parte del manga. Los capítulos 2 y 3 tienen sus momentos cómicos y conmovedores, mientras que el 1 y el 4 son bastante serios, sin llegar a ser dramáticos al nivel del primer anime. Particularmente quería destacar el primer capítulo, que toca de lleno la motivación de los Elric para hacer lo que hacen. 
 
El apartado técnico es impecable. La animación es soberbia, al igual que en la serie. El diseño de personajes es excelente, rotando de forma esporádica entre “normales” y chibi de forma totalmente natural. La alquimia es vistosa  (con rayos de electricidad volando para todos lados, edificios que ven sus estructuras modificadas o directamente destruidos) y los paisajes son hermosos y muy coloridos (especialmente Risembool, con sus campos, praderas y todo eso... Ishval es bien marrón, lo que según los parámetros culturales actuales, significa que es realista xD). 
 
Las voces son las mismas de la serie, y cumplen de la forma que ya sabemos todos. En cuanto a los nuevos personajes, destaco a Jude, cuyo seiyuu es Show Hayami (Aizen en Bleach, Devilman en Devilman, Zabon en Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka en Fate/Zero, Archer en la primer serie de FMA, más un largo etcétera). La música es también la usual de FMA, aunque no hay ni opening ni ending. Para ninguno de los capítulos. Eso es raro... pero bueno, tampoco es un problema. 
 
Así que, para redondear, que es lo que tenemos acá? Una sorpresa, y una muy agradable. Realmente estos especiales están a la altura del anime. No se me ocurre un mayor halago. A lo largo de cuatro episodios tenemos comedia, acción, drama, alquimia y mucha emoción (y, tristemente, nada de Armstrong...). Como ya dije antes, realmente parecen una parte más de la serie, especialmente el entrenamiento de Izumi (que es comentado en el manga) y la educación de Mustang. 
 
Esto no es recomendable, es obligatorio para cualquier fan de Brotherhood (y viendo el ranking de esta pag, son muchos). Véanlo y disfruten, dado que los buenos especiales/OVAS no son tan abundantes...

          
 
       Helpful Four espisodes are four different stories, that the reason why it is tought to rate all of them by one mark. The second story was quite boring to me, so was the third. However 1st and, especcialy, fouth were kind of a masterpiece. After watching all of them I was so confused that I was unable to give it any rate.  
The specials are great mean to meet our favurite characters one more time, also to learn new things about their history. Few scences where already shown in the core series, for me it is an advantage, as it allows to place a situation in the time frame, and it proves that this is not completely new story out of the blue. 
Art is the same, characters are the same, and sound is fine, so my enjoyment was pretty high. However it is not what I had expected from the story and it was not really interesting/intriguing for me. Not dropped after third only because there would be no sense in dropping last episode.  
I don't regret watching it and totally recommend you to watch these specials, but bear in your mind it is not a whole new story, just short pictures form the past. 

          
 
       Helpful The ovas had only 12/14 minutes (except the last one), and in my opinion, that went down very well! But although they were short, they were great. Except for the Winry episode, which was quite simple, but the part where Riza says, ""The reasons are quite simple because the world is simple, just shoot the trigger that the person dies,"" referring to the Ishval war, was the most worthwhile in my opinion. 
 
The blind man who claimed to have managed a human transmutation is also worth seeing! 
 
And who was never curious to see Izumi training in the Briggs Mountains? It was the perfect opportunity. Modesty aside, but she should have a movie of her own. hehe Unlike the Elric brothers, she never showed much compassion for the animals she ate. Still, she understood that it was just another small part of the flow of life. And to top it off, it became a legend that scared to everyone who lived in Briggs hahahaha 
 
Bump into senpai for being late for class, drop your books and fall in love with him? NO! 
 
Bump into senpai for wanting to return home after a month of surviving on Briggs Mountain, knocking down your bear and falling in love with him? YES, very romantic, baby. 
 
The most interesting of these specials, however, was clearly the episode that showed the young Mustang and Hughes fighting together! I was more a fan of Hughes than Mustang, but I think after that episode, I completely changed my mind. Should Hughes be cute to care about his wife more than any other life he murdered? Nah, I found it a little disgusting. He would definitely not be a good ruler, thankfully the one who had this dream was the Mustang, not him! 
 
I understand, it was his duty as a soldier to accomplish the mission, and he held on to his wife to move on. However, that's a lot of fun, isn't it? Hughes didn't care about the motive behind the war, and in the end, it was that motive that killed him. By the time he started caring about the country, it was too late.

Liu Bei was a young, poor straw-mat seller from the countryside of Hebai Hsing. After pledging eternal brotherhood with the two heroes, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, Liu began building his idea of a righteous kingdom that would aid citizens who suffered from persecution.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Historical']",none,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms has the deserved reputation as being one of, if not the, greatest historical epics of all time due to it's large cast of historical figures, no single side being portrayed as purely good or evil (despite the novel's Shu bias) and having some of the most intelligent military tactics. Sangokushi captures many of these, but not completely. 
 
To start off, the anime covers the events from the end of the Yellow Turban Rebellion up until the Battle of Chibi, at which point the Three Kingdoms finally became close to formation. In this incomplete manner, a more honest title for the series would be ""Prelude of the Three Kingdoms"" as it only starts to scratch the surface on the conflict between Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, though what material it adapts of the original novel is fairly well done with it's political machinations and military strategies. 
As for it's characters, whilst many are accurate to what historical records and the novel present them as, they and the story suffer from the main flaw of the series, being mediocre presentation. All of the cast only get enough attention to show their core traits, making even some of the more established names fairly one note. The focus it places upon primarily the Shu faction also heavily limits character appeal for the other sides. For instance, the Wu faction becomes absent after the campaign against Dong Zhuo up until their alliance with Shu, leaving a lot of their history and character drama to simply be infodumped. Despite this, I wouldn't say their presentation is bad when considering it's characters at least remain consistent and logical in their goals (something absent from the majority of most series nowadays), but I have simply seen the same characters be presented better in alternate adaptions. 
 
The superficial aspects of art and sound are fine, with the refinement and colourisation of the art allowing it's characters to be more recognisable than the manga which lacks distinctive designs for many of it's support cast. Voice acting is fairly good with some well known seiyuu in it's cast and the music is quite a treat to listen to with it's imitation of classical Chinese music to fit the setting of the series. Animation is fairly minimal, however, with limited movement and quite fairly limited imagery for the battles. 
 
As for comparing it to the manga, it stands inferior in all but art and some character appeal. The manga covers up until the actual end of the Three Kingdoms era, thus making it a far more complete story. The anime does provide additional character appeal through direction of various emotional moments, whereas the manga focuses primarily on telling the history of the tale rather than providing great character introspection. Still, a complete story is a decisive factor for such a tale, which makes reading the manga a far better alternative. 
 
Overall, Sangokushi can at least hold the title of being the best anime adaption of the tale of the Three Kingdoms due to it's historical accuracy and consistency, yet it's bland presentation and incomplete nature make reading the manga a far better option. Better yet, either watch the 2010 live action series Three Kingdoms or read the original Chinese epic all of these are based on.

          
 
       Helpful Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi 横山光輝 三国志  Romance of the Three Kingdoms Review  
 
 
Story (10/10) Masterpiece  
 
The story follows the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story rather well as I would consider myself really knowledgeable on the story. If you don't know the story of RToK before watching this you are definitely not going to appreciate is as much as some who is well knowledgeable is. The accuracy and adaptation quality and pacing all for a anime that came out in the earlier 90s, I can't help but praise the efforts of Studio behind adapting Yokoyama Mitsuteru's manga.  
  
 
Art and Animation (6/10) Fine 
More Specifically (6.75/10) Fine+ 
 
Obviously almost everything back in the 90s that went for over 35+ episode isn't going to look amazing and the art style and animation for the anime is definitely dated and didn't age well. Certain scenes although the art style would drastically increase looking really really nice but majority of of was obviously dated so nothing much can be said when it comes to this, it wasn't ugly just dated and it didn't really bother since I already know what I was getting myself into, I wasn't here for this category. 
 
 
Sound (7/10) Good  
More Specifically (7.5/10) Good 
 
The opening, BGM and JP VA all were good in the anime adaptation it fit the Sangoku era really well and I really don't have any complaints about it. It didn't blow my mind but it fit this type of anime well. 
 
 
Characters (10/10) Masterpiece  
 
These are based off of ancient Chinese characters of history and their personality where definitely portrayed perfectly as far as we remembered. Liu Bei is virtuous, Zhang Fei is hot headed and rash, Guan Yu is loyal and strong, Cao Cao is ambitious and courageous, Zhuge Liang is a genius and laid back it's all here. I didn't feel anything wrong, inaccurate or out of place. 
 
 
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good  
 
As a fan of the Sangoku era I am glad I took the time to sit down and watch this classical anime right here. It definitely refreshed my memory of have great the story of RoTK is and I wish it continued. It went from the Yellow Turbans Rebellion and to the end of the Chi Bi battle. The version obviously focus majority of it's time on the rise of Shu and I don't mind that because when it came to that aspect I didn't felt they missed anything.  
 
 
Overall (8/10) Very Good 
More Specifically (8.45/10) Very Good 
 
The anime really make me want to just watch a bunch of war related anime which I indeed will. Souten Kuoro and Kingdom are next on my list. Sangoku lore will never get old to me so no matter the time the anime came out I didn't matter because I know if they stayed accurate to it I'll love it and I did. I definitely recommend this anime to any Sangoku fans out there everyone else it depends on if you like War anime because other than that I can't recommend it for it. There's a lot of politics and talking behind this one so if you aren't engrossed or knowledgeable about Sangoku history before diving in you most likely will get bored fast.

          
 
       Helpful Romance of Three Kingdoms, for those not versed in Asian cultures, is the Illiad of the East, A giant epic set around the fall of the Han dynasty in 189 A.D... 
 
This particular version of Three Kingdoms is not a straight adaptation of the novel, but a version based upon Sangokushi, a manga by the famed mangaka Yokoyama Mitsuteru (Gigantor, Little Witch Sally, Giant Robo) in a whopping 60 volumes of tankoban between 1981 and 1987. Despite this, the story remains the same, much to the series' benefit. Yokoyama's designs are generally good, if somewhat 'old-fashioned' in comparison to character designs of the period. The characters are more archtypes then fully fleshed out people, but this also occurs in the novel. The only bonefide standouts are Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang, who chew screen time with great aplomb. The series becomes a bit of a slog towards the end just before the 'last battle', which hurts on a certain level. Unfortunatly the story is 'unfinished', with  this particular anime series ending around chapter 50 of the novel. Yokoyama never finished his manga version of Three Kingdoms anyway, ending it about three-quarters of the way through the novel. A good series that could have been truely great with better execution, the strength of the source material still stands out nonetheless. 
 
An interesting curio for any anime collection, and should be of particular interest to anime fans of Chinese descent. Also provides a distinct cultural flavor as well.

","I have to admit, given Final Fantasy's bad record of anime/3D animation adaptations I wasn't particularly excited about these shorts. But when I heard the minor buzz that they were actually better than they had any right to be I decided to give them a shot. And I'm glad I did. While Kingsglaive shows off the effects and action that Final Fantasy XV is capable of these shorts focus more on the characters. And that gives them a tremendous advantage. Each episode is focused on a different character, apart from episode one which establishes the basics of their relationships. These shorts are only about fifteen minutes long so they don't have time to show us too much and instead focus on one aspect of their personalities. The focus at all times is on their relationship with Noctis. Episode 2 shows how Prompto and Noctis became friends despite his being a filthy peasant, episode 3 shows how Gladio came to respect Noctis despite his being a bit of a spoiled brat, and episode 4 is about Ignis' attempts to educate/understand Noctis. Episode 5 tells how Noctis' mother(?) died and a bit about why he's so detatched. These are all told through flashbacks set up by events on their roadtrip. The series as a whole is bookended by an attack that happens in the first episode and is resolved in the final one. 
 
I enjoyed all of these and especially appreciated how the characters were actually allowed to experience real change throughout the series. It's not overly long or complicated, and it barely has any overarching plot, but it works well at humanizing these characters. The series is basically just an advertisement for the game (they're available for free online) and as such they do their job well. If this level of quality is what Final Fantasy XV is like I'm game.

          
 
       Helpful Brotherhood serves as a prequel to the video game Final Fantasy XV and gives some insight on the characters that had to be cut from the video game itself. It does well in what it sets out to do, which is to serve as a supplement to the game.  
 
Story: 5/10 Mediocre 
 
The central plot itself isn't very exciting, Noctis is to be married as some sort of peace agreement with Niflheim and must go on a long road trip to meet up with his bride so they can protect the fate of the world. The majority of screentime is devoted to banter and bromantic moments between the main cast  ( I mean what else do you get when you send four hot guys on a roadtrip). There are some fight scenes where you get to see the awesome weapons the guys have but they are short and only exist to create an actual plot in between the character interactions. For 3 out of the 5 episodes something happens to one of the main characters which triggers a flashback on how they become friends with Noctis and the entire episode is spent in that flashback. Not saying this is necessarily bad but its very clear that the central plot exists just to tie the flashbacks together and create a story. 
 
Art: 7/10 Good 
 
All the main characters are designed to be good looking and are enjoyable to look at. The backgrounds are beautiful and diverse and the animation is fluid enough. However nothing about the art in this series is above average. The main characters do not get much expression and at times appear stiff. As a result I found the characters rather bland compared to other anime I've watched. I tend to enjoy more over the top expressions but some may prefer the more scaled back emotional displays. The art is solid and is no way bad enough to hinder the viewing experience but is nothing special either.     
 
Sound: 6/10 Fair 
 
First off I have to say the video games OST is much better than the anime's but that's to be expected with the anime only being 5 episodes. I'm a sucker for piano music so I enjoyed those bits quite a lot (the main theme is my favorite out of the soundtrack). I am by no means a music genius so take my opinion in this section with a grain of salt, but I didn't find much of the music to really enhance the scenes for me. It had the classic danger music when an enemy appeared but no songs that had me thinking to myself ""this is awesome"". The voice acting was good but average, I like Prompto's voice the most. The majority sounded like the typical anime male to me. 
 
Character: 7/10 Good 
 
Brotherhood is all about the characters. The goal of this series was to provide background information about the characters relationship with one another and in that they succeeded. It is almost crucial to watch this anime if you have any interest in playing the video game because it gives much more depth to the characters relationships than what is provided in the game. The game sort of just plonks you down on a roadtrip with these four guys with little explanation. It made me care much more about the characters after seeing the anime. Prompto is the most interesting character in my opinion and his episode was my favorite. However all the characters seem to fall into a stereotype. Prompto is the happy go lucky comedic relief, Ignis is the serious silent one,  Gladiolus is the gruff but caring older brother type and Noctis is the distressed pretty boy. They are still enjoyable but if you're looking for unique characters you won't find them here.  
 
Enjoyment: 6/10 Fair 
 
I started playing Final Fantasy XV and heard about the anime and figured I would give it a watch. I'm glad I did so because it let me appreciate the characters and gave me an actual sense of why I was on a road trip with four hot guys who screamed bromance. Prompto's backstory made me laugh and was the best episode in my opinion. The others were interesting enough to keep my interest and enhance my experience. One thing the anime did right was the length, the episodes put together equal about an hour. So whether you enjoy it or not, it doesn't waste much of your time.   
 
Final Verdict: 6/10 Fair 
 
If you plan on watching this anime by itself I don't think you would enjoy it very much. There is no ""ending"" that leaves you satisfied since its basically a prequel to the video game. In order to enjoy this anime the most I would watch it as a companion to the video game. If you're playing Final Fantasy XV this anime serves as a great way to get more immersed in the characters and actually care about them. Otherwise I would give this show a pass. 

          
 
       Helpful ""Brotherhood"" is a form of prequel to the as of now still upcoming game Final Fantasy XV.  
It's not a different form of telling the game's story, and therefor independent (sort of), but obviously held short, basically only long enough to spark interest for the game. It is not supposed to be a full length story anime. 
 
The episodes focus mainly on the dynamics and friendship of the group and the bonds between the main character Prince Noctis and his companions. 
Most episodes give insight on each character's backstory and purpose, doing greatly so.  
 
Each episode feels complete, and even if you didn't like this or that character at the start, you might find yourself liking him a bit more after that character's assigned episode with well-written development. 
I sometimes find myself rewatching an episode or two, simply because it's enjoyable. 
 
As for the art and sound: It does its job. You won't be blown away - but that's not the point of this show anyway. Its focus lies elsewhere after all. 
 
Summary:  
An enjoyable mini-series with one clear purpose: character backstory. It's about the extent of what you can expect, but it's doing its job well. Being a fan of Final Fantasy is not required, since the episodes are basically complete on their own.

0,30240,3,7.227365816854904,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Prison School,"Located on the outskirts of Tokyo, Hachimitsu Private Academy is a prestigious all-girls boarding school, famous for its high-quality education and disciplined students. However, this is all about to change due to the revision of the school's most iconic policy, as boys are now able to enroll as well. 
  
At the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath! 
  
It's only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'School', 'Seinen']","Hachimitsu Academy, one of the strictest girls' academies in Tokyo, has decided to admit boys into their system. Kiyoshi Fujino is one of these new boys, but he discovers to his shock that he and his four friends—Takehito ""Gakuto"" Morokuzu, Shingo Wakamoto, Jouji ""Joe"" Nezu, and Reiji ""Andre"" Andou—are the only male students among 1,000 girls. The draconian laws that are still in place make the school even worse, which punishes even the most minor infractions with a stay in the school's prison. The five boys all commit voyeurism in the school's bathing area with the lecherous philosophy of ""all for one, one for all"". Their capture and ""arrest"" by the Underground Student Council causes the five boys to receive an ultimatum: either stay a month in the school's Prison Block or be expelled. The boys are incarcerated in the Prison Block together and Kiyoshi is overwhelmed by the discovery that all the other boys are masochists that revel in the punishments handed to them by their attractive but vicious supervisors.
","Hm. My favorite character was already buried alive in one of the first episodes of the anime. Kiyoshi even saw this poor character, but decided not to help him. Then, a day later it was digged up again (da feels). And this character is loved so much, it even made a man cry. A few episodes later this character was buried again, under cement and stones behind the school(cries). And it was finally dead. Rest in peace lovely booty pictures. 
 
I would say it was an ok anime all in all. The characters were fun, as well as their design.  
And I like how women are shown in this anime, like.. very strong and dominant, with their own will. Even if, Meiko, Hana and Mari seem to be ultra feministic.  The humor gets worse every episode.  But the expressions of the characters are on fleek,I loved them.  
I wouldn´t recommend this anime to everyone (((○UωU)ﾉ”♪ 


          
 
       Helpful Prison school is in fact a great example of bad show with great elements. Prison School successfully takes suspense, drama, action, and ecchi, turns them into one perfect mess. Prison School is also a great example of a ""Hit or Miss"" anime show. Meaning you either like it or don't like it depending or your personal tastes in anime and experience.  The story is sort of plain however the elements they add like violence, sexy scenes, drama, suspense etc literally makes the a bit non existent. There are many things I like about story though, but for now the thing that stood out the most was the fact that (and stated before) the show overall was so bad it's good. The soundtrack is awesome lots of rock and metal added to make action scenes and ""Uh oh i'm in trouble"" scenes more suspense. The characters, will never, ever be forgettable. Prison school has one of the best cast of unforgettable characters I have seen in a while. Hana (she's first because she was my favourite) Kiyoshi, the vice president, the Chairman of the school, just about everyone is unforgettable. You, the viewer, if Prison school is up you alley and you enjoy bizarre shows this show is indeed for you. Overall I think the show was Really, really good given the elements and story the creator and directors were working with. 8/10

Chrono Trigger takes place in an Earth-like world, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch (this default name can be changed by the player when the vehicle is acquired). The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.
In 1000 AD, the kingdom of Guardia is celebrating the new millennium with a Millennial Fair. There, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate their new teleportation device, the Telepod. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device, creating a portal that draws her in. Crono and Lucca recreate the portal and find themselves in 600 AD. They find Marle only to watch her vanish before their eyes. Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle (who is actually Princess Nadia of Guardia) for Queen Leene, an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a grandfather paradox. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by rescuing Leene. After Crono, Marle, and Lucca return to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping and sentenced to death by Guardia's chancellor. Lucca and Marle help Crono escape prison, using another time portal to evade their pursuers. This portal leads to 2300 AD, where the trio learn that civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999 AD. The three vow to find a way to prevent the future destruction of their world. After meeting and repairing Robo and discovering another time Gate, Crono and his friends arrive at the End of Time, where they meet a mysterious old man who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light.
The party discover that a powerful mage named Magus summoned Lavos into the world in 600 AD. They enlist Frog to help them stop Magus, but Frog requires the legendary sword, Masamune, to defeat him. During the subsequent battle with Magus, it is revealed that Magus did not create Lavos, but only woke him up. His disrupted spell to summon Lavos creates a temporal distortion that throws Crono and his friends to prehistory. The party recruit Ayla and do battle with the Reptites, enemies of prehistoric humans, and witness the true origin of Lavos as the creature arrives from deep space and crashes into the planet before burrowing to its core. Entering a Gate created by Lavos's impact, the party arrive in the ice age of 12,000 BC. There, the floating Kingdom of Zeal seeks to draw upon Lavos's power via a machine housed on the ocean floor. Before they can destroy the machine, the party are discovered by the Queen of Zeal thanks to a tip from a mysterious Prophet, and are banished from the time period via a magical lock on the Gate. Seeking a way to return to Zeal, the party discover a time machine in 2300 AD called the Wings of Time (or Epoch), which can access any time period at will. The party return to 12000 BC, where Zeal awakens Lavos, leading the Prophet to reveal himself as Magus, who tries and fails to kill the creature. Lavos defeats Magus and kills Crono, before the remaining party are transported to the safety of the surface by the Queen's daughter, Schala. Lavos annihilates the Kingdom of Zeal, and the debris of the fallen continent causes devastating floods that submerge most of the world below.
Magus confesses to the party that he used to be Prince Janus of Zeal, and that in the original timeline, he and the Gurus of Zeal were scattered across time by Lavos's awakening in 12000 BC. Stranded as a child in 600 AD, Janus took the title of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala. After the Gate in his castle returned him to Zeal, he disguised himself as a Prophet, and, using his knowledge of the future, bided his time for another chance to kill Lavos. At this point, Magus is either killed in a duel with Frog, or spared and convinced to join the party. Either way, he instructs the party to seek out Gaspar, the Guru of Time, to help them resurrect Crono. As they start to leave 12,000 BC, the ruined Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen, Queen Zeal's floating fortress. The party returns to the End of Time, where the old man reveals himself as Gaspar and gives them the ""Chrono Trigger"", an egg-shaped device that allows the group to revisit the moment of Crono's death with a Doppel Doll. The party then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions. Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics, stopping Robo's maniacal AI creator from snuffing out the last of humanity, giving Frog closure for Cyrus's death, locating and charging up the mythical Sun Stone, retrieving the legendary Rainbow Shell, unmasking Guardia's Chancellor as a monster, restoring a forest destroyed by a desert monster, and preventing an accident that disabled Lucca's mother. The party then enter the Black Omen and defeat Queen Zeal, after which they battle Lavos. They discover that Lavos is self-directing his evolution via absorbing DNA and energy from every living creature before razing the planet's surface in 1999 AD, so that it could spawn a new generation to destroy other worlds and continue the evolutionary cycle. The party slay Lavos, and celebrate at the final night of the Millennial Fair before returning to their own times.
If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. If Crono was resurrected before defeating Lavos, his sentence for kidnapping Marle is revoked by her father, King Guardia XXXIII, thanks to testimonies from Marle's ancestors and descendants, whom Crono had helped during his journey. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the Millennial Fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. If Crono was not resurrected, Frog, Robo, and Ayla (along with Magus if he was recruited) chase Gaspar to the Millennial Fair and back again, revealing that Gaspar knows how to resurrect Crono; Marle and Lucca then use the Epoch to travel through time to accomplish this. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. If resurrected, Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.
Chrono Trigger DS added two new scenarios to the game. In the first, Crono and his friends can help a ""lost sanctum"" of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to Trigger's sequel, Chrono Cross. In a New Game Plus, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.
","This is a fun little short meant for those who've played through Chrono Trigger. It stars some minor characters in a spoof/parody comedy.  It was really wacky and quite fun! 
 
Don't go into this expecting an epic OVA covering major events from the main game. For those wanting that, should just play the PS1 or DS version of Chrono Trigger, as it contains some beautiful anime cutscenes depicting some of the major plot points in the game. But chances are you already have, if you are reading this. 
 
I personally enjoyed this short OVA a lot! It brings more life to these characters in which only so much could be accomplished of a 32-bit game. 
 
Nu and Mamo (also known as Kilwala in the US version of the game) were the main characters of this OVA and they were fun while they lasted. Mamo does have a rather annoying voice, but it suits his character and he doesn't overstay his welcome due to the show being so short. The ones that really put a smile on my face were Gonzales (a.k.a Gato in the US) and Johnny! If they ever ended up making more episodes, they'd have to focus on more of the other great characters of Chrono Trigger. But, sadly this was only one episode. 
 
They reference a few other minor things in this short like in the credits when Nu and Mamo were posing in some of the famous locales of the game. So don't just stop watching when the credits roll! 
 
It is really a shame that this wasn't longer or consisted of more episodes featuring more of the Chrono cast. Because this video game is packed with lore, which would be great inside joke material for the fans. This had strong potential to be a well running comedy series based off of a game. But, maybe some fans are happy this was all there was. The budget was probably fairly low due to the mostly simplified character design and somewhat choppy animation. This combined with the loud blunt humor could be taken as a bastardization of the original masterpiece that is Chrono Trigger. When comparing this to other comedy spoofs, this certainly isn't any Carnival Phantasm (not even close), but it does give me a similar vibe. Especially with the racing scene. 
 
Like the Fire Emblem OVA, this had potential to be amazing. But, upon doing some research this wasn't meant to be a big thing. It was just something made by Production I.G for a V-Jump (a Japanese manga and video game magazine) festival. The good time was cut very short, but sweet enough to be worth it to the fans! 
 
TLDR; So definitely give this a watch if: 
•You've beaten Chrono Trigger at least once (if you haven't, then the characters and references won't mean anything to you). 
•You like cheesy comedy and/or parody anime.

       Helpful The only good thing of this anime is the music. Is the same music of the game, that's why it has a ten of mine. The rest is like ""Ha...haha...haha...NOPE"" Gonzalez is the best character and the rest are so derp as Carls @BSTCloud. If you wanna insult him, I will appreciate it. That's all I've gotta say, OST 10, the rest meh. 

          
 
       Helpful This is actually one of my favorite comedy-based OVA's. There are parts within, such as Gato screaming the same thing over and over, or Johnny's inside humor. If you're looking for the original characters of the SNES video game, you won't find them until the very end. Actually, you will only see the back of their heads. This OVA's characters are completely two different creatures that are traveling through time trying to get anyone to join their club. It may seem a little boring at first, but the second half will really make you laugh with Gato's yelling and running wild. 
 
Try it out, I know if you at least enjoyed the game, you will understand most of what happens throughout the OVA.

The work for this was handled by Enix, Pony Canyon, Shochiku film and Nippon animation. Let's delve into the movie and see just where they went with it.  
 
Story: 
 
The story  takes place between Dragon Quest III and the original. We open with a young boy named Arus being trained in swordplay by his... mother... sister... guardian... teacher? It never really says who she is to him. There's a problem with his training, however. He seems unwilling or unable to use the sword as she's trying to teach him or the magic that his elderly mentor is trying to teach him. To make things worse for this kid, the other children think he's a coward. This leads to a competition between him and another boy named Kira to go into a potentially dangerous situation. 
 
Honestly, the story is not bad but it's not good either. The main plot is a pretty cliché coming of age story. Just in a fantasy setting, which has been done plenty of times. There's nothing specifically wrong with it but it does nothing new. As a result, it's pretty predictable.  
 
Characters:  
 
The characters in this are kind of bland. We've got the hesitant hero. The abrasive guy who isn't really a bad person but comes across as kind of a jerk. The older mentor figure and so on. The film never bothers to establish anything about them aside from their archetypal traits. Although, to be fair, the film is less than an hour long and Arus's story arc isn't badly handled. Even though he never really develops beyond the trope.  
 
Art:  
 
The art in this isn't very good. To a degree, it's understandable since this is a film from '96 and they didn't exactly have access to all of the animation technology we do today. However, it isn't even good by the standards of the day. When you compare it to The Slayers, Gundam Wing or Sailor Moon, all of which started earlier but had installments airing at roughly the same time, the art and animation just look lazy. Almost as though they weren't trying.  
 
Sound:  
 
The vocal cast in this is decent. Everyone does competently, although no one gives their best performance. This is a film with Hiramatsu Akiko, Shiozawa Kaneto and Han Keiko, just to name a few. They all do fine, but they don't really have much emotional range to work with so their performances, though competent, are a bit underwhelming. The music is genuinely good. Beinghandled by Wada Kaoru, who also did the music for 3x3 Eyes, and Arai Akino.  
 
Ho-yay:  
 
Most of the characters in this are little kids. So, no ho-yay.  
 
Final Thoughts:  
 
There's not much to say about this one. We have a standard plot with standard characters and standard acting. The movie isn't bad, but it's nothing special or good either. If you don't mind the cliches and you're a huge Dragon Quest fan you might want to consider it. Otherwise, you'll probably just find it dull. My final rating is going to be a 5/10, and I am a fan of the franchise with the 5th game being my favourite. Tomorrow, a different kind of film. In the name of the moon.

And watching this 30 second an episode anime I didnt expect much at all. But knowing the characters, why would they go into the forest? What would provoke them given their individual geek passions to make them go out into the forest together? Maybe Im dumb but nothing comes to mind. So this little mini series is useless and a waste of money in my opinion. they dont belong in the forest, as I (a weeb) doesnt belong in the forest). So the creators of this anime short series needs to reevaluate what they do and do better.

          
 
       Helpful For a short parody series of something that is a comedy show, this is wholly unfunny. I'm a big fan of Kuragehime, and this is probably the most disappointing thing I could have watched. The story isn't very good, and when they try to make jokes, they fall flat. Very flat. I don't even really understand how anyone could find them funny. 
 
For a show with great animation, sound, and character development, it seemed like these all should have been of a decently high quality. Unfortunately, even the sound (which in my opinion is pretty hard to mess up) wasn't nearly as good as the original show. 
 
I found myself not enjoying this at all. If, by some odd choice, you feel like watching it, go ahead. It's a decent enough way to waste three minutes of your time, but there are much better things one could be watching instead. It's honestly a bit of a pity.  
 
Overall, if you're a fan of Kuragehime and are considering watching this, go watch the original. It's much more satisfying than having to sit through even the three minutes of this.

","Here's what I thought for the 5th installment, I liked it. A lot. Why? Let's get started. And bring on the final part already. 
 
Story: 7  
Now some parts of this movie was a bit of a roundabout and redundant, but at least this time we don't have any face rape. I advise, some scenes might be a bit confusing like the recurring digimons, I believe recaps might be necessary. I actually had to rattle my brain a bit to remember some stuff from previous movies as a result. [6.5, if I could for the actual story]  
 
What I really adored was some of the most ""forgotten"" parts of the entire series being brought back up, even if it was a brief moment [like that ocean], was terrific. 
There's one more thing I have to credit the series for, even for this movie, would be the pacing per movie so far. Each of the movie would usually start a bit slow and then around the mid-end, would increase the pace and it doesn't really destroy the story by doing so, this is what I love. Also the humor in the story was really adorable, and builds up some of the characters as a result. [7 for the pacing and atmosphere of the story though] 
 
Art: 7 
Not much to really say, I mean, it just followed up like the previous movies, I liked it, so I just gave it a 7 this time. 
 
Sound: 8 
With some newer tracks added to the movie and including the ending song, which I'm actually fond of, it was pretty nice. As usual the soundtracks befits the scenes appropriately, 8 it was. 
 
Character: 9 
I've enjoyed the characters more than before, especially Taichi's interaction with Meiko, additionally, Agumon and Meiko's interaction. Heck all that reporting, was really fun for me. It was a gossip moment.  
Also the bonds of the digimons with the kids, although they're still traumatized and reluctant, they've went ahead and embraced it.  
I'd really say that the 'relationship' is a major keyword to this installment, especially near the ending. I absolutely loved the ending moment [Omegamon and Taichi's trust, and Yamato's leadership]. 9, my 9. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Once again, I felt like I was a kid, watching and hyping for it. I've enjoyed and savored every moment of it, the humor, the anticipation, and mostly, the childhood factor. Sitting through the movie was easy and is easy, I kept sitting there and finished it without even stopping. It's fun. 
 
Overall: 8 
I'd say that the thing that really set me down with the story was Omegamon at the end of the movie, that completely did the perfect job for me.  
Honestly, I could be simple but I do think it's a fair movie, nonetheless, it's really up to one's judgement and opinion. 

          
 
       Helpful ENG: this fifth movie had everything to be great, but that was not what happened. Speaking first of the good things before going to the bad things (which are not few): the sound part stays in good quality (knowing well when and where to use) and good animation (thank you for not having those 3D animations that happened in the previous film). Well, now comes the bad part. 1- the main story is very weak (the script is not cooperating), because in one of the events (the memories) of one of the previous films, the ""overcoming"" of the problems between digimon and digidestined is being very fast (taking away all the drama from the third film). There is also a great simplification of the plot, there is no deep discourse of what is happening (the whole world is collapsing and then what is done? Stay talking about horror stories! WHAT?!). 2- The coming of several cliche scenes about friendship (some characters do not even seem to have a true friendship. And again, the whole world is urgently in danger and has few options to solve this, what can be done even with a powerful helper? NOTHING. ""Because I believe in the power of friendship"" or ""because if I do something with our"" friend "", she will be sad"" ...... please, serious!? They need is a reality clash! 3- characters that seemed to be interesting are totally wasted (himekawa is a good example of this). 4- a loss of opportunities to show good action scenes (they are not bad, but they look pretty generic. creativity is lacking).In this film many things are too simple, but no a tragedy.  
 
PORT: esse quinto filme tinha tudo para ser ótimo, mas não foi isso que ocorreu. Falando primeiro das coisas boas antes de ir para as coisas ruins ( que não são poucas): a parte sonora se mantém na boa qualidade ( sabendo bem quando e onde usar) e uma boa animação ( obrigado por não ter aquelas animações 3D que houve no filme anterior). Bom, agora vem a parte ruim : 1- a história principal está bem fraca ( o roteiro não está cooperando), pois em um dos acontecimentos (memórias) de um dos filmes anteriores, a ""superação"" dos problemas entre os digimons e digiescolhidos está sendo muito rápida ( tirando facilmente todo o drama do terceiro filme). Além disso, está havendo uma grande simplificação do enredo , não havendo uma discursão profunda do que está acontecendo ( o mundo inteiro está entrando em colapso e aí o que se faz?  Ficar falando sobre histórias de terror! O QUE?! ). 2- a vinda de várias cenas clichês sobre amizade ( alguns personagens nem parece ter uma amizade verdadeira. Novamente, o mundo inteiro urgentimente está em perigo e tem poucas opções para resolver isso, o que se pode fazer mesmo tendo um ajudante poderoso? NADA!. ""Porque eu acredito no poder da amizade"" ou ""porque se eu fizer algo com nosso ""amigo"", ela vai ficar triste""......é sério isso !? Eles precisam é de um choque de realidade! 3- personagens que pareciam ser interessantes são totalmente desperdissados ( himekawa é um bom exemplo disto). 4- uma perda de oportunidades para mostrar boas cenas de ação ( elas não são ruins, mas parecem bem genéricas. Está faltando criatividade). Nesse filme muitas coisas estão simples demais, mas também não é uma tragédia.

          
 
       Helpful Ok let's get right to it, this was really bad. 
 
When it was first announced that the new Digimon Tri series was changing from a television series to 6 movies, I expected the reasoning was to provide higher quality animation. However, it has become apparent that what Toei is truly aiming for; is to maximise movie ticket sales due to Digimon Adventure fans being starved for content.  
 
The majority of the 'movie' is dialogue placed onto still frames, the basics of visual stroytelling is ""show, don't tell"" . The best scene to highlight the failure of that is when it cut to it raining in the digital world and one of the digimon said it was just sunny a minute ago, they could at least  show the transition of the two weather effects. All of these saved costs and I was expecting the climax of the movie to be an all out fight scene, instead we get a slideshow of mega level digimon bumping into each other with no special moves being utilised. Transcendent Sword, terra force, giga blaster, the list goes on. I'm not expecting Your Name or Unlimited Blade Works level of quality but this was embarrassing. 
 
The writing is incredibly poor as well, one moment has the DigiDestined taking refuge at school where they proceed to tell scary stories at night. Although enjoyable for some members of the audience, the scene is misplaced and takes time away from a movie where already very little is happening. The only explanation for this is that they can create likeable characters to allow for more selling of merchandise.  
The 02 cast is completely ignored for no explicit reason, I mean I don't care about Iori or Miyako but the CHARACTERS should. There is no reason for them not to be constantly worried/searching for them, it feels unnatural and shows the writers either aren't willing to put in any real effort or don't care about the original source material. 
Meiko is a pretty divisive character and I am of the side where she detracts from the series. Especially in this movie, she steals screentime and adds nothing to the cast dynamic. It's like they wanted to make a character so shy introverts can relate to her and feel they belong in the digimon cast. She takes up more than half the movie and its showing that she's going to the main hero of the series which is beyond annoying. It was advertised as digimon adventure cast kicking ass, not digimon adventure cast babysitting a wannabe Shinji with none of her character quirks explained. 
 
It's not like it was all terrible, it often has good ideas with terrible execution. If I was in charge and could go back in time, I would create a Digimon prequel movie with the original 5 DigiDestined (Maki and Daigo) and in the end credits of that announce digimon tri. Also would scrap Meiko's character entirely. The story of tri would focus on Maki manipulating Taichi and others to revive Tapirmon while being manipulated herself. That is happening right now but it's kinda displayed in the movies as an afterthought rather than the focus. 
 
I wouldn't be so upset if this was a regular 2 cour series, but this is 6 movies with 6-9 months wait time in between each one and the animation and story is incredibly subpar. I am glad that a digimon adventure sequel even exists but extremely disappointed at how lackluster it is. Toei is exploiting digimon fans and their trust in the franchise to make a few extra dollars.

Most every action has a sound associated with it and most episodes in the first season begin with a quiet jazzy beat accompanied by the rhythmic squeaking noises of Putin dancing Kozachok on his bed. Each episode usually ends with the punchline accompanied by the chorale Jesus bleibet meine Freude from J.S. Bach's cantata Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147. The animation style is a clean, rather sparse, linear style with broad swatches of color. There is, generally speaking, some incomprehensible whispering but usually no intelligible speech. Speech is heard in the second season, when some Russian phrases can be heard quite clearly, although they are few and far between. Everything is communicated through either incidental sound or by a character expressing emotions.

Story 
Finally a major character background element is noticed. No more ""sitting back"" or trying to ""read"" up on is needed. For awhile he was considered silent and angry. Perhaps once he obtains his goal he will change? 
 
Another aspect i liked was the episode countdown. Having three preceding seasons of random episodes lacking back to back information I was expecting the worst. Thankfully i was wrong. Whether it was the artist's or writer's decision the idea of working the episodes for the season in with the floors of ""adventure"" was nice for not only provided balance but allowed the viewer to catch up with what he had missed. 
 
Ending however was not quite pleasing. While a goal was reached it didn't seemed to but the main characters in a position for future progress. If anything it seemed like the director wanted to end the story there. Thankfully, knowing at least two seasons remain it doesn't for there are a couple big questions remaining. Such as why the imprisonment? Do the main characters know each other before the jail sentence in season zero. 
 
Lastly, i enjoyed the relation the story had to the settings. Even though it had different names for all the key parts the concept was the same. Meaning, if you see big lights, casinos and women chances are you may be in Vegas. While in Vegas it doesn't take long to know luck is a major player. But to whom becomes the victor of this luck... the main characters or the villain(s)?

","**THIS IS A REVIEW OF ALL 6 MOVIES** 
**CONTAINS SPOILERS!!** 
 
*Animation* 
 
What bothers me the most in the entire Digimon Tri is the lack of facial animations and how emotions are displayed. I remember seeing  
many scenes where terrible things are happening in front of the characters eyes and they look like they don't even care. Sure they are  
adults and all but if they keep talking about things like friendship and digimon companions, I would expect to see a little more shock  
in their faces when things go bad. The biggest insult however is the fact that many times I see characters staring to distance without  
even saying anything to each other like they forgot their own lines or something. Like cmon, atleast try to create convincing discussion about something.. 
 
*Fights* 
 
All the fights between the digimons seem to be a bit rushed and there are even scenes where certain powerful digimons get beaten by a  
significantly weaker digimons. (Example: Magna Angemon ((Ultimate level digimon)) gets beaten by Devimon ((Champion level digimon)).  
If evolutions mean nothing and all the digimons can suddenly be as strong as any other digimon what is even the point of the evolution? 
 
*Story* 
 
Its a mess. There is this digimon that somehow is key for destroying the human world and digital world and its human partner is somehow  
a link that was suppressing it from going berserk. However in the end they will just outright murder the digimon because there was  
nothing else left to do. Thats some nice companionship isn't it? 
 
I didn't like Digimon Tri very much. If it was up to me to decide this show wouldn't even exist. Its clearly riding on the nostalgia of the older series and does many things too wrong.

          
 
       Helpful Here we is, the end of adventure tri, am i disappointed? not much, i have break with digimon from 2016 to 2017 and appmon saved my hopes with the franchise's future, but i already expecting the series won't be this good, since i have watched the first two ovas before the break...then i became disappointed as i thought, since i have watched the first two ovas before this break 
you know, i was really hyped for this ova, really. I remember seeing the trailers and really freaking out with it a thinking ""OW THIS REALLY DON'T LOOK LIKE TOEI"" and i need to say, i really liked ""saikai"", looks like they really trying to update digimon adventure...but them i realize...it was just a fanservice. 
Every fucking digimon fanboy whant to see omegamon and alphamon fighting just to see who is the strongest royal knight, and bringing it to the most overrated series was the icing on the cake.  
And, i wasn't thinking the art style was weird, really i liked THE HUMANS, but the digimon looked more polygonal than the 3D models used in the champion evolution(the only good one was angemon and kabuterimon), the animation out of battle was pretty cool...but in battle looks like some hiccups: moviment,frame pause(hiccup),moviment, frame pause (hiccup) 
ok was that the other digimon have the mega forms...but THEY GET FROM NOWHERE THIS FORMS. in the first season they only envolved because of that crests (that was the most stupid thing to do but it's worked in a children's weekly anime), in 02 they only envolved to ultimate do qinglongmon's digicore AND NOW THEY SIMPLY ENVOLVED TO THEM BECAUSE OF WHAT? seriously, is this some new trend in toei to breaking it's own concepts(yeah dragon ball super, i was talking about YOU). And the story ended in a cliff hanger... if this ending in a series created only to get money through nostalgia( like the whole ova wasn't this, right ? and yes was talking about DB super again) i won't be surprised. 
I only gave so much scores because i was waiting to see how it ends, it's allways so hyped and getting (edgier) darker and darker but , in the end DON'T COME TO NOTHING.

          
 
       Helpful *This is a review of the whole series, not just the 6th movie. Also: This review contains spoilers.* 
 
I'm almost positive a lot of people only watched Digimon Adventure Tri due to it being a sequel to the highly popular and well received Digimon Adventure. Same old characters, same old Digimon ... no fan would want to miss that. Naturally, expectations were high. 
 
To be fair, one could have had low expectations and still be disappointed. That's how bad the whole series is. It lacks structural integrity, thrill and character depth, it's inconsistently paced and even the animation quality is below average. 
 
Now the premise of the story isn't that bad to begin with. Digimon are infected by a virus which causes them to violently attack other Digimon and even humans. So far, you can at least feel some sort of danger luring the dark, waiting to be discovered.  
 
The second movie focuses on our characters and tries to give them a bit of backstory and personality, which could have been important for the course of the story. However, in the third movie, the story suddenly blows up. Buzzwords like ""Homeostasis"" and ""Reboot"" fly in. What was once a mission to stop the infection of Digimon is now a mission to stop the digital world from being rewritten, which would cause all Digimon to lose their memories. The digital world is still rebooted at the end of movie. In the fourth movie we learn that the big bad guy behind everything is Yggdrasil, a god-like being that wants to create a new world where Digimon and humans cannot interact anymore. Also Gennai has somehow been manipulated by Yggrasil to be evil. What we were told in third movie (that Digimon lose their memories after a reboot) also seems to have exceptions, as Meicoomon has mysteriously retained her memories. In the fifth movie the digital world suddenly begins to destroy the real world. In the last movie, the apocalypse has set in and our DigiDestined are trying their best to fight Ordinemon, an entity that could have originated from Neon Genesis Evangelion. They are losing badly, but of course, with the power of friendship, even the mightiest foe poses no threat. So the story ends with Meicomoon being finally put to rest and suddenly all problems are gone. 
 
The characters aren't exactly ""bad"", but they are only average, one-dimensional and they all have seen more development in Digimon Adventure. Meiko is just poorly written. Her contribution to the overall plot is about 0. I'm not a hater because she wasn't part of the original 8 DigiDestined, but it's hard to accept her because she's a shallow character that is of nearly no relevance at all. 
On the enemies' part, things look a bit different. They are almost all lacking motives, something that I feel is absolutely necessary for a good show. As a viewer, I should be able to comprehend the heroes as much as the enemies. Sadly, Digimon Adventure Tri rarely gives us insight. Like, why did Himekawa hide information from the DigiDestined? What was Yggdrasils ultimate plan? What sparked his decision? You don't come up with the idea to destroy the human world just because you're bored. 
 
The soundtrack is mediocre, unremarkable and generic. Two of the better tracks are the Tri version of ""Butterfly"" and ""Brave Heart"", but even they are just remixes from Digimon Adventure. ""Butterfly"" has been used in like 3 different versions in the last episode alone. I like this track, but why not be a bit more ... creative? 
 
The animation quality is also only mediocre at best. Especially in the last movie, so many still images are used, that you get the feeling that there's no animation at all. It makes the movie look poor with a low production value. I also expected a much better choreography of the Digimon's moves, because you know ... it's 2018 (or at least 2015). 
 
There are some additional things that bugged me, for example: 
 
a) The absence of logic in the final fight. There were some game changing moves pulled out of thin air, just to have a happy ending. How should I be able to feel the thrill of danger, if it's clear beforehand that our DigiDestined will overcome every obstacle? 
 
b) Digimon only act a plot devices, rather than characters. Something I liked about Digimon Adventure back in the days was it's emphasis on both the human world, digital world and the human characters and Digimon alike (think about the Ogremon vs. Leomon conflict). Nothing of that remained in Digimon Adventure Tri. 
 
Fans will probably like the returning characters and their Digimon partners, as well as the new mega evolutions we never got to see in action when we were kids. Aside from the fact that the story isn't entirely trash and the characters are at least average, I have very few other positive things to say about Digimon Adventure Tri as a whole. Sadly, I can't recommend it to other people, not even fans of the original Digimon Adventure.

For those who don't know I am Josh and I am here to review the anime that like Eiken is board line hentai. That's right folks. Today I am reviewing bikini warriors which is somehow surprisingly PG 13....Let's just get on with this. 
 
Story- ...The title is self explanatory. Like really. If your expecting anything but ecchi, fan service and board line hentai moments you are in the wrong place. I mean just reading the title can tell you what this is going to be. 
 
Anyway the show is set in an rpg type environment which was to a point. Mildly amusing at best. It about 4 big breast girls doing...well pretty much what you do in RPG just with loads of fan service and ecchi moments. The show is episodic and is only 4 minutes long. Doesn't overstay it's welcome to a certain extent. You can just breeze past this in one day really. Personally I didn't find it to be that funny at all, it had it moments though that brought out a chuckle but that's it really. Another issue is the pointless cliff hangers which got annoying a little and were pointless since each episode was something entirely different and had nothing to do with those cliffhangers. Overall the story gets a 4/10. It wasn't God awful but it is bad. 
 
Art- Probably the only high point of this anime from me. The animation decent for what it is. I got no issue with the character designs that much really. Other than that my main issue is that they relied so much on panty and boob shots and tons of fan service moments to again make me wonder why MAL says this is a Pg-13 anime. Overall it gets a 5/10 I guess 
 
Sound- I usually would judge opening and endings but this anime didn't really have one so I'll avoid those. The voice acting was meh to me. It wasn't bad and it wasn't good either tbh. 4/10 is the overall score 
 
Characters- Just generic girls to a tee with big breast in this (Not Eiken level, so don't worry about that). A fighter, a Mage, a Palladian and a dark elf....I could assume and make jokes on why she is called that but I won't. These characters are just your basic things that you can be in rpg games just with big breast and a shit ton of fan service and board line porn moments 
 
Oh and if your wondering why I have said this characters names...they don't have any. Really I sh*t you not. The creators of this were so lazy, that they just named them Fighter, Mage, Paladian and Dark Elf..,you know...cause she black...and she's an elf... 
 
I'll just stop now. 
 
Enjoyment- I pretty much knew what I was walking into and my expectations like for anything like this was extremely low as hell or just average. Overall this is just average enjoyment. 5/10 
 
Overall- Not the worst thing I've seen, but far from good to. It not appalling of horrible but you have to have a sh*t ton of tolerance when you watch this anime. The comedy is bad and it mostly relies on the fan service and board line porn moments. Overall Bikini Warriors gets a 4/10

It's not a Bikini if it's armor, right? 
  
Bikini Warriors... man was I ever wrong about this series. I was right, but so, so wrong. When I first saw the title art on the upcoming series, I had immediately and unabashedly 'bashed' this series as that odious, shameless cash grab for that all powerful ecchi market that permeates anime these days.  
 
However, let me be the first to admit that Bikini Warriors is a much more clever anime than it EVER deserved to be.  
 
----- 
 
See, Bikini Warriors is both exactly what you'd expect from a show with women's swimwear in the name, and completely the opposite as well. As a concept, this is not new- but what it does do is bring just enough self awareness to make you not feel like you need a shower immediately after watching. It actually does have genuinely funny moments- and in a show that runs 5 minutes, start to finish, something entertaining has to happen- and it does.  
 
Bikini Warriors' humor consists of various MMO (and video game culture in general) jokes, like the ubiquitous fetch quests for useless items, raiding and grinding dungeons for loot, only to get useless crap or something you already have, and the kicker- the Armor Dealer sells them armor that looks exactly the same as their underwear, BUT IT'S MAGIC DEFENSIVE ARMOR! Because everyone knows female characters need armor, but not on the boobs or butt.  
 
The heroes steal from the townspoeple because... well, they're the heroes. They break in and announce themselves, and like the brainless NPCS they are, the townspeople don't even notice their homes and clay pots being ransacked, and completely don't care.  
 
--- 
""We're the heroes, and as such we invoke our right to confiscate items we need for our quest!"" 
--- 
 
Of course, there's also the typical MMO dialogue garbage, that the heroines try desperately to skip through, but they need to be told for the millionth time that they ""already had the key inside themselves, they just had to discover it"". The untimely betrayal... the self sacrifice... and the cliffhangers. Bikini Warriors manages to weave up every fantasy story trope into one very tight string.  
 
I discovered that Bikini Warriors wasn't just a stupid boob fest, too. Did it have it inside itself all along?  
Well, the short answer is no. There's still a ton of tentacles and nudity thrown up onto the screen in every episode. If it's not a chest full of eels, then it's a giant squid monster, or a pervy questgiver. Even these are lampshaded though- parodying typical boss monsters and whatnot, but it's still gross.  
 
 
Overall: 
 
Despite being bombarded by ecchi and fanservice laden shows every season, I'm still no closer to being a fan of these kinds of shows, but I have to give Bikini Warriors credit: for a show I immediately pegged as being ""probably one of the stupidest, painful to watch things ever animated"", I was incredibly surprised by the inclusion of some honest-to-goodness humor. Humor that made me laugh a little in spite of how awful this could have been.

I have watched EVERY episode and never felt obligated to place any rules of any kind in reviewing this fun, bawdy, irreverently sarcastic show.  
 
Seriously, this is naughty comedy. Does anyone really want more from this show other than boobs, butts and shallow dialogue? I laughed my ass off just taking the awesomely paced in-your-face sheer (hmm really) attitude the creators threw down. Take that feminazis! Many newcomers to anime have no clue how it ALL began. Sigh. One could go on. Never mind. 
 
Being an ecchi fan from the beginning of my anime life, this mini-anime brings back memories and fills them with renewed energy. Animation is the groundwork of any anime, story supports art.  Animating human movement is key to bringing characters to life. Adding humor to ecchi is not easily done well. I laughed quite a bit watching EVERY episode, despite the occasional ghost.  
 
Story is weak, for sure a bit disjointed. So what! Ecchi rocks the anime world no matter what the drama (miserable) queens say. Beats squeaky-voiced high-school dramadies that go on and on for endless no ends. 
 
Done here. Woohooo Warriors in Bikinis!

","I didn't know what I was getting myself into by watching the movie over the anime so after a quick coin toss, I decided to watch the movie and also because someone said it was more detailed than the anime version.  
 
I realized I wasn't a huge fan about halfway through the movie. The movie was okay. I didn't connect with any characters like I usually do so I'm not taking that as a good sign and most of the movie was dull in my opinion. 
 
Nothing really eventful happened but I guess that's why there's a second movie - to put everything that should be shocking into the final installment.  
 
It also kind of bothered me that Chizuru was only capable of calling out people's names over and over again...almost until the point where she sounded like every other whiny ass female out there.  
 
But with all that being said, I'm going to watch the second movie and hopefully I'll like that better than this one.

ART: The art part of the characters is very good. The movements and the design of the characters is really good, something that is not really easy .Almost all the male here are samurai which mean from clothes to movements animation is challenging. 
CHARACTERS: Well..to be honest the characters are the typical reversed harem charecters. All nice , good looking dudes that likes the useless heroine and will save her from every prosibe threat. As for the heroine she is a cute little crybaby that can't do many things and end ups been protected every time. 
STORY: Actually the story is pretty nice. It is really interesting and and plot. The demon and samurai thing match well. 
OVERALL: It's not a masterpiece but it's a nice movie to pass your time if you like light-reversed-harem shoujo anime. Εven if the characters aren't that interesting the plot is very good and promising.Personally I will definitely watch the second movie.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shounen']","
The series is largely based on numerous stories from One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), most notably the tales of Aladdin, Ali Baba, and Sinbad the Sailor. The story is set in an alternate recreation of the ancient Old World with several regions and nations having some resemblances with real-life counterparts from that time. In this world, all living beings possess an essence known as Rukh (ルフ, Rufu) and when they die, this essence returns to the huge flow (also known as ""guidance"") of Rukh that gives life to all subsequent beings in an eternal cycle of rebirth called ""Fate"". Once a person is overcome with sadness, anger, and hopelessness, their Rukh becomes corrupted, unstable, and black, and deviates from the main guidance in a process known as ""Fall into Depravity"" (堕転, Daten).
There are also several magic castles full of treasures and traps known as ""Dungeons"", which are each the lair of a powerful magic being, a Djinn (ジン, Jin). Individuals that manage to overcome the trials of a Dungeon and earn the allegiance of its Djinn are known as Dungeon Capturers (迷宮（ダンジョン）攻略者, Danjon Kōryakusha), gaining the ability to use its powers infused in a personal item of theirs known as a ""Metal Vessel"" and create less potent ""Household Vessels"" for their companions as well.
People can use the Rukh in their bodies to create an energy known as Magoi (マゴイ) to power their magical weapons and abilities. This energy must be used with care, as despite the fact that an individual's magoi can be restored with feeding and rest, once fully exhausted it causes their death. Among those that can perform magic with their own Magoi there is a rare class of magicians known as Magi (マギ), that can also use Magoi from the Rukh around them, greatly increasing their capabilities. A Magi usually chooses Dungeon Capturers to offer guidance and protection making them into their King Vessels (王の器, Ō no Utsuwa). There are several nations in history that were founded or improved by the rule of such individuals.
Fourteen years ago, a structure appeared from the sea, turning into a gigantic tower. Thousands of people entered, and did not come out. Until one day, it gets conquered by two special people, a Magi and a King.
Magi centers around Alibaba Saluja (a young man aiming to capture the nearby dungeon, Amon) and Aladdin (a traveler with a Djinn named Ugo in his flute). Witnessing the power of Aladdin's Djinn, Alibaba finds an opportunity to go dungeon diving with him. Aladdin and Alibaba eventually become friends, and conquer Amon together, despite facing Jamil and his slaves, Morgiana and Goltas. After a desperate fight, Aladdin and Alibaba assist Morgiana in breaking the mental chains that bind her to Jamil. Alibaba claims the dungeon while the Djinn Amon appears to briefly explain that Aladdin is a Magi and Alibaba is his king's candidate. However, they are interrupted by an outside force trying to close the dungeon off. Alibaba, Aladdin, and Morgiana escape the dungeon while Goltas resolves to die to atone for his sins along with Jamil, but not before cutting Morgiana's shackles. Aladdin ends up sent to a distant land, far from the others, where he learns he is a Magi. Having no news of his friend, Alibaba uses the treasure he obtained in Amon to free all slaves in the city, including Morgiana and returns to Balbadd, his homeland.
Aladdin and Morgiana encounter Sinbad, the first Dungeon Capturer and the king of Sindria. They eventually reunite with Alibaba in Balbadd, where they learn that he has joined the Fog Troupe, a cadre of thieves opposing the tyrannical rule of Abhmad, Alibaba's half-brother. Alibaba makes the monarchy a republic nation in Balbadd, however, Balbadd ends up annexed to the Kou Empire, a powerful Eastern nation that plans to conquer the entire world with the pretense of ending all conflict.
Aladdin, Alibaba, and Morgiana are brought to Sindria. They train under the members of Sinbad's household to get stronger and help stop the mysterious organization, Al-Thamen, that works secretly to spread chaos throughout the world as part of an unknown agenda. The trio befriends Hakuryuu Ren, a prince of the Kou Empire visiting Sindria, whom they help to conquer the dungeon of Zagan; where after confronting members of Al-Thamen there, the group separate upon return. Aladdin studies at Magnostadt Academy to study magic and investigate the country's ties to Al-Thamen. Alibaba goes to train with the Yambala Gladiators in the Reim Empire to fix his magoi, so he can achieve his complete Djinn Equip. Hakuryuu returns to the Kou Empire, and Morgiana departs to the Dark Continent.
A year later, Aladdin and Alibaba are reunited during Reim's and Kou's campaign to conquer Magnostadt. As a last resort, Matal Mogamett summons an army of Dark Djinns with a huge mass of Black Rukh stored in its deepest level to defeat the invaders for good, but Aladdin reveals that by doing this, Mogamett unwillingly helped Al-Thamen to get closer to their main objective; to summon Ill Ilah, whose advent will cause the world's destruction. The medium appears, and Alibaba and his friends join forces with the Kou Empire, Reim, and the Alliance of Seven Seas to stop it.
A few months later after Alibaba revisits Balbadd, representatives from Kou, Reim and Sindria gather for a summit organized by Sinbad. At the summit, Aladdin reveals that mankind was originally several distinct species transformed by magic into humans from the world of Alma-Torran, located in another dimension. Ill Ilah, had its magoi stolen by Aladdin's father, King Solomon, in order to create a destiny favorable to the people of Alma-Torran. Resisting this change, the members of Al-Thamen summoned Ill llah to the world sapping its magoi by destruction.  Solomon is forced to give his life to seal away Ill Ilah and Al-Thamen. Solomon gave his magoi to Ugo, and Ugo used it to create the current world and transport everyone from Alma-Torran to this world.
Suddenly, Hakuryuu Ren and Judar start a civil war in the Kou Empire. Alibaba and Aladdin rush to the Kou Empire to talk sense into Hakuryuu, however, they realize that he has fallen into depravity. The two duos fight and Alibaba and Judar end up as casualties. After the war ends, Sinbad starts his plan of bringing a new era of peace to the world, while Aladdin, Morgiana and Hakuryuu take separate ways. Alibaba meets the people of Alma Torran who proceed to help him get revived. Later, Judar and Alibaba meet on the other side of the Dark Continent, where they encounter the Mother Dragon who decides to assist them in traveling back to the mainland, however this would be a long journey. While traveling back, Mother Dragon reveals that Ill Ilah's persona has been corrupt by David, the father of King Solomon. He is also revealed to be connected to Sinbad and wants to become God of all.
Three years later, Alibaba reappears and solves the Kou Empire's economic problems. He reunites with his friends after they defeat Arba, apparently destroying Al-Thamen for good, but Arba's spirit turns to Sinbad, and together, they reach the Sacred Palace and Sinbad defeats Ugo taking over the palace. Sinbad rewrites the Rukh system; the only way for happiness is by turning into Rukh, or death. Alibaba and Aladdin joins forces with Judar and Hakuryuu to confront Sinbad, but just after they reach a compromise, David appears and takes control of the Sacred Palace; returning all souls to the Rukh was his original plan. David enters world and starts causing chaos and destroying everything to turn it back into Rukh. Alibaba struggles to defend the world; he faces more trouble when the entire world is working for David because are brainwashed due to the Rukh change, and are fighting Alibaba. Yunan and Aladdin confront the real David, in the form of a child. The spell of rewriting the Rukh gets stopped. Alibaba's allies who were fighting him have now teamed up with him. Sinbad helps kill David by sacrificing all his power into killing him; it is unknown whether Sinbad is dead or alive. The Magi system, dungeons, metal vessel, sacred palace, and the continental chasm, disappear, leading the nations unify their efforts to create a better future. After Alibaba visits Cassim's grave, he marries Morgiana.
","[UPDATED]  
 
Like anything to do with Sinbad, the oh great and glorious conqueror of the Seven Seas, it's mostly the same but they add some depth into the way he goes about his life and how he got to where he is.  
 
With the third OVA released I couldn't wait to watch it and I did straight away, even being in area with little to no internet, I loaded the episode and watched it when it was done and man did I enjoy it! It was everything I wanted (well except the cliffhanger :/).  
 
Story (8) 
 
It's all about SINBAD! when it comes to these OVA's, hence the name. It goes through early life troubles of himself, his family, his village and his comrade Drakon. The story works well and they show everything needed and it's very easy to understand which is good if you're looking for a easy and relaxing OVA to watch.  
 
The story for the new OVA is about one of Sinbad's eight generals in his early life and he must prove himself as a man in front of his sister by slaying a sea monster, while on the verge of death, Sinbad comes outta no where and slays the beast and saves them. He gets invited to their isolated icy village and hears about a new dungeon and he warns the village not to go and that he must do it so no one else would get killed. With Hinahoho getting false credit for slaying the beast, he wants to prove himself and goes to the dungeon.  
 
Art (9) 
 
It's the complete same as the normal anime so their won't be any surprises when you watch this, there's detail on characters that don't need a lot of detail for them so that's a good touch.  
 
The art always amazes me and with the third OVA it still did, to me it just added the icing to the cake after the long wait for this.  
 
Sound (8) 
 
Just like the normal anime so if you enjoyed the sound in that, you'll enjoy it in this :). 
 
Character (7) 
 
They don't go into very much detail with any character, a little with Sinbad but other than that, no. Sinbad was born with great power, oh cool, and cliché. With the rest of the characters, they're just military people and want power, not much of a big surprise. On the other hand Yunan is a mysterious character with little known about him.  
 
In the third OVA they introduce Hinahoho and his little icy village, along with a few more characters such a his sister, father, etc. With all the new characters added, I thought they did well with giving us enough information about them all and made it a very good watch.  
 
Enjoyment (9) 
 
I thought that this was a great watch, mainly because I get to watch more Magi.  
 
Overall (8) 
 
I have enjoyed all of the OVA's that have been released so far and with the 4th one being announced, I just can't help myself to get excited. I can't wait.  
 
I hope this review was helpful. 
 
(With this being newly updated for the third OVA, I will be updating it again for the earlier episodes and adding more to the review). 

          
 
       Helpful I must admit, the tale of Sinbad- King of Sindria, Conqueror of the Seven Seas, a legendary man whose mythical adventures have been woven into countless movies, books, and cloth- is a rather difficult story to tell. So far, Magi season one and two have both done exceptionally well in portraying Sinbad as a grown man in charge of a nation. Rather than sticking to just the classic mold of ""Sinbad the great sailor!"" or ""Sinbad the witty, flirty, virtuous bad boy!"", they add depth by darkening the inner workings of his tactical mind. However, the same effort in characterization was not applied to either of the OVAs of Sinbad's adventures.  
 
STORY (6) 
 
The first OVA begins on a dark, stormy evening with the screech of a woman in the midst of an excruciating labor which just happens to be occurring during a magical, mystical, wondrous night full of shooting stars, glowing genie lamps, and the classic array of oddities that only happen ""once every thousand of years"". If this were any other anime, this would be an irritating (and frightful) way to start off the episode but because it's Magi and it blends together legends with just the right amount of originality, I gave it some leeway. After all, the intro music was fantastic, and if you're a Magi fan already, at this point you're cracking your knuckles cause Sin's finally in town! There's no way this can go- 
 
..wrong...And before you know it, the producers have dragged you into one of the most cliche, overdone story lines known to fairy tales. Sinbad's portrayed as the classic hero, complete with a tragic background story, the help of a supernaturally gifted stranger, and everything else that serves as the pedestal upon which this adolescent's destiny sits- awaiting his overbearing greatness. While the main character's traits are clearly established alongside the antagonists' and a clear goal is conveyed, the origin- the story behind the very essence of Sinbad's character is unfortunately, not the work of just his own hands, but of the imperious power of 'destiny' that he was assigned from birth.  
 
The second episode of the OVA consists of Sinbad and Commander Drakon's meeting, and together, they face the creatures of the dungeon. While this episode is action-packed and amusing, it fails to retain any hold on reality when Sinbad flips the bird to every law in physics. Another irk is that Yunan can be officially branded as the deus ex machina magi when he appears out of nowhere to do nothing but act like Sinbad's personal magician. The final moments of the episode are drenched in a vat of cliche tropes. 
 
The third OVA, however, redeems this series more than I hoped. It finally introduces a brand new character and hurries along the plot to a possible dungeon fight that may occur. This episode brings back the classic excitement that often accompanies the tales of Sinbad. If the series is ever continued or revived separately, any episodes from here on out will surely lead to a better telling of Sinbad's adventure and it may finally give his character the depth it deserves.  
 
ART (8) 
 
The art is just as amazing as it was in the series- perhaps even more so. Details are not shirked and even minor characters are given diverse facial features that go beyond the usual haphazard sketches. The quality of the other two episodes is similar, yet not quite on par with the extraordinary display of the first. Nevertheless, the animation itself is enjoyable overall. 
 
SOUND (7) 
 
As is the soundtrack- the only two notable bits of music being at the beginning and ending of the first OVA, the ending rock instrumental that rolled with the credits at the end of the second OVA, and everything else flows on the waves of equilibrium.  
 
CHARACTER (5) 
 
Here's where they stopped hammering the nail in halfway through the script. 
 
With a dead father, a sick mother who feels guilty for worrying her son, a village jam packed with kids and adults alike who absolutely adore Sinbad because he's just so NICE, so speshul, so won-der-ful!~ 
 
He's everyone's favorite guy! 
Everyone's awed and inspired by him, 
And it's not hard to see why, 
Cause no one's slick as Sinbad, 
No one's as quick as Sinbad, 
No one's hair is incredibly long and luxurious as Sinbad's! 
For there is no other teen in town half as heroic, 
Perfect, a classic archetype! 
You can ask any Natsu, Lelouch, or Levi, 
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on! 
There's only just one guy in town who's got it going on, 
And his name is SINBAAAADDD! 
 
Unfortunately, Sinbad's characterization falls flat. They might as well have inserted the song montage in the background to accompany the numerous occasions that validated the glorious, inherent valor of Sinbad who- around the age of four, 'somehow' supernaturally directed his father which way to row their boat to get out from under the raging storm. He all but rowed the damn thing himself- which, of course, would have been far too absurd to show. It's understandable that the directors want to stick to the conventional tale but Magi's been about deviating from the given plot line and spicing it up. I honestly looked forward to the twisting of Sinbad's tale into something thrilling-perhaps about a boy who wasn't meant for greatness, but instead I was met with the same old generic set-up for a child's play of heroism. 
 
As for less familiar characters such as the traveling magi: Yunan, or the ruthless military commander leading the next dungeon raid: Prince Dragul, and his childhood family friend: Princess Serendine- they all attempt to squeeze their personas into trope coffins as if the entire point of their existence is to offset our main character as the 'good guy' who always knows the right thing to do. By the time we reach the second OVA, the characters still lack depth. The third OVA, on the other hand, redeems itself by introducing new ones that gain depth through the hurried narration of events- which fits the pace at which Sinbad leads his adventures. Although the episode ends as a cliff-hanger, it holds much more potential than the first two stints.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
All in all, the three-pack episodes of Sinbad's adventures are mildly amusing. The art is superior to that of the series itself and the soundtrack appears new- making it a worthy watch if only for the sake of aesthetics. However, the plot line itself is lackluster in comparison to the series due to the standards (of the original series) that it's held against. At the very least, the OVAs can be viewed as the classically cliche retelling of the animated version of Sinbad the Sailor with the conjunction of Magi's take on magic- making the shortened tale an entertaining ride till the very end.

       Helpful Shukufuku no Campanella 
Genre: Slice of Life, Comedy Magic, Drama, action (minor), Ecchi (Minor) 
Length: 12 episodes - 24 minutes each. 
 
I'd had Shukufuku in my ""To-Watch"" list for a while. I'd downloaded the Blue-Ray versions, so I knew I was going to be getting an HQ expereince. 
 
The first thing I wanna say about Shukufuku is it SCREAMS ""RPG game"". It's EXACTLY like an old style RPG or MMO game. You've got the character classes (Engineer, Mage, Swordsman, Pupeteer, Berserker etc), a fantasy world, standard monsters and a big boss fight at the end. Know this before you get into it, because it stands SO faithfully to that trope. Which, in my opinion, was a GOOD thing. 
 
Shukufuku is about a guild in the land of Ert'Aria called ""Clan Oasis"". It's headed up by the pretty mage Carina, and includes the bishounen (and very feminie) main character Leicester (Which is pronouced ""Lester"" by the way). When a huge burst of magic activates a VERY human like automaton named Minette, who calls Leiceter ""Papa"", the Clan takes her in. 
 
Now, without giving away any plot details, I can tell you that Shukufuku is a very relaxing anime. The quests the guild goes on involve taking on some monsters now and then (so yes, theres action), and then a mildly darker plot involving Minette pans out at episode 7. 
 
Now down to the review. 
 
Shukufuku is a really fascintating watch. I've never watched anythign that adheres so typicaly to the old RPG style before. Swordsman (Or swordsWOMAN in this case), Pupeteer, engeneer and Mage are all present. 90% of them are female by the way. In fact, only Leicester and the main antagonist are men. Oh and theres ""Nick"" a Berserker warrior in the guild who's so unmemorable it took me 5 episodes to remember his name, and everytime he showed up I had to remind myself he existed. 
 
Shukufuku takes it slow. VERY slow. Theres next-to-no ""plot"" for 7 episodes. Well there IS plot but its simple quests and adventures that involve taking on low level monsters. In a way, its a very ""realistic"" aproach to a fantasy world. If you lived in a magical land, it's NOT going to be monsters, villians and save-the-world adventure everyday like ""Fairy Tail"" would have you believe. In fact, it'd probebly be quite peaceful, which is what Shukufuku is. For this reason, Shukufuku is more like a ""slice-of-life"" anime than anything else. 
 
Shukufuku has a beautiful art style thats soft and uses light colour shades. It's really well done and definently one of the most appealing parts of the anime. 
 
Shukufuku moves at a relaxing pace right up until the final episode, which features a host of awesome, high impact action scenes. Unfortunatly, this feels a bit rushed. I really wished they'd had a few more episodes. Hell could have been a 24 episode anime and had a bit more time to develop the final lead in. I was pretty disapointed with the last part of the fight, where for no reason, a holy sword appears infront of the swordsman with no lead in. 
 
Characters is where Shukufuku shines! Leicester, the male lead, is really likable as a guy. He's not really like other male protagonist. He's geninuly a good guy who does his job. He isn't very strong or overpowered, he's just inteligent. He's of the ""engeneer"" class, he makes things. His weapon is a cool gunblade he made himself. I really like that they made an engenner the main character instead of the swordsman. He's very relatable. Handsome too, as almost every girl in the series is after him. But thats a given. 
 
Carina, the cute mage girl and female lead was my personal favorite. Like Leicester, she's relatable. It's not like she's the ultimate mage who excelles at all spells. She's just a strong spellcaster. That's about it as well. In terms of physical strength, she's weak. 
She's the type of character who's mature and calm about everything. Even when in the fight of her life, she remains calm enough to focus her spells.The only time she ever gets worked up is in a comedic way when another girl gets close to Leicester. 
 
Of notable mention here are the twin girls Salsa and Ritos. They are a hillerious duo of guild workers who use a stone-mech Golum. Salsa tries her best to do the right thing, but Ritos is detirmed to troll her at every point. It's so funny, with Salsa getting worked up over Ritos sheer ""I don't give a shit"" attitude. 
 
Sound and music matches the art style fairly well. It's calming and soft most of the time. It's not really notable. I barely remember it, so I wouldn't call it fantastic. 
 
Oh yes, I almost forgot. Shukufuku is adapted from a hentai eroge, like fate/stay night. It retains a little ecchiness because of this. In reality, it probebly would have worked just to leave the few hentai scenes in. Theres one scene that's blatently a lead in to a H-scene but is obviously removed. 
 
Ecchi is limited to a few full-nudity shots in a bathroom or changing-clothes enviroment. It's good because it feals really ""natrual"". Ecchi anime often feature clothes being toarn apart in battle so characters are fighting naked. This doesn't happen in Shukufuku. (The characters DO take clothing damage, but its not like ""oh no, my entire clothes have been destroyed showing off my boobs"". More like ""damn, tore my skirt""). It's not actualy fair to call it an ecchi. 
 
Overall, Shukufuku no Campanella is enjoyable, but not that memorable. It's going to stick with me mostly for its chracters and adherence to the RPG style. It's not an amazing anime, BUT it's worth a watch. Check this one out if you have some spare time and it sounds like your type of thing. Just know that its going to be a fairly basic ride without a lot of thrills and only simple action.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, a review of Blessing of the Campanella! *rubs hands together eagerly* 
I'm actually a little surprised in myself for actually making this review, but I just recently finished it and I thought it at least deserved a mention of some kind. This was not a groundbreaking anime, nor was it an absolutely horrid one. 
 
Story: One thing I liked about the story was its setting. Sometimes I'm a sucker for fantasy, which I did not know would be involved in this. So seeing the 'Shouseki Monsters' appear, and the group stepping up to the plate to kick some Crystallized demon butt was actually pretty cool. It starts off with the re-awakening of a young automaton girl named Minette. The concept of an automatan is basically that of a robotic human which is related to the 'Eru' that flows in the city. That being said, they really did not elaborate on the purposes of automatan. Minette seemed to act like a normal young girl, so she didn't perform anything particularly special (even up until the very end.) There also was only maybe 2 or 3 automatans in the entire series: I mean you'd think these things would be important, but I guess not. *shrugs* Alongside this, the real problem did not present itself until the 7th episode, which annoyed me as its about halfway. The last 4 episodes were the most enjoyable of the series for me, so it wasn't entirely fast-paced either. 5 overall. 
 
Art: I'll admit, it was the art that first drew me into watching this show. I looked at the promotional picture and thought, ""This looks like a really cute and enjoyable anime."" I didn't think it looked like anything amazing, but something to just kick back and relax to. This vibe was executed well with the art, and though the designs weren't the most original of things, I enjoyed it. They also made a good decision when they put in different animations for the ending in the last 4 - 5 episodes. 7! 
 
Sound: The songs used in this grow on you very quickly. For a majority of the episodes they stick with using one opening (which is fairly catchy.) In one episode they switch openings, and I liked the new one a lot! Weirdly enough it was only for one episode, so that was disappointing. I might want to have these songs on my iPod to listen to occassionally, but its nothing that could get stuck in your head for months on end. In total, I rank it 7! 
 
Character: Campanella certainly presents forth a lot of interesting characters for the audience to meet. You have a small cheerful automatan girl, a male love interest with almost no flaws, a young sorceress, a shy swordswoman who has no sense of direction, twin sisters (named after salsa and chips), very energetic adults and two people with a goal that proves to be the problem by episode 7. While I didn't love all of these characters, I did enjoy a great number of them. Chelsea's bits about getting lost were entertaining, Ritos and Salsa were decent comic relief at times (and their Golem was an all-around great machine), Minette was too adorable and even Carina was a cool character to see on screen, what with her awesome magical abilities and complete jerk of a magical broomstick (er... broom paddle?) That being said, though they were each unique in their own way, they didn't leave a huge impression on me. Lets just say that of I had to choose a favorite character, it would be Golem. Yes, Golem; a walking wall of a machine with little dialogue over all of those other characters. (But he was still awesome in his own way.) Thus, I give this another 7. 
 
Enjoyment: I was originally watching this series as each episode aired weekly, but I kept it on hold after awhile and got back to other shows. In short, its pace was very slow. I was mentally snoozing by my desk at 2 pm when I hit episode 5. However, all things considered, I did enjoy this anime. It ended up how I thought it was going to be: short and sweet. Something to watch and relax, you know? The ending also had a big impact on me; even for me to up my final score of the anime by one point. For Enjoyment, 6! 
 
Overall: Overall, I'd say this is a 6. Decent: not amazing nor absolutely horrid. Its got good music, interesting enough characters and nice (while not completely original) artwork. Watching this reminded me of watching Chobits back in the day, as the plots and atmospheres are slightly similar. I'd say I liked Chobits more than Campanella for the better-executed story, but they're very similar. 
If you're looking for something that has all of the previous things mentioned above along with a bit of fanservice (its not horded onto you, thank goodness) and won't make your brain melt from being confused, I recommend this. =]

Among them is the easily flustered yet brave Bell Cranel, the sole member of the Hestia Familia.

","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia (ファミリア, Famiria). The primary activity of these organisations is exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon (ダンジョン, Danjon) in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores. By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known as skills.
The story follows the adventures of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old rookie adventurer and sole member of the Hestia Familia. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman of the Loki Familia, and vows to become as strong as her following a chance encounter where she saves his life from a powerful monster. While Ais is the object of Bell's romantic affection, several other girls, deities and mortals alike, have similar feelings for him; most notably, Hestia herself.
","Trying to get my point across without spoiling anything. 
 
I've enjoyed the first season quite alot and the beginning of the second season but there is things about it I quite frankly can't let go. The main part is about the characters and their development. Bell Cranel. He does not change at all, through out the whole story and that is something that is annoying. It feels forced the way he acts for the story to progress and it gets tiring after awhile. That's mainly my biggest grudge and why I get angry watching it because it's easy to see how the story progresses but it's not enjoyable if it's the same indecisive character having the same dilemma all the time. The first season was him overcoming himself and not being scared anymore but it feels like he has gone back to the start. If you have seen up to episode 8 you might understand what I mean. 
 
Except my rant about character development i've enjoyed the art and the sound, the story has been alright but just that alot in there that could've been better but its doable. 

          
 
       Helpful DanMachi season 2 feels like it's already been experienced. The story starts some time  after where season 1 ended and characters have since gained some strength for the upcoming challenges to come and with that giving less screen time for the actual dungeoncrawling, which is good since this seasons point isn't to become strong, it's being able to stand up to the challenges that have fallen on Bell due to his fast growth. 
 
We see a lot of conflict between familias compared to what we saw in season 1. This gives highlight to other ""rival"" characters to come and expand our known power policies in the world of Orario itself. The Gods itself have more role in this season than the last where they were just kinda sitting back and just cheering their familias on, but now there is competition and strategy to try to win more area and money to expand the familia and rise in power. As in terms of individuals Hermes is the most interesting one to step up in this season and not just as a quirky player, but as a calm and sharp minded person, plotting behind the scenes. 
      
Still it seems like the points have already been seen, and struggles to find the fresh and adventurous feel like the first season did. Yea Hestia is still in love with Bell and keeps forgetting some obvious things and get in trouble for it, yeah Bell is still a virgin that is throughoutly helpless to talk to girls and shit, but yet it still doesn't have the same energy nor the ring to it that made the first season enjoyable. 
 
Overall this season didn't quite reach the levels to be a fun and enjoyable watch and dropped to leave a mediocre impression that left me a bit dissappointed. 

          
 
       Helpful It is fair to say that I am one of those critics that had no big problem with DanMachi when it first aired in 2015. It was flawed, no doubt, but it was a harmless, fun adventure show that brought about one of the greatest waifu-bait cuties ever to grace the medium; and I will hear no denying that sentiment from here on out!  
 
After nearly five years, we finally get more of DanMachi to continue the story of our two favorite lovable companions going on more adventures and meet new characters on the way. If you remember my review of the previous season, you'd see that I gave it a solid score considering the type of anime that it is: Harem anime with a dim-witted protagonist. However, Bell is a dim-witted protagonist that at least has some heart to him and especially with his interactions with the boob goddess herself, Hestia. That was what made DanMachi a lot better than most of its similar contemporaries. My one big wish for the sequel was to expand on their relationship more and have it be a more significant focus on the narrative. 
 
What I did get was more of that, but not enough. The reason I wanted more of it was that everyone else outside of Hestia and Bell's relationship is merely decent to just downright dull. None of the other female characters have anything to them that makes them stand out or memorable in the slightest. Lili is the only one other than Hestia that has any semblance of charisma only because she does become more integral to Bell's story, and she does have her fair share of funny moments sprinkled throughout the show. Every other character, I could not put my finger on what I'm supposed to latch to. Their personal story arcs aren't exactly anything special or become downright melodramatic to the point where it gets nauseating the more I try to think about it. I would not classify them as terrible characters from a moral or writing standpoint, its just that the sequel did not do much to carry me through whatever struggle or situation they happen to be in. 
 
I have noticed that Hestia does draw some ire among the anime community. A lot will point out how annoying she can be whenever she tries her best to cling on to Bell whenever she has the opportunity to do so. There have been other characters like Hestia that did strike me as annoying to the point where I didn't want to sit through whatever tedious antics they conjure up. With Hestia, I find that what made her special was her eye-catching design and her bright personality that shines through Minase Inori's fantastic performance. Would I say that Inori could only play Hestia? Probably not. But, I think she sells this character with her much needed charisma that makes Hestia's advances more charming than anything else. 
 
I've said before that DanMachi's plot is nothing special. I would say it's not very good in many aspects. Many times I often forget what the main overarching story is supposed to be other than, ""Main character and companion go on RPG adventures A, B, and C."" There isn't much to it other than that. The sequel does try its best to give us plot arcs that jump up the melodrama to try to tug at your heartstrings a little. I don't think it was very successful as it felt a bit contrived once I thought about it. The one thing I will give credit for the 2nd half of the season was that it gave us a familia that is mainly populated by bikini clothed girls. So if you weren't already turned off by the boob goddess sulking up the screen by her gelatinous milk jugs, you will not be swayed by this season by a long shot. For me, I appreciated the gesture, even if the plot itself wasn't very memorable. 
 
The animation quality is about the same as season one. Thankfully. We have been getting a lot of lousy studio changes in other anime that switch up the animation or character designs that make it jarring to go back and forth to. J.C. Staff usually never disappoints to give quality art and animation direction consistently even if it isn't spellbinding like most other big-budget anime studios. 
 
DanMachi is one of those anime that I always stick up for regardless of its many detractors. However, it is one of those situations where I can not argue why those people have their issues. It is dumb in its execution to be a standout RPG/Fantasy anime in a time where there is already enough of those to the point of suffocation. Honestly, without the relationship between Bell and Hestia, I do think I would be on that side of the camp. Regardless, anyone who says anything about Hestia is just wrong in every sense of the word. Just stop. Please? Thank you.

       Helpful The second season of Bananya! Who wouldn't be hyped for this! 
After ranking the first season a masterpiece I was really excited for this one.  
 
Instead of in the human world/interacting with every day objects/life situations and sometimes even with humans themselves this season plays on the fictional Bananya planet. (possibly the origin story?) 
Every now and then meowteors (nyagareboshis) will fall onto the planet and bestow the inhabitants with unusual items to interact with (usually items from the human world). As the first season, most episodes introduce a new bananya character (like the zombie bananyas, emo-bananya or my personal favorite the elder bananya). 
 
This season continues to bring warm and fuzzy feelings to you every week and yet I'm personally missing the interactions with the human world from the first season that made it feel like bananyas were more a part of our actual world. 
The new characters are all fun, but unfortunately we don't see any of the characters from the first season (as of episode 9), except for Bananya.

Story 
Same routine of gags. Where the duo stars as main characters and wacky situation come up in their adventures. Of the entire season i would have to say the season's introduction was the best. For it makes a true statement about escaped criminals that is quite unexpected and true one can't help but to laugh. The joke highlights the eagerness one would have having been confined in a small space for a large amount of time. Which is fine by its self unless it becomes overwhelming that mutates into arrogance than it is problematic. In more concise wording, planning ahead will allow for more control than last second decisions. 
 
Ending was okay for it gave the audience a taste of what to expect for the next season. Although, its conclusion was slightly problematic. Before substantiation was building up to the point of insanity. During season two that insanity fueled the long drive of ambition but how will the show proceed if the fuel isn't need no more? 
 
Audio 
The other two seasons:zero and one have been all show and no talk. Finally towards the end of the season there is some vocal lines. Unfortunately, there isn't much brought into the show with them. Sure, some detail exchange like what exact words were chosen and reasoning but given the moment and how limited the lines were it may have been garbled. For without the actual words the same message is being conveyed.

          
 
       Helpful This second season of Usavich is a direct continuation of the first so expect the same characters, animation design and general over-the-top craziness. 
 
The biggest difference is that the static setting of the first season (which was fun but had run it's course by the end of the season) is switched for a more dynamic one. The two main characters are on the run and most of the episodes deal with them fighting off their pursuers and doing crazy things to their car. I found it more engaging than the first season and the animation has also become even more fun to watch without everything being confined to one room. 
 
Basically if you somewhat enjoyed the first season you will also like this one. In my opinion it is a slight improvement in terms of premise and animation while still being just as ridiculous and over-the-top as the first season. At time it might get too silly even for hardened comedy fans, but overall it is definitely worth the little time it costs to watch.

","Well since I haven't done a review for Season 1, I'll be going into quite detail here. So, does this anime have the amount of cuteness and sweet sugary goodness which might result in diabetes that it is claimed to have? Well, maybe not that extreme but you bet this anime is brimming with cuteness. 
 
That's basically why I ended up watching this anime: To see for myself just how cute it can get. And the main reason for that can be attributed to the character designs. This is a very good example of a situation whereby the characters do not look their age. In fact, in most cases, they don't even act their age. But seriously, who the heck cares about that? The important thing is that this anime will most definitely put a smile on your face. And one thing to note about the character designs are the eyes. I absolutely love the unique style used for them as they have the ability to mesmerise me like crazy. Good job, White Fox. 
 
Considering how Gochuumon Wa Usagi Desu Ka is a casual anime series (an anime that lacks an overarching story and much dramatic tension), it need not be taken too seriously. And because of that, I am very willing to watch these kinds of anime. But even among casual anime series, Gochuumon Wa Usagi Desu Ka is one of the better ones that I've seen. On top of having absolutely adorable characters, this anime is also rather funny and the comedy is handled very consistently throughout its course. And even more so, this anime does have fanservice. But the fanservice is utilised in a really sparring and innocent way just as a treat to the audience. And this is where the character designs come in handy. It shows that it is not impossible for characters to be portrayed as both cute and sexy at the same time. 
 
And even more than all that, I personally think that the best part is the relationship between the characters. Through their many interactions, it is easy to believe that they are very close to each other. The chemistry between them just clicks very well. This is especially true between Cocoa and Chino. From the beginning when Cocoa first arrived at Rabbit House to the end, you can see their changing behaviour as they get closer until they learn to accept each other. That itself was so sweet and adorable to watch and it honestly gets me every time. 
 
[THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS] 
But I would have to say that my absolute favourite part of the anime was the arc when Mocha, Cocoa's sister came to visit. This arc was just filled with touching moments with some bonding between Cocoa and Mocha. And not to mention, my absolute favourite moment was when Mocha petted Rize on the head. I was just like... ""OH MY GOD SOOOO CUTE!!!"" 
[SPOILER END] 
 
Now, for the animation, while I agree White Fox with the help of Kinema Citrus for the 2nd season did a really good job, I can't say I  found that one moment that really stood out. But as for the art style, it was just gorgeous. White Fox may have only filled so little of my watchlist, but they have been consistent with their visuals. 
 
Finally, we get to the songs. Now we first have to talk about the Season 2 ED (Tokimeki Poporon), which has literally become an anime meme for cuteness and I would say a big factor in me ending up watching this anime. It was actually a pretty good song. And might I add, the animation during this ending theme is probably that moment when the animation actually gets really good. It's kind of upsetting when you realise that is where the animation just takes off but whatever. But even for this anime, I would have to give the winners to the opening themes especially my favourite of them all Season 1 OP (Daydream Cafe). I swear I am addicted to the chorus of this song because I literally know how to sing it word for word (almost at least). So overall, pretty good theme songs too. 
 
While this is definitely one of the better anime of its kind, it does not have anything that truly blows my mind. There isn't really anything ground-breaking that Gochuumon Wa Usagi Desu Ka brings into the genre. And there is an opportunity for that which the anime did not fully utilise. The anime could have explored on the backstory of Tippy and Chino's grandfather. That in my opinion might have turned out to be something amazing. But in the end, that never happened. But regardless, all was fine and it was still an interesting piece to watch. And if there happens to be another season for this anime, I would be so excited to check it out. And if that happens, White Fox... do the Tippy and grandpa backstories. I'll be looking forward to it. 

          
 
       Helpful GochiUsa is the third series from my arbitrary holy trinity of shows from the modern era of moe. These three are KinMoza, NNB and GochiUsa. In my opinion, these three are the epitome of the modern time's CGDCT SoL anime, and with all three having recently had a second season, their formula seems to be working. 
 
This is a review of both seasons of GochiUsa without any spoilers (as if they actually exits) 
 
STORY 
	As is with these SoL shows, the main focus of the show is on the characters and their interactions with each other, rather than on any kind of storyline. Each episode is split into three or four separate scenes, each usually playing completely separate from one another. Most scenes are comedy oriented, but most of the show's emphasis is on the characters being cute mofos. GochiUsa is set in a France-esque city full of tea and coffee shops and a load of rabbits. 
	The ""protagonist"" of the show is a young girl named Cocoa, who comes to live and work in a small coffee shop called ""Rabbit House"" and meets Chino, the landlord's daughter. Cocoa and Chino have almost opposite personalities, with Cocoa, being loud and energetic, acting as the fool; and Chino, a quite and shy girl, often acting as the straight-man in the comedy sketches. 
	The other girl who works in Rabbit House is Rize, the seemingly calm and collected twintailed girl, who has a slightly unhinged liking of military equipment and always carries around a Glock on her person. Then there is Chiya, she lives in a traditional Japanese-tea house, and acts as the mellow ""Ara ara"" Nee-san arche-character. Finally is Syaro (or Sharo) a blonde sensitive girl who despises Rabbits, gets drunk off coffee and is absolutely the best girl. 
	Another point is the etymology of the girl's names. Almost all the names in the series are some tea/coffee related pun, with personal favorites being 'Kafuu Chino' (Cappuccino), 'Tedeza Rize' (Thé des Alizés) and fucking 'Hoto Cocoa', which I'm not even going to explain. 
	Finally there is also Tippy, who is the soul of Chino's dead Grandfather trapped inside the body of an Angora Rabbit. I don't even know. Also go Google Angora rabbit if you want to laugh at evolution. 
	 
PRODUCTION 
	Animated by White Fox, the studio that can seemingly animate anything at all, the animation quality is as good as it feels necessary for such a show. The comedy scenes are in a proportionally drastically changing style, switching between the standard and deformed styles for the punchlines. One part that does stand out are the backgrounds. The notable ones are those of the traditional Germanic/French town with timber frame buildings and cobblestones streets. 
	There isn't too much to say about the soundtrack for the show, the two OP songs are almost identical and I'm pretty sure I developed some kind of diabetes from  season 2's ED. The OST is rather short, and is full of calming piano pieces that play in the more relaxed portions of the show. 
 
CONCLUSION 
	I'd say that the overall feel of GochiUsa is somewhere between that of KinMoza and NNB. It is a mix of comedy and pure SoL with most of the jokes being slapstick reactionary gags that aren't all that funny, but don't have to be because of the charm of the characters. That being said, there are some actually funny moments and the whole show is a hoard for reaction-face connoisseurs such as myself. 
	The whole show is comfy overload, and sometimes this can be too much. I found the first 6 odd episodes were very slow, and next to no comedy was apparent. The episodes seemed dedicated into introducing us slowly to the main cast of characters and showing their endearing sides (ie- The trope/fetish filling parts). However, the show soon comes into its own, with season 2 being a much more enjoyable watch. 
 
	Just a minor peeve here: the geniuses down at anime HQ decided it was a great idea to name the second season the exact same as the first, but with the addition of an extra ""?"". Great. As well as being a ground-braking and meaningful idea for the franchise, ""?"" is also not detectable by search engines and so a search of ""GochiUsa?"" will bring up the same results as ""GochiUsa??"". Should have been subtitled with something along the lines of: ""Which Gochi would you Usa?"" or ""Now with more Heartburn!"".

       Helpful Well since I haven't done a review for Season 1, I'll be going into quite detail here. So, does this anime have the amount of cuteness and sweet sugary goodness which might result in diabetes that it is claimed to have? Well, maybe not that extreme but you bet this anime is brimming with cuteness. 
 
That's basically why I ended up watching this anime: To see for myself just how cute it can get. And the main reason for that can be attributed to the character designs. This is a very good example of a situation whereby the characters do not look their age. In fact, in most cases, they don't even act their age. But seriously, who the heck cares about that? The important thing is that this anime will most definitely put a smile on your face. And one thing to note about the character designs are the eyes. I absolutely love the unique style used for them as they have the ability to mesmerise me like crazy. Good job, White Fox. 
 
Considering how Gochuumon Wa Usagi Desu Ka is a casual anime series (an anime that lacks an overarching story and much dramatic tension), it need not be taken too seriously. And because of that, I am very willing to watch these kinds of anime. But even among casual anime series, Gochuumon Wa Usagi Desu Ka is one of the better ones that I've seen. On top of having absolutely adorable characters, this anime is also rather funny and the comedy is handled very consistently throughout its course. And even more so, this anime does have fanservice. But the fanservice is utilised in a really sparring and innocent way just as a treat to the audience. And this is where the character designs come in handy. It shows that it is not impossible for characters to be portrayed as both cute and sexy at the same time. 
 
And even more than all that, I personally think that the best part is the relationship between the characters. Through their many interactions, it is easy to believe that they are very close to each other. The chemistry between them just clicks very well. This is especially true between Cocoa and Chino. From the beginning when Cocoa first arrived at Rabbit House to the end, you can see their changing behaviour as they get closer until they learn to accept each other. That itself was so sweet and adorable to watch and it honestly gets me every time.

There's the ""cheesy"" bad (see Batman and Robin), the ""incompetent"" bad (see The Last Airbender), and the ""embarrassing"" bad.

If Master of Martial Hearts best represents the ""rrue"" bad, then Gun-dou Musahshi best represents the ""good"" bad. 
 
Story - 10/10 
The story follows Miyamoto Musashi - if Miyamoto Musashi was a whiny shounen protagonist dedicated to winning the heart of a girl, instead of like he's depicted in my current favorite manga, Vagabond.  Now, normally I would get irritated because it shares the same name as the badass samurai, but that issue doesn't bother me since they use dart guns.  Plus, I can look at it this way: he grew out of his immaturity and into the badass we know him for today. 
 
Art - 5/10 
Ignoring the animation errors, the art style is just...mediocre.  It's just not a style that really appeals to me.  It's just a somewhat...plastic style.  The color is alright, but that's about it. 
 
Sound - 10/10 
This is where it starts to get hilarious - listen to the opening theme and then tell me that it isn't hilarious.  No seriously: ""WE'RE GHOST BUSTERS OH OH OH!""  How are those lines NOT comedy gold? 
 
Character - 10/10 
What character? No really, I don't remember anything about the characters that wasn't hilarious.  Oh, Miyamoto is a whiny kid.  Other than that, that's all I remember. 
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
This series made me burst out laughing when I first saw it.  Watch it for yourself if you want a ""so good it's bad"" show. 
 
Overall - 10/10 
There is one thing I'd like to note: I can only find subs up to episode 4, so you're going to have to watch it raw afterwards...but it won't matter, since this show is funny without the subs. 
 
RIYL: ...I actually don't know what this show is similar to.  No, seriously, I have no idea.

          
 
       Helpful Now where to start on this show. 
 
First of all, 10/10 for me, I loved watching this show, even if the subtitles that I used were probably fake.  
 
PLOT- 2/10 
 
This show is basically about a dual-wield gunslinger samurai named Musashi who battles a group of monsters known as the Ayakashi. Well, we call him a samurai because he has a sword, but he never uses it. 
 
ANIMATION- 2/10 
 
To put it lightly, the art was terrible. Some of the sequences that took place outdoors were photos taken of forests, rather than drawn. The animation, was...subpar, with a fight sequence involving a guy shooting a monster while slowly falling to the ground from about 20 feet up.  
 
SOUND- 1/10 
 
The voice acting wasn't bad, but what really gave it this score was probably the out-of-sync audio and the infamous opening song, GHOST BUSTERZ by ULTRA BRAiN, is a pure masterpiece featuring someone's screams edited by Windows Movie Maker. 
 
CHARACTER- 2/10 
 
Five episodes and I still have no idea what our heroes are really trying to accomplish, so I can't give an accurate assessment there, but judging from what I can tell from the show, they're just messing around.  
 
ENJOYMENT- 10/10 
 
While this is clearly the worst anime I've ever seen and probably will ever see, it is undeniable that I enjoyed this anime through and through while watching the hilariously ridiculous fight scenes and horrible sound.  
 
OVERALL- 3/10 
 
While this show is riddled with flaws everywhere, it can be safely said that these flaws are what give the show such great entertainment value. If you wish to see some quality Japanese animation, then good luck ever finding it, but if you want to see a new side to what Japan has to offer, then give this show a watch, once you can find someone who has subbed past episode 4 without buying the DVD set.

          
 
       Helpful So bad that it becomes good. That's exactly why I enjoyed watching it, for all the wrong reasons. 
 
I don't know if there's a story here, maybe I didn't pay enough attention, maybe I was laughing too hard to notice.  
 
They really did have Berretas in medival Japan for your information. 
 
Really, for real, and gun handling fight schools too. 
 
The art is.. absolutely amazing, no just simply spectacular - 10 second animations are 3 frames strung together repeating slowly, battles are so intense that it seems you've seen them two or three times in one viewing. 
&quot;We're being attacked by a scaling effect!&quot; 
 
The sound is groundbreaking, with sound effects coming only 3-4 seconds late. Characters lips move when nothing is being said, Oh, the song at the start is completely epic -one of those timeless classics you'll enjoy again and again. 
 
The characters are completely original, memorable and developed. The good guys consist of: a gun samurai, a bald troll, a cleaner, a girl with naturally purple hair and gandalf the green. 
 
Many people called it the worst anime of the century, but forget about that, those people can't laugh. It's either an anime gone horribly wrong, or complete genius. You'll spend more time laughing your ass off than being disgusted at the quality.  
 
Logical Rating: 4.4 out of 10. 
 
Sseth's Rating: 10^2 out of 10.

(Source: ANN)",['Comedy'],none,"Mr. Stain on Junk Alley consists of 14 stand-alone episodes that each tell a short story entirely through action. Each story generally revolves something that Stain finds in the said junk alley and how it affects everyone within the junk alley. The stories are all told clearly and are quite inventive and fun to watch play out. 
 
Art will most likely be a love it or hate it relationship as it is entirely in CGI. The CGI is clear and the series knows exactly what it wants to do with it's graphics, but sometimes they also come off as a tad creepy (particularly in the final episode). The animation is completely smooth and clean however, always a plus. It doesn't have tons of detail like we've come to expect from movies like Shrek, but it didn't bite off more than it could chew either. There is some god-awful CGI out there, luckily, this clearly avoids that category. Sound fits and there's not too much in the way of music, but nothing feels out of place for the sake of having pretty music, it all fits the tone of the series pretty well. There isn't any voice acting except for occasional laughs or other basic noises so there's not much to critique there. For the series it works well, but it's nothing special either and it certainly wouldn't work so well elsewhere. 
 
Mr. Stain is not a series afraid of injuring its own characters and it does so quite often in a mix of slapstick and entirely deserved pitch black humor. In some cases, you do feel a little bad for the characters when they've been injured a little too much or for unfair reasons. In fact, the presence of the pitch black humor added to my enjoyment, as it is one of my favorite types of humor. Mr. Stain is not a series that takes itself too seriously and spends its time trying to shove preachy lessons in your face, it's there for entertainment. It's a short if not completely fun series that doesn't overstay its welcome by being far too long either. The enjoyment value is quite high if you know what to expect (which is not a long string of anvils falling on head comedy). Mr. Stain has its touching moments and uses them quite well, it actually hits a good mix between comedy and making you curious about what will happen to the plot and characters, more so than you'd initially expect. One episode honestly almost had me to tears, so it has a little bit of everything. 
 
If you want something short, sweet, and completely off the beaten path, consider checking it out. It's on hulu

          
 
       Helpful Wow is all i have to say, never would i have thought fourteen episodes of 7 minutes in length could be so enjoyable. It tells the story of Stain a man who lives like a homeless man and each episode he finds a different unique item in the pile of junk in the alley. Anything can happen from magic crayons that bring drawings into reality to robots that want to fly. The creator really did do a good job in making each unique object into something that can tell a story because you never know what will happen. 
 
The show itself can be rather violent, pretty much every episode feature Stain being hurt in some way giving him various bruises and cuts and there is always blood, this is a touch that might make you go 'what the fuck' because you simply don't expect it to happen in this type of show, granted you get used to it, but it all adds to the uniqueness that makes it all the more enjoyable. 
 
It's created solely in CG but all the characters are cartoonified so they don't look too realistic but it does make the show quirky and the CG allows for great animation. What will become apparent is it seems the creators like dancing, there is a lot of dancing whether its just the ending credits or part of the episode, the dances are pretty cool and funky and the music that accompanied the credits is brilliant and catchy. 
 
Stain lives in a room but its not a house, im not really shore what it is and lives off eating doh nuts or what ever he kills, he also falls in love multiple times throughout the series with various things, a painting, a flower, a real girl, he gives off that feeling that makes you want to see him succeed in anything he does as he gets the short end of the stick a rather lot. Palvan is a cat, i think, he also likes doh nuts and is the most seen recurring side character and often helps Stain with whatever. Other characters barely make appearances unless its an episode they only feature in, then they are likely to get plenty of screen time. Masked Monkey a masked monkey, Rings a lizard thing, they're all weird. 
 
Fourteen episodes seven minutes long with a 30 minute finale you can hardly find better time, this show should be enjoyed for its daring uniqueness and its lovable characters. Oh and there is not a single word spoken in the shows entirety, don't let this put you off because it simply doesn't need words, that how well it tells each story. It is a comedy but a dark one as its jokes come from its characters suffering with amusing injuries. You can never guess what's going to happen next or what Stain will find.

          
 
       Helpful Garakuta-doori no Stain is about an unlikable and boring homeless man who somehow has a home despite being the most obvious homeless man on the planet who lives in an alley populated by whatever random crap you can think of.  As expected of a Funimation production. 
 
The plot is fairly simple, Mr. Stain finds the thing the episode is named after and shenanigans ensue.  Actually I lied, shenanigans don’t even bother ensuing.  It’s more along the lines of extreme boredom ensues.  How you manage make a world as quirky as this so gut-wrenchingly unfun is a job for a team of scientists. 
 
Sometimes the show makes you try to feel sad because Mr. Stain is feeling sad because boohoo he can’t have a relationship with a painting (I’d like to say this is a jab at waifuism, but who knows.) or boohoo he likes that girl in the other building but she’s out of his league.  Don’t even get me started on how creepy the flower episode gets.  Obviously I never feel sad because Stain is a completely unsympathetic loser who doesn’t deserve his giant cat friend (the best character in the show) or his homeless-man house.  The only decent episode is 13, only because of how out of left field it is. 
 
If you need a sleep aid ala Aria or Hidamari Sketch except devoid of any artistry, check out Mr. Stain.  This is easily the worst thing Masuda Ryuuji has ever done and proof that western companies shouldn’t involve themselves in the production of anime.  Unless it’s Big O.

The story: It's unexpected if you think about the target audience, The story begins with Yuuta, an elementary student that has been transfered to the first (tecnologicaly) futuristic city in Japan, where everything is controled by computers and internet systems. Unfortunately, yuuta hates/fears computers because of a past trauma. One day Yuuta recieves a strange text and  
he is mysteriously swallowed by his cell phone into the net world (internet) meeting three Net Ghosts (a kind of autonomous programs), Pit, Pot and Pat. The story is a little slow but definetly has a plot. Some terms used are, in my opinion, pretty hard to understand for the children. Summary: Good story, Nice start, slow introduction to the plot, but definetly worth watching. 
 
The art: The art has nothing special but it's very pleasant, vivid colours, nice attention to details and the animations are great and smooth. 
 
The sound: The soundtracks fit perfectly to the series, the openings are sticky and filled with rythm. About the voice acting, is exellent in almost all characters. 
 
The Characters: This is probably the best part. Starting with the PiPoPa, they are very different from each other, they are imprudent and prideful, but clever and in some way very strong, in the other side, Yuuta is the one who tries to make them responsable and helpful instead of using their abilities to cause problems to others. There are some  secondary characters that you want to know more about them, like Mamoru, yuuta best friend, and some more. 
 
About the enjoyment: This is a tricky part, my 10 year brother loved it, he devoured the anime in like 4 days and talked about it for weeks. In my case i enjoyed it a lot too but it's definetly not a masterpiece nor something close to it. The children would give it a 10/10 but for more mature audience it would be a 8/10. 
 
Overall: Remember that this anime is for children, but you can definetly enjoy it and is pefect to introduce the younger ones to the anime world.

Only adventurers who form partnerships with the gods themselves have any hope of defeating the monsters that lie within. But the dungeon is not the only place where monsters exist. Far from Orario, in the ruins of an ancient city, a new threat arises. To counter this threat, the goddess Artemis has come to Orario in search of a champion—but it's not Ais Wallenstein (the legendary Sword Princess) nor Ottar (the strongest warrior to ever enter the dungeon) that she chooses. Rather it is Bell Cranel, a newbie adventurer partnered with a low-tier goddess. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia (ファミリア, Famiria). The primary activity of these organisations is exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon (ダンジョン, Danjon) in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores. By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known as skills.
The story follows the adventures of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old rookie adventurer and sole member of the Hestia Familia. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman of the Loki Familia, and vows to become as strong as her following a chance encounter where she saves his life from a powerful monster. While Ais is the object of Bell's romantic affection, several other girls, deities and mortals alike, have similar feelings for him; most notably, Hestia herself.
","I Saw European premiere of this movie and saw no review, so I will try to write one. I didn't see the parent story (which one is already on my list of anime that I plan to watch), so maybe that's the reason why some things were little unclear but overall even me as a newcomer was able to get ""into action"". Story was pretty typical of this kind of anime but characters are pretty good and the movie itself had many interesting and funny moments. The movie went pretty fastly forward so I have many ""questions"" that will be hopefully answered in season 1 and coming season 2 of anime. I enjoyed the movie, maybe it doesn't bring anything new but anyways I believe it's worth to see it.

          
 
       Helpful One month before the release of Danmachi season 2, they give us a movie preview, I was able to attend, and as i only watched it once, it is not impossible that I might forget details or make a mistake. 
 
First we will start with the scenario, honestly it's a very unoriginal scenario, starting on a new quest from the moment Bell was chosen by a weapon. I find that the plot is also far too predictable,there is also some fan service scene, probably for the comedy side. The movie being released as a preview I do not prefer to give too much detail on the story. 
 
Regarding the animation, it is not bad but also nothing exceptional, the fight scenes are not incredible or even bad, including the fight against Antares (who is animated in 3D) but maybe a certain scene can give more than interest to the movie. The sounds, like the animation, is also nothing impressive, quite trivial OST. 
 
Finally characters, I personally think that this is the biggest highlight of the movie (maybe you do not agree with me), in my opinion, Artemis is the one that gives the most meaning to this movie, it's a character unique to the movie, but also the one I find most endearing of all Danmachi. I hover over the details, just to tell you, where are the interesting points and where are they not, without spoil you. 
 
In my opinion this movie is clearly not to look absolutely, but if you are a fan of Danmachi, you will probably like it so if you had not enjoyed the first season, you probably do not appreciate this movie. 
 
Although it is a review I avoid a maximum of spoil since many people read the reviews to decide to look at it or not. 
 
Story: 5, Art/Animation: 5, Sound: 6, Character: 8, Enjoyment: 7. 
 
I hope I don’t have too much writing error… 


          
 
       Helpful I think many people misunderstand what a non-canon anime movie is. A movie for an on-going series must be a self contained story that does not affect the source material as to avoid ruining the continuity of the original work. With that in mind, most anime movies are nothing more than popcorn-fare that are only meant for the enjoyment of the fans of the series. So walking into a film and expecting the storytelling of Bebop will leave you very disappointed, every time. 
 
The Arrow of the Orion was yet another non-canon anime movie with a self-contained plot and heroine with no real development for the characters. As someone who's watched his fair share of Naruto, Bleach, etc. anime films, I knew full well what I was getting into. Mainly for non-canon movies like this, what I look for is 1. How entertaining is the film? and 2. What does the movie do to make itself unique? 
 
The movie has Bell and the gang help a Goddess in need to defeat an ancient evil, but the quest is not all as it seems as the Hestia Familia begin to unravel the unsettling truth behind the quest and the Goddess who offered it. 
 
This plot is pretty standard. It's doesn't really stand out and most people can guess what's going to happen before it even happens on screen. I was however, very happy that we are finally exposed to the world outside the city of Orario. While most of it was fairly generic backdrops, it was still nice to get out of the city. I would say the plot is the weakest aspect of the film. But for a non-canon film, this isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Personally, I'm just happy we get to spend more time with these characters. 
 
I myself am a big fan of the Danmachi franchise. I like many of the characters and find the world interesting. Even Bell, who can be considered a ""generic protagonist"", is someone I find both endearing and someone I love to cheer on. I very much enjoyed the first season and I can't wait to see where the second season takes us. 
 
With that in mind, I found that this movie did a great job with character interactions; most were fun and entertaining. I love this cast, and seeing them further joke around and talk is something I'll always find enjoyable. Hestia especially has really great screen presence. Jokes hit most of the time and I found myself smiling during the groups' antics. But as I've said, there isn't any room for any real development for characters in a film like this. 
 
You'll be hard pressed to find a movie that doesn't have improved visuals over its TV counterpart, and this was no different. The animation for multiple action scenes was stellar. Danmachi also has a very appealing art style. The design for the movie-only character, Artemis, was as great as the regular casts'. The group also got some nice movie outfits which were a nice touch. The only real downside was the mediocre CGI that was used for the monsters in the film. Unfortunately, this has become an industry norm that I've more or less have gotten used to. Regardless, Danmachi has always had solid visuals in both animation and art, and that continues in this film. 
 
I think one thing this franchise doesn't get enough praise for is its sound design. The sound design for this was outstanding. Some standout sounds came from the final fight, as well as during special powerful attacks. But even more common sounds, like when someone defeats a monster, sounds terrific. The sound is strong and very bass heavy, but some others sound alien and weird; I just love it. The soundtrack was also good. If you're familiar with the TV series' OST, the movie's soundtrack sounds very similar. I think the franchise as a whole has had above average music, especially during fight scenes with the violin segments. 
 
While this movie doesn't break any new ground and plays it pretty safe with its simple story, I still enjoyed myself. If you're not a fan of the franchise, or you dislike non-canon movies, then I'm not sure why you're here. But if you're a fan of this franchise and just want to see more of Bell, Hestia, and the whole gang, then grab your adventuring gear, because this film is worth your time.

","The Good Witch of the West.  
Its an anime filled with Much Romance, Drama, Mystery and Action. If you wish to see a anime with a great yet not to obvious storyline this is the anime for you. 
 
It started of looking as nothing but some lame children anime, but as the story unfolds you will find the story interesting and you might also get addicted to it.  
The expected won't happen as you watch this 13 episodes long anime. 
The first episodes might not be so capturing however when you start following the story for real you might have troubles leaving your computer. 
 
I will without a doubt recommend this capturing anime to everyone who like the genres: 
Romance, Action, Mystery and Drama. 

          
 
       Helpful Good Witch was a show I picked up on recommendation from a friend of mine, and while I was initially disappointed, it proved itself down the stretch. 
 
The main sticking point here was the story.  Don't get me wrong, the plot itself was well-written with lots of twists and turns.  However, this show was poorly paced, which is what happens when you put either some or all of 9 light novels into a 13 episode series.  The first half of the show was a whirlwind, and while this is understandable considering how the main character is swept up into a world she doesn't understand, there were a lot of questions at least in the back of my mind regarding the underlying political and social situation that was mentioned over and over but never explained, at least early on.  
 
As I said, however, things really came together down the stretch, redeeming this anime plot-wise.  The situation is clarified (even though more mysteries start arising) and while some things aren't explained by the end, it's still okay.  It has an ending that makes sense and brings some closure even though it makes you yearn for more, as if this has to be the animated version of only a part of the entire original story. 
 
The world itself, while not holding anything new, was still very intriguing.  It focuses not on fantasy or action, but on the politics and society of the world, which is like a breath of fresh air for a tired genre.  This is like the Crest/Banner of the Stars of the fantasy genre.  (I'll have to make a suggestion about that...)  
 
The art and sound were solid, not too much to say here.  The only complaint I had was that some of the girls really, REALLY looked like guys. 
 
The characters in this were excellent.  Everyone was appropriate for their situation and they all related to each other very realistically. 
 
All-in-all, I enjoyed this series.  Action, comedy, drama, romance - Good Witch has it all, and it also carries it all very nicely without being contrived.

          
 
       Helpful Actually, in truth, this anime is one of the best short animes I have watched!! It made me want to know more and what is going to happen next~ It's very gripping and this anime is an anime that someone would really want to finish in one day because it is just that good. There may be some parts in which they drop the anime's tension by a bit, but that's all what's bad about it. But also because it is shorter, it keeps viewers interested all the way until the end and love it. I know because that happened to me. I was bored and couldn't find something to watch, then I came across this anime and totally LOVED IT. I was sooo happy that I found something interesting again!! Good Witch of the West is definitely an anime I would recommend to other anime lovers. ^-^~ 
Oh and the characters are so loveable!! &gt;w&lt; Especially Roux and the baby unicorn *huggles*

In the Slayers universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its ""true form"", which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (shinzoku, lit. ""godly race"") and demons (mazoku, lit. ""demon race""), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.
In the world where the Slayers takes place, Flare Dragon Ceifeed and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu are, respectively, the supreme god and demon. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceifeed was able to split Shabranigdu's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdu himself would be destroyed. However, Ceifeed was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in Slayers, one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the Resurrection War (降魔戦争, Kōma-sensō, alternately ""War of Demon Conquering"") against one of the parts of Ceifeed, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdu won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdu's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only demons could pass.There are four types of magic within the Slayers universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the demons and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Lei Wing, Fireball, or Elemekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the gods, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the demon Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, demons can only be harmed by astral shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another demon with greater might than the target.
Above all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.
The protagonist of Slayers is Lina Inverse, a teenage wandering genius sorceress with many nicknames and much infamy attached to her that she refuses to acknowledge. Lina narrates (within the novels) the history of her various adventures, ranging from whimsical and silly to dramatic to even outright world-threatening crises, in which she becomes involved along with her traveling companions everywhere she goes.
","This is my first review so please don't be too harsh on me. 
 
No but getting to the point The Slayers Excellent wasn't too bad, it had the smae feel as the series being mostly comical and all that but as usual it still had it's fight scenes and moments of seriousness (be it as rare as they can be for this series). 
 
This little side step is a nice introduction to the infamous Lina Inverse' past and her rivalry/friendship whatever you wanna call it with Naga the aWhite Serpent.  Even though it's only 3 episodes.   
 
The artwork for the series is basically about the same as it is for the first or second season of this series bt all in all it's not too bad and I personally like the artwork of some of the older animes. 
 
The story for the Ovas kinda jumps around a little but hey thats the Slayers for ya. 
 
The enjoyment for the OVA's is pretty high especially if your a Slayers fan. 
 
So all in all I personally gave this Slayers OVA an 8 out of 10.

          
 
       Helpful I have a small question, why was this not the first OVA? I mean, this is where we finally figure out how Naga and Lina met for crying out loud. Of course it did happen pretty much as I suspected but the problem I have is that we seem to keep jumping all over the place. First Naga is there, then she is gone, then she is back again. She is like a bad cold that will not leave Lina alone and although they are a bit friendlier to each other in the first OVA, they are not in this. I’m surprised Lina hasn’t tried to get rid of her more then she has. Naga is even more stupid then Gourry and that says a lot. There really isn’t much else to say about this that has not been said in the first OVA, I still like the TV show more then the OVA. The stories are singled out 
 
The artwork is the same, a very old style of cell drawing with a bit of a haze to it that old shows have. The grain makes it feel very old compared to newer cleaner shows. Characters feel pretty proportional and of course Naga’s breasts bounce unnaturally whenever she moves. On the other hand, Lina’s waist is a bit too small but in the end, she is way more proportional then Naga. 
 
I still cannot stand Naga’s voice. Her laugh sounds like an alarm or something. If I put her laugh as my alarm to get up in the morning, I would probably jump and scream out as I broke it! It’s that bad. She does it way to much; almost all of her dialog has her laughing or being stupid. The same went for Sirene as she had the same voice style. All others are alright, the script is kind of stupid but that goes to show the time frame it was dubbed.

(Source: BakaBT)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Historical']",none,"So this was a very short little movie about a sword for hire and his interesting adventure with a small Kitsune. The story is very simple, wealthy family gets attacked by pirates for an item they have and one of the children is taken away, only wanting to get the item back and get a little revenge for what had happened. Along the way, he hires a sword for hire to help him. The reason I didn’t start out with the sword for hire, Buta, was because the show doesn’t start out with him and yet both characters seem to take on the feeling of what a main character is supposed to be for different reasons.  
 
Let’s talk about the main characters now I guess. First we have the little fox boy who is trying to get his map back from pirates. We never get an actual name for him; just that he is the oldest child of his family so will end up getting the map on his birthday. He is just like a normal child who was raised in a loving home; naïve, kind, and knows what is right from wrong. The second main character is Buta, the sword for hire. He is pretty much the exact opposite of the little fox. He is slightly dirty, worried more about surviving then doing the right thing, and is always looking for a way to make money. This doesn’t make him a bad guy though as the show has tried hard to show that. It just shows the difference between the privileged and the not so privileged without demonizing the two.  
 
There is one group of characters that I sort of feel really did not need to be in the show, and that’s Guppi and her group. Guppi is a female thief who just didn’t seem to fit into the story at all. Her and her group just seemed to pop up every once in a while. I think there are only like three or four scenes with them and it’s just like they were there for comedy relief.  
 
The animation is very beautiful; something I would be proud to put next to Studio Ghibli to compare though I do believe Buta was not made by hand. The colors are very bright during the happy points and pushed back slightly when they need to be in order to match the scene that it was trying to portray. The anthropomorphic creatures are very simple but it almost adds to the charm the movie was trying to portray as this is a movie supposed to be meant for all ages. The only problem I had with the design is that the dried fish did not look like dried fish. It’s a very small problem to me but the final part had it as a main point and I just couldn’t understand what they were doing till the fox said they were dried fish. 
 
The Japanese voice acting was really nice to hear surprisingly. I don’t normally say that as it’s a little harsh on my ears being a non native speaker but this show’s tone was actually quite nice. The story was slow enough that I could read the subtitles fast enough without stopping the show and the voice acting had a nice tone that made it rather enjoyable.

          
 
       Helpful Young Animator Training Project/Anime Mirai short reviews: Part 5/12 
 
Buta is a story about a lone samurai guy helping a kid find some lost treasure. Except the samurai is a pig. And the boy is a fox.  
 
Yes, all the characters in Buta are anthropomorphised animals. Anthropomorphisation does have narrative purpose beyond trying to appeal to furries. Sometimes it’s about grafting these animal traits onto human characters to emphasise that characteristic. Sometimes it’s about distancing us from the reality of events so we’re able to take a step back from the reality and spend more time analyzing the symbolism which is the reason why Night on the Galactic Railroad decided to turn its brothers into cats.  
 
In Buta, it doesn’t really serve any purpose. If anything, it cheapened its story because turning the characters into animals distanced me from them enough that I didn’t really care about them. At least, that’s my theory as to why I never got into Buta. It could have just been the story was boring. But I’m rather baffled as to why they decided to go the anthropomorphised animals route anyway, so I’m going to blame it on that. 
 
Verdict: Skip

The characters are furies not humans. A warm heart tale about pirates. Even though this movie was comedy based some of the actions made were not bright. For example, say you have guns and you were robbed are you going to rant or shoot? Especially if they are within shooting range. 
 
The random luck usage was crazy. I have a problem oh wait here is a solution to help me out. 
 
The message i got from this was money buys. Not quite the message i would want kids to get. Yes, money is needed to live but to portray money in a form of friendship base is not recommended.

Along with his best friend Huckleberry Finn, he spends his days ditching school, fishing, climbing trees and having adventures. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","Tom Sawyer is an orphan who lives with his aunt, Polly, and his half-brother, Sid, in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, which is based on Hannibal, Missouri, where Mark Twain originally lived, sometime in the 1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is made to whitewash his aunt's fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday, as punishment.
In one of the most famous scenes in American literature, Tom cleverly persuades the several neighborhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his tedious work, using reverse psychology to convince them it is an enjoyable activity. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with other students for several denominations of tickets, obtained at the local Sunday school for memorizing verses of Scripture. Tom then exchanges the tickets with the minister for a prized Bible, despite being one of the worst students in the Sunday school and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.
Tom falls in love with a girl named Becky Thatcher, who is new in town and the daughter of a prominent judge. Tom wins the admiration of the judge in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get engaged by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was engaged to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence.
Shortly after Becky shuns Tom, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a superstitious ritual designed to heal warts. At the graveyard, they witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr Robinson, Muff Potter and Injun Joe, robbing a grave. Muff Potter is drunk and eventually blacks out, while Injun Joe gets into a fight with Dr Robinson and murders him. Injun Joe appears to frame Muff Potter for the murder. Tom and Huckleberry Finn swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder, fearing Injun Joe would somehow discover it was them and murder them in turn. Muff Potter is eventually jailed, and he accepts the blame, assuming he committed the killing in an act of drunkenness.
Tom grows bored with school, and along with his friends Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn, he runs away to Jackson's Island in the Mississippi River to begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they become aware that the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and after a brief moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, he is struck by the grand idea of appearing at his funeral. The trio later carries out this scheme, making a sensational and sudden appearance at church in the middle of their joint funeral service, winning the immense respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky has ripped the school master's anatomy book after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by nobly accepting the blame and punishment for tearing the book.
In court, Injun Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter. Tom decides to defy his blood oath with Huck and testifies against Injun Joe, who quickly escapes through a window before he can be apprehended. The boys live in constant fear of Joe's revenge for incriminating him.
Summer arrives and Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs, they hear a noise below and peering through holes in the floor, they see the deaf-mute Spaniard who had shown up in the village some weeks before revealing himself to be Injun Joe. Speaking freely, Injun Joe and a companion plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own in the house. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. By chance, the villains discover an even greater gold hoard buried in the hearth and carry it off to a better hiding place. The boys are determined to find it and one night, Huck spots them and follows them; he overhears Injun Joe's plans to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas and mutilate her face in revenge for her late husband, a justice of the peace, having once ordered him to be publicly whipped for vagrancy. Running to fetch help, Huck prevents the crime and requests his name not be made public, for fear of Injun Joe's retaliation, thus becoming an anonymous hero.
Just before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal's cave with Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky get lost and wander in the cave for several days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes extremely dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe in the caves one day but is not seen by his nemesis. Eventually, Tom finds a way out and they are joyfully welcomed back by their community. Becky's father, Judge Thatcher, has McDougal's cave sealed with an iron door. When Tom hears of the sealing two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe's corpse just inside the sealed entrance, starved to death after having consumed raw bats and candle stubs as a last resort. The place of his death and the in situ cups he used to collect water from a dripping stalactite become a local tourist attraction.
A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence at McDougal's cave that the villain must have hidden the stolen gold inside, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, but he finds the restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back to his vagrant life. Tom convinces Huck to go back to the widow so that he can later be a robber with Tom, because you need to be high society to be in a robber gang. Reluctantly, Huck agrees and goes back to the widow.
","Tom Sawyer is very likely one of the pearl of the Nippon Animation Studio. This studio is mainly known for the “World Masterpiece Theater”: under this label, there are many animes which are all based on a classic western novel. 
In this case, the anime takes its source from the classic 19th century novel of the American writer Mark Twain/Sam Clemens. in the same vein than others 80s animes, it was widely broadcast on many European TV channels (Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain…) with a significant success: millions of kids have watched it at that time…I was one of them ;-) 
 
The scene takes place in a town close to the Mississippi river in the 19th century USA, and we followed the fantastic adventure of the young Tom Sawyer and his friends. 
 
The art and animation are very satisfactory for an anime of this generation. Like other Nippon animation anime, the general work is less “Manga style” than usual (no blue hair or galaxy like eyes), very likely to stick more with its literary source. 
 
The target audience is obviously the children. All the ingredients that will make a child dream of marvelous adventures are gathered here. 
 
The strength of this anime is the very naturalistic aspect of all the environments and the plausibility of the personality of each character (children or adults) making this anime quite realistic from a western standpoint and it will surely awake the little child who sleep in everyone of us. 
 
The music by its funny aspects and the use of traditional instruments match perfectly the action and the astuteness of our young hero. 
 
Like many others eighties anime, The French Dubbing is once more very professional and has involved a wise choice of voice actors (especially Francette Vernillat whose voice fit perfectly Tom Sawyer). Unfortunately I never get the chance to hear the dubbing in other languages. Maybe some of you can tell us… 
 
Overall, this anime will entice positively a young audience by the inner nature of Tom Sawyer and his adventures but will raise interest among older viewers by its naturalistic aspects as well…Let’s play the pirate on the Mississippi!

Whether it's because of his personality or the powers of his horn, no one knows. However, the gods become jealous of Unico, thinking that only gods should be able to decide or let people be happy or not. Unico is banished to the Hill of Oblivion, and the West Wind is ordered to take him there. She can't stand giving this fate to an innocent like Unico, so Unico's adventures begin, as the West Wind takes him from one place and time to the next, in a neverending journey to escape the wrath of the gods. In this adventure, Unico meets Beezel a devil child and then Katy (Chao), a cat who wants to be a witch! Can he become friends with them? 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Kids']","Unico is a young, innocent male unicorn who possesses a special ability to bring happiness to anyone near him. The story begins in ancient Greece with a young mortal girl named Psyche. She is the first friend to Unico, and is apparently so beautiful that the goddess Venus becomes jealous. The goddess attributes Psyche's beauty to her happiness and decides to remove the magical creature. A series of trickery takes place and leads to the kidnapping of poor Unico. Once the goddess Venus has Unico, she calls upon the second star, Zephyrus, later known as the ""West Wind"" in the film adaptation. The West Wind is commanded to take Unico through space and time, to the Hill of Oblivion with no memories of Psyche.
In the 1981 film adaptation, The Fantastic Adventures of Unico, the gods believe that only they should have the ability to control others' emotions and decide that Unico must die. However, the gods feel that punishment may be too harsh and instead choose to send the West Wind to capture Unico and take him to the Hill of Oblivion.
The West Wind takes pity on Unico and declines to follow the gods' commands. The gods are furious when they learn of the West Wind's defiance, and send the Night Wind to capture Unico. This is when the real adventures begin.
To protect Unico from the gods, the West Wind must continually transport the little unicorn. Whenever Unico makes friends and brings happiness to others, the gods are alerted to Unico's whereabouts, so the West Wind appears to spirit him away, yet he is unable to say goodbye to his new friends. Once again his memory is taken and a new adventure begins again.
","This review contains minor spoilers! 
 
I decided to watch this movie on a whim, expecting nothing of it, and I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the first 30 minutes of the film. After the absolutely adorable opening song, Unico is sent away to a wasteland. The lonely, cold atmosphere really got to me, and seeing Unico, the beacon of happiness and hope, pull through and turn the selfish, temperamental devil Akuma into a charmingly awkward friend was really inspirational.  
 
Sadly, the rest of the movie is much more average and not well-constructed. The second character Unico meets on his journeys is Chao the cat, a far less charming friend than Akuma. She stays a boring ditz the whole movie, not really learning much from Unico.  
 
The villain, while totally fearsome and creepy (mostly due to excellent visual design), really detracts from what the film could have been. He has no depth and is defeated without any emotional fanfare. While his battle with Unico might be visually grandiose, there is nothing of substance here. 
 
I really did enjoy the bittersweet ending, though. Unico’s curse, bringing happiness to all, but never being able to stay with his friends, is tragic but meaningful to me. The plot and pacing are really unfocused for most of the film, leading to plenty of interesting themes…that are completely underutilized.  
 
Still, I really admire how atmospheric and interesting the visuals are in Unico. The sheer scale of important figures like the West Wind, the Night Wind and the villain is immediately apparent with their distinct designs that look great animated. Unico is literally the most adorable character on the planet. The whole package oozes creativity.  
 
I should also mention that while this is technically a children’s film, I wouldn’t recommend it for really young ones. There’s plenty of violence and dark atmosphere, a very imposing big bad, not to mention subtle rapey undertones.  
 
Unico has a lot of problems, but its heart and creativity push it into the 7/10 territory for me. On a bad day, maybe 6/10. I recommend it to anyone who’s a sucker for this power of friendship type of stuff and wants to see some fun art and animation. There are much worse things you can spend your time on. 


          
 
       Helpful This is cute movie to watch with the kids (if you have some) or with a friend. The story is quite simple, which is not bad considering this is a kid's movies.  
The music is very cute and the art is nicely done. 
 
The fight scene towards the end of the movie was crazy and vibrant in color. The fight scene remind me of the dragon fight in sleeping beauty.  
 
 I would of liked to see Unico meet more people. but the two he did meet were both good. I liked the cat and her naïve. It drove the plot forward and caused good character development and was taught a good lesson about kindness. The demon Unico meets learns about friendship and how to be a good friend. Kid movies should have morals like these in them.  
 
The west and winter winds are good plot devices, which can be use to continue the story indefinitely. Remember that this movie as a sequel.

The second Sakura Wars developes studies on every Flower Division Combatee in every episode while they go on their miscellanious adventures around Japan. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']",none,"One of the problems that faces all studios, regardless of their medium, is how to build on success. The most obvious solution is to create a sequel, however as most people know, the sequel is rarely on par with the original, and it's unfortunate that following the success of the Sakura Taisen game and the OVA Ouka Kenran, the follow-up anime is guilty as charged. 
 
Released in 1999, Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran is set between the first two games and follows the lives of the members of the Imperial Assault Force - Flower Division. The Demon Wars have ended, and the members of Teikoku Kagekidan Hanagumi are finally able to rest, recuperate, and focus on their work in the theatre. 
 
Unlike the first OVA though, Gouka Kenran (which actually translates to The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Flowers - the first OVA was called The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms), focuses on the characters in a much more direct manner. Because of this, the second OVA is often called a ""character study"", and while there are nods in that direction, in truth this is nothing  more than a secondary introduction to the characters. Each episode is about one or more of the characters, and contain a mixture of drama and comedy, with little in the way of action over the course of the OVA. 
 
Deviating slightly from the main review here, there is one major factor that affects every aspect of this OVA, and it needs to be mentioned. The second OVA is not simply a sequel in the same sense as something like the Aria series, and the main reason for this is because of the owners of the franchise - Red Entertainment and Sega. The success of the game and first OVA caused them to try and capitalise on the franchise. Unfortunately they decided to do this by changing not only the series director, but the animation studio as well. This change has played a pivotal role in the creation of the OVA, and for those who have watched Ouka Genran, the differences are obvious and, at times, extreme. 
 
Going back to the review, there is a distinct lack of focus in Gouka Kenran. The decision to replace the original director, Ishiyama Takaaki, with Kudo Susumu, was a poor one indeed. That is no criticism of Kudo's skills as a director however, it simply means that it would have been preferable to have someone familiar with the characters at the helm. The change from one director to another impacts greatly on the pacing and style of Gouka Kenran, in particular the elements that made Sakura Taisen such a popular series. Kudo has tried to stamp his mark on the series whilst remaining true to the original game and OVA, and it's unfortunate that it hasn't worked for the most part. The plot tends to drag, or be overly dramatic at times, and without any real action to balance it, the OVA can become a chore to watch for some. 
 
Another aspect that has been adversely affected by the produciton changes is the art and animation. Where the orginal OVA was produced by Madhouse, Gouka Kenran was made by ANIMATE, and the difference is telling. The animation in the second OVA is a definite step down for the series, especially as the characters move in decidely rigid, and at times robotic, manner. The colours are as bright and cheery as they were in the first OVA, however the backgrounds have a far more ""cartoon"" feel to them. The only thing that couldn't really be changed was the character design, however the implementation makes them look odd at times. 
 
It's strange, but the one area that seems not to have suffered from the production changes is the sound and music. This may be partly due to the fact that the cast from the original OVA reprised their roles in the sequel, but on the whole the sound throughout the anime is of a decent standard. The music is well chosen, although some of the comedic scenes could have done without the comedic music. The effects are well used for the most part, however there are occasions when the vocals take a back seat.  
 
On the whole though, the sound is reasonably good. 
 
One would think that, given that this is supposed to be a character study, there would be some good characterisations and development. Unfortunately this is not the case. The fact that the series tries to focus on almost all of the members of Teikoku Kagekidan Hanagumi precludes any substantial development for any of them, and is the reason why I called this more of a secondary introduction rather than a study. If the intent was to study the characters, then the series should have been at least 26 episodes instead of 6 as there just isn't enough time to go into any kind of detail. That doesn't mean that the characters are bad though, as they are all likable in their own way. No, the problem is that there just isn't enough time spent with each character to make the audience relate to them. 
 
As with the original OVA, this is a tough one to recommend to any but fans of the franchise. It's unfortunate, but also true, that one should watch the original OVA before watching this as well, as this way the viewer will at least have an idea of what's going on, who each character is, and why they are in the anime. Although it lacks the same kind of pace and punch as the first OVA, the fact that the characters are effectively allowed to ""step out"" of their roles is an interesting approach that, due to time issues, doesn't actually work out.  
 
Ultimately though, the entire OVA is effectively all ""filler"", which is a shame as it could have been so much more.

But a new friend has joined the group. Her name Lycorus who was sent to find Orphen. Many mysterious shadows are overhanging over head.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shounen']","The young man Orphen engages in money lending activities in the back streets of the commercial city of Totokanta. Once, he was known as one of the Tower of Fang's most promising black sorcerers. One day, Orphen was approached by Volkan and Dortin, who had a very profitable money making scheme set up. Under the guise of wealthy merchants, they set forth toward the Everlasting household to partake in a marriage fraud. But, there was one problem: Volcan's plan was full of holes, leading one of the sisters to find out about their plan too. Then suddenly, a huge monster attacks the mansion. Among all the commotion, one name rings out: Azalie. This monster was what he was looking for for five years: his older sister Azalie who transformed into a dragonic monster. Between those who seek to kill the monster and Orphen, giving everything to protect it, his peaceful days are at an end. Trying desperately to transform his sister, Azalie, back to her true form leads to a treacherous journey that, ultimately, allows Orphen to learn the vast secrets of his world.
","The first Orphen had a great story with a couple of complete filler episodes few and far between. The art style was decent and the soundtrack was memorable. The story was prominent from the get-go as well as interesting to keep the viewer's attention. 
 
Here Orphen's Revenge is a completely pointless second season to the original. With entire episodes literally feeling like filler with about 80-95% being complete filler, 5-20% being actual story.  
 
There is literally only one episode out of the first 15/24 episodes that is interesting all throughout. And that actually involved the death of a villain which was unexpected.  
 
Orphen has 200% more battle monologue with the same 2-3 spells repeated throughout. Until about 10-12 episodes in you feel like it's just the same crap over and over in each episode with a teensy bit of story at the end. Most of it you feel like they're just pointlessly wandering around the lands. 
 
Chloe's character hasn't changed much since the first season but now shows more of a love interest in Orphen. Magic has improved his spell-casting and became a bit of ladies' man making his character slightly more useful than the first season.  
 
The trolls Horton and Balkan are the worst characters of the bunch and actually become main characters. The reason why I say that is because in the first season they would make their mandatory pop-up here and there but in Orphen's Revenge they are given way more lines and more screen time. They go from being okay to deal with in the first season to being outright annoying.  
They aren't funny and their comic relief role takes a turn for the worst. 
 
I got up to the 16th episode and realized I largely wasted my time watching this considering there is only a small amount of the story that was revealed with only 8 episodes left. As a viewer I would quit a long time ago if it wasn't for the fact I liked the original. I cannot recommend this to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Orphen meets up with Cleao and Majic once again for a brand new adventure. When a girl named Lycoris approaches Orphen and wants to take him to a society known as ""The Royal Public Order of Knighthood"", strange monsters appear and attack the group. Orphen must figure out who is sending these creatures and why. 
 
My thoughts: 
Sorcerer Stabber Orphen :The Revenge was a great sequel. I love the returning characters and the new ones that appeared. I also enjoyed the laughter most episodes brought and in the last episodes I was quite surprised at who actually had that “seed” inside them. I did enjoy the reappearance of “New Shrimp Man” aka Black Tiger, he was quite funny. This sequel to Orphen is worth watching.

","Medabots Spirits is the sequel to Medabots and follows the continuing adventures of Ikki and Metabee who now have to stop the evil boy genius Cam who wants to destroy all medabots and have children play with kilobots instead. However, unlike medabots, kilobots have no emotions and are simply killing machines built to destroy with medafighters who don't play by any rules.  
 
BTW, why in the english dub are they called kilobots? Kilo is a unit of measurement like a kilogram or a kilometer. Just call them killbots or kilabots or something.  
 
Story 4/10 
 
Medabots have gotten some upgrades since the original show; now medabots can transform into an action mode, a demolition mode, and can even fuse together into one medabot. I know that sounds awesome in theory, but in execution not really. First, with action mode, a medabot transforms into a car or hovercraft, but it isn't very useful in battle because think how useful a car is in a fight; second, demolition mode drastically increases a meadbots attack power, but Ikki almost never uses demolition mode; and finally, in the span of the entire show, they only use fusion twice. Why? You have all these great new weapons, why don't you use them? They just keep relying on the Medaforce like back in the original show.  
 
The original show had a good balance of action and comedy, but in this version there's barely any comedy. This is due mostly to the writers writing out all of the comic relief characters like the Rubber Robo Gang, Mr. Referee, and Karen who were present in the original show and were some of my favorite characters. 
 
Finally, the theme of this show is the importance of teamwork and friendship, but I hate how much it's hammered in. I understand this show is made for kids, but even kids get tired of listening to friendship speeches.  
 
Characters 6/10  
 
Cam: Cam is Ikki's new rival who wants to destroy all medabots and replace them with kilobots. What I like about Cam is how evil and cruel he is. Cam is merciless to his opponents and will keep attacking even after they've surrendered. Cam isn't kinder to his own kilobots either; if Cam feels his kilobot isn't strong enough then he doesn't hesitate to have it destroyed and replaced with another one. Cam even orders his own kilobots to destroy each other just to test which one is strongest.  
 
However, while Cam is definitely evil, his plan isn't all that evil. In the original show, the Rubber Robo Gang wanted to take over the world, but Cam's goal is simply to get kids to play with kilobots instead of medabots. That isn't very evil, I mean in real life some people play Yu-Gi-Oh and others play Magic: The Gathering, but that doesn't mean one game is evil and the other isn't.  
 
The Screws: The Screws gang are the three bullies at Ikki's school; I already mentioned how the writers cut out their old comic relief characters like the Rubber Robo Gang and Mr. Referee, but I think the writers tried to replace them by giving the Screws more attention. However, this was a big mistake because the Screws aren't nearly as funny. One running joke I hate is how the Screws keep trusting Cam just for Cam to betray them. Is the joke they're idiots for trusting Cam? 
 
Ms. Nae: Nae is a new character and the medabot mechanic who continuously repairs Medabee and the others. There isn't anything bad about Nae, but I hate how her entire character seems to just be a plot device the writers can use to give friendship speeches. I guess she's suppose to replace that chicken salesman that was always giving advice from the original show.  
 
Art 6/10 
 
Similar to how in Pokemon there's always a whole bunch of new pokemon whenever a new generation starts, many new kilobots and medabots are introduced. One thing that makes kilobots visually different from medabots is how kilobots are clearly designed solely for battle and not for friendship. For example, the kilobot Desperado has a body that's just one giant gun and the kilobot Cutter has a body that's just one giant knife.  
 
Overall 5/10 
 
Medabots Spirits was a step-down from the original show. It seemed like the writers had some cool ideas, but didn't know how to use them. Personally, I think Medabots was renewed for a second season as a cash grab only to sell more toys. 

          
 
       Helpful The story continues with the protagonist Ikki and his medabot Medabee. However, Ikki loses a battle to a new type of Medabot without emotions called Kilobots. Disturbed by the inherent nature of Kilobots, Ikki and Medabee fight Kam, the mastermind/creator of these Kilobots throughout the series. 
 
Story: The story was decent at best. In all honesty, it was a disappointment. The plot did not pull you into the story nearly as much as the previous seasons. Additionally, the story follows a common archetype and fails to build up suspense in the fights.A good characteristic was the continuing motifs of friendship and teamwork, although very straightforward at times, it abided by the previous notions of the Medabot series. Lastly, a real disappointment was the absence of previous characters in the series. My favorite Medabot Rokusho did not partake in this series, however they made an awful imitation of him called Roks which just made the sereis feel like its been going on far too long. Henry and the Referee had also been eliminated. Henry was awesome and the Referee was humorous at times. 
 
Sound: The sound effects were kinda crappy. I've taken into account that this is an older show, yet it does not live up to other series of the same period including various Gundam series and Hajime no Ippo. 
 
Characters: My only complaint from this category is the character development. Kam, Ginkai and several other main characters histories are introduced at what I thought was a bad time or simply gave vague details to support the following actions. The author also gave many episodes to develop some characters, but many of these scenes give counterproductive insight. 
 
I would rate this series a ""6"" or a ""5"" mainly because I enjoyed the prequels. Overall, I think this series killed Medabots.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","5000 years ago, the Triton clan lived in Atlantis until the Poseidon clan destroyed them all out of envy, leaving Triton the last survivor of his kind.  The white dolphin Ruka took the orphaned Triton to the caves in coastal Japan to protect him from his enemies.
Triton was taken in as a baby by the human boy, Kazuya Yasaki (矢崎和也). But Poseidon set off a huge tsunami that destroyed Kazuya's village and killed his father.  Kazuya, his mother and Triton then moved to Tokyo.  However, Kazuya was cheated out of his salary and in his anger committed murder.  He becomes a fugitive and works on a ship that, unbeknown to Kazuya, delivers goods to Poseidon's base.
As he grows older, Triton returns to the sea to take revenge on the Poseidon family.  With his dolphin friends Ruka, Uru, Karu and Fin, he proceeds on a one-man war against the Poseidon family.  During his journey, Triton meets Pipiko, the last surviving mermaid.  Together, they work to stop Poseidon and his evil minions and get vengeance for their family.  Triton kills all of Poseidon's 33 children one after another. Then he decides to go inside Poseidon's marine base to try to kill him.  Supported by the human slaves working at the base, they almost succeeded, only to be betrayed by one of the slaves.
During his battle with one of Poseidon's sons, Triton came to know Ganomosu, the big turtle who has lived for many years at sea and is very wise.  Ganomosu advised Triton to live on a floating island which is his granddad's shell and is surrounded by seven whirlpools.
Poseidon, who just managed to have another son with a sponge disguised as Pipiko, is unable to control this son, who is destroying everything in the sea.  Triton and Poseidon came to a truce with turtle Ganomosu as witness, in which Triton will try to kill this monster provided Poseidon will not disturb the mermen and mermaids' peace anymore. Triton kills the monster by trapping it under the sun on dry land.
Pipiko and Triton marry and Pipiko lays seven eggs. Three months later, two boys and five girls emerge. They are named after the colours of the rainbow: Blue Triton, Green Triton, Indigo Triton, Yellow Triton, Orange Triton, Red Triton, Violet Triton.
Triton takes the children on an educational cruise around the seas on a yacht.  It hits a storm and Green Triton is taken by humans. Triton goes on land to find her and he is drugged while Green Triton is taken to Tokyo.  Triton and Blue Triton go to Tokyo to get Green back but the two are separated due to heavily polluted water.  Triton, though, is met by Poseidon's general and is shown a piece of fake newspaper stating that Green Triton is dead.
Blue Triton, with the help of humans, finds and is re-united with Green Triton.  Meanwhile, Triton, out of anger, triggered huge tsunamis to hit Tokyo at Poseidon's suggestion.  Poseidon's general then advises the Tokyo media that the tsunamis are set off by Triton.
Triton finds Blue and Green Triton and realizes that he has been framed.  As he tries to take his children back to sea he is shot.  Kazuya and his friends finds Triton and together they exposes Poseidon's plan to frame Triton.
Triton goes after Poseidon to end the matter once and for all.  Beforehand he asks Blue Triton to lead the mermen family in his absence.  Triton then goes to Ganomosu, the huge turtle, and the two go to Poseidon's base for a final battle.  The battle ended with a huge explosion at the base, killing everyone except Ganomosu.
Humans continue to hunt for mermaids and are led to the mermaid family's floating island by dolphins.  Blue Triton then asks all the dolphins to push the island towards the human boat.  They succeeded: The island crashes into the boat and both sink.  The mermaid hunter dies during the crash.  Blue Triton then meets Kazuya.  He tells him that Triton is dead, and it is better for humans and mermen to stay away from each other.
Pipiko leads her children to meet Ganomosu, who is about to die.  Ganomosu says he will provide himself as a sanctuary for her and her family out of his friendship with Triton.  The mermen and mermaids from then on live on Ganomosu Island.
","Story: 
 
I feel like I'm being very generous since it has the classic ""Beat every mini-boss guy you see"" set up. The ending was weird and it doesn't really explain anything. Triton the main character is accompanied by a weird dolphin with a check mark shaped tattoo and is trying to defeat this bad guy who supposedly killed his clan.  
 
Every ""mini-boss"" has his (or her) own aquatic animal they use to beat Triton. They usually stump him for twenty seconds and then Triton comes up with the ""most genius"" solutions ever. The series repeats this about all the way to the end. Even the final boss didn't even seem that difficult to beat up. 
 
Art: 
 
Considering it being a old anime the art looks faded. The water looks like it's a solid object. The underwater scenes are decent. The ""mini-bosses"" have a cheesy design. They would always use the super buff bad guy or the witch-like bad woman. 
 
Sound: 
 
The OST sounds old. If you actually know what the guy is singing about it stupid. If you didn't its actually pretty decent. It's the kind of thing where you think it's suppose to be stupid, but it's actually cool. the quality of the sound itself is smooth (In the DVD version at least), but some of the voices of the characters can get really annoying sometimes. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
In general, most people in this generation won't even look at this anime. They got cooler stuff like  Sword Art Online. It kept me hooked since it gave me an nostalgic feeling. I believe it's hard for other people to enjoy and I really don't recommend this kind of anime if your into stuff like SAO. This action level is pretty much lower compared to Power Rangers. 
 
 
I have the actual DVD in Japanese. So if any of the sound or art summary are worse than what I say it's probably, because the people recorded it with poor quality. 

          
 
       Helpful This anime was chosen for two reasons: one, there wasn't a lot of anime that came out during this year; two, this was Tomino's directorial debut. Tomino is the guy that brought us Mobile Suit Gundam. 
Triton, based on the art work looks pretty standard for its time... like they were just discovering color pallets and water colors. The only release available is mostly Chinese bootlegs or streaming, or at least all I could find. I ended up watching this on YouTube in Italian with horrible German subtitles. The audio isn't very good either. I even heard a creature make the old Godzilla roar. 
The story isn't all that special and therefore neither is the anime. Triton is an orphan who grows up in a human village because his fish-people clan was murdered by Poseidon. He finds out he isn't human, the village is attacked by a sea monster, and then he leaves to spare the village that outcasts him. 
Each episode is much like the first.. Triton mad. Triton fights random fish monster sent by Poseidon. Triton somehow wins by 9 year old genius. Next episode.  
Sure we learn a little about Triton's past, and he and his dolphin buddy meet a mermaid who also survived the fish-people genocide. There is even some pretty violent scenes such as narwahls spearing their seal friends to death and rocks falling on giant creature to smash them to a bloody mess. 
All in all, this is an anime that isn't even worth a search nor a short screening. I made it 6 episodes before I finally had enough.

","This is less of a review and more of a public service announcement that this anime has potential, has finished airing long ago, and still doesn't have it's deserved fansub. However, one episode got a fansub in 2011 and hasn't seen any updates from that person since. This review will be of that single episode. 
 
So ""Gamba no Bouken"", or ""Adventure of Gamba"", is what appears to be - and probably is - a children's show. That guess comes from the type of dialogue that happens and the simple-mindedness of much of the cast - not to mention the simplistic art style and the fact that every main character is a talking mouse. This show, however, seems to have taken the mature-minded viewer into mind as-well though as there feels to be a dark underlying future to the plot, the show even presenting a wounded and bloody mouse in this episode. Of course that would be more mature in the way of violence, but I also see that violence as carrying psychological aspects into the cast of the series that will change them. Without even seeing the villain of the show yet, the mice already cower in fear to the mention of him, giving off a menacing atmosphere. The mice also are living around the human landscape, at least in this episode, and the humans also are presented in a dull and eerie fashion as if they live on a higher plane - not even acknowledging the existence of the mice. Even so, it's still clear they'd be a threat if they did notice, and the scanning of their flashlights around makes for another quite dark moment. 
 
I did say before that the art style is simplistic, and I wouldn't take that statement back, but what I feel it makes up for that with is it's creative animation. It's somewhat clear that there isn't too big of a budget in this show, but even so the simplistic characters allow for a fair amount of good animation that is enjoyable to watch. The characters are yet also what I would consider simplistic in this episode, but they all feel as though they serve a specific role to a group mentality. The group all has the same goals and fears, and each member has to add their own skills to do what they're setting out for in the future (but that's just speculation since only the first episode is subbed). The characters do feel as though they could fit into a slot, like the main character could almost be of a shounen, but the dark atmosphere of the story already feels as though it's changing them by the end of this one episode - the shounen mouse maybe later being similar to a Rick of Walking Dead (while I personally don't like Rick - so not a great example). I see that the main mouse will end up taking on a leadership role and face tragedy along the way, forcing him to think in a more grim and realistic mindset - as in this episode he doesn't even know of the villain's race and how apparently deadly they are (according to other experienced mice). 
 
Overall, this show has potential, and I'm already surprised how much I enjoyed this one episode. I expected that I wouldn't think much of it from the art style, but things look much more pleasant when you watch it in motion. The actors are also good and help in making the characters likable. Give this episode a shot and, if you like it, there'll another person who knows and wants another episode. Maybe one day when this show is then known enough it'll get a complete subbing job. Til then, I tap my pen.

Space Dandy is a dandy guy, in space! This dreamy adventurer with a to-die-for pompadour travels across the galaxy in search of aliens no one has ever laid eyes on. Each new species he discovers earns him a hefty reward, but this dandy has to be quick on his feet because it's first come, first served! Accompanied by his sidekicks, a rundown robot named QT and Meow the cat-looking space alien, Dandy bravely explores unknown worlds inhabited by a variety of aliens. Join the best dressed alien hunter in all of space and time as he embarks on an adventure that ends at the edge of the universe! 
 
(Source: Bandai Visual)","['Space', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","The space opera follows the misadventures of Dandy, an alien bounty hunter who is ""a dandy guy in space"", in search for undiscovered and rare aliens with his robot assistant QT and his feline friend named Meow. Though he and his crew act with the best intentions, despite being normally dimwitted and next to useless, Dandy is unaware that he is being pursued by Dr. Gel of the Gogol Empire.
The series has loose continuity, with several episodes featuring the main protagonists and antagonists dying, getting turned into zombies, or getting trapped in different dimensions for periods of time, only for them to show up as normal in the next episode. There are also many references to older science fiction, music, anime and Internet culture.
","Space Dandy is unique, it is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, it is fun, it is trippy, it is superb. Season 1 is good but there are several episodes that are a hit or miss, however, season 2 is awesome, much better than the first. 
 
STORY: 9/10 
Story? What story? Technically, the universe of Space Dandy is so vast that the creators can concoct any story and it will still make perfect sense. Space Dandy is an episodic anime, with the episodes differing A LOT from each other, this is mostly due to the fact that Space Dandy is directed by multiple directors, each bringing their own flair and style into the episode they directed, which is why I said this is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, because it is! 
 
There isn’t any continuity between the episodes, as such you are free to watch the episodes separately and still enjoy it as a whole. Dandy and his co may die in one episode, and appear perfectly fine in the next, and this fact, supposedly established in the very first episode of season 1, is actually explained brilliantly towards the end of the series (hence my high score). 
 
ART: 10/10 
Hands down, Space Dandy is one of the most beautiful animes I’ve ever seen in my life. Remember when I mentioned the episodes differ a lot from each other? This applies to the art as well! Each and every single episode are drawn in a different style and this gives us viewers a myriad of eye candies to watch for (that ancient Japanese artstyle in ep 5? Wow). Not to mention the jaw-dropping sceneries found in many parts of the show, my eyes were glued to the screen at all times.  
 
SOUNDS: 10/10 
Space Dandy wouldn’t be the same without the awesome soundtrack behind it. Most of the soundtracks are funk and jazz music (dandy!), of course there are plenty of other genres as well, heck, we even have live rock music (ep 7), high school musical style (ep 4), disco music from the 80s (ep 9) and many more. This season of Space Dandy had really upped the ante especially on this area, so pay attention to it as well when you watch it.  
 
CHARACTERS: 8/10 
Sadly, this season has more episodes of Dandy being isolated from QT and Meow, so we don’t see much of them as compared to the first season. Anyhow, Dandy is as cool as ever, and this coolness escalates to a much higher level especially towards the finale. Scarlet and Honey gets more screentime as well and they will be featured much, much more than just at their respective workplaces. Dr Gel and Bea are also featured as recurrent villains, and towards the finale, there’s a big surprise waiting… 
 
We also have a huge cast of new characters joining in, with my favourites being Johnny and Planet Limbo herself. See for yourself and you will as well, I am sure, love the characters in Space Dandy.  
 
ENJOYMENT: 9/10 
Granted, due to the episodic nature of Space Dandy, episodes may be a hit or miss, subjective to the viewer him/herself. If you ask me, I fell in love with most of the episodes of this season compared to the last season, and this season has many episodes with very high rewatchability, either to marvel at the greatness of the art, or the gorgeous soundtrack, or the mightily creative story and characters.  
 
OVERALL: 9/10 
I’d reckon that Space Dandy is viewable for all ages, but is especially appealing to the adults. Space Dandy should become more enjoyable as you age, due to the wide range of pop culture references in it. In conclusion, Space Dandy is a clever anime, and a brilliant work of art.  


          
 
       Helpful Space Dandy was created by the same people who brought you Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, legendary anime known for their great storytelling and stunning visuals, so what makes Space Dandy so special? Well it should be noted, he's a dandy guy in space with a great story to tell.  The episodes seem a bit random but really piece together in the end, Space Dandy season 2 really brings together the entire feel of adventure you get from season 1, it has great storytelling and is in all entertaining.  Critiques to keep in mind however, the ending is full of crap, not really a spoiler, more of a warning.  You really get attached to the story and art of the show, sometimes an episode can get you confused, but in the end you'll really miss the journey you went through with the Dandy Space Crew.  Truly an anime worth watching, and one of the few where the dubbed and subbed are as equally good, so watching either is great.   
For some more in-depth, first we can start with story: the story is a jumbled just like the first season but the seemingly random plotline is what really makes the story great, especially with all the butts and boobies to gawk at on the way.  The art is just stunning, the animation itself is outstanding and in few episodes you'll have to pause just to admire the quality of both character design and background art.  The sound and music of the show is great, it has great music to listen and gives a sense of awe.  The character development of the anime.........isn't that well done.  Keep in mind they can travel in space! They aren't off to see the same person all the time! However, you get a sense the characters never really change purely because the gang continues to move around everywhere, leaving loose ends everywhere such as Scarlett's and Dandy's relationship or Honey and her brothers true nature.  Personal enjoyment is truly a 10, the anime is phenomenal in the sense of entertainment!  Overall it'd deserve a 9, being a great anime to remember and watch when you want another adventure, but not one with complex storylines or anything serious, something just to sit back and relax, laugh and cry a bit, definitely a 9/10.  

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review and I'm not really good at writing but I enjoyed the show and wanted to review it. 
 
So, Space Dandy ""Season 2"". I didn't really have any expectations for this show because Season 1 disappointed me a bit just because my hype was so high for it. There were some enjoyable episodes but overall, Season 1 was a good show, and that's about it. However, after I got used to the formula of the show, Season 2 was very entertaining. 
 
There really isn't any story to Space Dandy, everything is different every week and the stories range from making a band to going to a musical high school and other various random things. I actually loved this format, because getting something new each week was great. If you are looking for something like Cowboy Bebop just because of the Watanabe name, you will be disappointed. And I am assuming that's why so many people disliked this show, or rather, was disappointed with it.  
 
The art for this show is amazing. There were different directors throughout the entire show and a lot of episodes looked completely different from each other. This is great, as sometimes an episode needs to look completely different because of the tone/theme of the episode and it works, most of the time. I can also talk about the animation here, in which Bones did an amazing job. Even with the episodes where you can tell that they are saving budget, it looks great. 
 
Dandy was the center of this show. Without Dandy being an amazing character, the show would fall on its face. Sinclair did a great job voicing him, and Dandy's mannerisms and how he acted really made the show for me. I didn't really have any problems with the supporting characters like Meow, QT and Honey, but I loved Scarlet and the episode dedicated to her and Dandy was great.  
 
Overall, I enjoyed the show more compared to last ""season"", and if you like episodic shows you should like this show. If there were .5s on MAL I would give it a 7.5, though.

However, all that changed when a carrier pigeon named Pippo tells Glikko about the chipmunks living in the vast North Forest. Glikko is convinced that the Forest is his true home, but Fluff refuses to believe it. The next morning, Pippo returns and warns Glikko about the dangers on his journey, such as foxes and hawks. The two are stalked by the neighbor's cat and it attacks them, but it misses and flees. Pippo thinks it's impossible for Glikko to make it on his own, but Glikko insists on going. Fluff makes an escape for Glikko and he escapes by flying through the city with their owner's hat.
The following night, he encounters a sewer rat named Gamba and saves him from an approaching car. Gamba offers Glikko to help him fight a gang of house rats with his friends. Glikko and the sewer rats win the battle and they throw a party. The next morning, Gamba wakes up Glikko and leads him to his destination, only to discover a zoo instead.
Glikko meets up with a chipmunk named Zipzip and he tells him the tales of the vast North Forest. He also meets up with a female chipmunk named Nono, who is also eager to go to the North Forest. Glikko leaves the zoo and Nono follows. Glikko refuses to let her come at first, but Nono tells him that she was taken to the zoo and he reluctantly agrees to have her along. The next morning, they feast upon an persimmon tree and are attacked by a black cat guarding the tree. Nono hurts her leg badly and Glikko manages to escape. Glikko goes out looking for her and eventually manages to find her.
The next morning, the two chipmunks plan to cross the fields to reach the mountains, but Nono suddenly catches a fever. Glikko tries to help her, but Nono admonishes him and orders him to leave. However, Glikko returns with a stack of acorns and he reminds her that he'll still be with her no matter what. The next morning, they encounter a hibernating squirrel, who flirts with Nono before getting snatched by a hawk. The two try to escape, but they notice the hawk patrolling the area. Glikko distracts the hawk by leading it into a thicket and celebrates their victory, but Nono knows that the hawk may return someday.
Eventually, they notice the mountains and find a boat during a storm. The boat starts to drift away in a river and Glikko sings ""We're on our way, Nono"" before eventually reaching the oceans the next morning. They play around in the shore and notice the mountains. They make it to the mountains, but they notice that winter is coming. The hawk comes and attacks the two chipmunks, but a fox intervenes and battles with the hawk, allowing the chipmunks to escape. The fox kills the hawk and looks ominously in the chipmunks' direction. The following night, the chipmunks notice the forest and head out. The next day, during a snowstorm, Nono tells Glikko her story about how she and her mother were captured by humans and brought to a zoo, which resulted in her mother's death. Nono starts to become weak and complains about how they aren't gonna reach the forest, but Glikko heads out and finds some tree bark, unaware that the fox is stalking them.
The next morning, the two chipmunks continue their journey and Pippo arrives and tells them that they've finally reached the North Forest. They arrive at the Forest and meet the other chipmunks living there. Pippo then notices the fox approaching them, having followed Glikko and Nono. The other chipmunks flee in terror from the beast while Glikko tries to fend him off. Nono and Pippo intervene, but are vicious battled aside. Both of them survive and the fox pursues Glikko to the edge of a cliff. Across the gulf was Glikko's only salvation; the other side of the ravine. The other chipmunks, looking on, called for their friend to jump. Glikko finally leaped, just as the fox did too, snapping the branch. The fox's claws raked across Glikko's back in midair, but only succeeded in tearing Glikko's bandanna. Glikko made it safely across while the chipmunks' most dreaded enemy fell victim to gravity. Glikko survives and the chipmunks cheer as they prepare a feast. Pippo decides to return to the city and Glikko requests him to tell Fluff about the Forest. Pippo then flies off as the chipmunks wave goodbye to him. The camera then cuts to the forest now empty and covered with snow before Spring returns.
","Even though he's lived his entire life in a city apartment, Glico (Grick) is restless, and yearns for more -- and when he learns of the Great Northern Forest from a carrier pigeon (voices by Orson Welles), his mind is made up!  He MUST return to his home (that he's never been to!)     
   
And so, Glico is off on a grand journey, full of dangers and hardship.  First encountering sewer rats (Jim Bacchus), then chipmunks in a zoo (where he meets his beau), constantly on guard for hawks, cats and even wolves.  Along his epic quest, he must cross a river, see the ocean, and climb over a tall mountain as winter encroaches.  The success of his journey is never guaranteed, as the naive little chipmunk perseveres from one hardship to another.   
   
Story-wise, it's pretty straightforward and easy to understand, and there are no problems with how the story itself is told.  The artwork is perfunctory with simple character designs and background artwork ranging from okay to pretty nice.  Animation is also perfunctory and unimpressive, but it gets the job done.  But this is really aimed at a pre-teen audience, and unless you are in the target audience, you'll probably be bored.  It's a kids movie that really doesn't have anything to keep the adults engaged at the same time.

Through the series, Snork, the Snork Maiden's inventor brother, designs and creates two flying ships of different type; the first is destroyed due sabotage and the second one gets finished at the end of the series. Before the second winter period, the Moomins and their friends also get to know Alicia and her grandmother, who is a witch. She teaches Alicia to become a real witch and has a negative opinion about the Moomins and their nice nature. As the series goes on, the witch however begins to appreciate them. At the end of the series, Snork decides to go on a journey with his finished flying ship while Alicia and her grandmother also leave the Moominvalley for the third winter period. The series concludes when the winter arrives, the Moomins fall into hibernation and Snufkin travels to the south once again.
","The producer of the Moomin series has stated that this second season should have never been made. And he is probably right. Across all fields, the second season pales in comparison to the first one. Still, it is hard to be mad about it, since we have already got an amazing sprawling first season that covers the original stories in almost entirety.  
 
This is a set of independent stories that, without a few excpetions, have nothing to do with the original stories. Writing original continuation to the stories is fine and all but from watching a few episodes you'll start to notice that the series does not feel like Moomins anymore. This review is based on the Finnish dub. 
 
Story 4/10 
 
The story is not bad, but it feels very unnatural when the main cast from the first season is put through them. In essence, the aspects that made the Moomins so enchanting in the first place, particularly the slice-of-life absent are  non-existent. 
 
Art 5/10 
 
In the art department, quality suffers tremendously when compared to the first season. Characters stand out in terms of lackluster animation and looks. Still, the characters are recognizable at a glance, but if you have seen the first season and the OVA it leaves something to be desired in terms of quality. 
 
Sound 7/10 
 
Sound department stands out still quite well, and the voice actors did a fine job. However, the second season suffers from out of place sound effects and music pacing, which is mostly due to the nature of the stories. 
 
Character 2/10 
 
This is the critical flaw in this season. The characters you witnessed in the first season are nothing like their second season counterparts. 
 
Enjoyment 1/10 
 
Let's just say that I get vastly more enjoyment from rewatching first season episodes for tenth-something time than delving into 2. season episodes a second time. 
 
Overall 5/10 
 
This series is unnecessary. Still, it doesn't take anything out from the adaptation of the source material which was done pitch-perfect, and this consists 75% of the total episodes. This is the main reason for the average score. The additional episodes don't bring anything to the table, nor take anything away from the originals. It is just out-of place filler that didn't need to be made.

          
 
       Helpful Hey, boys and girls!  
 
Say, what happens, when you take something, that was good - if not even perfect, to some degree - and then you hand it over to a someone, who's gonna make it... not necesseraly any better, but good nontherles, and then, you hand that project over to a some freaking pumpkinhead, who'll turn that into a freaking mess! I'll tell you, what'll hapen! It was Moomin, season 2! 
 
Overal, this isn't too bad of a sequal for a series, that really didn't needed a sequal to beging with - kinda like Little mermaid, or Lion king. The premise is still the same, just like in the previous one, and the characters are... more or less the same, like we used to know them. Couple of voices may have changed from the originals, due to the long age of the actors or such, and the personalities of most of the main characters may stray from the old and original traits a bit, but the Moomin Valley is still the same - again, more or less - and some of the little story arcs are at least decent, if not somewhat enjoyable. It's all about the viewing eye, and my eye, sadly, knows these episodes really, really well. 
 
The most notable difference between this season of Moomins, and it's actually good prequel, is the art style, characterization, and the stories. When the original was more or less cartoony, with it's fresh, fluid and soft animation, this one is straight anime-style, right down to the more ""obvious and exaggerated"" personality traits - whiny one, angry one, hopeless dreamer, etc. - facial expressions, and movements of the characters. And it shows! It is absolutely horrible to watch, and it doesn't fit with the format at all! It really is obvious that this season was mainly produced in Japan, because compared to it's more swedish-oriented prequel - also drawn in Japan, mind you! - this season almost feels like it's... dumned down, and it's really off-putting, to say the least!  
 
Another thing, like I said, was the stories. When the original Moomins were inspired from Tove Jansson's original books, these ones are entarily made up, and it also shows! I mean... Moomins in the ancient Egypt, destroying one of the most priceless treasures in our modern world today, the Giza's pyramid... I don't even know, what to say about that! And what about the antics with Da Vinci and Mona Lisa in the renaissaince era ... or how about wild west and Billy the Kid...? Is this a parody from Alfred. J. Kwak or what?!  
 
The musical track is luckily still the same, allthough some of the view new pieces really succeeded to pierce my ears really good, same with the new voice actors, when the old ones were too old, or died... I don't know which. Some of my favorite characters, like the Witch, Groken, and the Magician are also abcent, which is a real shame, since the latter was my first childhood crush.  
 
Despite all of my gripes with this season, this is not a bad sequel... it's just not needed to exist. The original series ended with the final winter, in Moomin valley, most of our loved characters are long gone on their marry ways, and Snufkin leaves forever from the Moomin valley, never to return again. This one... I don't even remember, how this ends, but let me tell you, it ain't good! Again, this is not bad... it's just different, than what would be expected... or should be. Give it a chance, but prefer to the original show. It's just easier that way.

","Goblin Slayer is in hot waters right now and I feel I must address that. I also have my own personal problem with the show unrelated to the controversy: namely its action scenes. But before I undress and nail this series’ fight scenes hard, I want to set a couple of things straight first. Let’s not jump into the nailing part without context, because that’s just… stupid.  
 
First thing’s first. Grimdark, in and of itself, is not a criticism. At best, grimdark is a style, a poorly defined one, even by the lowered standards of classification in the field of Literature. Others would contend that it is a simplified catchall term that has been used to unfairly dismiss certain fantasy works that do not conform to what a certain pompous writer calls the “Spirit of Tolkien”, whatever that means. 
 
For the purpose of this discourse, we take grimdark as a style, one that focuses on grit and gray non-Manichean morality. Like all styles, there's going to be generally bad and good examples. 
 
This show is looking like it’s going to be one of the bad examples. But I’m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, in the minute chance that the anime diverges a bit and grows the pair that the manga and the LN can’t. I’m not hopeful though. Neither should you. 
 
Let’s talk about good and bad grimdark though so that you, the audience, can judge for yourself, because I see a lot of people jumping into this bandwagon with phrases like “so realistic” and “if you don’t want realism, go back to your Hello Kitty stuff and STFU”. 
 
There are two main recurring problems I’ve observed in bad serious grimdark works. 
 
The first one, one that this show is exhibiting worrying signs already, is that bad grimdark, like most bad writing, is in a massive hurry to get to the good stuff of the story to the exclusion of all else and shot their pacing to bits along the way. They’re so scared of losing their audience because they have nothing else going on except shock and brutality. The moment they slow down for an introspective look, their rank garbage writing shows. They can rarely give a moment the clarity, hilarity, or gravity it deserves. 
 
The second and most crucial sign of bad grimdark is that it absolutely refuses to hurt any of its main casts beyond backstory fluff and trauma that appears and/or disappears quickly and conveniently when the author has no need of it. 
 
That is in direct betrayal to one of the core appeals of the style. 
 
Grimdark fantasy allows its characters greater agency and with it comes consequences. Simply put, a character doesn’t have black and white choices but varying shades of gray. Each choice has consequences, the number, scale, and execution of which depends on the skill of the author. The concept of greater agency and corresponding consequences helps grimdark works build up the tension, because if you consume enough stories, you generally know which characters are going to survive until the end or at least until the final act. But in grimdark works a lot could still happen even if they survive. Not only are they’re open to grow and develop through their choices but they also face possible negative consequences up to and including personal harm through say mutilation. They could lose a hand, a tongue, or a penis, and their narrative then towards how it affects them from here onward. 
 
People say that they tend to gravitate towards grimdark because they’re tired of the fluffy bunny shows. But that’s exactly what bad grimdark is, a fluffy bunny show wearing black paint. ""Wolololo this is a dark gritty world and people get hurt, except out main characters because they're main characters "". 
 
Plain old violence can and still do elicit powerful impact when done right, with proper build-up and context. But bad grimdark’s hesitance to hurt its main casts pushes the brunt of the violence into the unimportant background characters. And background characters dying or suffering rarely elicit anything, so bad grimdark has to escalate. 
 
And Goblin Slayer escalates. Into rape. 
 
Now we segue on to the rape scene, because you must be curious about my take on it. 
 
Eh. I have lived for a tad more than two decades on this Earth. I have seen far worse. At least it’s not the manga which has a tendency to fetishize the rape scenes. 
 
What I want to do here is attempt to give you an idea of how Goblin Slayer incorporates rape in its narrative. 
Rape, in Goblin Slayer, seems to be deliberately conceived and written to add elements of shock factor. The author made the goblins a male-only species. There's no reason for them to be a male-only species but the author made them one and pushed rape as their only means of reproduction. Ergo the author wrote the story precisely in such a way that it has to include rape. 
 
Why it has to be included? Well, I think it's simply a by-product of the escalation-of-violence/violence-arms-race in the entertainment media ever eager to snatch the attention of a viewing public that's becoming increasingly desensitized to violence. Escalation to one rung higher in the ladder into sexual violence is simply inevitable. If the author so chooses, the goblins could have had female specimens and not be purely male that relies on rape to multiply. And the fact that goblins raid and pillage villages of their crops while burning the villagers' homes and fields is reason enough to hunt them down without resorting to overly relying on rape to emphasize why they must be kept down. But it's what snatches attention nowadays because violence is already mainstream enough. 
 
The second thing is that rape is used as a call to action. Not of the victim, but of the protagonists. The eponymous character is waging goblin genocide because goblins raided his village and raped and kidnapped/killed his elder sister. The priestess witnessed to the rape of one of her party member and sticks to her saviour the Goblin Slayer in the aftermath. 
 
It’s not an exploration of rape and its aftermath here but rather a cheap gimmick. And so we come to the controversy that sparked. This is mainly what fans the flames of the detractors of the rape scene in Goblin Slayer: because it’s just another one of those gimmicky works they’ve read already from amateur grimdark authors in the West. Goblin Slayer is not the first or the ten thousandth to do this and earn ire. It may be the first anime you’re familiar with that got into this mess, if you only care about anime. 
 
The controversy is ridiculous actually. Basically, what happened was that Twitter has a little outrage, especially since Goblin Slayer’s rating used to be PG-13. Who cares? Twitter does that every other hour, perhaps (I’ve never been active on Twitter). Apparently the fans did and they went into full defense mode in preparation for the massive “SJW attack”, catching even more attention and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
 
Now we’re in this mess. Allow me to take this moment to clarify this controversy for both sides. 
 
The detractors are simply asking for authors to treat it with proper respect and gravity. 
 
The fans need to understand that that’s the message. They’re generally not calling for censorship of rape in fiction but a better handling of a perennially badly handled topic. 
 
The detractors also need to understand that most of the fanbase are honestly disturbed by it too but they’re treating their disturbed reactions as a triumph of the Goblin Slayer’s storytelling rather than a failure in handling a sensitive topic. 
 
The last point about rape I want to make is that rape IS a sensitive topic. Not only because it is continuously mishandled by amateur authors in a way that seems to imply that worth of their female characters are inherently tied to their sexuality and sense of purity (especially since it’s curious to note that a large part of rape victims in fiction are pretty and nubile, and even virgins). It’s also because of how rape is. Several people have come forward in defense of Goblin Slayer by saying “Why do we have to tread lightly when it comes to rape but not about murder?” 
 
Here’s the thing: there are a multitude of reasons for why one person murders another. How many reasons can you name for why a person rapes another? A murder can be framed as a good act, or a lesser of two evils. A rape can’t. It’s an inherently evil act that can’t be framed any other way which then usually causes it to take center point in the ensuing discussions. 
 
Now let’s go to my main problem with this show. 
 
I came into Goblin Slayer with 25 chapters of the manga under my belt. I know what to expect. I just came here for the action. Goblin Slayer is a story about a guy killing goblins, mostly.  Its story is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to connect one fighting scene to another. It’s a dumb action series, is what I’m expecting. And I’m okay with what. I love the occasional dumb action flicks. Who doesn’t? 
 
But I do have standards. 
 
I like realistic takes on fighting because 1.) they’re rare, 2.) I highly appreciate their research and dedication, and 3.) as someone pursuing a career in the field of biology, I want to see the human body pushed to its absolute limits. 
 
I also like unrealistic fighting with jaw-dropping choreography. I love Boyka: Undisputed (2016) even though I also watch MMA and the kind of blows that would cause at the very least dizziness in a real MMA match is just basically shrugged off in the movie and there’s little to none of the awkward grappling. That’s fine. Frankly, I just want to see awesome tightly choreographed fights and Boyka: Undisputed absolutely delivered. 
 
Goblin Slayer doesn’t deliver. A good action series lives or dies with its fight scenes. The one other thing that could elevate a fight scene is the story behind the fight and the fighters. Given Goblin Slayer’s setup, there’s none of that. It’s a guy mowing goblins left and right. So it has to bank on its fight scenes to actually be good in order for it to be considered good. And its fight scenes so far are garbage. 
 
It refuses to use wide angle shots to properly convey the entirety of a fight. As I’ve said again and again, a fight is a synthesis: thesis and anti-thesis, action and reaction. Here, there’s still the tendency to have action occur in one frame, showing only one character, then the reaction in the next frame, showing the target. Refusing to show both action and reaction in one frame rids the viewer of a frame of reference to ground the action which ends up limiting the impact of a fight. 
 
The action scenes are the easiest angle for the series to improve itself. And I hope they do. Because right now, Goblin Slayer is just insultingly mediocre. It’s not the worst anime of the year, or even of the season. It’s simply a very forgettable one that’s going to be remembered more for the rape and the controversy than anything else. 
 
Thank you for reading. Have a free pitchfork, on me:

Copy and paste it on my profile page if you disagree. It’s better than harassing me on my profile page because that would not be helpful to Goblin Slayer’s reputation at all.

          
 
       Helpful The problem with this anime: 
 
1. One the MC always have a armor and he eat with his mask on atleast take it off sometime 
2. The anime literally slay goblin atleast slay something else 
3. They need to really say a name of character first ep and I still don’t know their name 
 
Reason to watch it: 
The show is kinda dark which most older people like 
The girl MC is cute and the show is PG17+  
I like the plot but I like the girls more  
 
Character wise I give 8/10 
The MC is like a psycho who only kill goblin to save “people” I think he just doing it for fun and his partners the girl she is pretty useless  
Should you watch it? Hell yes

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR: at bottom ***Minor Spoiler from episode 1 below*** 
 
I am not familiar with the source material, my review is solely based on the first 4 episodes. 
 
CHARACTERS: 2/10 
The worst part of the show is the main character. He is an empty tin-can, both literally and figuratively. 
He is always wearing full body armor which covers his face and body at all times. This might look bad-ass in a character with  
less screen-time. But when the main character is wearing armor doing mundane things, like eating though though his metal visor,  
it really makes him look retarded. 
 
One might overlook the superficial appearance of MC if he was given something resembling a personality. 
He is obsessed with killing goblins because TRAGIC BACKSTORY. 
Boo-Fu*king Hoo 
 
 
His responses are monotone, like a robot. 
99% of his responses are 
 ""Is that so?"" 
 "" Fine.."" 
 ""I See.."" 
 "" Where are the goblins?"" 
 
These repetitive responses, combined with his appearance really get on your nerves over time. You don't care about him at all. 
 
 
The Main girl character has turned 15 and she really wants to be an adventurer. That's her motivation & ""personality"". 
 
Supporting cast is your generic tropes in an adventure anime. Most of them are there to talk about Goblin Slayer, to make up for his cinder block personality. 
 
 
STORY: 1/10 
Story is non existent until now. Just kill goblins thats all. 
The biggest flaw here is TONAL INCONSISTENCY 
Characters are non-serious, joking and bickering, sometimes, even during dangerous quests, followed by scenes of carnage, immediately followed by same jokes. 
 
Its almost like the things happening aren't real and have no effect on them. 
They look like Edgy teens running around in a Adventure game. 
 
 
 
ART, ANIMATION & SOUND 6/10. 
 
 
NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE INFAMOUS SCENE * SPOILER FROM EPISODE 1* 
 
There is a random girl adventurer that gets raped by goblins. She is immediately cast aside by the end of episode.  
Why not make her the main girl? She has a lot more reason to fight goblins and the motivation behind her actions would be self-evident. 
 And this would have made a dark action packed emotional drama with cathartic violence. 
But the show neither had the intellect nor the courage to actually deal with such an issue. 
That is why I would say the rape scene was unnecessary, exploitative and only there to seem edgy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TL;DR: 
A Human shaped Tin-can, a stupid girl, an elf, a dwarf and a lizard-man walk into a bar. 
All of them talk about how great the Tin-Can is. 
 
Tin-Can says ""Where are the goblins?""

       Helpful This used to be one of my favourite movies as a kid. It also made me scared of meat-eater-plants, octopuses and falling stars. Especially falling stars... 
 
I may be a little bit biased with this one, but I noticed that there was not a single review for Moomins! I tried not to put too high ratings, but it's so hard. I already feel like I'm giving it lesser score that I actually think it deserves. Sometimes it's hard to be objective... 
 
So where should I begin? Yes, it's a ""children's movie"", Moomins are targeted for children (which is odd since the original source, Tove Jansson, didn't emphasize them to kids especially...) but you can see a lot of mature themes and grim moments - I wasn't allowed to watch Moomin's before going to bed when I was a kid. Do I still watch Moomins? Of course! This is a good example of an animation that pleases everyone - at least I've never heard of a person who hated Moomins. 
 
The lore and the world in Moomins fascinate me a lot. This movie is no different, and it serves as an ""origin story"" to the show and it underlines the tone that the whole show will have - except I remember that the show was a little bit more lighthearted, which can be explained by the plot of this movie; A gigantic star is falling from the sky! You remember when Final Fantasy 7 went grim and melancholic when the star was peeking from the horizon, soon to be crashed on earth? Well same here, except the gripping feeling is through the whole movie ""Will they make it in time?"". 
The story is done well, it really gives you the feeling of a long and exhausting adventure, even though it's a short movie. The setting is build up perfectly for the show to continue where they left off, but the movie stands alone perfectly - just like the show does (so you don't need to watch them both if you don't want to.). 
 
The art style... oh boy. I just love it okay? It's simplistic but detailed where it needs to be? That sounded confusing. 
I haven't seen same kind of art anywhere else. I love how the hills, forests and other landscapes look. The colors blend together beautifully and give away a serene and a mystic feel in some way. Sure, the characters may seem a little bit simply done, but I think that's a matter of opinion if it bothers someone or not. 
For it's time, it was really pretty and I think it has aged perfectly. 
 
The characters are the weakest point to be honest, but they are still pretty decent.  
I've always loved Snufkin (really? that's what you call him in english/japanese?) and he definitely shines in this one once again. I just think he is so cool, travelling all the time and being handy, friendly, few with words and mysterious.  
The protag in itself is pretty neutral moomin, someone that the audience can relate to and look up to, since he is also quite brave.  
I was often referred to Little My as a kid because of my short temper... Eh, people either love her or hate her.  
But the blandest character... Floren. She is bearable in this movie, our heroes save her and her brother and she is pretty neutral, but in the show... She is just so meh. I never really liked her as a kid that much since she was too girly and moody in my opinion. 
This movie has it's great, okay and meh characters. All of which succesfully entertain you and makes you feel attached to them. The best character? The muskrat (a philosopher muskrat) who lives under the bridge. His most famous line ""Stupid woman - Cleaning doesn't help anything"" is a bit of a running joke in finland. 
 
and the music! It's awesome. Do I need to say more? (go google ""Sumio Shiratori"" soundtrack and listen those sweet tunes) THIS MUSIC SHOULD BE ON SOME VIDEO GAME OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD! (I'm sorry I had to.)  
but... the voice acting. I really can't bear the voices in japanese. Maybe it's nostalgia, I don't know. Little My sounds really unbearable. I prefer the Finnish voice acting and subtitles. Maybe it won't bother you. It bothered me. 
 
I think that I fell in love with Miyazaki's films because of Moomins. They are in many ways similar. And no wonder; Akira Miyazaki worked in this! He may not be Hayao, but the similar feel this movie and the show has is striking. Moomins are enchanting and enriched my young mind with wonder and adventures. If you love Howl no Ugoku Shiro or Majo no Takkyuubin, I think you should check out moomins. 
This is a show/movie I'm going to revisit many times and in a few years I'm going to watch it with my own children. 
 
(I'm sorry if my review is too hyped, I tried to tone it down. Moomins are my weak point and it's terribly hard to stay objective about them! I have notalgia goggles and I admit that. 
You can see if I'm only talking and go watch it! It's only 1h and 15min movie! If you get hooked there is always the show too!)

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Slice of Life']",none,"As I contemplate this strange little series, a question pops into my mind.  Why would a woman watch a series such as this, a series which is practically built around the idea of the panty flash?  And on top of that, why might a woman actually enjoy it?  I often find the gratuitous panty flashes that plague many anime series to be annoying, and the thoroughly unrealistic portrayals of women found in anime series can bother me as well.  However, when these anime traits are taken to extremes and/or used as parody, then I become interested.  It is as if the anime genre is poking fun at itself.  ""Colorful,"" in part, is a parody of anime fan service, and it makes fun of stereotypical male fantasies and male behavior.  I like ""Colorful"" for the same reason that I like the British comedian Benny Hill's classic TV programs.  A seemingly normal and innocuous man encounters an attractive woman and catches a tantalizing glimpse of her nether regions.  He suddenly turns into a blithering idiot, a sex-crazed fool who is driven completely out of his mind by a glimpse of a woman's underwear.  The expressions on the men's faces in ""Colorful"" are hilarious, and the sudden transitions from normal to nuts upon viewing the infamous undergarment are also funny.  The artwork and animation quality are good but not great, appropriate to the setting and story line, but no more than that.  This series doesn't have a strong story as such, but a strong, consistent story is not necessary; the randomness is actually entertaining.  Character development also isn't a major feature of this series, but again, strong characters aren't really necessary.  Since the show is interested in stereotypes, stereotypical characters are appropriate.  For a compact piece of weirdness that pokes fun at stereotypes, Japanese culture, and anime conventions, I find this series successful, and it is enjoyable to watch.  At least in this series, all the panty flashes are appropriate to the story and the concept. 
 
If Japanese men truly are as crazy as they appear to be in ""Colorful,"" I'll have to make sure I don't give them the opportunity to look up my skirt if I ever travel to Japan.  Japan's problems with groping, voyeurism, and other forms of sexual harassment occasionally make the news around the world, and the situation is disturbing.  Perhaps ""Colorful"" and other parody series like it are useful in exposing and counteracting this problem.  Maybe men can watch this series and see the humor in their own situation; the show makes fun of men, but in a lighthearted manner.  However, do men really want to be just like the jokers portrayed in this series?  I should think not. 


          
 
       Helpful Bad shows don't always stem from a lack of talent. Even the exceptionally talented of directors or artists have created a work which is far bellow their abilities at one time or another. Take director Ryuutarou Nakamura, for example. At his best, his works are powerful, thought-provoking experiences which warrant multiple re-watches. Yet he's had his fair share of busts, as well. One of these came a year after his magnum opus, the mind-bending Serial Experiments Lain, in the form of a screwball social satire. This is Colorful, Ryuutarou Nakamura's satirical take on the over-sexualized voyeurism of modern society and mass media, which can be summed up with the words lowbrow gutter comedy. Speaking personally for a moment, I can also describe it as a guilty pleasure. 
 
Given Nakamura's inclination of working on intellectually challenging and thoughtful projects, it is strange that Colorful is so lowbrow in just about every aspect. Conceptually, a satire of overblown sexual content in media sounds pretty juicy. However, in practice all the jokes end up being lewd and crude, rather than being witty and insightful as satires usually are. No doubt this is due to the subject matter of male fixation on the female anatomy. To put it lightly, the male gaze is prevalent in this show; it's naked women galore, with plenty of focus on butts and boobies. Much of the comedy centers around men getting distracted, or acting stupid and perverted, after catching a glimpse of some girl's cleavage. Amusing certainly, but it's hardly sophisticated satire. 
 
The humor also ends up being rather limited. There is only so many ways to depict male lack of judgment being spurred on by hot women. Granted, the show does play around with its pervert humor in creative ways and can be inspired in its lunacy (a giant school girl trots through a city, and all the men are focused on her panties), but it is basically recycling the same joke over and over again. In a way, this is actually counterproductive, as the show itself indulges in the voyeurism that it is lampooning. Although the episodes are only 5-6 minutes long, it is good to take time between episodes instead of going right into the next one; the perverted idiocy of the men in this show can be taxing, especially when taken all at once. That said, the show becomes more enjoyable in small doses and the show does provide a few chuckles and maybe one or two big laughs. Still, it's almost entirely brain-dead humor and if you can't open to its self-aware dumbness, then you probably will not like the show. 
 
Colorful was clearly made cheaply. The animation is stiff, and the character designs are janky. There is (naturally) more detail put into the girls, especially their 'assets'. Even still, they're hardly the most attractive anime girls. Nakamura's direction crude and undisciplined; the complete opposite of his usual work. With its nonsensical tangents and bouts of obnoxious wackiness, Colorful is more akin to adult swim shows like Tim & Eric than other anime. That's not a compliment. It sort of feels like Nakamura was just screwing around, which would be fine if what he produced was quality work, unfortunately it isn't. 
 
In all honesty, I can't say this is a good show. It is far too dumb to be a successful satire. Its humor is hit-or-miss, as well as being repetitive. It has no characters or plot to speak of; it's just a cluster of dumb jokes that occasionally hit the mark. There is enjoyment to be found if you let yourself sink down to its level, but the fact that I used the words 'sink down' is an indicator of the show's quality. It's a small but notable hiccup in the career of a rather talented director.

Story 
A mixture of different shots. Positively speaking left a surprise of what was to come. Negatively, plot could change at any precise moment. In other words sure one never got bored but how is one supposed to focus if you won't stand still. *crickets chirp( I thought it was amusing). 
 
Could have made for a rather interesting ecchi aspect. But several elements had my mind questioning the demonstration that made me miss the show. For example there was more than one ending. Why was there two? Did the creator originally shoot for one season of 8 episodes than due to popular demand brought in another season? Or, was it a marketing trick to rack in more bucks. 
 
For a show that demonstrates collection the least they could do is keep the episodes in order. Rather than have them jumbled. 
 
Art 
About 20 percent of the artwork show was recycled in some matter. Also, depending on scene the art acted in a somewhat stock market fashion in terms of grade. 
 
Overall 
Men like women. Or at lest they like aspects of them. That fact was clearly demonstrated in this showing. If you don't mind a bumpy ride with interesting angel shots to slightly make up for chaotic plot this may be your kink.

","I really really enjoyed this movie, didn't expect so much feels from a Doraemon movie, then again I do remember the old movies having quite a few feels. 
 
Story: (spoiler free) 
The Story can be somewhat predictable at times and somewhat cliche, but overall story was really nice, might just be a personal thing but the plot driving events in this one is quite obvious, that being said I still really enjoyed it, has an overall good moral. 
 
Art: 
The Art was Superb, really sticks to the original style while also having modern aspects of computing power added (the tree leaf animations). 
 
Sound: 
The Soundtrack really fit the scenario and really added to the emotion of the story and events. 
 
Characters: 
The usual gang is all there, + a few others that really remind me of Studio Ghibli's work (which is a good thing). 
 
   
Other: 
had a very "" nausicaa of the valley of the wind"" feel to it, can't say much more to avoid spoilers, but I totally recommend it to anyone even if they're not fans of Doraemon.

","The eternal dilemma which is always brought up infront of Anime and cartoon lovers, by those who are close minded is “These animations are for children, not for grownups.” As a result, you find a lot of Anime lovers resorting to Anime with evident superficial markings so that they could prove that Anime is not in actuality for children. Some examples of superficial markings is the presence of violence, blood, fatal injuries, or sexual intercourse. This way of looking at things is not accurate, because some Anime on the outset - such as Deadman Wonderland – look like they contain a lot of blood, gore and violence, but their storytelling in general is unoriginal, weak, and most importantly, immature. The Anime Thumbelina: A Magical Story, on the outset, looks very childish and is made for kids, and it lacks any semblance of violence or gore. The surprising thing is that this Anime is more suitable for adults than, let’s say, an Anime that actually entails all kinds of violence in it. So, what is the general rule that is applied to knowing precisely if a work is for children or for adults? Hopefully after describing this Anime, you’ll get a better view.  
 
The story is an adaption of the novel by writer Hanz Anderson, by the same name of Thumbelina, and it talks about a princess who is the size of a thumb, who comes out of a flower and faces many who would like her hand at marriage, until she settles in a true and loving relationship. The Anime adapts this in a light manner, and tells the story from a different angle. The main girl, Mia, is a normal human girl, who makes her mother exhausted due to her bad demeanor and shady shenanigans. Due to this trouble that Mia is causing, her mother seeks the advice of an old woman so that she could help her out with her issues. The old woman gives the mother a book by the name of Thumbelina, and the mother takes it before she falls asleep on her rocking chair, and is later picked up by Mia. Unfortunately for Mia, the book imprisons and traps her in it’s fantasy world, and from there on, Mia tries to return to her own world and her mother, and her true size as well, since she became much smaller upon entering the fantasy world. In that book, she will face a lot of enemies and circumstances, and form a lot of friendships as well in each passing episode. This is the body structure of the story, it is classic, and is ready to be filled with well-developed characters and a strong narrative. The script is very well done in the sequence of events and the speed at which they take place in, is intelligent in showing the necessary details. The writer is proficient at writing the script, and he respects the mind of the viewer.  
 
The Anime’s beginning is straightforward and spectacular, where the viewer gets to know the titular character Mya and the general goal of the story in a clear manner, and it contributes to sculpting a road for the writer to take later on in the story. The Anime is episodic, and each episode is different from the other, but they are all related in the fact that they have the general goal of adventure. Due to this, some episodes will turn out excellent while some others will turn out to be fairly average, and with that I find that the average mean score for all the episodes is fairly good.  
 
The main characters which are reoccurring in most of the episodes have a lightweight depth and are easy to understand, but they are still fairly developed, and that is something which makes it easier for the younger viewers to follow the story and understand the events that are taking place, while the older viewers are not deprived of any depth in the story as well. The most beautiful aspect of the story is that the development of the main characters, and that of the heroine are very concrete, and it begins to show more and more in a logical and natural way over time, and this is a professional achievement when it comes to storytelling.  
 
The secondary characters, or the guests of each episode, are complete in their compositions and are fairly developed. The ending is intact and beautiful, although being normal, and it was in dire need of a touch of brilliant directing to make it better, not better writing. There are some light negative points in weaving certain events and reaching their significance, and a lack of excellence in some episodes, and this deprives the storytelling in this Anime from reaching the highest level of writing, but does not deprive it from achieving a high quality nonetheless.  
 
All of the camera angles and movements have a significant meaning, and they contribute to the narration and making the Anime more exciting. The visual backgrounds throughout the Anime’s run are beautiful and very well done from a technical standpoint, and are filled with important details, to the point where they reflect on the personality of the characters that live in them, giving off a deep backstory for them, and contributing to making the story highly credible. The drawing of the movements and the characters maintain their quality throughout the Anime’s run, as most of the episodes contain incredible drawings and visuals, and there are episodes which are even greater, especially when those episodes become plot driven in a big way.  
 
The character design is imaginative and brilliant, even the secondary minor characters look unique in their own way, since each design reflects on the personality and traits of a character in a correct manner, without the need to make them look as outlandish as possible. The color palette is brilliant, especially when it comes to creating indoor lightning and mixing it in a way that comforts the eye and contributes on making the events more focused. The sound effects are also brilliant, as well as the music, which is harmonious with the events of the story and effectively contribute to aggregation and integration.  
 
All in all, this is an Anime that walks a fine line when it comes to writing, creative in showcasing it’s themes and has some of the best pacing in Anime. The characters are all well developed and lovable, appropriate for both young and old audiences. As for the old person, who suffers from the eternal dilemma of Anime being a children’s medium, this one proves otherwise. Don’t let the outer design of something fool you, rather let the essence of something be the most important. Plenty of times do we see something that looks like it was made for adults, but is in fact contextualized for a young audience of little experience in life, and plenty of times do we see a work that looks like it was made for a young audience, but rather becomes apparent through it’s context that it was clearly done for an older one. 

          
 
       Helpful I seen this twice and re-watching it again, I really think its underrated, also a very rare gem of early anime too. 
 
Story - This story is really a twist; it has elements of the story of Thumbelina base off Hans Christian Andersen but goes its own way. 
A woman whose fed up of her daughter's bratty attitude went to the town's witch and ask what to do, the elderly witch gave her a book called 'Thumbelina' and told her to  read it to her daughter. 
When she get home, she told her daughter Mia about the story and started reading it; a few pages in the story the Mother felt asleep and Mia decide to read the book however she suddenly grow smaller and smaller. 
Mia started her adventures, made friends along the way as well while heading to a kingdom to get back home and avoiding the evil witch and her magic. 
 
The story like I said has some elements of Thumbelina and a hint of the Wizard of Oz too while still being its own. 
Characters like the Toads and the mouse appear in the story as well with other creative characters. 
 
Characters - I'll admit their pretty descent but the only grew we see is our Main Character. 
Mia is indeed a total and ungrateful brat, like kids mostly are when she suddenly shirk down; she was helpless and scare  while still being bratty but along her journey, she starts being less of a brat. 
-The side characters are fun and cute too, Noble and Hoppy are super cute. 
 
Art- The art is good old school anime style, bright and colorful to dark and mysterious. True gem. 
 
Sound - Thou I did watch the dub, the voices were okay and I'll admit Mia's voice gets annoying at first but gets better later on. 
The music is wonderful and magical. 
 
The only down side I'll admit is the Witch Character, thou I won't say anything about it. 
 
This is a wonderful story to watch, and I want to find the DVD to this since its a cute story.

Fushigi Shima,"Professor Senbei finds a videotape of his deceased father providing instructions on how to create a love potion. The main ingredient is a tear of the evil Gyaasuka Daimao who lives at the Wonder Island. To retrieve it, Senbei takes Arale and Gatchan on a wacky adventure. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Dr. Slump is set in Penguin Village (ペンギン村, Pengin Mura), a place where humans co-exist with all sorts of anthropomorphic animals and other objects. In this village lives Senbei Norimaki, an inventor. In the first chapter, he builds what he hopes will be the world's most perfect little girl robot, named Arale Norimaki. However, she turns out to be in severe need of eyeglasses. She is also very naïve, and in later issues she has adventures such as bringing a huge bear home, having mistaken it for a pet. To Senbei's credit, she does have super-strength. In general, the manga focuses on Arale's misunderstandings of humanity and Senbei's inventions, rivalries, and romantic misadventures. In the middle of the series, a recurring villain named Dr. Mashirito appears as a rival to Senbei.
","Even though this is considered a movie, this is basically just an episode of Dr. Slump with the same length as an episode and even starts with the same opening animation and ends with the same ending animation. The story of this film is actually a direct anime adaptation of the manga chapters 32 and 33. This movie was released after episode 13 and before episode 14 so this would pretty much be ""episode 13.5"". 
 
This story of this movie is pretty simple which is that Senbei, Arale and Gatchan go to the land of Wonder Island to get a tear from the Ogre King Gyaska to make a love potion which was from a recipe in an old video tape by Senbei father. Wonder Island is actually the setting of Akira Toriyama's first manga of the same name and even has a few background cameos of the characters along with many other classic fairy tale characters. At the point in the series that this film was released there wasn't really any episodes where they would actually go out and adventure of go after a fixed antagonist so this movie does feel a bit fresh. All of the comedy that is in the series is still in the same fashion in this film as well as the characterization featuring more of Arale hilariously overpowering her enemies. Since this is a movie, the animation is very colorful and looks slightly better and has way better sound quality than in series. 
 
If you really enjoy the classic 1980s Dr. Slump anime than you will easily like this film as well since it basically is just another episode.

Before I tell you what I think  about this movie, I wanna tell you a bit about my trip to Kanagawa prefecture, Japan where I visited F.Fujiko Fujio museum. It is about 1000 Yen , I booked a ticket just in the freaking morning at Tokyo before going there (which is about 9 hours before the visiting time!) which actually I am so fortunate to be able to get 2 free seats , one for my sister and one for myself. 
 
'Yo , hey we are discussing review here hey...!' Oh wait, just let me slowly , immerse you into the creator's mind. 
 
Fujiko-sensei is really someone (just when I typed this I really ....ahh... think he is just..) he is just super captivating and the motives and he tries to deliver via his works mostly focuses on one thing : 希望 , if I romanize this, it becomes 'kibou'. Kibou means hope 
 
It is a highly , and furthermore, let's say 'heavily' mentioned in his interview which was documented and displayed at the museum. I still remember holding a small toy-like phone which can translate to other languages (hmm as I recall it has Korean, Chinese, Spanish, English, Portuguese and Russian!) I hear him talks in Japanese rather than English. Let's pretend you do not understand at all what he says, I replayed thrice on his speech, he literally says : 'Spread the hope to the world' 
 
And there's one picture I remember, he went to Egypt to get some ideas about Nobita's and Doraemon adventure....oh my God, please take me back to Japan haha.... 
 
Moving next to this movie, there's a part where a villain being portrait as the same as the main character and I appreciate Takahashi-san 'brings' out the emotions at that part (this part of the movie is the huge mystery) because they did not actually 'explains' who is the one that mimics the main character!! But in the end Nobita , Sunyo, Giant, Shizuka and of course not being said Doraemon had a really great time on their adventure. 
 
At the course of ending the adventure, of course, 'kibou' appears and embedded deep within my fragile heart… and woke me up from the long hibernation so I can take my first step again to realise longed dream.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","
In the Slayers universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its ""true form"", which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (shinzoku, lit. ""godly race"") and demons (mazoku, lit. ""demon race""), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.
In the world where the Slayers takes place, Flare Dragon Ceifeed and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu are, respectively, the supreme god and demon. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceifeed was able to split Shabranigdu's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdu himself would be destroyed. However, Ceifeed was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in Slayers, one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the Resurrection War (降魔戦争, Kōma-sensō, alternately ""War of Demon Conquering"") against one of the parts of Ceifeed, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdu won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdu's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only demons could pass.There are four types of magic within the Slayers universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the demons and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Lei Wing, Fireball, or Elemekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the gods, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the demon Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, demons can only be harmed by astral shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another demon with greater might than the target.
Above all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.
The protagonist of Slayers is Lina Inverse, a teenage wandering genius sorceress with many nicknames and much infamy attached to her that she refuses to acknowledge. Lina narrates (within the novels) the history of her various adventures, ranging from whimsical and silly to dramatic to even outright world-threatening crises, in which she becomes involved along with her traveling companions everywhere she goes.
","Alright, they don’t really say this in the show but ‘Seven months later…’ we have the same group pretty much with the same comedy, the same personalities, the same goals and fate has decided once again to make them meet. This is where it gets slightly ridiculous in that nothing seems to stop this bunch from having to be stuck together. I guess the writers found that we were getting tired of the small area that the Slayers was taking place in and decided to open it up a little by saying the area where they lived was in a magical bubble. They now have a whole world we now have to learn about after finally maybe understanding the magical area that Slayers was in. I at least like that they give you the information little by little but sometimes it’s a little too late.  
 
These young heros now face an even greater threat… or at least I think so as they take most of all this as a joke and just try to use the time for their own personal gain. Zelgadis wants to find a way to change his body back, Amelia wants to spread justice, Gourry just follows Lina blindly and Lina just tries to get cash. The only reason why Lina is in this new world is because her sister ordered her. They never explain why she is scared of her…. Or why we should even care about her sister, she is just there mentioned and then gone. 
 
All the bitching that I have done now actually is only a small part of the show in some regards but I have to nit pick or I wouldn’t have anything to talk about since the rest of the show is the same as the first two. I mean it, if you liked the first ones, then you would love this one. Filia is interesting, and adds a lot of fun to it. 
 
The art work turned out much better in this version; you can tell they put a lot more money and love into it.  
 
The voices again are really good, though some of the information about the barrier is lost in translation. I don’t get some things about it though it really doesn’t seem to be problematic to the story line. They just talked about it way late in the actual show so I don’t really know much.

Zelgadis wants to find a way to change his body back, Amelia wants to spread justice, Gourry just follows Lina blindly and Lina just tries to get cash. The only reason why Lina is in this new world is because her sister ordered her. They never explain why she is scared of her…. Or why we should even care about her sister, she is just there mentioned and then gone. 
 
All the bitching that I have done now actually is only a small part of the show in some regards but I have to nit pick or I wouldn’t have anything to talk about since the rest of the show is the same as the first two. I mean it, if you liked the first ones, then you would love this one. Filia is interesting, and adds a lot of fun to it. 
 
The art work turned out much better in this version; you can tell they put a lot more money and love into it.  
 
The voices again are really good, though some of the information about the barrier is lost in translation. I don’t get some things about it though it really doesn’t seem to be problematic to the story line. They just talked about it way late in the actual show so I don’t really know much. 


          
 
       Helpful In the world of entertainment in this case anime, it's usually a crime punishable by ridicule to not fall into the hive mind. One may find themselves victim of the hairy eyebrow simply for seeing something from a totally different perspective. In regards to the Slayers series, at least before Slayers Revolution and Slayers Evolution R; it was pretty much mandatory to at least think of Slayers Try as the inferior series of the franchise. Many of the complaints I heard about the series is the unfamiliar feel to its predecessors: ""the comedy and silliness simply isn't the same"", it's different"", and other criticisms of that type. This brings me to believe that many people have a big soft spot for redundancy, and evolution can simply take a walk. Slayers needed to stray away from its usual path because its weaknesses really began to show in Slayers Next. Slayers Try has a familiar feel, but there is clearly something different here and it really isn't a bad thing. After this re-watch I firmly believe Slayers Try is the best of the first three seasons. 
 
This story takes place awhile after the battle against Fibrizo the Hellmaster. As a result, a barrier surrounding the island which was put in place by the monsters has been lifted giving access to the outer world. Lina and Gourry encounter Zelgadis, and they're soon greeted by a woman named Filia whom later briefs them about a prophesy that will lead to the world's destruction. The crew gather and go off on this new adventure. 
 
It's very important to mention that Slayers try doesn't feel as madcap as the previous seasons. There definitely is plenty of random comedy to be found, but there's more of a focus on plot progression, story development, and even character development for a new character. Surprisingly, Slayers Try is actually at its absolute weakest when it breaks away from the main story and focuses on the stupidity. Even the characters some times break the fourth wall mentioning the stupidity in a negative way, which can add to the fun. 
 
When Slayers Try is focused, it definitely delivers an engrossing experience with plenty of very interesting back story, and the plot is frequently effected by all of this. The large amounts of story works very well in developing the character Filia and her people, as well as new threat Valgaav. I have to say that Valgaav is by far the most interesting villain in the series at this point, and is far away from the usual cookie cutter type meant only to push the plot. Filia was indeed a surprise and many fans were ticked because she received so much development while Lina and Gourry's budding relationship received no attention. I'm fine with this completely because Filia actually served a purpose, and there was more to her personality. Despite some small missteps in pacing, when compared to the last seasons I was surprised by the steady progression a majority of the time. I also liked the smaller details on how the outside world saw people using magic, with some of the populace seeing Amelia as an angel from heaven as she cured a person from an injury. It would have made for better storytelling had this story element been given more time. 
 
I hope some people don't get things twisted though; there is still some good comedy like one of the early food fights between the crew involving some spaghetti, Lina's angry insults, along with Gourry's classic stupidity, and some in your face parodies that actually work. Also, the action is pretty stable too with some nice encounters against the main threats. 
 
The animation is about on the level of Slayers Next which isn't a bad thing. The high energy attack battles are still just as vibrant, epic, and entertaining, and there's quite a bit of onscreen death. Valgaav has a nice design along with various others clearly indicating that some of these guys are from a different world. The darker settings still look just as great, and the soundtrack still does its job good enough. In regards to voice acting, the English dub continues to shine and Lisa Ortiz simply has Lina Inverse down. 
 
It may be blasphemy to hail Slayers Try as the best of the original series, but swimming against the current has been my style for years; to those whom came into the first two series I highly advise to brace yourself for something kind of different. This series has plenty to offer while still maintaining something from its usual self. 
 
Highs: Much better story and plot development, interesting new characters 
 
Lows: Some weak filler moments, a tad bit of reused jokes

But a brave man with an afro of gold and nose hairs of steel stands up against their tyranny. Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, trained in the ways of hair, rescues a teenager named Beauty from the grunts of the Maruhage Empire. Together, they start on a journey to defeat Emperor Tsuru Tsurulina IV. As Bo-bobo meets new friends and battles foes along the way, so too does he begin his quest to save all the hairs of the world! 
 
Light-hearted and comical,  Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo  details a wacky adventure in which Bo-bobo and his companions fight all sorts of villains and deviants within the Maruhage Empire, all the while having a fun and exciting adventure. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']","In the year 300X, the entire world is under the tyrannical rule of a regime called the Maruhage Empire (Chrome Dome Empire in the English dub). Its ruler, Emperor Tsuru Tsurulina IV (Czar Baldy Bald IV), has initiated the Hair Hunt, a crusade where his soldiers, the Hair Hunters, invade settlements, shave every person they see bald, and leave said settlements in ruins. Standing against the Hair Hunt is Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, a bizarre rebel who fights the Hair Hunters with the Hanage Shinken (Fist of the Nose Hair), a martial art that gives him the power to control his nose hairs like whips. Bo-bobo's team consists of Beauty, a normal teenage girl he rescued; Heppokomaru (Gasser), a teenage boy who fights with the Onara Shinken (Fist of the Back Wind), allowing him to weaponize his own flatulence; and Don Patch (Poppa Rocks), an eccentric creature who leads the Hajike Gang (Wiggin Gang), a group that fights by confusing their enemies into submission. Bo-bobo is on an exciting, gag-filled quest in which he uses his hair as a weapon in many locales to fight the forces of the Maruhage Empire as he gains other allies along the way.
","Bobobo-bo is certainly an anime of one of it's kind. With the hilarious character of Bobobo, and so many hilarious moments, with not only Bobobo, but also Don Patchi, Beauty, Hekkun and the others it's certainly something that should be watched. With many quirky moments, that are not expected, especially during the fight scenes, it will certainly make you carry on watching. Perhaps, the characters are rather unusual at some moments, but you will quickly get to like them, with their varied attitudes, to their adventure. At some times it may question their character, but it would quite certainly make you want to watch further. In addition to that, what really caught my attention is the opening song. It truly is one of a kind, and it's super catchy, so be warned, you may want to listen to it on repeat. Whenever it's true to the manga, I am yet to see, as I haven't read it, but regardless of whenever you watch or read first, you should see this anime. 

          
 
       Helpful Review 12: Lil' Birds Flock Together, but Only the Early Worm Will Catch Their Death of Cold, so Dress Warmly! 
 
Ladies and germs, weeaboos and otakus alike, hold onto your butts, you're in for the ride of your life. This is the widget series you weren't looking for let alone have heard of. Actually, you might have heard of it and just hadn't seen it, but don't let your ears hog it all, let your eyes feast as your brain fries. And don't let it just be you, bring your friends, your families, your peers, there's plenty to go around. There's something for everybody. And if they don't like it and think you're a weirdo for watching something that looks like a Saturday morning cartoon small children would sit in front of the TV drooling over for hours, then they clearly don't know the meaning of mindless entertainment, and they probably watch reality TV. 
 
Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo is the king of mindless entertainment, and it shamelessly boasts it from the rooftops while its nose hairs take you for a spin on your head after you're stuffed into a tutu you never knew you had. But don't worry, you're not the only one dressed up, everyone involved is in a tutu attempting and failing to reenact Swan Lake, it's just that you're the only one spinning on your head. No harm done, unless you're the bad guy. 
 
Oh, I'm supposed to write a review. Sorry, got caught up in the imagery and had to untangle myself. Let's get back on track, shall we? 
 
STORY: Funny, Bo-bobo has no real story. Sort of. It kind of forgets it has a story. It has arcs, I suppose, and like every other shounen series, the arcs span several episodes a-piece, but luckily not to the extent of “They're still on Namek?”. But I'm sure it's parodied somewhere and I just didn't catch it, or the anime never made it that far. The entire show's a parody of Fist of the North Star anyway, although I've yet to really watch it for myself, so that's probably my problem. 
 
But for the set-up, it's the year 300X-and-a-half, and the Margarita Empire's leader sent of a group of Hair Hunters to go around and shave everyone's hair off. A young girl named Beauty was about to lose her head of hair when a tall, muscular man with sunglasses and a blonde afro arrived beating the snot out of them with his Super Fist of the Nose Hair, a fighting style known as “Wiggin”. He's a rebel, and is going around looking for more like him standing up to the tyranny. For the next several episodes, they gather more allies and make new enemies all in the name of hair and insanity. Then it's just insanity the rest of the time like you took a wrong turn on Willy Wonka's boat ride through the tunnel, just with less nightmare fuel and flashing lights. And insanity is both normal and abnormal, depends on which end of the stick you're on. 
 
You'll never get used to it, but it all becomes the norm before you know it. Kind of like with Yellow Submarine, except I don't think Bo-bobo was ever influenced by drugs. At least, nothing official has come out about it. But the show's been described as something Jay Ward (the creator of Rocky and Bullwinkle) would create if he did LSD. So that counts, right? 
 
CHARACTERS: The show has many colorful characters that just grows and they all go bonkers as it continues. What'd you expect from a show that's 76 episodes long? I swear the show bypasses Dragon Ball in terms of its cast, but I'm probably over-exaggerating because there's quite a number of characters that last for an episode or two. So luckily for you, reader, you're going to get acquainted with them right now. 
 
Reader, meet Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Beauty, Don Patch, Jelly Jiggler, Gasser, Softon, Dengakuman, Hatenkou, Don Patch—wait, I already counted him—King Nosehair, Captain Battleship, Suzu, Serviceman, the Narrator, Over, Torpedo Girl, Giga—wait, where're you going? It's not over yet! I didn't say I was done! *throws a protesting Jelly Jiggler at you to stop you in your tracks* 
 
ART/ANIMATION: This is Toei Animation's animation. No, it's not good, but its simplicity works for the type of show it is. Things get wacky and colorful, so the less strain on the animators' part and the viewers' eyes, the better. The character models are some of the more unique seen in anime, it's one-of-a-kind. At least I think they are. The only other (shounen) anime I can think of more weird-looking than Bo-bobo are Zatch Bell and One Piece, but that was at least from a glance. Which is also weird because Toei did those shows as well. They seem have a knack for doing anime with unique art styles. Or maybe it's because such models are simple enough for them to do limited animation and let's them get away with off-model moments. Seems right up their alley, anyway, and so with Bo-bobo, I suppose they used it to their advantage to make the animation go just about anywhere in quality. And indeed, its animation is one of Bo-bobo's keys to its success in its humor next to the dialogue. And so for a show that first aired back in late-2003, Bo-bobo is pretty much a product of its time in the art department. Not that it's a bad thing. 
 
Also, bonus points for Toei to have actually done adaptations of some of the anime being parodied like Fist of the North Star. Not entirely sure if that was just mere coincidence. 
 
SOUND: I don't know what the Japanese is like, I chose to watch it dubbed. The reason I did this is because the show heavily relies on Japanese pop culture and puns, something that's basically untranslatable and the average non-Japanese-born-and-raised viewer is not going to fully understand. This is pretty much 99% of us on the site, maybe 98%. Whatever, Bo-bobo doesn't care.  
 
So the script was pretty much rewritten for the dub while still maintaining the spirit of the show. Like I'm surprised this wasn't done by Saban Entertainment, who had previously done gag dubs in both Samurai Pizza Cats and Digimon. To further back this up, Jeff Nimoy was one of the screenwriters (and also voiced the character Hatenkou), and the dub is pretty much a Digimon reunion (that spans across the first three seasons). But the actual company behind it was Phuuz Entertainment Inc. (now Unbound Creative, Inc.) with Cloverway Inc. 
 
The voice actors were very stellar for their roles. Richard Epcar is the titular character, and he was pretty much Myotismon while channeling Etemon, which was the best thing I could've asked for. In the Japanese, it's Dio himself, Takehito Koyasu, but it was learning that Mr. Epcar was the main character that sold me on watching it dubbed next to the facts previously mentioned. Philece Sampler is Beauty, who I felt was a better fit for her than Mimi (although despite what I've said in my Digimon review, I've actually been beginning to warm up to her role as Mimi), and she did a fantastic job delivering her lines. Others include Kirk Thornton as Don Patch, which fans agree is his best role and it probably always will be his best if only because the character stole the show, Jamieson Price as the butt monkey Jelly Jiggler, Brian Beacock as Dengakuman (who sounds like he's on helium the whole time, but it's better than it sounds), and of course, Michael McConnohie as the Narrator. For the villains, notable voice actors are Paul St. Peter as Captain Battleship, Liam O'Brien as Over, and David Lodge as Giga. 
 
Pretty solid cast, if you ask me. 
 
The first opening, “Wild Challenger”, is a minute long, but it pretty much sums up Bo-bobo. Not that I'm recommending you just skip the entire show and just watch the opening, because I'm not, but if you just want a quick taste before deciding, go for it. Not that “Baka Survivor” doesn't capture Bo-bobo's spirit, but it took a few episodes for the second opening to grow on me, while the first got me sucked in from the start. You might like it more, though, it just depends on your taste. The endings are an entirely different story. I listened to them, but I was never a big fan. They're not bad, except “Shiawase” makes my ears cringe (but it's an earworm), and I don't remember “Kirai Tune” very well. “H.P.S.J.” at least is something and acts pretty much like a dance party ending for every episode, but that's about it. 
 
ENJOYMENT: I've never taken a picture or recorded myself watching this show (although I've had my webcam on once for a friend who was also watching the show, so he at least knew what went on), but I know what my expression was for every single episode. I'll demonstrate: 
 
I'm leaning in my chair, elbows on my laptop, or desk or wherever else I'm sitting at, chin in my hand. I'm transfixed to the screen, watching and listening intently as my jaw slacks in preparation for an outburst of laughter that'll bring tears to my eyes, or just hangs in awe at what's going on on the screen. My brain can't keep up, and goes into hibernation until the episode ends, or I stop watching for the day. I become a couch potato, reminiscent of my childhood days of sitting in front of the tube watching cartoons. And I feel nothing but bliss. 
 
And that's how I enjoyed my time with Bo-bobo. And I'll do it all over again, although I'd like to watch it with someone else. 
 
So despite my ramblings, I definitely recommend this if you're in the mood for some over-the-top wackiness in your search for widget series. Just don't binge-watch this show. You'll die. 
 
Of laughter. Though you might also die of boredom if this isn't your thing. Bo-bobo doesn't care, but at least the laughter isn't canned like the show was. And that's terrible.  
 
The show being canned, I mean. I'm just making myself sad thinking about it. Still doesn't take away from the enjoyment, thankfully, that's what matters in the end.

The music is a joy to listen to I thought alll the songs were great. I haven't heard this style of music used to often. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
All of the characters were awesome and funny.Even the one-shot bad guys are entertaining. But Don Patch got on my nerves sometimes. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
To say I enjoyed this show immensely is a massive understatement, It never failed to cheer me up. Evey episode had at least one moment that caused me to burst out laughing uncontrollably, I had a great time watching this with my younger brother. 
 
OVERALL: 
Bobobo is a anime that will always be on my all time fav list, every episode is so ridiculous and random that I never got tired of watching it. this show has the best blend of action and comedy I think iv'e ever seen in anime.

       Helpful Listen, if you're looking for a glorious, action-packed, fantasy show full of drama and deep story writing... Then this anime is not for you, heck, just stop reading this review and look for another anime to watch this year. 
 
On the contrary, if you're looking for some light watch full of cute girls doing some adventuring, getting into some shenanigans, and having fun while fighting demons. Then keep reading. 
 
This anime doesn't take itself too seriously. Focusing more on the cuteness, the adventures, and the overall character interactions of our protagonists. All which has zero drama and no depth, just your regular wholesome adventurer party in training. 
 
Story: There doesn't seem to be any plot around here, other than ""defeat the demon king"" and things like that. This series seems to be taking more of a... episodic storyline(?) where each episode contains its own story. Personally, there's nothing wrong with it, but some might not enjoy it. 
 
Art and Sound: Personally it's not bad, there's no glaring problems at all, but it's definitely not the best I've seen and heard. 
 
Character: They are a picture perfect example of your ordinary hero party. (Hero, Lancer, Tank, Support). But this show gave them some nice little quirks that makes the character interaction seems to be more interesting in some way. 
 
Enjoyment: It's not deep and the humor's can fell short in someway, but the whole show's cuteness and its overall expansive adventures and settings can make it very worthwhile in a wholesome and light way. (Though the humor can feel pretty dry and repetitive in some way.) 
 
Overall: By looking at this objectively, I can fairly say that this anime isn't just for anyone. The lack of drama, emotion, and deep writing in it can make it pretty stale and boring to some people.   
 
However, to those who is just looking for some light watch in the nature of Nichijou and Lucky Star... you might like this one a lot!

          
 
       Helpful This is another of those ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows. By itself that's not really a problem. The characters are just fleshed out enough to not feel like cutouts and the framing is done decently; however, there's really not a lot going on at the end of the day. 
 
This is basically a slice-of-life show with a fantasy coat of paint with a dash of magical girls thrown in for good measure. The first few episodes do the framing fine, but once that's set up nothing is expanded on. This is an excuse plot through and through and used to set up silly scenarios. I would liken this show to Konosuba in that regard, but that show had its own glorious level of intentional awfulness with its protagonists and I simply can't find this group's quirks or antics nearly as funny. 
 
I also had a few issues with the art. Characters always had some kind of blush no matter situation. Blush stickers, blush lines, luminescent blush, drunk blush- it all all there and sometimes it was stacked which just looked weird. I didn't find any of the designs or art particularly interesting which really made the already mediocre cute things going on only mildly enjoyable. 
 
I wouldn't say no to this show being put on the TV as background noise, but it's not really anything worth putting any investment in.

","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shounen']","The world of Earth-land is home to numerous guilds where wizards apply their magic for paid job requests. Natsu Dragneel, a Dragon Slayer wizard from the Fairy Tail guild, explores the Kingdom of Fiore in search of his missing adoptive father, the dragon Igneel. During his journey, he befriends a young celestial wizard named Lucy Heartfilia and invites her to join Fairy Tail. Natsu, Lucy, and the cat-like Exceed Happy form a team, which is joined by other guild members: Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a magical knight; and Wendy Marvell and Carla, another Dragon Slayer and Exceed duo. The team embark on numerous missions together, which include subduing criminals, illegal dark guilds, and ancient Etherious demons created by Zeref, a wizard cursed with immortality and deadly power.
After several adventures, Natsu and his companions find Zeref living in isolation on Fairy Tail's sacred ground of Sirius Island, where he expresses a desire to die for the atrocities he has committed. A battle over Zeref ensues between Fairy Tail and the dark guild Grimoire Heart, which attracts the attention of the evil black dragon Acnologia. The Fairy Tail wizards survive Acnologia's assault when the spirit of their guild's founder and Zeref's estranged lover, Mavis Vermillion, casts the defensive Fairy Sphere spell that places them into seven years of suspended animation. Later, Fairy Tail wages war against Tartaros, a dark guild of Etherious who aim to unseal a book believed to contain Zeref's ultimate demon, E.N.D. When Acnologia returns to annihilate both guilds, Igneel – revealed to have sealed himself within Natsu – emerges to battle Acnologia, only to be killed in front of a helpless Natsu, who departs on a training journey to avenge Igneel.
After Natsu returns one year later, Fiore is invaded by the Alvarez Empire, a military nation ruled by Zeref, who intends to acquire Fairy Heart, a wellspring of infinite magic power housed within Mavis's equally cursed body preserved beneath Fairy Tail's guild hall. While battling Zeref, Natsu is informed of his own identity as both Zeref's younger brother and the true incarnation of E.N.D. (Etherious Natsu Dragneel), whom Zeref resurrected as a demon with the intention of being killed by him. When Natsu fails to do so, Zeref absorbs Fairy Heart from Mavis in a bid to rewrite the present timeline with one where he might prevent his own curse and Acnologia's rise to power. After Natsu defeats Zeref to stop the drastic changes to history his actions would create, Mavis lifts her and Zeref's curse by reciprocating his love, which kills them both.
Meanwhile, Fairy Tail and their allies detain Acnologia within a space-time rift created by the use of Eclipse, Zeref's time travel gate. However, Acnologia escapes while his disembodied spirit traps all of the present Dragon Slayers within the rift to maintain his godlike power. Lucy and many other wizards across the continent immobilize Acnologia's body within Fairy Sphere, while Natsu accumulates the other Dragon Slayers' magic and destroys Acnologia's spirit, killing him and freeing the Dragon Slayers from captivity. The following year, Natsu and his team depart on a century-old guild mission, continuing their adventures together.
","Get ready to have some fun with some of our favorite friends from one of the most prominent guilds in all of Earth Land. From the same series that has been running for over two years, Fairy Tail's author Hiro Mashima here brings fourth not 1, not two, not even 3, not 4, but 5 OVAs. 
 
Fairy Tail: Youkoso Fairy Hills! is a series of special episodes 26th, 27th and 31st volumes of the manga. If you're a faithful fan of FT, then you're in the right place. The four episodes incorporated does not much have story by themselves but they do have one thing: entertainment. Hell, most people who've seen the original series would know that Fairy Tail is one of few series in the anime industry that has watchable fillers. And of course, these OVA episodes are watchable as well.  
 
That's right, Fairy Tail isn't always about battles but sometimes is about fun, fun..and fun.  
 
These five OVAs are standalone episodes that are nonlinear. In other words, there is no direct story or expansion from one episode to the next from this bundle. Don't face palm yourself yet though because they all are all amusing to watch in a variety of reasons. In fact, comedy is one of Fairy Tail's greatest aspects and it shines through in these episodes. (only in terms of comedy though...not else worth more adding) 
 
The OVA themselves contains characters from the original series consisting of Team Natsu -  
 
The outgoing Lucy 
The over hyperactive Natsu 
The naked Gray 
The tough and boss Erza ""Titania"" Scarlet 
 
All of them get their moments in these episodes ranging from being a bunny girl, wearing a cat/neko costume, the school uniforms, being a kid all over again, and beach fan-service. Speaking of which, the fan-service does shoot off the charts occasionally in these episodes. Unlike ecchi series though, they are for comedic purposes. Like I said before, Fairy Tail brings out laughter, fun, and entertainment rather than the typical ""accidental shower walk-ins"".  
 
The Fairy Tail atmosphere is still there though with some action scenes and the OST. Hiro Mashima likes to play with some of his typical battle shounen scenes often from the original series. In these short episodes, he brings out his skills of creating humor and that he did quite so-so from my perspective. It's a welcoming aspect from the original series that has high levels of energy to induce entertainment rather than the more serious fighting scenes anime fans watches in so many long running shounen today. It's not something serious to take into light. 
 
The artwork of the series remains generally the same. Beyond the fan-service, the characters are drawn like from the original series with similar edges, proportions (including those boobs), and backgrounds. It's sort of like the typical shounen artwork you see in many of today's anime series. Fairy Tail doesn't have the best art but it gets the point across. 
 
The soundtrack of the OVAs remains generally the same although two different OP and ED songs are used. Aya Hirano and Tetsuya Kakihara does their roles and gives their songs a magical rhythm . It's not too exciting but it gets to the point that reflects on the FT atmosphere. 
 
All in all, these Fairy Tail OVAs are a fun watch. Don't take it serious. Just don't. If you do, you won't enjoy this as much as some other fans. The original main characters return in this so it makes it worthwhile to watch them all have their fun, awkward, and entertaining moments.  
 
If you're having a bad day, watch this to brighten it up. 
If you're bored with your life, watch this to make your life more fun. 
If you're tired of waiting for the latest FT episode from the original series, watch this to pass some time. 
If you're frustrated about today's other onsen/""beach"" OVAs in other anime series, watch this to laugh at them 
If you want to just enjoy some typical Fairy Tail entertainment, watch this to appreciate. 
 
Ultimately though, these OVA episodes connected together are just of something amusing to watch but don't expect much out of it, even if the above are how you felt before watching. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Well,(this is about OVA number1)  an OVA filled with fan service, and Fairy Tail comedy 
a story/quest slapped around it, 
but to be honest not very exciting just fun to watch. 
 
I noticed the OP theme song was sung by Natsu's voice actor (not sure) 
and the ED theme song by Lucy's voice actress (also not sure) 
 
but am I the only one missing something, 
I personally think an OVA is the perfect chance to take a series 
to another setting or 
use  experimental visuals or 
explore an unknown character 
 
but at least it was better than High school of the Dead OVA 
 
Update: Just saw the second OVA and in my humble opinion it is even worse then the first one; 
This second OVA deals with fairy tail in a new (ahum ahum) setting a.k.a High School. 
Now this did not work for me, if I want to C slice of life or Seitokai situations I will watch other series I love Fairy Tail the series because it is a action packed/funny series witch moves slowly and has a bit of depth,+ great voice acting 
I found none of these qualities in the Ova's, 
this second one has no story/no witty dialogue a few seconds of Erza fan service and a lot of BS, 
it was the first time for me to get annoyed while watching Fairy Tail... 
 
OP/ED is again song by the voice actors of Natsu (OP) and Lucy (ED) 
So initially I gave these a 7 but now,well 
 
the series itself on the other hand is still going strong 
Seeing Happy pissed was fantastic:) 
 
  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Some of the funniest lols you'll see in a long time. Kind of like taking all the small gags over 40 episodes, and lumping them together into two OVA's. WIN! 
 
I love the in-OVA jokes (Aries, and Happy + Charles in second OVA) and that FT isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. A certain moment in OVA 2 involving three guys + Erza did a lot to lighten my feelings towards recent storylines in the FT anime. 
 
The first OVA is a bit up and down in the funny stakes in comparison to the second, but still had me crying with laughter. Both OVA's are a bit coarser than usual (nudity, nosebleeds) but always relevant. Suprisingly moving towards the end, which shouldn't really be suprising considering that FT has done that before. 
 
The second OVA is my favourite for the sheer amount of FT gags in an alternate universe. No real magic in this world? No problem! Special props to whoever came up Gray and Natsu's ""magic power"" substitutes.

As a slightly older anime fan at 26, I have seen a LOT of shitty anime. Some think that anime has only recently started going down hill and there wasn't shit like Boku no Piko and Seikon no Qwasar in the glory days of the 1990s. Those people are wrong...because this unholy abomination exists. 
 
Story: 1/10 
 
A little girl learns how to do an erotic twerk dance and becomes a fertility goddess with huge tits. However, you are supposed to wack off to a little girl in an adult's body. Its Lolicon and giant tit fetish hentai like Eiken at the same time! Honestly there is no plot in this piece of shit. If you want a summary of the plot...tits. That's the plot! 
 
Character: 1/10 
 
There are no likeable characters or clever character development to be seen here. Only poorly drawn giant titties. Much like Dennis's drawings from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 
 
Art: 1/10 
 
The very least an H series can do is have decent art right? I gave mentally handicapped and morally repugnant Seikon No Qwasar a decent rating in the art department, so I don't just rate 1/1/1/1/1 because I hate the series. The art truly is deserving of a 1. 
 
Sound: 1/10 
 
An obnoxous ""tropical"" chant happens when she does her racist jungle twerk. I guess that counts as a soundtrack 
 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
 
I would rather beat my tongue wafer thin with a meat tenderizer and staple it to the ground with a croquet hoop, than watch another episdoe of Jungle De Ikou. 
 
Overall: 1/10 
 
This series pulled it off. The imperfect 1/1/1/1/1. It absolutely sucks in every category. Even Mars of Destruction would get a 2 in soundtrack for hilariously using shit quality midi recordings of classical music pieces. This is the 2008 Detroit Lions of anime! Watch it if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you! 

          
 
       Helpful Jungle de Ikou... I legit think this is the first anime I watch with such contrasting elements, even knowing beforehand that it's a full fanservice anime... anyway, let's go. 
 
I don't know if this review can be considered a spoiler warning or not, as I'm going to be very direct with some points. Read with discretion (or just jump to the last paragraph, where I do my veredict). 
 
Jungle de Ikou is a very poor anime, even for its main objective: fanservice. 
The Story is interesting enough, or at least the synopsis got me in that way. But it's literally wasted in every way possible, not even just in favor of the fanservice. I even feel the whole title, synopsis, and even the anime opening is a sort of bait, but a really bad bait. Or maybe it's just me, but I'm going to be really honest here: what would you expect from an anime that introduces itself with a sort of ""tropical"" ambient and characters, or that its own title literally translates ""Let's go to the Jungle!""? At least I expected something related to a jungle, indeed. But sadly, it's completely the opposite: it gets ambiented in a damn city. Knowing this, is there even something bad else worth to say? Yes, the story can't solve itself. There's no need to elaborate in each episode after knowing this. In short words, they just wasted a interesting plot. 
About the Art & Sound, I have no big issues with. Pretty decent for the age, catching OST (including the opening and ending) and overall decent. Indeed, the art was an appealing factor for me to watch it, I really like this kind of old anime artstyle, like tall/big eyes or stuff (like Slayers or GS Mikami, for example). 
Now, speaking about the Characters... damn... as I said before, how contrasting elements had this series. The ""main cast"" is decently designed for me, every character had a proper role, the problem about them is the lack of development (which of course goes hand in hand with the lack of story development), or even just the focus of them. Like yes, you expect fanservice, therefore a busty girl bouncing her chest, but not even that is really well done. 
Enjoyment... nope. I sure laughed in some scenes or something, but not anything else. Nothing much to elaborate in this point, honestly. 
 
Then... it's overall a 3 for me, sadly. And I say sadly because I had decent expectations about this anime (yes, decent, not even good expectations). But it couldn't even reach the decent spot. To be fair, it was probably a mistake from my part, to have some kind of expectation about it, but I really tried to watch and analyze this without any (or the less possible) previous knowledge/critique. 
I can't recommend it at all, unless you fully psyched up that it's a bad thing, before watching it. Because it's actually bad. The worst thing of all is this was officially licensed in the US, hilarious in the weirdest way possible.

          
 
       Helpful This OVA gets a bad rap because it's a loli fanservice comedy and people apparently go into it expecting a deep plot or something. Yes the plot is dumb, but you don't watch a comedy for the plot. And yes, it is primarily loli fanservice despite those giant balloon tits you've seen all over the promo material. If you haven't been disgusted by anything I've written so far, you'll probably like it. 
 
The only real negative I have to mention is that the third episode decides to put the fanservice and comedy to the side in favor of focusing on the plot, which I've already established is a bad idea for a fanservice comedy. The ending is pretty weak but I really get a kick out of the first two episodes. It's a short, fun OVA and something I'll re-watch once in a while to have a few laughs and a boner.

sugar sugar rune was not any of those. it was absolutely AMAZING i remember watching this when i was young but didn't finish it since no one was subbing it at the time. but i remember about it to this day as an adult. character development was really beautiful i still hate the character waffle to this day, she was so annoying and every time she appeared i was like ""just go away"" but she developed more as the series went on and she became tolerable, still dislike her. other than that its really what a shojou anime should be, the journey of finding yourself (not finding yourself, more like becoming a better you) and lessons about friendship. 

          
 
       Helpful Part 1 Chunk: (Please forgive me for basically writing an essay.  I need to find another hobby.) 
 
What show could fit your mood if you're looking for something simple yet fun? This show.  It is nothing more than a children's show, but it is far from being boring.  Sure, it can get rather repetitive, but the repetitive parts I found hard to outright hate, actually.  I do dislike a certain character who is purely there to create filler, but even she ends up better in the end.  If anything, this show stole my heart AND if you think stealing hearts is a bad thing, this show will do it anyway with magic potions, love charms, hugs, smiles, and kisses.   
 
Two Witches named Chocolat Meilleure and Vanilla Mieux are Queen Candidates who collect valuable different colored hearts can only receive them by wooing Human boys.  (""Gotta catch 'em all! That is their master plan."")   
 
Yes, Humans and Witches are two different species pretending to date, but Witches are not allowed to fall in love with Humans no matter what (i.e., their hearts are not allowed to turn Red).  Does it get really hard not to wish they could reciprocate a Humans' feelings fully at times? Sure, but if anything that just makes Witches desire to understand and observe the ways in which love works like scientists more.  However, they aim to gather experience in the Human world so that they can learn the best from both worlds and apply that to their futures in Magical World politics or in whatever else they choose to do.  It's supposed to be a Win=Win situation, despite Witches not being able to fall in love with Humans, in general.  
 
The show, however, throws its biggest hurdle at the Queen Candidates with the introduction of a group called the Ogres.  Since Chocolat and Vanilla are fairly young and naive, they learn the hard way about how they already have enemies out to get them because of their royal status.  If the Witches are dedicated to pure love, the Ogres are dedicated to all that is evil and/or taboo, such as forbidden love, etc.; in other words, they are natural born enemies.   
 
One particular character, who attends school with the Queen Candidates, is very interesting because he is supposed to be an Ogre, yet he is very innocent in appearance (I will not say who, but it should become fairly obvious early on).  He believes that if Witches and Ogres aren't supposed to love Humans, they are meant to be taken over.  So, if the girls represent the essence of pink, BOY, does he embrace the essence of the color black.  His presence is said to be full of ""Noir."" 
 
So, while this show is very simple, the way everything is set up the characters are going to have to grow A LOT (especially Vanilla who is a shy, frail, polite, bundle of nerves; as opposed to Chocolat who is brave, stubborn, and outgoing but has poor manners).   
 
In fact, the ending is a fantastic example of how having the will power to do what is right can transcend most if not all of the conflict, confusion, and uncertainty thrown their way.  As predictable as the outcome may be, it is never boring to watch it when it feels like a theater play whose leads try to perform with their heads held high and their hearts gleaming (very pretty, shiny hearts). 
 
Part 2 Chunk: 
 
Sugar Sugar Rune has a very European flavor with lots of eccentricity added to it and some goth touches, so no setting could possibly fit it better like a glove! The Magical World, however, looks like Halloween Town and Candy Land put together!  
 
It's important to mention the food, too, after mentioning Candy Land, right? Well, it's completely Western/European, very appetizing, and, also, consists of tons of desserts and candy!  
 
A fun quirk is that many things are given a French name.  Although, the French is really simple and is nothing like the lengthier phrases used in, say Maria-sama ga Miteru, for example.  Some of the spells Chocolat uses, for instance, are ""La Fleur Spirale,"" ""La Étoile Brilliant,"" ""Agrandizement,"" etc.   
 
This show, also, loves bubble baths, fragrances, pearls, jewels, charms, stars, the Moon, or any kind of mysticism that Witches might love.  Creativity is certainly not something this show lacks, nor foreign, exotic, or paradise scenery! 
 
Aside from everything else, I could draw a good amount of similarities between Sugar Sugar Rune and Harry Potter, such as a flying car, flying broomsticks, Mandrake, dragons, big spiders, unicorns, an invisibility cloaking object, etc.   
 
The art in the show is quite good.  Although, I think it could've been done better, especially if you compare some of it to Moyoco Anno's gorgeous art in the manga.  The animation varies from average to very neat and exciting, such as the Witches falling from the sky in the 1st episode, and the ending of the 4th episode is wow! Pretty is all I can say.  The animation in the 37th episode, and plenty of other episodes is surprisingly top notch, also.   
 
The music in the show is quite memorable, in fact, some of the songs are playing in my head right now.  The best song is, of course, the opening! It is a song that pays homage to ""Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son"" by France Gall and is probably one of the most fun songs I've heard as an anime OP as of yet (except for Azumanga Daioh's OP, maybe?).  I think I've watched the opening 100 times already, but the two ending songs are really pleasant, too! 
 
Who has the best seiyuu? Honestly, I cannot choose, since all of them did a fantastic job and sound very cute saying little phrases in French. 
   
Robin - His seiyuu has an incredibly silky smooth voice, and he sings great! (Listen to Robin's seiyuu sing ""SUPERSTAR"" and ""DON'T CRY."")   
Chocolat - Her seiyuu gets some of the best lines.  Even though everybody in this show seems to have a catchphrase, hers are the best.   
Vanilla - Her seiyuu is fitting and sounds like she's going to cry all the time; although, it could get on some peoples' nerves a little bit.   
Duke and Blanca - They're opposites, and they fight and argue a lot so that's done very well.   
Saule and Houx - They sound like teenagers for sure, but they are very unusual for twins in quite a few ways.   
Pierre - His seiyuu has a handsome voice; however, he sure likes to inflect some harshness and increase volume later on.   
Rest of cast - no complaints there, except for Waffle, who is just annoying.   
 
If you'd like an easy to get into show with an interesting characters and magical world set up, Sugar Sugar Rune is definitely worth checking out.  I don't think it'll ever become more popular than Shugo Chara! But it definitely gives it a run for its money.  It's one of the cooler magical girl shows that's for sure! 

          
 
       Helpful It was really cute to watch...actually ultra cute! heh heh heh! It's about these witches on ajourney to become queen, by winning hearts!

She learns he's a very bitter man who only accepted by force to take her in. But Heidi's kindness may be able to open his heart. Together with the shepherd Peter and invalid Clara, she has lots of adventures. 
 
(Source: adapted from ANN) ","['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama']","Heidi is five years old when her aunt Dete, who has raised Heidi since her parents' deaths four years earlier, takes Heidi to live with her formidable grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Dete has found a promising job in Frankfurt, but cannot leave while still Heidi's guardian, nor can she take Heidi with her. The only relative left is Heidi's grandfather, and in Dete's opinion, he should take some responsibility. Alm-Onji, as Heidi's grandfather is commonly known, has a fearsome reputation with the villagers of Dörfli, as rumors claim that in his youth he killed a man. Now he lives a solitary life with his dog Josef in a cabin halfway up the mountain. However, Heidi quickly wins her way into his heart with her enthusiasm and intelligence, firmly establishing herself in his life. She spends her days on the mountain top with the goatherd Peter, whose responsibility it is to take the villagers' goats to the high mountains for pasture, and her winters occasionally visiting Peter's grandmother, a blind old woman whose dream is to one day hear her cherished book of psalms read to her (which Peter cannot do since he failed to learn to read). Alm-Onji's misanthropy and seclusion prevents Heidi from going to school, of which she has no experience anyway, ultimately leaving her illiterate.
Heidi continues to live happily in the mountains until Aunt Dete returns from the city, excited about a good opportunity for Heidi. A wealthy German businessman, Mr. Sesemann, is searching for a companion for his wheelchair-using daughter Clara. Thwarted by Alm-Onji, Dete tricks Heidi into accompanying her, ostensibly to get a present for Peter and her grandfather. Promised that she can return at any time, Heidi is taken to Frankfurt. There, Dete abandons her to the ""care"" of Miss Rottenmeier, the strict, no-nonsense governess in charge of Clara's welfare. Heidi and Clara quickly become friends, and Heidi quickly turns the household topsy-turvy with her escapades and well-meaning faux pas. Clara is enchanted by Heidi's stories of the Alps, which paint a picture of a life completely different from the sheltered and lonely one she is accustomed to. Her father is mostly away on business, and Clara's only constant companions until now are the servants and her pet canary.
Heidi's longing to return home and occasional attempts to escape are punctuated by the occasional distractions of new friends. She smuggles a small kitten into the house, and she and Clara care for it until Miss Rottenmeier discovers it and has it thrown out, until Sebastian, the kindly butler, is able to leave the kitten with a friend. Clara's doctor befriends her, and occasionally keeps a benevolent eye on her, but it is Clara's grandmother that has the most impact. On one of her rare visits to Frankfurt, she and Heidi become fast friends. Under her kindly tutelage, Heidi finally learns how to read, to the astonishment of the tutor who has struggled for months to do the same. However, the old woman's departure home again proves a turning point for Heidi. Forbidden by Miss Rottenmeier to ever mention or even think of the Alps again, Heidi rapidly goes into a decline, eventually becoming a sleep-walker, whose passage through the hallways is mistaken for that of a ghost, terrorizing the household.
Summoned home to deal with the haunting, Mr. Sesemann, with the aid of the doctor, catch Heidi in the middle of the night. The doctor diagnoses Heidi's condition and persuades Mr. Sesemann to send the girl back to her Alps before she dies of homesickness. Clara is only reconciled by the promise that she will be allowed to visit Heidi in her mountains. Under the care of Sebastian, Heidi embarks on the long trip home, finally returning to her grandfather, Peter and his family.
Heidi's return and her newfound enjoyment of reading prompt Alm-Onji to partially restore a ruined house down in the village, where they retire the following winter so that Heidi can start going to school. Over the course of the season, Heidi and Alm-Onji become friendly with the villagers, and Peter builds his own sled and wins a local race. The subsequent spring, they return to the mountain in the Alps, bidding farewell to their new friends. In Frankfurt, Clara, who has been longing to see her friend again, reminds her father of his promise to her, but he reminds her that the conditions in the Swiss Alps may be too harsh for her to handle. The doctor is sent to the Alps in her place, to inspect the area and determine whether it is an appropriate environment for a disabled, sick young girl. Heidi, Peter, Alm-Onji, and the limitations of the terrain convince the doctor that this may be just the place for Clara to try her legs again.
In due course, Clara comes to the Alps with Miss Rottenmeier, who shows a clear disapproval of the rustic conditions, an open fear of animals, and distress at the potential for accidents on the mountain. However, Clara's grandmother soon arrives, and after seeing first-hand the vast improvement in Clara's condition, sends Miss Rottenmeier home, commending Clara to the Alm-Onji's care before departing herself. After having established that Clara's legs are capable of functioning, the children and Alm-Onji begin to work on Clara's physical therapy. Eventually, Clara is able to walk without assistance and returns home with her father and grandmother, promising that she will return the following spring to be with her friends again.
","Heidi came out in 1974 created by an all-star staff: Directed by Takahata Isao (Tales of Princess Kaguya), Layout by Miyazaki (Spirited Away), Storyboard by Tomino (MSG), Music Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, and Background Art Mukuo Takamura (Gauch the Cellist). Basically, this was high on my list, if only to give a glimpse at. 
 
Based on the 1880 book ""Heidi,"" the story is ""for children and those who love children."" It focuses on a little girl named Heidi growing up with her Grossvater Ohi in the Alm Mountains for three years before her selfish Tante Dete takes her to live with a rich family in Frankfurt, Germany. The characters are fairly one-dimensional as well as the story itself, which is alright for what the anime is. Watching the first episode in Japanese with English subtitles, I felt I wasn't getting the essence of the show. From there I found a German dubbed version, and the show got so much better.  
The art is your typical ""Studio Ghibli"" style, not coming to much surprise. Meanwhile, the Japanese music is great coming from Watanabe, but the German version took it out of the park. For a story taking place around 1880 with old German style folk music, perfect. 
 
Heidi begins in the mountains at 5 as a free-spirit learning the mountain life, and then is forced to move to the big city at 8 into a ""cage-like"" environment to live/befriend the daughter (Klara) of a rich family learning ""civil"" life. As one could imagine, once getting used to a country lifestyle and then moving to the ""civilized"" life of the big city isn't for everyone. That is pretty much the story with some life lessons along the way. 
 
At 52 episodes and what seems to have a lot of filler in between the show's main plot points, you could probably watch only about 12 episodes to fully understand the story while skipping the other content. I recommend to watch episodes 1-5, 16,18,20,26, and 52 in German preferably. This is a nice children's story and does a fine job being just that.

          
 
       Helpful Heidi is the first anime and cartoon I've ever watched.  
 
The 5-year old me loved everything about it. I loved the relationship between Heidi and her Grandpa. I loved Heidi and her friends the most. Thinking back, I feel like I used to ship Peter with Heidi lol. It can be sad at times but the overall atmosphere is actually cheery. The Swiss Alps really did serve the beautiful background which leads your younger self dream to places beyond. Unlike a lot of anime or even cartoons I've watched as a child, I'd say neither did me or my parents ever found anything inappropriate and I think you could still recommend to kids even now. Those character designs are still so great that I can recall even now and hence why I am here.

          
 
       Helpful Alps no Shoujo Heidi is more then a story. It's a journey. You will both laugh and cry while watching this series. You will cry both tears of sadness and tears of joy. You will fall in love with Heidi (but in a weird way - she is a little girl), and you will fall in love with the Swiss Alps. This anime may be old, and it may be targeted towards children. However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a perfect series, and one of the most beautiful series ever told. Also, I ship Heidi and Peter. They'd make a cute couple. Although, I don't think either of them are old enough to think of boys/girls romantically yet. Then again, if my math checks out, at the end of the series Heidi is at least ten and Peter at least sixteen. (They were five and eleven at the beginning.) 
 
One more thing. Heidi is the original moe character. Some otaku might say that moe began in the late nineties or early two thousands. To which I say, ""No, moe began in the seventies maybe earlier.""

There weren't really any dry episodes or filler that was noticeable either. The last three episodes were more or less dedicated to the ending, and although there were events leading up to this it almost felt like an abrupt twist to finish things up, but in the end I was pleased with the way things were handled so I can't complain. If you dig comedic anime and the old school RPG setting then I'd highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful I watched the whole series. It falls mostly in the realm of a magical fantasy that takes place in a stone age civilization. There are several female main characters, but it is definitely not a harem-style anime. It took me several episodes to really begin liking it, but by the 4th or 5th episode I was hooked. Overall it is pretty good. I wanted there to be more romance in it among the characters, but there wasn't too much of that.

          
 
       Helpful Maybe back in the day it was something to go gya gya over (according to the person who rated it a 10) but to me it was cliche after cliche. Some of the scenes are cute, but there's nothing new or surprising in the story. The episodes are very skippable, I'd compare it to saiyuki where there is really nothing to tie all the series together except for the same characters that keep appearing in them with a couple attempts at humour. So, you can skip a bunch of the episodes as I did and still not miss a thing. I guess, most of the part that you could call a &quot;plot&quot; appeared in the last couple episodes of the series and even that was soooooooo predictable that you can just skip through it. So, I recommend that you watch this if you are really bored, or in the mood for watching something really predictable and bla.  
Also, as another personal rant comment, the guy is supposed to be a crappy magician so why is he practicing with swords??!!! shouldn't he be training to become a better magician???

","Looks like I have to change my opinion about this anime. 
 
First, let me say this.  I did not like the first episode.  At all.  It explains nothing.  It gives no introduction to the characters.  Battle scenes are unentertaining.  Everything is aimed at girly moe fans, with no other merit except for CG art and graphics. 
 
That said, the 2nd episode takes a complete turnaround in terms of explaining more of the story, direction, and the background behind the main characters, and includes some plot twists to the previous setting.  Its almost as if a different director took over the project and rescued what was already started..although I'm sure that isn't so, since I can only find one director...but I digress. 
 
Anyway, the story and characters are a little more satisfying.  They still doesn't explain a whole lot, and there's too many questions raised as to why this is all happening, or what's motivating some of the characters,, but its not as distracting as in the previous episode.  Artwork in the 2nd episode is even more impressive than the first.  I felt like I was drawn into another world.  Sound isn't as annoying as before, and fits the mood rather well, in that everything isn't as it seems.  And with the twists in story and the more entertaining fight scenes, its more user friendly to a broader audience. 
 
I definitely enjoyed the 2nd episode a lot more.  I would recommend skipping the 1st episode entirely, and maybe reading a summary for it instead, but that's asking a bit too much, right?  If you end up watching it anyway and hating it like I did, don't say that I didn't warn you. 
 
1st Episode: 2/10 
2nd Episode: 7/10

Never in my whole life have I been so blown away by a small yet utterly sublime and awesome little series. It's only a short little OVA consisting of 3 episodes, but it's so unknown and under appreciated! People may just blow it off as a yuri-moe show about girls kissing in space and stuff, but DO NOT be fooled by what you see! What you see in this show is a great storyline, a charming cast of characters, epic plot twists that appear in the 2nd episode, and not to mention animation that's COMPLETELY computer generated! 
 
People may think it's all about moe and yuri, but what this show is REALLY about is that in the year of 019 of the new age, the sun began to radiate more heat which made people's chances of getting skin cancer a lot higher. Not only that, a new ""species"" of humans called ""Adapters"" began to appear. These Adapters (all girls for some reason) have strange abilities that make them COMPLETELY impervious to human touch or contact. Unfortunately, since there are so few, they're often the subject of prejudice and are discriminated against for their mysterious abilities. Three adapters from three different countries meet in space when a space colony called Pink Coral is blown up by intergalactic space pirates. The three girls, Amuri Kakyoin (from Japan), Yunque ""Suzu"" Ling (from China), and Perrier La Mer (from France) meet in space and end up in a strange place called Galapagos which is where their struggles with both their external problems (albeit returning home and finding air) and their internal problems, including psychological problems from their traumatic pasts. 
 
I've seen all three episodes. While the first episode may be a little shallow, it's definitely worth watching and continuing onto the second episode and maybe the third! The show depicts the girls facing struggles that seem uncontrollable by themselves alone, but then they learn the secrets to their strange Adapter abilities and actually put them to use! Unfortunately, it's definitely not a kids show. There is SLIGHT nudity, though not very explicit and there's definitely blood and violence, especially in the 2nd and 3rd episodes. Each episode develops one character and dives into their past, with the first episode focusing on Amuri, and so on. 
 
But this show REALLY states how awesome it really is in the final episode! The events, the plot twists, everything! But the most common feature that all the episodes share, and the events that happen in them, is the song that the girls sing whenever they're stuck in a bad situation. The song (along with the three adapters developing a close bond with one another) has been their only support system, not just in the events currently, but in their traumatic pasts as well. It's their coping mechanism that's used when they're in pain. Each heroine experienced some type of psychological problem, but that's what makes them so unique. But there are some flaws. Some of the side characters aren't developed enough (ESPECIALLY the awesome girl from the final episode!), I think the outfits some characters wear are rather revealing (example being Suzu's stora, VERY revealing), some things weren't exactly explained clearly (example being why Suzu's arms are encased in REALLY big sleeves and have no use other than to fly), and IT'S JUST TOO DARN SHORT!! I would love to see the characters fleshed out even more. 
 
All in all, I seriously think this anime needs more attention. It's basically a big achievement for the anime world, using computer generated animation in such a beautiful and epic manner that really stands out. The characters are so fantastic, the music is beautiful, the fights are epic, and the show is just a delicious sandwich filled with awesomeness and epicness inside just waiting to be consumed and eaten! Not only that, I think I can understand the message that it's trying to give out to the viewers: Those who are different from normal kids, don't give up. There are others like you out in the world, so try and find them. You may even develop a close bond with one another.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']",none,"I was VERY excited to see this anime because of my experience with the OVA. 
 
The OVA, ""Master Mosquiton,"" is one of my favorites. It combines great animation, wonderful music, interesting characters, adult humor, nudity, and an ability to draw you in. It was a light-hearted tale of a vampire (Mosquiton) and his mistress (Inaho). 
 
The series takes all of that, dilutes it and stretches it so thin that you end up feeling like NOTHING happened after 26 episodes! I realize that the sex and adult content was removed so it would be seen by all ages on TV, but it was a mistake to do so: Mosquiton was originally an adult dark comedy, and it worked.  
 
[ STORY ] 
 
The story starts very interesting and intriguing but it falls flat after repetitive episodes. The backstory later within the last 5 episodes almost saves the day but ultimately fails to make up for the series earlier shortcomings. 
 
Also, this story is a ""re-imagining"" from the OVA, which is fine, but it wasn't as strong a choice. ( OVA: 1920s, Mosquiton '99:1999) 6/10 
 
[ ART ] 
 
The animation goes from TERRIBLE to fair and back again within the same scene. So disappointing since ""Master Mosquiton"" had excellent visuals. 4/10 
 
[ SOUND ] 
 
The music is pretty good. The 1920's big band music that trickled over from the OVA is tops and I very much enjoyed the opening theme and background music. Solid. 7/10 
 
[ CHARACTER ] 
 
Inaho is 100% annoying and vile, which is hard when she's the main character. Don't get me wrong, it's okay that she has many less-than-stellar traits, but she should have at least ONE redeeming quality. Mosquiton is also MUCH more of a wimp and lapdog this time around. He's still an adorable Bishounen (^_^). Yuki and Hoono, the two demons, are one-dimensional but are given more depth when you see their back story in their final episodes. There are also two main characters that are unique to the TV series and not the OVA: Wolf Lady and Frankie. The wolf lady proves to have a great backstory, (She cannot TOUCH a member of the opposite sex without lashing out violently/becoming more ""wolf-like"") which includes a great deal of heart breaking backstory. Frankie is boring and has no reason to be in this series. 
 
Camille, Mosquiton's first wife, who had a HUGE role in the OVA has no pull in the TV series. In the TV series they never establish her as Mosquiton's ex-wife she's just a henchman. Totally stupid for them to pass up her interesting story. 
 
The characters would be rated much higher, but the only good moments in their arc are their backstories, which only appear very late in the series. 5/10 
 
[ ENJOYMENT ] 
 
The first 20 episodes (give or take the few that stand out) are boring a strung out. When you get to the last 5 or so, your enjoyment goes up immensely. 6/10 
 
[ OVERALL ] 
 
Final verdict? WATCH THE OVA. It is truly fun, unique and interesting. If you have seen the OVA, and you want more Mosquiton goodness, you may want to watch this anime. It will at least give you some Mosquiton to savor. If you are NEW to this franchise, I would say pass the TV series up. You won't have the love of the characters already like I did- that's the only way I got through it. 6/10 
 
Thanks for reading. Hope this gives a good insight as to whether or not to see this show.

       Helpful This is a anime from about 10 years ago, so give it a bit of leverage here. 
 
Story: 
 
The story is a re-imagining of the OVA, it places the characters in different places, in different times with slightly different personality changes.   It starts with the greedy Inaho and she finds Mosquiton and forces him to make a contract with her.    Every episode starts with her looking or searching for a piece of O-part that fits the key she has which is slightly annoying because that was every episode. 
 
EVERY EPISODE, it was fair but it seemed like you could watch a few episodes for the light-hearted banter between the Mosquiton & Inaho.    It seems the darkness/adult-comedy/romance isn't there anymore, this more of a light-hearted/romance/comedy.  Which, even though it IS the same set of characters, the storyline worked a lot better in being a dark comedy rather than a light one. 
 
Some of the character's backstory is different, like Camille.  She's not with Mosquiton and Germaine or whatever is his name is isn't just some guy who seemed like the bad guy at the end.     I preferred it this way, honestly.  Camille in the OVA added something, but her presence here seemed better to me, I don't know. 
 
The ending episodes are the best, I wish they would have spread them out.  The Christmas one was especially my favourite because it reminded me so much of how Inaho acted in the OVA and their relationship. 
 
All in all, the story was fair, kind of fun and made you shake your head at Inaho, so I gave it a 6. 
 
Art: 
 
The art was alright for it's day, I believe that because this has been fan-subbed that the quality has been lost on VCRs.  A lot of people complain about older anime because of this, but I don't fault the art or animation.    I am sad that I couldn't give it a better rating, because the fun use of colour would have been much better and the animation much smoother and less pixelated had there been original dvd releases.  So -- 5. 
 
Sound: 
 
Great! They use some of the old OVA music in mixture with some new tunes and some music that makes you feel like ""Oh, this is getting good!""  I loved the music, I have nothing to complain about!  -9 
 
Character: 
 
I believe that in a light-hearted scenario that this is how the characters would act because there was honestly no darkness in this anime.  Mosquiton was very light hearted and I see how he became very domesticated during the series.    They were all the same basically but with two new characters: Wolf Lady and Frankie. 
 
I liked the character's development here, it's very touching in the ending episodes.  Frankie is often funny and I like his persistence.  I think they add something to the series. 
 
THE ONLY CHARACTER I DO NOT LIKE is Akito?  Inaho's cousin?  She is annoying, she acts just like Inaho and she reminds me of Sailor Moon?  I don't know, it's just with Inaho being a frustrating ass, Akito comes in and does the same thing.  When they are in an episode together, I just skipped one completely because it was just stupid.    Even in the end, she was practically useless.    There did not need to be a character to try to hog Inaho's spotlight by acting just like her, they show no family ties which makes her appearance more annoying. 
 
Enjoyment:  If you like Mosquiton, you'll like this kinda.  In my brain, I think of this as a super sequel in my brain where it's a certain way so I don't think of Inaho as the same exact one in 99', because they are different in many ways. 
 
Overall:  It's a little better than decent, I found myself almost tearing near the end because I love Inaho/Mosquiton :]   I think you would too if you saw the OVA

          
 
       Helpful Master Mosquiton has an interesting beginning, so to speak. It shatters some of the often used vampire weaknesses right from the first episode, albeit not all of them, and it certainly shows straight away the kind of characters you’ll be dealing with. Inaho is in no way a noble heroine led by desires to protect her schoolmates, rather than that she is shown as perfect student with selfish motivations. Now, although Inaho’s character could be an annoyance, the remaining cast does have likable qualities. Basically it’s a decent anime, nothing too special, but you could watch a random episode every now and then just to pass time.

The queen bee is forced to flee, but an egg is saved from the terrible slaughter, ending up hidden under a leaf. This egg is then found by a female bumblebee, the queen's handmaid, and taken by her as if it were one of her own.

He also discovers that Aya is actually his sister, who managed to survive to the wasps' attack at the beginning of the story. Hutch and his family rebuild the bee kingdom, vowing to make it peaceful and kind.
","Strangely enough, this series has a long history with a sequel, remade movie in 2010, and a spinoff. The studio that made this was Tatsunoko Production, a long standing studio that is still in the industry today. Ippei Kuri, the man whom co-founded the studio, was the lead episode director and series production director worked along with another now-veteran anime industry man by the name of Yoshiuki Tomino or better known as the man behind all things Gundam. Unfortunately, at the time of this review only four known episodes of the show were able to be found. However, they really show off why the show was quite good for 1970. 
 
For a show aimed at young children, this anime is actually quite violent, depressing, and has many sad undertones. Honeybee Hutch starts out with a scene depicting the entire bee hive being attacked by a swarm of swaps that proceed to murder everyone, stand over the corpses, and drink their honey. The bee queen somehow escapes leaving the bodies of her children behind. A sole female worker bee from another hive (whom also escaped a genocide of her own) happens upon a single egg left and raises this bee as her own among her 9 other children. However, Hutch is different because he is not part of the hive. The other kids bully him and isolate him constantly. Hutch inevitably is told by his pseudo-mother he is actually an orphan, so an upset Hutch sets out on an adventure to find his real bee mother. 
 
Each of the other episodes follows a formula in which Hutch will befriend another insect such as a child grasshopper and by the end of the episode another insect or creature higher of the food chain will murder/eat said insect Hutch has befriended. For example, the child grasshopper’s parents are eaten by a lizard in front of Hutch and the child with half the corpses hanging out of the lizard’s mouth. Despite the constant death and destruction surrounding Hutch, he remains a hopeful optimistic idiot which the viewer can’t help but feel for. 
 
Character art is quite reminiscent of a cross between an old Disney and warner bros cartoon, and yet Hutch’s face and expressions usually makes him seem “special” most of the time. Music plays a huge role in the show. It always matches the mood of the scene ever changing and adapting including most insects knowing how to play an instrument leading to episodes focused around that character. Watching the 2010 remake movie is evidence of these things. 
 
Much of the show can be compared to the movie “A Bug’s Life” how the insects interact with each other and world such as children insects using a shape of a leaf as a slide. No doubt that movie took a lot from this show. 
 
Overall, based on what was seen and little understood language wise, events and character expressions show the viewer more than enough to understand what is happening. That says a lot to the caliber of Honeybee Hutch. It is a real shame more episodes could not be found because it was actually pretty good despite coming out in 1970.

","Honestly the season 2 went slightly downhill. The main character goes through dramatic development that doesn't even go close to his character at one certain point that I won't spoil. The season 2 is great but the story is based all around 1 arc for a long time from what it seems whereas season 1 didn't have that and was more original in that regard. If anything you'll get enjoyment from it and it definitely beats SAO series. 
 
 
Other than that just be sure to watch closely from beginning to end as you will miss critical details on the long arc. The character development was okay but if it involved more of the original duo team this season would've been a lot better.

About 50% of the show time can be described as: ""and they decided to have a meal..."". Should one pay enough attention to the content, it will become clear that this can't be a mere coincidence. Maniacs kept the studio staff in a cellar with no food so they couldn't think of nothing else? Doubtful. More likely that, though unofficially, this was funded by people with not the least influence in japan food industry. 
 
You like watching ads? Cooked with a pathetic pretense of a ""plot""? Spiced with unsoundly repetitive and totally unoriginal ""humor""? Served to a hub-controlled zombie ""characters""? Then this one awaits you! :) 
 
There are still a few good episodes though, or moments in between, mostly in second part. Arguably worth the trouble. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I mostly enjoyed watching it, but it was such a disappointment compared to season 1. I don't know anything about what actually happened in production, but it feels like all of the writers quit before season 2 and were never properly replaced. There are a handful of particularly interesting and thought-provoking events and themes, but for the most part the plot is all over the place, often feeling contrived and nonsensical. Moreover, I was constantly feeling that plot events were undermining important overall themes set up in season 1. 
 
It seems like they were just constantly running out of ideas, so they had to constantly change the rules and throw crazy events at the characters. I very much wish that they had focused more on politics, interpersonal relationships, character growth, and realistic sorts of conflict rather than insane and unpredictable outside forces. A number of super interesting potential problems/conflicts were actually explicitly mentioned briefly, but then not properly explored. The biggest strength of season 1 in my opinion was how it set up a very interesting scenario and then let things play out in a fairly realistic/believable manner, without subjecting the viewer to too many deus ex machina surprises. In many episodes of season 1, I had fun imagining what I would do in the situation, thinking about all of the various factors involved. In season 2, it felt more like uncontrollable events kept being thrown at largely unchanging characters, which isn't nearly as fun. 
 
I loved the characters from season 1, and while I don't particularly dislike how a lot of time was spent on certain characters in season 2, I feel that a lot of time was wasted on unimportant and uninteresting things when we could've instead been exploring more of the characters, many of whom ended up largely forgotten. The characters at the end of season 1 remained largely unchanged by the end of season 2 -- there wasn't much character growth. 
 
I do think that from a narrower perspective, execution was OK. When characters did appear, season 2 remained pretty faithful to them; I didn't often feel that characters were being twisted. The settings and dialogue were usually OK. Individual episodes were usually interesting enough to keep my attention. 
 
Overall, I have to say that I think it was decent. It's probably comparable in quality to popular shounen anime. I'm mainly just struck by massive disappointment compared to season 1, which was monumentally better. I really wish that some new continuation could be made from season 1, but that's probably not going to happen.

The story follows Ayumu Aikawa, a high school boy who was turned into a zombie by Eucliwood Hellscythe, a Necromancer from the Underworld.

Strengths 
 
I thought the strongest aspect of this anime was the comedy writing. For an anime that felt like a fairly big filler, it was pretty well written in its comedy regard. While I was a bit impartial to the comedy of the 1st series, I found the 2nd season to be better written. I found myself laughing much harder at the ludicrously ridiculous situations Ayumu got himself in.  
 
Another strength of this animewas the character development. We learned a lot more about not only the leads, but many of the side characters, such as Kirara, Yuki, Orito, etc. On top of that, an array of new characters were introduced, including a hallucinated Fairy-like character, another soft-spoken harem addition named Taeko, and a former warrior for Eucliwood from the Underworld named Negrelia. Learning more about the side characters, as well as the addition of the new side characters seemed to lighten the overall mood for Zombie-desuka and made it much more humorous. 
 
As per usual in the Kore wa Zombie-desuka series, the music and voice acting is pretty solid. Especially in the Kirara concert scenes, there are many insert songs that are pretty solid to rock out to and the background music in almost all the scenes fits perfectly, ESPECIALLY in the final episode. The voice acting overall is still very solid and for the many Eucliwood Hellscythe fans from this series, they'll be glad to know they'll get to hear a lot more from their favorite...quiet Necromancer. 
 
Weaknesses 
 
The obvious weakness of this anime was story progression. It's difficult to progress an on-going story in a 10-episode run, and on top of that, the 2nd Season didn't even really try and progress the story very much. Essentially all we learned from the 2nd Season is there is a new enemy, a Masou Shoujo named Chris, who stands in Ayumu's way. However, her grand scheme was not  clearly revealed and I would more than likely guess it will primarily be revealed in the 3rd Season. 
 
Another weakness of this anime was pretty much the same argument I had with the 1st Season. It just goes way too far with the fan service. Fan service to me is sort of hit-or-miss in anime. There are times where it is used well and can make a funny situation even funnier...and there are times where it is just thrown in for the simple fact of appeasing a semi-perverted audience. In this...it's spotty. There are times where it works and times where it just falls flat and is completely unnecessary.  
 
Overall 
 
My overall impression of Kore wa Zombie-desuka? Of The Dead? It was okay, and not necessarily a step up or a step down from the original series. Fans of the series are going to get what they expect...more crazy, loony comedy from a mixed troupe of fantasy characters living a frantic, yet semi-normal high school lives. Like I said, I felt the comedy in this anime was much stronger, but the overall storytelling was much weaker. In my own personal opinion, I've become more of a fan of this series due to this season because I felt the storytelling was good in the first season and the comedy was lacking. This season, to me, more or less balanced things out. As far as a recommendation, Kore wa Zombie-desuka? Of The Dead is a good watch if you were a fan of the original series and even if you were like me and thought the 1st Season was sort of watered down and bland, this does seem to add a little bit more of a wrinkle that makes it funnier and more interesting. If you weren't a fan of the 1st Season, it's not very highly recommended. All this season really adds is a little more depth to the characters, more hilarious side stories, and a setup for a 3rd Season. 

          
 
       Helpful KoreZom is back, and it could actually get even better than its previous season. Obviously that I'm talking in plot terms, since its essence remained just the same: make you lose your breath from laughing! 
 
{STORY - 7/10} 
 
Ayumu returns as a zombie and masou-shoujo, but, if meeting a lot of weird people got him into tons of trouble, dealing with an unexpected event, that suddenly turns his school life upside down, will be a true challenge. 
 
An unknown drunken being joins our main character on this new journey to assist Ayumu onto understanding the reason of living and seeing the bright side upon being accused of sick crossdressing and becoming an world known fever. 
 
This newly developed plot surpasses the first one, as it gets better and better on every new episode. A little bit from its climax unfolds slowly, until it reaches the edge and give us an worthy ending, eventhough there's a whole more to be shown. 
 
{ART - 9/10} 
 
Once again, I got the pleasure if being amazed with such artwork, that may be the best I ever saw on a shounen manga based anime. Tough it remained pretty much the same, a new and even more exciting opening sequence was made to introduced the brand new season, while an ending directed towards romance was featured this time, contrasting with the ridiculously funny one we knew from before. 
Also, you can expect a whole new bunch of faces coming from Ayumu! 
 
{SOUND - 10/10} 
 
Most of its backgrounding still focused on the three top instrumental songs from the series: calm, transformation and thrilling. Obviously that some other pieces complete the OST and every one of them were still to fit their places without any problem. 
 
Iori performs ""* * * Passionate"", an improved version of the previous intro song, and Rie stands by herself this time during the anime's credits, mixing the ""Koi no Beginner Nan Desu"" love song with a very special... ""compilation""... 
 
{CHARACTER - 9/10} 
 
Briefly introduced characters now come to steal some spotlights and make their bright entrances on this series! You may guess I'm talking about Haruna's master, Ariel, the emerging idol, Lovely Kirara/Sarasvati and, finally, Mystletainn Sensei, who holds a special surprise for us. Some recurring names were added as well, to enlarge its original cast and further improve this aspect. 
 
{ENJOYMENT - 10/10} 
 
It will hook you right on the first episode and those 10 pieces may seem not enough to fully express this amazing work. It ends fast, but doesn't let you down and adds a desire for more. Only time can tell us when the next chapter from this story will be aired... 
 
{OVERALL - 9/10} 
 
Ayumu is had nothing special. Being friends with a pervert and not drawing too much attention during his High School time was something that he wanted. No trouble, just a calm life. Getting to be immortal and sharing his house with uncommon beings for so long made him change... This season is dedicated to Ayumu's youth, as a deeper reason for him to live will be revealed, under many absurd situations. Gaia will not rest until Ayumu shows what he is really capable of...

          
 
       Helpful This was nothing compared to season 1: Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka 
 
They mashed so much otaku related fan service like maid cafes and water melon smashing at beaches that the story was completely pushed out. 
If you watched the first season you will know it also contained this type of stuff but the core story was good. However season 2's core story could have fit into 2 episodes. 
Doubt this will get a season 3 seeing as how bad this season was it's a real shame the first season was one of the best animes I've ever watched.

Shizuka is kidnapped and a storm prevents her persecution. When the adventurers finally find the mysterious Treasure Island, where they have taken Shizuka, they discover that it is something more than a common island. 
 
(Source: Official Website)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Kids']","Upon hearing about the story of Treasure Island, Nobita dreams of discovering and exploring his own treasure island, despite the fact all of the Earth has been mapped already. Doraemon provides Nobita a special treasure map that shows him the location of a treasure island. At the same time, the media announces the discovery of a completely unknown island. Believing the new island is the treasure island, Nobita recruits Doraemon and Shizuka to journey with him, with Doraemon providing a ship. Gian and Suneo also tag along. However, as they get near the island, they are suddenly attacked by a gang of pirates. At that moment, the island begins to move, revealing that it is, in fact, part of a massive, highly advanced ship. The pirates retreat but abduct Shizuka in the process. Nobita and his friends are unable to rescue her, but save an unconscious boy named Flock.
Flock explains that the pirates that attacked them are in fact time travelers who travel to different eras to steal treasure off the sea floor, and he himself was part of the ship's crew but decided to desert since he couldn't accept taking orders from Captain Silver. Doraemon uses the treasure map to track the pirate ship's location. Meanwhile, on the pirate ship, Shizuka encounters Sarah, Flock's sister. Sarah agrees to help Shizuka. Both Flock and Sarah reveal that Captain Silver is, in fact, their father, who went mad when their mother died and has become obsessed with gathering as much treasure as possible. Nobita and his friends attempt a rescue operation, but end up rescuing picking up Sarah instead of Shizuka, who is taken directly to Captain Silver.
Captain Silver then moves on the final stage of his plan. Having seen humanity's destruction in the future, he is determined to launch his pirate ship into space and colonize a new planet with all of the treasure he has acquired. However, this requires him to drain the Earth's energy to get the power he needs to reach space. Doraemon warns that taking Earth's energy will result in its destruction so Nobita, his friends, Flock, and Sarah attack the pirate ship again. Gian and Suneo stay behind to occupy the pirates while Nobita, Doraemon, Flock, and Sarah confront Captain Silver directly. While Nobita and Doraemon delay the activation of the pirate ship's engine, Flock is able to seize control of the ship and eject the energy back into Earth. Captain Silver comes to realize how badly he had neglected his children, and abandons his plans, promising to be a better father to them.
Afterwards, Flock, Sarah, Captain Silver, and the rest of the crew return to their own time while Nobita and his friends return home, with Nobita gaining a new appreciation for his own father.
","As Nobita hears a pirate story, he dreams of going hunting for treasure himself and using Doraemon's gadgets he surprisingly discovers some undiscovered treasure. The treasure was located on a newly formed island of rock outside of Japan but as they make their way there, they are attacked by a group of time travelling pirates and Shizuka is kidnapped. Now they must rescue her from these mysterious assailants. 
 
A new original movie for 2018 even though the pattern's been remake of an old movie followed by an original. Interestingly enough, Genki Kawamura was responsible for the screenplay - he was one of the producers for Your Name and also The Boy and The Beast. 
 
As usual the art is good and this was actually quite a good action comedy. Shizuka gets a lot more screen time than she usually does. They added in a bunch of little riddles in for fun too and movie doesn't forget to empthasise on protecting Earth and its environment as its been with previous movies. 
 
Worth a watch for Doraemon fans.

Will new secrets be revealed? Will Himawari finally find out about her past and the mysterious ninja that saved her when she was little? 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Romance']","Kasumi Kogen, which translates to ""The Village of Mist"", is a town somewhere in rural Japan. In this town there is a school, the Shinobi Gakuen, where competent female students gather from all over Japan and train to become kunoichi (female ninja).

","Season two of himawari is pretty much the same as season one in many ways, no surprises there. The difference, which resulted in a lowered score, is that there's too much ""drama"" or things they'd like to call drama. Instead of just the slice of life-esque episodic comedy thing we had in season 1, season 2 tries to be something it's not by introducing some kind of an enemy organisation that keeps on sending weird ninjas and doing experiments or whatever. As a result, there's much less focus put on the funny parts and much more on some kind of subpar ""drama"" or slightly serious stuff. This further enhances the flaws of a show that never had any remotely good plot in the first place by focusing on what it sucks at the most.  
 
I have absolutely no idea about what they were trying to do with this anime, but it sure as hell wasn't well done. It's really a stupid move to stray away from the pure comedy thing they had going. It got really damn boring quickly and I have no idea how I even managed to watch it all.

However, at one point earlier in its development many people from Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro) had been involved with the project. In 1984 they produced a test pilot. In 1987, Osamu Dezaki directed a third one (as a very first one was made by Sadao Tsukioka in the mid-1970s).",['Adventure'],"The film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel, Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed. Upon actually falling asleep later that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.
Nemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes ""the nightmare"". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, ""The Nightmare"" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.
Nemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him into the ocean. Genius discovers Nemo and tells him not to blame himself for all that has happened and that Flip is to blame, but Nemo accepting the situation pledges to find the King.  When the two return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon because he has a map of Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Oomps who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter but awakens in his bed instead. The Oomps appear in Nemo's room and the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently imprisoned in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter. Nemo soon uses the scepter to finally eliminate and defeat the Nightmare King but almost at the cost of Nemo's life. Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom. Camille escorts Nemo home on the dirigible. The two nearly share a kiss before Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window as he looks forward to his new day.
","A lavishly animated, dazzling pilot for what I can only assume would've been Japan's answer to Disney's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, or conversely the 1939 adaptation of the Wizard of Oz. Such a movie would've been too good for this world. The great irony of the situation is the realization that such a lush movie about dreams became little more than a fantastical dream itself. 
 
If you're reading this, I'm sure you already know that Little Nemo cost a fortune, went through years of production hell, emerged with little more than a superficial resemblance to its gorgeous pilots, and completely bombed in both America and Japan. Tokyo Movie Shinsha hasn't tried to produce anything this ambitious since, and everyone is worse off for it.

It doesn’t take long time until Sumomo discovers that Chii forgot her panties, so Sumomo and Kotoko sets out on an adventurous trip to return the panties to Chii. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Romance', 'Comedy']","The series centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a held-back student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (パソコン): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, not noticing that a disk fell on the ground. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is ""chi"" (ちぃ, Chii), thus he names her that. Hideki assumes that there must be something wrong with her, and so the following morning he has his neighbor Hiromu Shinbo analyze her with his mobile persocom Sumomo. After Sumomo crashes during the attempt they conclude that she must be custom-built.
Shinbo introduces Hideki to Minoru Kokubunji, a twelve-year-old prodigy who specializes in the field of custom-built persocoms. Minoru's persocoms, including Yuzuki, a fairly exceptional custom-built persocom, are not able to analyze Chi either, and thus they conclude that she may be one of the Chobits, a legendary series of persocoms rumoured to have free will and emotions. Although this is a possibility, Minoru is confident that it is only rumour. Yuzuki also adds that she does not resemble any persocom model in any available database and so she must be custom made after all.
A major part of the plot involves Hideki attempting to teach Chi words, concepts, and appropriate behaviours, in between his crammed schedule of school and work. At the same time, Chi seems to be developing feelings for Hideki, at an emotional depth she is not supposed to possess, and Hideki struggles with his feelings for her. The need to figure out more about Chi and her mysterious functions and past becomes a pull for the characters in the series.
Hideki's feelings intensify for Chi regardless of her being a persocom and despite his friends' painful experiences involving other persocoms. Chi becomes aware of her purpose through a picture book series called A City with No People which she finds in a bookstore. The books speak about many different things involving human and persocom relationships: persocoms and their convenience as friends and lovers, how there are things that they cannot do and questioning whether a relationship between a persocom and a human is really one-sided. It also speaks about the Chobits series; that they are different from other persocoms, and what they are incapable of doing unlike other persocoms. These picture books awaken Chi's other self, her sibling Freya who is aware of their past and helps Chi realize what she must do when she decides who her ""person just for me"" is. Together, Chi and Hideki explore the relationship between human beings and persocoms, as well as their friends' and their own.
","Well, there's not really much to talk about since it's only a 6 min special. Basically it's a story of two mini Persocoms trying to return Chi's underwear :P 
 
It uses, as you would expect, the same kind of animations and sound effects from the series which is always nice. It just seems overall like an exaggerated bit of humour which could of been taken from the show and is overall pretty enjoyable. 
 
If you're a fan of the show it's simply one of those item's that can just help round off and add to the whole Chobits experience (and plus you get to see the cuteness of Chi again, :D lol).

          
 
       Helpful Wow, this is actually not as perverted as you thought it was going to be. The story line actually holds back some though not as much as I would hope. This doesn’t really tell you when this is happening; weather it is after the show or in the middle of it but it’s a bit funny none the less.  
 
The artwork is the same as in the show, so not much to say on it. It’s bright, childish at times and yet shows a lot of detail. 
 
The voices I have to sigh at. I don’t like how high pitched the two little bots voices are, and just couldn’t stand it. I just could not deal with to much of the sound. 


          
 
       Helpful It was cute. Mostly.  If you're jonesing for Chobits, in particular, Chii, Sumomo, and/or Kotoko, this is a fine, quick fix of kawaisa.  It's more of the panty fetish, which seems to be a big thing for the anime writers. 
 
However, and let me preface a huge caveat with this:  I love Sumomo.  Dearly.  She's as cute as a button and I'll be the first guy on my block to get me a little Sumomo persocon when they come out. 
 
BUT -  if I EVER saw Sumomo or Kotoko with the horrifying expressions on their faces at the 4:30 mark, I would have no other recourse, but to burn them both, with a Eucharist wafer stuffed in their mouths, and a wooden stake pounded deeply through their adorable little hearts. 
 
And, having seen them like that, and knowing they're even capable of such a look, it's kind of hard to forget it and go back to adoring them.  What has been seen cannot be unseen, and all that. 
 
Why CLAMP would sign off on those four seconds of animation is utterly beyond me.

Why did I watch this? Why did I decide on writing a review when it is clear it is at the bottom of the ladder that all anime try to climb. I can honestly say I don't know. Maybe it's because I watched the original To Heart which was bad and I wanted to relive sitting through incredibly agonizing episodes filled with generic story, characters and screenplay. Most likely I watched it because I've been watching some good anime lately and I decided it's time for some balance. 
 
I don't really know if I actually want to write a review, per say, about this anime. You see, it is really bad, but then again so are almost all of the anime this anime try to look like. In truth Harem is probably the worst genre of anime, well maybe after ecchi. Never quite understood ecchi, either make a hentai or make real anime don't try to hybrid. 
 
To Heart 2 is one of the most generic anime you can find. It is thrown into the same bunch of quality productions such as; To Heart, To Heart remember my memories, Kono Aozora ni yakusoku wo, Amaenaide yo!, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! and more recent ones such as; Asu no Yoichi and Tayutama -Kiss on my Deity- and many, many, many more. Why do they make all of these generic fanboy animes one can ask oneself? The answer is simple! For the fanboys. 
 
There is always a demand for these kinds of anime, even the fanboys know that this is just like the 30 almost axactly similar animes they've seen before, but since the art is slightly different, the characters are slightly different, the guy attends highschool instead of middle school or his name is Ken-chan instead of Hiroyuki-chan it becomes worth watching. Sometimes it isn't a robot girl either, sometimes it's an alien, or maybe even a mermaid! 
 
To Heart 2 is, as all of the aforementioned titles aswell as many I've not mentioned here, one of the most predictable animes ever produced, but if it wasn't predictable then maybe something original could happen and we wouldn't want that! Oh no we wouldn't would we Ken-chan? 
 
Ken-chan: No we wouldn't! 
 
Have you ever noticed that even in fairly good shounen romance animes the guy is always clueless when it comes to himself and his feelings? ""Girl hugs guy, crying, but is too shy to say anything"" - ""Guy thinks to himself; why is she doing this, could this mean?.... no don't be stupid she probably just fell and got something in her eye and..."" 
 
I mean really? Who comes up with this shi... oh wait. 
 
In conclusion if you haven't seen To Heart 2 but you've seen all of the ones I mentioned and many other harems and alternately shounen romance comedy/drama where the guy only has two girls who are madly inlove with him then you will not be disappointed by this! 
 
FEEDBACK MUCH APPRECIATED ONLY NOT REALLY SINCE I AM RIGHT AND IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME YOU ARE WRONG. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO APOLOGIZE BEFOREHAND FOR ANY SPELLING ERRORS I*M JUST TOO LAZY TO READ ALL OF THE CRAP I JUST WROTE. THANKS.

          
 
       Helpful In this review there are hints of mature language.So if you aren't old enough to buy beer.......Not your fault i know..But hey if you do happen to read it i'll not tell anyone... 
Do you know those tv ads,like don't eat meat,eat weed or don't smoke go for a run in the woods?Well i got one as well,smoke meth don't watch animes like this. 
 
You're probably reading this standing in front of your screen going:""what the fuck he's on about""..But wait..Recent studies show that watching 1 episode from animes like To Heart 2,basically your everyday harem-romance anime,it shortens your lifespan by 1 week.That means that after watching an entire season you've had it.If you're a dog that means you're already dead.Thanks Frisky for all the lovely memories.We will always remember all the joyous walks to the park,your barking as we parked the car. 
 
And it's your fault Frisky bought the farm.Cause if you fruitcakes stopped for a moment being such whiny little bitches we would have more animes like Elfen Lied and not this shit.You ruined the anime bussiness and now all we get is this romance/drama/harem crap that causes people serious death.And i don't care about people but what did Frisky ever do to you you little fucktards? 
 
And if you think that i'm out of rants woohoooooo,i'm so not.I'm just starting with this bitch. 
 
To Heart 2....This must be the work of a mad scientist cause there's no other word for it,this is as lethal as a biological weapon.In fact there were rumours of entire villages ""mysteriously"" vanishing from the map around the time they were making this anime..I'm not so sure it was THAT mysteriously lads.I think they kidnapped those poor souls,handcuffed them in front of a massive screen and showed them eps from this.Death was instant.According to some reports that were leaked their brains melted and their eyes had turned into this pure white cream. 
 
So how,you wonder,this dangerous thing made it onto our screens?It was thanks to a special task force team,joined together by the UN.They worked day and night to make sure it was suitable for broadcasting.But even they,the very best of them all,couldn't quite tame the beast. 
 
And we ended up with this hybrid.Part bio weapon part anime.Or in terms you can understand part UCT(Unholy Cancerous Trinity) aka Kanon,Clannad,Air,part Japanese fever. 
 
Story?Hasn't got one.It's the classic school setting where one lad gets all the women the other lad gets his dust and some free porn on the net to pass his time.Oh we also have a vast cast of women who have the hots for the first guy.And this is a known fact that the almighty god gifted him with so much testosterone that women were known to pass out after being drained from their bodily fluids.That's called the squirting phenomenon. 
 
Animation,you say?Well that my friends is where things get even worse than before.The purpose,in my mind at least,is to make the new anime better in every way than the one before that.Well in some areas it looks so much better than the previous effort which was a blatant copy of UCT.But because this was made by men tehy couldn't do many things at once so they only fixed some parts of the hideous animation like the huge foreheads for example.While doing that they forgot to make the animation look like it was a product of 2005 and this resulted in it looking like one that was made in WW2. 
 
Songs and VA?Well the songs are as always a mix of the pink vomit of unicorns and the turds of the care bears.As for the VA it was there to do one job..Being absolutely subpar. 
 
And now onto the last part..Them characters.This time round they decided to go fresh,start anew.So their first job wwwwwwwaaaaaaassss...A new freakin robot...I'm not joking this also has a robot..Granted it doesn't play a major role but how lazy is that?If you're starting fresh ditch every single thing that made the previous 2 seasons such a waste of time.But at least i have to say that the rest of them are actually a tad better than the old folks.Mind you that doesn't say much.That like saying ""oh look i have aids which is better than Ebola cause i won't die in few days but in 2 years from now"".They are all the same shit you'll find in every other anime of this type.Nothing new. 
 
Sisters that both like the MC and one is a tsundere?Check 
 
Male friend that is there to serve as a plant?Check 
 
Cute Class Rep who is also afraid of boys but falls for his non existent charms?Check 
 
Childhood friend who after so many years wakes up one day and realises that all along she wanted to jump him and bear his children?Motherfucking CHECK. 
 
You must be thinking at this point that for a rant of this size there must be many things to this anime.But you'll be wrong.This is exactly like any other anime out there.No character,no soul,no passion.It's as lifeless as a dead corpse that is...Well,dead! 
 
If you want to watch it,then do by all means.Just don't come back here crying that i didn't warn you.Honestly if you are into self destruction please start taking drugs or start drinking and gambling.

          
 
       Helpful Funny, I watched the original To Heart before this (at the time, I believed ""To Heart 2"" to be another season of the original) and was hype as heck to watch this...only to discover it was something entirely different. And I LOVED it, but not as much as the original. I loved the original so much that I am still writing a draft for that review and it's not even close to completion. 
 
Anyway, not much to say about the core. Just another romance anime with a lifeless male lead designed to shoehorn you into buying the game it's based off of. And, well the original To Heart made a male protagonist with some personality, this one is just as generic as any harem male lead out there; and it doesn't help that it had to take place after Love Hina, the anime that popularized the male lead being tortured. And appropriately enough, nearly half of the new cast of females do this, which is why I feel more negative towards it. 
 
One positive thing I will say about the anime itself was the use of the soundtrack. The soundtrack, for what very little they use of the actual piano segments, sound beautiful. Maybe the game has the same one, but if not, this anime has a splendid soundtrack and that is probably the highest number I gave was for its soundtrack, funnily enough. 
 
Beyond that stuff, you obviously are reading this review cause you want to know of the female characters! This review ain't for the anime, it's so that you get to know the female characters in the game before you play! Cause, well, this one felt a tad bit lifeless for me to take it too seriously, so it's mostly a calm review about the characters and, well, that's about it. If you want to know about the main lead, Takaaki Kouno, he's not very fleshed out at all and his role in the anime is basically to be the generic nice guy that suffers various torture porn from some of the girls as it progresses. So, similar to what Love Hina started. 
 
So, this character list will go from my most favorite characters to my least favorite. Sadly, I did not draft this or review it much before publishing it here, so my words might be a bit scattered since I finished this a while ago, but I did watch all the spin-off stuff as well as the extensions, so my memories of the original are a bit loose now because of this. Speaking of, I would give those a higher rating on the art cause they looked much more expressive in comparison to this one's rather bleak colorization. If this review is panned a bit much, I can just make another review on the next series that goes into fuller detail of everybody in case my sentiments here are mediocre. 
 
With that, let us begin. By the way, partial spoilers. You have been warned. Also, I will not be counting any girls introduced in the special episodes; rather, they will have their own section in the next half of the review. Only girls that appeared in the original To Heart 2. Also, probably not gonna count the mom or maid robot, either. 
 
Sango Himiyuri - What more can I say about this girl, besides her confidence being so overwhelming that she just upright decided to break the ""no kiss romance"" trope by straight up kissing our male protagonist the same episode she meets him! Yes, this guy actually gets some action, and she straight up admits she loves him! Well, ""love-love"" but you get the idea. I thought she was a breath of fresh air in contrast to the darker girls, as whenever she was in the scene, you couldn't help but smile. 
 
I love her personality, her appearance and the fact that she's probably the most normal female in the entire cast with her non-exaggerated reactions and appreciation towards Takaaki. Doesn't help that she is apparently a freaking genius, either! She can create robots and do most things science. In fact, she even curbs her little sister multiple times in a very mature manner, despite how simplistic she sounds when talking to Takaaki. With a personality as unique as hers, there was no way any other girl would be number one. She was fully tolerable and nearly every scene she is in is filled with smiles. 
 
Manaka Komaki - Oh yes, I assume for those whom have already seen this anime, you know my pattern now. This girl did compete with my number one spot, but I was judging the version of her that appeared outside the original To Heart 2, so that would've been unfair. If we count the version of her that only appears here, she's a solid second place on the list. 
 
Sporting the warmest personality of the girls, Manaka is a very calm and delightful girl to listen to. Much like Sango, she sees more positive in Takaaki than negative; at least, in this particular series. She always listens to him and never exaggerates (often, anyway) anything, which I enjoyed a lot. Honestly, due to how little interaction she does have, or maybe it's cause my memory is a bit stale now since it's been a while since I saw the original, I can not really write much about her, despite her high placement. That's okay, though, cause she's still a fine character and most fans of To Heart 2 probably like her as well. 
 
Lucy Marioa Misora - What the hell, I thought she only went by ""Ruuko"" maybe they announced her full name on her debut episode, cause that confused the hell out of me. 
 
Um, anyway, this girl is just adorable. I actually admired the way this anime introduced the girls, as they actually start off as a character you see at least once in the background (there's a whole episode that brings this up, actually, for all of them), but I didn't think anything of her at that time. She's, by far, the most supernatural girl in the anime, as she can legitimately summon storm clouds and lightning from the sky (only does so one time, though) cause, well, she is very obviously revealed to be an alien. Her antics throughout are mostly comical, as she has minimal character development and little to discuss, beyond introducing the longest running gag in both the original anime and spin-offs, the ""Ru!"" line, which of course, Sango just HAD to use indefinitely every time she sees Ruuko (and sometimes Takaaki), which made me love Sango even more than I already did. But, I already talked about her, so let's move on. 
 
Konomi Yuzuhara - The last of the good characters, here is Konomi, a character whom legitimately sleeps in the same bed as Takaaki in the same episode of both her and his debut. Not sexually of course, but she was just scared of a horror movie and wanted comfort. It was quite adorable, but of course, now you're thinking ""this is the childhood friend"" well, you are correct. He does indeed refer to her by her first name, no honorifics attached, meaning he has the closest bond with her. Their relationship is honestly quite adorable, as it is indeed like they are siblings, but this adds a bit of drama to the anime later on. 
 
Her personality is likable if you like adorable characters, she has some good one-liners every now and then and, well, I did not pay much attention to her. Beyond her debut episode, which also introduced both her friends that she had to say goodbye to (though they are minor characters, so they are not counted in this), she becomes somewhat recurring from what I can remember. She was mainly there just to greet Takaaki and not do much else other than tease him, which was typical of the female childhood friend role. So, she's a fine character, and I would rather not put her lower on the list cause of what is sadly coming up next later on. 
 
Ruri Himeyuri - Here's the little sister I was talking about! She is basically Sango's exact twin, especially in this series where their hair color is lazily different from one another, with Sango's being slightly richer in blue, well Ruri's is slightly richer in purple, but a literal slight where, if you have poor vision, you'd just say they both have a low saturated tone of blue. Thankfully, Ruri always looking angry will help you tell her apart from her big sister. 
 
Her character development is among the most intricate in the anime, but I won't go into too much detail to avoid spoiling the whole experience. Overall, she just loves her big sister a lot, but hates anybody that wishes to ""steal her away"" from her. As I said before, Sango did kiss Takaaki, but Ruri responded with an immediate (and quite unnecessary) shot to his groin, despite Sango initiating the smooch. Sango almost always scolds Ruri for being rude to Takaaki, but Ruri's selfish nature prohibits her from truly listening to her words. 
 
One last thing I'd like to note about Ruri is that I'm not entirely sure how she ""loves"" her sister, cause it turns into a bit of a twincest thing throughout their arc; most notably, during one scene where she touches Sango's lips (very slowly) with her fingers and then touches her own well closing her eyes (still quite slowly, and I think she moaned a bit, too). She even kisses Sango herself at the end of their arc, albeit only on the cheek. It confused me a lot as to how much she ""loved"" Sango, but as of now, I believe it might be between a sibling love and a romantic love. Maybe also cause, since she wants Sango to herself, she might be willing to go so far as to marry her so that she is not ""hurt"" by anybody. Kinda creepy, huh? But, those are the exact vibes I get from her character, mainly due to her extremely antagonizing ways towards Takaaki. 
 
Yuma Tonami - Close friends with Manaka, this girl has one of the most hilarious hate arcs in the whole anime. She is typical tsundere, but in the most cringe way possible. She first begins the streak by accidentally running into Takaaki, but blaming him for it and claiming it to be a challenge (second longest running gag in the anime, perhaps) and always wants to fight him. From what I could remember, I believe this hatred stemmed from family manners at home where, being unable to overt her true feelings towards the career she decided to study for, she perhaps takes out her hatred on Takaaki as a means to calm herself. That's what I got the idea from. 
 
But, again, another case of lack of character development other than her debut episode, so it's mostly laughs when you see her come into the scene, since her hatred is quite obviously the most forced tsundere mode in the entire anime. 
 
Also, outside the original, there's a small implication that she actually secretly loves Takaaki after they share a ""romance glance"" (where the music stops, flowers are in the background and she blushes well starring at him for a while), but that was a different series and I won't spoil how that happens. But, I thought I'd bring it up to compensate for the little bit of information I wrote for her. 
 
Tamaki Kousaka - VERY close to being the last girl on the list, but not quite. Like Konomi, she has a childhood bond with Takaaki, giving him a pet name and is rather not afraid to get up and close with him. On her debut episode, when Takaaki is unfamiliar with who she is (apparently, she was gone for a while in her own school, alongside some of her classmates saying their goodbyes, whom you never see again in the entire anime), she teases him for a while till he figures it out. Straight away, she hugs him, slams him to the ground (despite how it looks, and the camera angles, this isn't romance, but a very hilarious reunion hug) and just rubs her face against his a lot well he's doing the ""Um, Tamaki?"" line well looking down all nervous. 
 
Coming off as very sweet thus far, you'd think she'd be higher up, especially since it's another one of his childhood friends. But, unfortunately, she has a bit of a yandere side to her. I guess it never came off to me right away, but near the end of the anime, it made sense. This will be a heavy spoiler, but I figure I should bring it up. It is implied that she loves Takaaki when they are children (she leaves him around this time, so he doesn't see her for years, I think) and so, well, she has a rather strange tsundere vibe around most of the girls in the anime, and it's quite condescending and overpowering. 
 
Most of what I'm about to say next is kind of not done in this series, but was worth a mention since I did not wish to write multiple reviews of it. Throughout most of it this one, the original, her eyes will switch from innocent to devious (the sharp, thin looking eyes) whenever she is about to have her way, and she always does, which was a major turnoff to me since I didn't like that very much. But, in the next series, it is shown that her yandere mode is much worse, as she is apparently four hundred percent stronger than the average human (she stops the attack of a freaking robot) and this just proved to me that her character was mainly meant to be a kind of ""bring the balance"" character, since nobody could defeat her. Well...maybe one, but she's not in the original series. 
 
Overall, Tamaki is a rather peculiar character that's hard to love due to her condescending nature, but she is indeed the only one that wrote a real love letter to Takaaki (we find out more about this in the next series) and, judging from how she reacts around the other girls at times, she can kind of look like a cryptic yandere type of girl. It's hard to elaborate, but that's the best way I can describe her. 
 
Karin Sasamori - Quite honestly, I wanted to skip most of the girl reviews and just write about her, but since I knew that would be a rather poor writing of the anime, I had to include the other girls, too. 
 
Yes, this is the girl whom I consider to be the worst in the series and for multiple reasons. Despite not being as intimidating as Tamaki, Karin manages to do one of the lowest things in the entire anime. I honestly don't want to spoil how it all leads to this, since I will leave that up to you to watch. 
 
But, at some point, a sign falls on Takaaki and the ""anime accident"" occurs where the main guy just happens to have one of his hands on the female character's breasts as he fell. Taking advantage of the situation, Karin asks that he is bold (general running gag in most anime when a male lead goes in for a move) and, before Takaaki can remove his hand, Karin places it back on her breast, albeit harder. She then says if she were to scream in agony, everybody in the sports team (coincidentally right next to them, just outside the room window, doing warm-ups) would hear and his reputation as a man would be ruined. 
 
And thus, begins the third longest running gag in the anime where Takaaki has to aid her bidding or else she will ruin his reputation. With Tamaki, despite her tsundere ways, she still cares for Takaaki and wouldn't truly hurt him (she does, inadvertently, in the next series, but it was by accident), well Karin is the very definition of sadistic. Her character is just not likable to me and she has no redeeming traits aside from having the most normal hair in the group. I was gearing up to enjoy her when she debuted, until that episode went on. 
 
Even worse, she indeed enforces this on Takaaki, even when he's in the drama portion of the anime where something serious happened. Only once, I believe, does he get out of her bidding, but only cause a friend pulls him out of the room they're in. Otherwise, she also has her way like Tamaki most of the time, but the thing is, she doesn't care if he hurts him or not. And that made her the cruelest character in the anime. Cause both Ruri and Yuma admittedly like Takaaki, but in their own unique way. Offscreen, according to Sango, Ruri admits at home that she ""misses Takaaki"" sometimes; as to which, she does the obvious blush before talking, hinting the fact to be true. As for Yuma, well, not much happens there until that light spoiler I gave of the next series. 
 
Yeah, this review was...pretty lifeless. It was hard to be optimistic writing about this, cause the anime became a bit of an earful, among other things, as it progressed. I just began disliking it a lot, with a few notable exceptions such as Sango, Manaka and others really managing to have bright enough personalities to cheer me up. I would've had more to write if I didn't wait so long, as it faded my memory of the anime and I wanted to just write something cause it had been a while for me. 
 
But, before I end things...there is one more girl in the bunch, one that apparently only has a cameo in a flashback sequence in this anime. Since she appears, though, and is considered a potential love interest for the main character (as a ""bonus"" according to what I saw, but was simply left out of the anime), I feel she counts. 
 
Yuuki Kusakabe - Honestly, if I count outside of this anime, this girl is probably my real third favorite...oh, who am I kidding, I've already mentioned the next series enough already, I'm not fooling anyone. 
 
She appears in a small flashback, revealing that she had to move away and also change her last name, so she could never see Takaaki again. As such, she is not necessarily a ""childhood friend"" of his, but close. She only ever got to interact with him for a little, but she grew close to him and, arguably, Yuuki is probably the girl that he has the most potential to date in the actual series as a whole. If you want to know more, you can read the last paragraph of her description or wait till you watch the next series. 
 
In the full version of the flashback, in a rather sweet way, Takaaki offers his last name to Yuuki so that he will never forget about her, saying she can go by ""Yuuki Kouno"" if she likes. This shocks the other girls in the next series, as this kind of implies that he proposed to Yuuki, and technically, inadvertently ""dated"" her before any of the other girls. It's pretty cute, honestly, but they only share one real heartwarming moment in the next series. Their interaction is also rather subtle, maybe cause the next series might take place a year later and, by this point, maybe he hadn't seen her in so long (want to say over half a decade by this point) that he just forgets about her. It's rather sad, really, but it also did not help at all that, in this series, she has teal(?) hair, well in the new one, it's black. Maybe they just couldn't write her character fully for the anime and she was more in a ""beta"" phase during that flashback. Either way, I enjoyed her in the next series a lot and, indeed, she would be my personal number three if this review wasn't bias towards the original series. 
 
So, that's the last of my sentiments towards To Heart 2. It's very vague, cheesy and this review wasn't fleshed out at all. In fact, due to the lack of free time I have to write this stuff anymore, I didn't really want to pour my soul into this, either. I'm saving that for the original To Heart later on this month, if not the next. So, this is more of an opinion thing I have between all the girls. 
 
My final sentiments regarding the anime are that it would've been better if it was made before Love Hina, like the original was, as it would've allowed for better development, no tsundere bull and, well, less negativity perhaps. The drama was a welcomed idea, of course, considering how lighthearted the series before it is, but they do it in very strange ways; only becoming stranger in the next series. 
 
Hope you enjoyed the read, and look forward to my sentiments on the original To Heart!

0,1116,68,4.576570631994051,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Junkers Come Here,"This heartwarming and unexpectedly mature story concerns a young girl named Hiromi Nozawa and her dog, Junkers (pronounced Yoon-kers). Hiromi walks us through her childhood troubles of love, schooling, and family bonds. Her companion Junkers accompanies her on this adventure; however, Junkers is no ordinary dog—he can talk and grant 3 wishes. ","['Slice of Life', 'Drama']",none,"Junkers, Come Here encompasses everything that is great about animation. 
 
The movie sticks close to the reality we know and avoids topical and epochal content while still using animation effectively to depict scenes that would otherwise be difficult, expensive, or uncanny in other media. While the story it tells is typical, the writing, soundwork, and pacing of the scenes demonstrate mastery of craft. While neither being a dramatic film nor a comedy, Junkers manages to constantly deliver scenes which are wholeheartedly funny, moving, and entertaining. The characters and story deliberately avoid feeling artificial, and even with the inclusion of a talking dog, the movie's universe feels completely like our own. 
 
Movie gems like this are the reason I keep watching anime. Rare is it to find a movie which can sincerely entertain me for every second of its runtime and leave me feeling good after reflecting on the experience.

          
 
       Helpful This heartwarming family film focuses on a young girl named Hiromi dealing with the complications within her family alongside her pet talking dog, Junkers. The film believably deals with the issues of divorce and parental absence that effect Hiromi in this film, issues that you wouldn't find touched upon in many family or children's films. Both of Hiromi's parents have areas of work that require them to have days to weeks at a time away from home and Hiromi is normally cared for by her tutor and family maid. While the young girl puts on the facade of not minding the work of her family, her dog and tutor can tell that the distance with her parents hurts her emotionally and the movie creates a coming-of-age theme out of Hiromi's situation with her parents. Hiromi behaves believably for a girl of her age and gets enough fleshing-out where one can connect with the problems she faces throughout the movie. 
 
At the same time though, the anime deals with the issues in enough of a light-hearted and mature way where the content won't alienate or insult the intelligence of its wide audience. The anime mixes in its fun moments and jokes involving Hiromi and Junkers' interactions with one another to lighten the mood at points and has some magical elements thanks to Junkers that contribute to the anime's heartwarming moments. The combination of fun and serious elements give Junkers Come Here its strong charm and excellent quality for a family anime film that some could mistaken for a Studio Ghibli film with the similar themes and animation style from the studio's films used for this movie. 
 
Speaking of animation, the backgrounds to Junkers Come Here used a soft pastel-like drawing style that are beautiful to look at, are well detailed and add to the film's gentle mood. Character designs are a bit on the simple side, but are drawn to make the characters look lifelike and not feature the big-eye or ridiculous hair styles and colors found within many popular and well-known anime titles. The soundtrack mostly consists of light and whimsical music pieces that do their part in enhancing both the fun and serious moments found throughout the film. 
 
Overall, Junkers Come Here made for quite the engaging and touching anime family film offering a nice balance of fun and serious moments in the exploration of Hiromi's family issues and the girl learning to be honest with her family in expressing her feelings on the dilemma. It is definitely worth adding to your collection and even a film worth showing to your children if you have any. 

          
 
       Helpful This is an anime for all the latchkey kids out there. This is an anime for everyone that has sat alone at an empty table eating microwaved dinners night after lonesome night.  This is an anime for all the people that grew up in broken families, where stony silences and frigid stares were the main means of communicating. And this, sadly, is an anime for me, someone who spent the majority of his childhood, desperately trying to reconcile two hostile parents that couldn't stand to be in the same room as one another. I too spent many late nights waiting to hear that car pull into the driveway or that key rattle in the lock. It's the reason I was drawn to reviewing this anime, because the anime resonated with me on a personal level. I'm also reviewing this anime with the hope that my words will influence a few readers to give this film a chance. It's closing in on its 20th anniversary, it's won awards for best animated film, and yet still fewer than 1000 people have completed it on MAL. 
	 
 
Story: (8/10) Now I hope I didn't discourage anyone with my introduction. Even those that can't relate to the opening will still be touched by this remarkably poignant and moving film. Both slice of life and drama, this story tells the tale of a young girl named Hiromi and her pet dog, Junkers. With her grandmother recently deceased, her mother working deep into the night, her father constantly away on business, and a lack of friends at school, Hiromi finds herself struggling with loneliness and a feeling of abandonment.  Junkers is her only constant companion, and we quickly learn that Junkers is no ordinary dog... Junkers can talk! When people hear talking dog, instantly they pigeon hole the film as a kiddy movie, but this film tackles serious and difficult issues. Divorce, abandonment, sacrifice, and being true to oneself are each explored in this surprisingly emotional story. Importantly though, the film manages to avoid falling into the trap of being melodramatic. The drama is never overblown to the point where it becomes unrealistic.  
	 
 
Characters: (9/10) Hiromi takes up the lion's-share of the screen time, and her character is more than up for the task. Her character is beautifully developed through out the film, and its very easy to empathize with her pain. Outwardly Hiromi struggles to convince the world that she's perfectly fine. She portrays a happy, confident, precocious girl to all who meet her. The truth behind the mask is that she's really breaking down inside, and the weight of wearing it day in and day out only makes her misery worse. Junkers is an interesting character as well. He plays the naive, well-meaning friend, but perhaps he's more than he seems... The parents aren't given enough screen time to really develop much, which is unfortunate, but fits into the theme of the absentee parents. I haven't mentioned the boarder that's living with them yet. His relationship with Hiromi becomes quite interesting, and he may be the second best character in the film. And last but not least is the housekeeper, who provides wonderful comic relief. 
 
Animation: (6/10) Even if we give the film some leeway due to its age, the animation can only be described as average. The frames per second seem to be slightly on the low side, and some of the movements lack smoothness. The character models are simple, yet effective. The facial expressions work well to aid the story. The backgrounds and sets are very plain, but this isn't the type of film that requires beautiful and detailed artwork to carry it. The simple artwork lets the story and the characters become the stars of the film.  
 
Sound: (8/10) The soundtrack for the film is decent, but not remarkable. I thought the voice acting was superb though. Hiromi's voice actor did a fabulous job, and was always able to convey her characters emotions to the viewer. I also really liked the maid's voice actor as well. 
 
Overall: (8/10) Again, I couldn't recommend this film enough to anyone that enjoys a good drama or coming of age movie. After I watched this movie, I was really shocked it was as unpopular as it was. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I promise you won't be disappointed!

Set following the events of the first Popolocrois game.","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"Popolocrois is a childish anime. 
So, if it would be watched with this ""eyes"" the experience will be more enjoyable. 
 
A simple story and development about friendship and ""duties"". 
The background is way more interesting than the main story, and the 25 episodes show us more about the characters than the development of the story. 
Dragons, Sky and humans are a good idea, but unfortunattely forgotten in the most of the show. 
 
The design is very different from the other anime, but after some episodes it turns enjoyable too. The voice casting is one of the highest points, Gamigami and Shiroshiki are just perfect. 
 
But, the ""gold"" in Popolocrois is just it - his innocence and simplicity.

          
 
       Helpful Poplocrois monogatari starts with a prince Pietoro who was born to a Dragon mother and a Human. So he acquires power due to his dragon blood. He had a friend who is a fairy (born as a sprite and brought up as a witch with alternate personality Kai) name Narcia. Most of the time this young prince roams in the forest with Narcia. Accident created by Gami Gami Maou who considers himself as villain brings a wind clan girl named Hyuu, who steals indirectly dragon powers of Pietoro. Remaining story is getting it back. 
 
Characters: Most irritating characters are Hyuu and Pietoro because he forgives Hyuu's selfishness easily. Pietro is also selfish when he only chants name of Hyuu even after she brought calamity to his kingdom. I am surprised with His mother character who is the only pleasant one in the entire series. 
 
Entire series is worse than any fillers we have seen so far in any anime.  
 
This anime failed to explain lot of story behind why everyone sympathized with Hyuu though she is the EPITOME OF SELFISHNESS. The characters seem to be little kids then why is there romance element? Bizzareness is what i can ascribe to the plot. Pietro was considered to become strong when he returns from his ""journey"" by his fater. But i do not see where did he journey actually. He roamed in their kingdom forests only.  Narcia is not supposed to roam in her form to distant places. But she accompanied him for certain areas.  Pietro enjoys the company of Hyuu only ( most of the series shows it) 
 
The story is not worth watching as it is dragging and selfish story of Pietro who seems to double cross both the girls. 
 
BUT THE GOOD POINT OF THIS SERIES IS THAT THE USEFULNESS OF THE translation notes provided at the beginning of  some of the episodes as these provide some understanding of Japanese language and culture. I learnt about goushiosama deshita for instance. 
 
This series might give some clarity to those who have played the parent story of it, RPG play station game.

          
 
       Helpful PoPoLoCrois Monogatari is a video game series I rarely see mentioned. It was initially released in Japan in 1995 (based on an earlier manga series, which I hear isn't very good), but was passed up for localisation in favour of Beyond the Beyond due to the latter's psuedo-3D battle engine, preferable over PoPoLoCrois' (albeit absolutely beautiful) 2D isometric sprite based play. It spawned numerous sequels, and the first two titles (as well as a specially made scenario) were eventually ported to the PSP and brought to the Western world. The two titles were heavily edited (over half the content was removed from the first game) due to Sony's completely illogical viewpoint of having 'shorter' 30-hour quests for their portable system (which I really cannot understand, at fucking all. Usually I'll see some logic in this kind of decision, but I really don't see any at all (yes, I'm extremely butthurt)). Despite being highly inferior to the original PS1 games, the PSP version is still a very good game for JRPG fans (if buggy and somewhat easy). Those who appreciate light-hearted children's fantasy are doubtless to fall in love with this game, as I have, as the games focus on the adventures of Pietro Pakapuka, Prince of PoPoLoCrois, as he attempts to save his mother's spirit from the ominous Ice Demon. 
 
Two anime series were also created: PoPoLoCrois Monogatari which takes place between the first PoPoLoCrois Monogatari game and PPLCMII, and PoPoLoCrois, which adapts the PlayStation 2 games that chronicle the adventure's of Pietro's son, Pinon. Whilst both are very good (the latter including some surprisingly dark moment), I feel the former is the better series - hell, I think it's a fucking masterpiece! 
 
PoPoLoCrois Monogatari tells the story of a mysterious girl named Hyuu who somehow appears on PoPoLoCrois. She soon befriend Pietro, and the majority of the series focuses on their relationship, how Hyuu copes with being in an unfamiliar world, and the mystery surrounded where she came from. The series starts out rather small-scale initially (despite a rather large opening, but grows to be almost an epic by its finale. 
 
Despite being a children's series, PoPoLoCrois Monogatari places a massive emphasis on character development, deeply exploring the thoughts and feelings of the main characters. So much emphasis is placed that the plot effectively stops half way through and then shifts into a series of stories and encounters that have no real bearing to the main plot but greatly develop the main characters, and the story does not pick up again properly until the last three or four episodes. Character development is done in a way that shows that the protagonists are still children yet does not trivialise or tone down the drama. 
 
The only real problem with the series is that the aforementioned plot-hiatus can make the show seem to drag out a little, but honestly I didn't find this detracting from the overall experience one bit. 
 
The series has great animation with a very unique (and pretty) artstyle, and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in anime. It is not required to play the games to enjoy the series, but you'll understand certain characters' relationships more and recognise references/callbacks to the first game. I'd highly recommend watching this series, it's quite tragic that it's so obscure despite being so fantastic.

(Source: Official Website)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha']",none,"There is a reason animes do not try to throw ALL the tropes into one show. It creates a giant mess. While there are some interesting character designs, what really counts, characters and story, are poorly done, ruining whatever this show had to offer.  
 
To give you an idea of what I mean by all the tropes here's the synopsis: a couple of happy go lucky androids from a fantasy kingdom team up with an immortal outlaw who owns a giant Pink Cadillac that can transform into a giant Minotaur Robot. Their goal, to reach the prince that one of the androids was programmed to the best friend of. Oh, and said android is one of those chosen one stereotypes. Add in a crazy team of assassins chasing them, and even a drunken master, and you get the point. The writer simply wanted to put ALL the things he liked about anime into one work.  
 
When the show is at it's best is when it just goes nuts. All these crazy characters could run around doing god only knows what, and it can work. This lends itself to a more episodic format, which I wish they could have committed to. Unfortunately, the story is only kind of episodic, with a very week through story woven within it. The tone is not consistent, being wacky one episode, and then dealing with darker themes the next. The entire prince arc is a drag. Just a total mess of a narrative that has a rather weak conclusion, most likely because I could care less about any of the characters.  
 
This show is going for over the top, I get it. That means damn near all the characters are going to be one note, hyper flat cliches. This works fine in something like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because they do a good job of making the good guys awesome, and the bad guys dicks. Here, I didn't like a single character that we're supposed to be rooting for. Sam and Casey are very annoying, and Philly is a selfish prick. The prince is a spoiled brat. The rest of the cast are totally forgettable. The bad guys, well, they're pretty much just bad for the sake of being bad guys. The big bad has a little backstory, but a very cliche one. Buy the time it gets to the final battle, there are side fights between characters you really know very little about, and have zero investment into.  
 
Technically, this show was competently executed. The animation and sound are executed to the point where they didn't detract, nor elevate the show. While some to the character designs look like rip offs, (Philly is way too reminiscent of Spike) some to the character designs are pretty cool. Especially the team of assassins that we barely get to know. I'll give them points for that.  
 
Cannon Busters was never going to be some deep show that we'd talk about years later, but it had the potential to be a fun romp with crazy characters. Unfortunately the weak story, and poor unlikable characters leave this one as a miss. Basically a show to fall asleep to, little more. 

          
 
       Helpful I decided to watch this show for the August 2019 Anime Watching Challenge because I needed to watch a fantasy anime. As an African, I always love to see black characters represented in anime and I was sold once I found out that the creator was black as well. I know that's not a great way to build a watchlist, but I had to support a brother. 
 
Art: 8/10  
The character designs are all unique, which helps if you're like me and can't remember names. I especially applaud this show for its flawless integration of 3D with 2D designs. The sparse use of 3D really served it well. There was also some great background art, creating a scenic setting that matches a show of this genre. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
I don't have anything to say about the sound design. Nothing particularly stood out to me. I will say that they had an awesome intro song though. I literally never skipped the intro on Netflix and even as I grew frustrated with the show, I would always appreciate this ultimate bop. Will definitely add to playlist. I wish the tempo was even more upbeat though. 
 
This is the last positive thing I will say about the show. If you are a huge fan, please stop reading because I'm about to rip this anime to shreds. 
 
Story: 3/10

Enjoyment: 2/10 
 
I'll group these 3 together just because they're all intertwined. I have no idea how this show was allowed to be made. I'm genuinely confused. It starts out alright with us meeting the main characters. I was intrigued since I'm a sucker for shows in which the main characters adventure together through different lands while meeting interesting characters along the way. The show is definitely this type of anime but it had major flaws that made me unable to appreciate any of that. 
 
The main issue is the lack of character development. The only way the premise of a group of characters traveling together works if you actually like the characters. Not only did I not like them, I didn't know anything about them. After the first few episodes, I expected us to see subtle characteristics that reflect their personalities and outlook on life. The show was more concerned with making Philly look as ""cool"" as possible rather than actually showing us how he came to have this unfazed, unenthusiastic attitude as well as the effect his loneliness has on him. They really gave us 5 seconds of his backstory in episode 11 and expected us to feel anything for the guy.  
 
They also made him so overpowered that there were absolutely no stakes in every fight he was in. It's not a good sign when your viewer is hoping that the main character gets actually killed or heavily injured. 
 
The 2 bots were purposely written as naive idiots just so the writers can dump exposition on the viewer with the pretense of Philly having to explain every detail of the world they themselves live in. This is cheap and makes me feel like the writers just didn't give enough of a f*** to ingrain details in the scenes for the viewer to pick up on themselves. Other than the 5 minutes in ep8 that I felt pity for Casey and the first few episodes where we learn about Sam's relationship with the Prince, I didn't actually care for any of the characters in this show. 
 
This is sad because instead of doing this episodic bulls***, they could have spent time diving deep into these characters to reveal what makes them tick, what motivates them, what makes them themselves. But the writer decided that it was more vital to the story to show how cooky and zany the different towns of the universe are. I DONT CAAAARRREEEE! Give me heart, give me passion, give me something to make me want to root for these characters instead of spending nearly 6 hours of my life watching the most hollow characters do absolutely nothing and finally being thrown into a battle. They should have been building up to the final fight, instilling anticipation in the viewer with each episode. Instead, we had no idea how far away they were from their destination and had no actual confirmation that Philly was indeed taking them there. Because I still can't come up with any legitimate reason why he would. He could have just roamed around and gone where he wanted to go while lying to his companions so as to keep Casey with him as his handyman. I fact, taking them where they wanted to go would only lead to Casey leaving with Sam and Philly being left without a handyman. There is more reason for him to keep them away from their destination! THIS IS SIMMMMMMPLLLEEE TO FIGGGGURRREE OUUUT! The people ivolved in this show could have taken 1 second to flesh out this part and made this show make sense. But no! They have cool transformer cars. They don't need decent writing! 
 
And to top it all off, they came back to spit in my face with the sh**show that was the last 2 episodes. I genuinely feel disrespected. The writers gave absolutely no f***s and decided they'd throw all reason out the window. Because of the lack of character development, the viewer was forced to assume each character's motivations for doing what they were doing. But the writers wanted to ""surprise"" us, so they wrote the final 2 episodes in which none of the things the characters did made any sense and you were forced to watch the most chaotic fight scenes, not knowing who was on who's side. I truly felt like I had missed an entire season of content between episode 10 and 11 because the random s*** that was happening had no rhyme or reason. 
 
I think this is it for me. I don't know if accurately describe how much of a waste of time this show was. I can't understand how anyone could come out of this wanting a second season. The entire show was clearly a setup for the next season, but I genuinely hope it doesn't happen for the sake of my sanity. 
 
I know this review was pretty dramatic but I just want to say that if you did enjoy it, good for you. We all have different tastes, but this was just my take on this show.

          
 
       Helpful I went into this show blindly, hoping to like it. This show should have been much better.  
 
ART: 6.5/10  
 
Pretty good at times, pretty standard at times. I like the designs of Sam and Casey the best. Backgrounds look good, and the animation is great at times. Awful design awards go to the main villain, floating claw lady, Russia white hair woman, and vitiligo girl.  
 
SOUND 5/10 
 
Something about cowboys + robots + anime just screams Nujabees or J-Dilla type music. Something with soul and rhythm. None of that was here. I know that's something up to personal preference, but even so, the soundtrack was very unmemorable and felt kinda quiet and lacking impact during intense scenes.  Not horrible, not amazing— but I guess that’s kinda worse in a way. 
 
WOLRD 3/10 
 
One of the worst things in this show, other than the story, is the world building. Nothing in this world feels coherent or logical. There are no established rules in this world, or a pecking order of sorts. We see royal castles, samurai, cowboys, robots, magic, furries, discount Zalem from Gunnm— all kinds of shit. In this regard, it feels like Space Dandy, the difference being it actually WORKS there, because they are hopping galaxies, dimensions, and planets— NOT driving across state borders.  
 
How does anything in Cannon Busters fit together? All of this is happening on one world. It would be nice to have a sense of scale, or progress, or some kind of hint as to how this world functions, but apparently Philly and crew can just fucking drive anywhere they want, because all these conflicting areas are right next to each-other, connected by simple roads.  
 
The world feels like random set pieces strewn together, with an emphasis on cowboys. It doesn't help that we never really see these different kinds of worlds overlap in some major way. Where were the cowboy knights, furry samurais, western themed castles? They are utilizing all of these themes, yet they never combine them to create new and interesting ideas. It’s just goes to waste. 
 
CHARACTERS/STORY 2/10 
 
I'm a fan of cute, dumb, friendly robots, so I am giving Sam and Casey a slight pass. It still would have been nice to get more character development on them, as the only thing we know about either of them, is that it’s very easy to convince Casey to go commit Sudoku, and that Sam is the Prince’s protector. 
 
Everyone else however, not so much. No one is interesting. At all.  
 
Am I really supposed to give two hoots about the prince? lmao 
 
The bad guy in the show, Ifor’Got-hisname, is so awful, so generic. He’s like the villain in Justice League. This show did not need ANY of his scenes. Honestly, just cut out all the scenes with the royalty, or big bads. Change the whole plot. Make Sam need Philly’s help with some kind of Mcguffin retrieval job, or have Philly steal Sam and Casey or something.  
 
ANYTHING but the royalty plot. Please.  
 
 
Verdict: 4.5-5/10 
 
The show was kinda enjoyable at times, but eh, you could watch much better stuff. This season finished, but it just left me saying, ""That's it?”.  
 
I'm not sure if this is getting a second season, but to sum up my thoughts, I think Philly the Kid said it best during the final episode: 
 
""You mean I'm supposed to go after the same damn kid all over again— only this time with even more idiots I can't stand, annoying the crap out of me? Yeah, no thanks.""

       Helpful I've heard Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran described as ""fluff"", and I'd say that's accurate. It's a very light-hearted, relaxing anime, despite being about martial arts and action. Kazemakase is the kind of thing I'd put on while I fold some laundry or something. That being said, Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran has no illusions about what it is and it does it very well. It doesn't try to be anything more and doesn't need to be.  
 
One thing that stood out for me was Ran's character. If you watch a lot of anime, you might have noticed that a lot of series really seem to struggle with realistic female characters. Ran, I felt, is believable. She's got more than one side to her personality, but isn't so convoluted or simple that she's unbelievable as a character. She's probably my favorite female character in any anime, which is saying a lot, because while Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran is good, it's not even in my top 10 anime.

","Firstly, i must state that i watched this anime with spanish dubs (latin) and this is important as it was obvious that most of the jokes were changed, and made reference to latin culture and mexican primarly i think. 
 
Story 
well, there was not a continued story, it was more like a sitcom of 6 minutes episodes, but each mini-storie was great and really funny and intelligent. 
 
Art 
Most of the characters were draw very simply, &quot;extras&quot; being just a grey body with eyes. And well the artwork was similar to that of crayon shin-chan but less ugly, often joking about that by drawing the characters in the more common anime style when they are acting cool. 
 
Sound 
All i can say about the japanese sound is that the opening was really funny and fit perfectly the anime. More than that i can't say but for the ones who know spanish i recommend the dubs, it was the best spanish dubbing i've seen. 
 
Character 
there are lots of characters in this show and none of them is boring. you have the four main characters high (a energetic guy who's always on fire, and has the personality of a leader but is not listened buy his mates ), nari (a millionaire that loves circular things and solves everything with money), moro ( the girl of the group who is always trying to be sexy and... nothing more really) and koni (the mysterious main character with the mysterious house). 
some of the side characters are a samurai fish, a talking tv, a teacher that has a thing for koni, an old woman's hand, and a talking dog. 
 
Enjoyment 
i laughed out loud all the time with this series and you can see each chapter a thousand times and still laugh the same way.

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I reccomend to watch this anime if you know Spanish and if you know a little of latin and mexicain culture. I did not watch this anime with subs, so I can't tell you how it was in Japan, but in latin america, when this anime was airied, it was amazing. The dubbing is outstanding and the jokes are extremely funny, sort of like what happened to The Simpsons (Latin dubbing is better than original). 
 
This is one of those comedy animes divided into three segments of 7 minutes, each one with a different story. I can tell you: The first segment is about ordinary life (sitcom), the second is sort of like romantic comedy, and the third is all about parody. There is no main plot, and the main characters don't have a goal per se. 
 
The characters are memorable. Koni, the main protagonist, is a obese twelve-year-old kid, and still, he is the most famous person in the world, the strongest person in the world, and the incarnation of all virtues in history. 
High, his buddy, is eccentric, hyperactive, and he starts a fire wherever he is. 
Nari, another buddy, is the richest boy in the world, he can buy anything that was, is or will be in this universe. 
 
And there is the moe-sexy-girl, Moro, who is in love of Koni. She is a exhibitionist, causing nosebleed to almost every human but Koni. 
There is no Evil Castrating Dark Horrible Powerful antagonist, but what could be the bad guy, is the boss of an organization called The Bad Guys, and he has two sidekicks. He is known for dating the wife of the armed-man, called ""Tal Iván"", whose name is a pun of the Talibans. 
 
The art is not so amazing but simple: The extras are drawn with cyan and magenta colors, and there is one character that is a purple man with golden sort-of-like glasses. 
 
The BGM of this anime is PERFECT for this anime, I'm still criying I can't found it on the internetz. 
 
Anyways, I don't think you'll enjoy this anime if you are not latin or if you don't know spanish and don't know about mexicain culture. But if you do, like me, you'll find this anime extremely funny, and you can rewatch it forever. 
 
NOTE: This review is based only on the latin-dubbed version. I did not watch it in japanese, but I don't think it was bad in Japan.

          
 
       Helpful I guess most of us watched this with Spanish (Latin American) dub, then! Most jokes and dialogues changed, but it was for good. No idea how it is in Japanese, but I guess it's full of Japanese jokes and popular culture. 
 
Either way, this anime is one of the most hilarious I've ever watched, it's so full of energy, and all characters are very very likable. I wish it lasted longer though, since they promised us a 2nd season that got canceled. It's funny to think this is way more popular overseas than in its own original country. 
 
One of the very very very few times I'll recommend any dub. If you know Spanish well and think you can understand all the Mexican jokes (I'm not even Mexican and I got most of them!), please watch it. Every episode has 3 short sub episodes, so watching it doesn't get heavy at all. 
 
Oh, and the rewatch value is very very very very high. I've watched some episodes like 5 times, and I still find them hilarious.

Story: This lacks any form of coherent story, so I can't really give this a high score... but believe me, the craziness is what matters here. 
 
Art: Personally as a kid I loved it! And I still do. It fits perfectly with this anime, but I guess sometimes the drawing style gets a little lazy. Oh, but the character design is amazing! 
 
Sound: I can't really remember well the BGM, but the opening and endings are great. Energetic opening and calm ending, I really liked that. 
 
Character: The characters are the best, they're all so likable. They're all so weird and have their extremely sick obsessions. You'll definitely feel more normal watching this.

Ok, enough of that before I get accuse of trolling, what we have here is the 2nd season of the parent anime ""Utapri,' so far only a few things have change but the anime as a whole still focuses on the musical genre, so how did I rate every category of this anime? Here's how: 
 
 
Story: Fair 6, I need you....S.... 
 
I would have given it a 5, but due to some minor yet nice changes this part should be fair enough. 
 
 
Art: Good 7, I feel you....T.... 
 
Let's face it, in this anime the art is on the character's sense of fashion, though it good, it was to elaborate and elegant for a commoner like me to comprehend. 
 
Sound: Very Good 8, I kiss you ...R... 
 
Like I said, this anime is more on the musical genre so therefore the plot is only an added bonus, and I mast say I like all the songs in this anime and so as the seiyuu's who sung it. I also like Nanami's seiyuu as well and Shinning Saotome's over exaggerated tone. 
 
Character: Good 7 , I believe you....I.. 
 
Ok, Nanami maybe the driving force of STARISH, but it was the guys who has the most contribution with this anime's feature, though I could have given this  part a 5, it was the introduction of Cecil Aijima that has added to the flair of the group. There is also the Sempais; Ranmaru Kurosaki,Ai Mikaze ,Reiji Kotobuki and Camus as well as the ""Heavens"", Ēichi Ōtori , Nagi Mikado and Kira Sumeragi who seem to be just a bunch of pretty face that were added for additional antagonist of the protagonist, We're Heaven,  Yes We're Heavens. 
 
Enjoyment: Very Good 8 ,  I hold you... S... 
 
Not bad for an otome game to have a 2nd season, though the plot is lackluster, it was the songs that carry this anime's enjoyment. 
 
Overall: Great 9,   I want you... H...  
 
Though there are some predictability in this anime, studio A1 did a good job on this anime's songs and episode theme, the end.

       Helpful UtaPri2 leaves UtaPri1 in its DUST. 
 
I remember UtaPri1 being a little hard to follow - you were immediately launched into the story, there were colourful bishies everywhere (making things a little harder to concentrate) and characters were difficult to keep up with (I always got Masato and Tokiya mixed up). But as UtaPri1 came to an end, I kind of wanted to watch more. 
 
I found UtaPri2 to be mindblowingly brilliant. From the first to last episode, I really enjoyed it. There's at least one episode dedicated to each member of STARISH; the storyline is a lot more gripping; character development is much improved; the animation is bright, cheery and colourful; and most of the songs are plain awesome. Especially the OP. (In my opinion, best OP EVER. It's fabulous. OHMYDAYS I LOVE IT. If you haven't watched the anime yet, go watch this OP.) I also found a lot of it to be very, very funny (and it takes a lot for me to laugh at an anime). 
 
A little more on character development - the talented, bright-eyed, slightly emotional, slightly ditzy, majorly airheaded heroine doesn't change all that much - one thing I've noticed with this season is that she becomes a lot more confident, and is no longer afraid to put her foot down and stand up for herself. As for the bishies in this reverse-harem, we all see a load more of character development from them all, but I don't want to spoil anything. 
 
All in all, it's a very happy anime. It has its cheesy moments, but what's a good anime without them? If you don't like bishies, bright colours, musicals, reverse-harem, or otome-to-anime-adaptions, this anime is not for you. 
 
But even if it's not - you should know that the battle of the bands arc at the end is AMAZING. I still have the chills. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
OVERALL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
STORY: 9/10: I liked the storyline a lot! Much improved from season one. 
 
ART: 9/10: The art is very colourful and well-thought-out, and many of the character's outfits have a lot of interesting details. 
 
SOUND: 10/10: The OP. I never skipped it. Not even once. As for the rest of the songs, we see a variety of genres spanning the series, and I'm sure at least one of them will appeal to your tastes. 
 
CHARACTER: 8/10: Again, the character development was very well done; however, nearly all personalities are a little cliché to that of your typical reverse-harem, otome-to-anime-adaption, shoujo anime. But for an otome-to-anime adaption, character development was really good. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 8/10: What can I say? I love bishies, bishies being kawaii, bishies being hilarious, bishies singing beautifully, bishies being passionate and bishies wearing colourful pretty things. 
I Am Sane. 
Seriously though. I really love this season. The funny moments, the music, the characters all made it explode into a happy pulse (you'll get that last bit when/if you watch all 13 episodes.) 
 
OVERALL: 10/10: TEN! (Are you ready?) NINE! (Are you ready?) EIGHT! (Are you ready?) SEVEN! SIX! FIVE! (Are you ready?) FOUR! (Are you ready?) THREE! (Are you ready?) TWO! ONE! 
 
... ... ... Yeah, I kinda liked it.

          
 
       Helpful ""The award for cheesiest anime ever goes to Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love 2000%."" 
 
STORY: 
The story of the first season was pretty straight-forward, while this season has a bit more going on at a time. I felt that this season was a lot more exciting and had more to offer story-wise. It definitely helps that they give you a better look into the guys' lives by having them deal with their various jobs based on their specialties(acting, modeling, etc), and having them overcome their problems. I felt it focuses a bit more on the guys than Haruka, than season 1 did, but maybe that's just me. 
If you love the cheesiness of the anime...  you will absolutely LOVE the ending. It's the cheesiest thing ever to be thought of by humankind. 
 
ART: 
The art of UtaPri is always beautiful and colorful. Not only the colors, but even just the shapes are beautiful. I really quite love how they draw the males in particular, because they aren't too girly or too manly. Their eyes aren't too big or too small. Their faces are nice and shapely, without being too detailed/manly. They're just perfect to me. 
The one thing that bothers me(and probably many others), is Haruka's eyes. They are boringly generic and too big/wide in shape compared to the guys, but the colors... I wonder what made them think that neon puke-green and laser-lemon yellow would look ok on someone's iris... Well, at least it's... unique? I quite like how her hair is not quite pink, and not quite orange... More like a neon salmon color? 
I do find the blond hair colors in this anime to be too yellow, well, unless they are supposed to be yellow rather than blond. 
I'm quite fond of Tokiya's hair. That subtle indigo color is really one of my favorites for hair. 
Also note, there are a LOT of sparkles and ""glitter"" effects in this anime. That either makes a scene look beautiful, or makes it look corny, or a mix of both. 
 
SOUND: 
Of all of the music-oriented anime I have watched, UtaPri has the most songs on my playlist. They are genuinely catchy and well-made. Naturally, the lyrics are cheesy, but hey, it sounds GOOD, and that's all that matters to me. The opening to both season 1 and 2 are both wonderful, with vocals done by Tokiya's sexy and incredibly-talented voice actor, Mamoru Miyano.  
All of the characters' voices are beautiful in song and have their own unique sound to them so none of them sound the same and you can tell who's singing what line. I definitely prefer Shou's voice when he sings in softer tone, than the usual cheerful tone, though. 
I personally quite like how Tokiya's and Masato's voice sound together in the ending theme. 
If you love vocal music, you will probably LOVE the music in this. The singing skills of the voice actors are incredible. 
 
CHARACTER: 
The only reason I did not rate this 10, was because of Haruka's boringness and passiveness. I'm also not fond of her high-pitched falsetto voice.  
Of course, that isn't enough to keep me from enjoying this anime. The personalities of all the male characters more than balances it out. 
One thing I like about the males, is that they aren't 100% stereotypical tropes from every anime. They are mixes of different tropes and might have subtle bits of this or that personality, and best of all, they compliment each other. One thing I like about Utapri that most other otome genre anime lacks, is that the guys actually interact with each other... they get along with each other and become close friends, or they compete and have rivalries. At the same time, there are some that do have their conflicts with each other, such as Ren and Masato, and that gives them a pretty deep character development, or as deep as Otome candidates can get. 
The heroine is not stealing all of their attention 100% of the time, and she's more like a supporting character or friend to the guys, but also not cast aside as she has very important roles. I think that's one of the things that makes a typically boring heroine enjoyable/bearable in an otome anime, so you can't completely hate her. 
The addition of a new band member also adds excitement as we learn about him and what he must face, along with how he will interact with others(he was in the first season, but had never met the guys until now). 
Along with the new band member, there are also the 4 new characters who act as the bands' mentors. I couldn't really get a taste for the two taller ones as they felt too similar personality-wise to each other, but I really loved the shorter two, especially Mikaze(though they do not reveal his uhh secret in the anime, but you may have guessed it if you notice how he talks). 
Also, just like in season 1, the headmaster voiced by Norio Wakamoto is in this series. He is as flamboyant as he was in season 1, so that keeps the series as fabulous, if not more, than season 1. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I gave this a 10 because, well, it was enjoyable. I loved every minute of every episode, and there were some times where I could not stop laughing due to the pure cheesiness of it all. Even when there wasn't anything particularly funny or cheesy going on, it was always exciting and had something happening. I enjoyed it all, both the serious and funny moments. The music is really exciting to watch in the anime as well. 
I actually liked this a lot more than the first season. The character development goes on and beyond, and the guys even get jobs and struggle with their past or whatever. 
 
OVERALL: 
I definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a light-hearted and fun anime, even guys may find they enjoy it at least for the character development, music, or even just to make fun of the cheesy humor.

0,139,74,4.499444021968386,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island Final,"Continuing with their adventure at Greed Island, Gon and Killua train furiously under the guidance of Biscuit for better preparation at attempting the game. With their abilities vastly improving and the threat of player killers menacing Greed Island, Gon and company continue the game despite the dangers that they will face with the game activities and encounters with other players. Based on the manga by Togashi Yoshihiro.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Super Power', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']",none,"Ah, a masterpiece. Hunter x Hunter overall is just a blessing that keeps me glued to the screen and away from my responsibilities. This review is aimed at two groups of people: those who are planning to watch this after finishing the rest of the old adaptation, and those who have watched the new 2011 adaptation and are thinking about watching this. These are probably the two biggest groups of people looking into this OVA.  
 
The story is very similar, almost exactly, to the story of the manga or the new adaptation. For those who are watching it for the first time, it covers Gon, Killua, and Bisky's journey as they work towards finishing the game. There are a lot of complicated nen battles and in all honesty, it's best watched in one go. While this arc is one of the less popular and certainly not my absolute favorite (that would be Yorknew) it has a lighter feel to it than any of the arcs (excluding the exam arc) do. It focuses more on Gon and Killua's growth and the logistics of the complicated game, as well as the real advances in Gon's plan to find his father. Overall, I personally found it rather heartwarming and a really good training/growth arc for all the characters.  
 
Throughout the course of the OVAs, the art has only improved. Granted, it's still nothing compared to the 2011 adaptation, obviously, but it's gorgeous in a timeless way. Personally, even as someone who doesn't watch 'older' anime often, I forgot the animation was even 'outdated'. It's very smooth and detailed, and it's easy to tell how much effort went into it.  
 
In the beginning, the opening and closing seemed off to me and I didn't like them at all, but by the end of the 14 episodes, they had grown on me and I'd become attached. It's not music I would listen to on my own time, but it was something almost nostalgic and it will forever remain in my memory like a warm blanket. As for the background music, I think it was well done. Nothing ever seemed out of place to me.  
 
I think the characters and their growth were the most important to this arc overall. Hisoka is shortly at the front and center once more, but his ambiguity of character and swaying loyalties are highlighted in this OVA, creating another layer to him that warns the fans to never rely on him. Being a Hisoka fan, I've always appreciated this grey area of his character and enjoyed this aspect a lot. Gon and Killua undergo a lot of development as well. While some may argue that this is just a training arc, it's momentous for their relationship as they begin to trust eachother through anything (not that they didn't before) and grow in their abilities considerably. I've seen some argue that Killua, who was formerly much more powerful than Gon, has taken a lesser role in this OVA, but I think it suits his personality. He belongs in the shadows, he watches and waits, while Gon jumps ahead and is rather impulsive. That's how they work together, and that's what this OVA develops.  
 
I binged this in around a day, the only thing getting in my way being my other irl responsibilities, unfortunately. Despite having seen the 2011 adaptation, this was still such a fun ride, and there were even things I didn't expect, even the second time around. It was just very entertaining and heartwarming overall, and I would definitely watch this again and try to get more of my friends addicted to it.  
 
I would recommend this if you: liked any other OVA or adaptation of HxH, liked the manga, like full immersion MMORPG anime, like massive-scale games, like 'training'/development arcs 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like any other adaptation or OVA of HxH, like more 'plot heavy' arcs, dislike 'training' arcs  
 
Have a great day everyone! 

          
 
       Helpful At last, I have arrived at the finale of my reviews of Hunter X Hunter 1999 and its OVAs. Kinda pissed me off that I had to release them during a time I had said I’d be doing nothing but Gundam reviews, but whatever. Sadly however, these OVAs did not end on a good note, as the final events of the 1999 Version of the Greed Island arc are… well, not very good to say the least. 
 
Final Arc: Greed Island FINAL (Episodes 79-92): 
 
After we got the first part of Greed Island covered in an agonizingly slow pace, this time around they rush through the arc as fast as possible! I am not kidding you, folks, they straight up start skipping scenes and condensing events by this OVA. It makes me realize how hypocritical 1999’ fandom can be at times, as they complain when the 2011 Version skips scenes, yet when this one does so, no one even cares. Yes, I know that the thing people generally complain about the 2011 Version omitting is the Kite scene, but the point still stands that this OVA is just as guilty of that. 
 
On the plus side, Greed Island’s story is generally solid due to the foundation it’s built upon, so they can’t screw it up that badly. The constant power struggles and twists are engaging, and Gon and Killua’s training does serve its purpose quite well. Similarly it takes more time to develop the characters that were introduced in the previous OVA. Now, characters that seemed bland like Tsezguerra now become much more fleshed out. I also admit to liking the Arc’s main villain, Genthru. He’s simple, sure, but I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. After the more complex Gen’Ei Ryodan, it’s nice to have a villain who is simply an asshole for the sake of it. 
 
The problem is that this is 1999’s finale, which makes it another Gecko Ending, and a real one at that as Nippon Animation didn’t even bother animating the Chimera Ant Arc, and frankly I get the feeling they had no plans to do so, as the final episode ends with a montage of all of the previously seen characters going around doing their business and Gon seemingly meeting his father… except if you’ve read the Manga you know that THAT’S NOT GING! That’s Kite. So basically the show can’t even end with Gon meeting his father! At least the 2011 Version had the decency to end on that note, even if it did cause Kurapika’s character arc to remain inconclusive, but the same goes for this show (Though I do hold out for the hope that Madhouse will give the series another go once the Succession War Arc ends… whenever it ends, that is). 
 
Animation: 
 
While the story in this OVA is fine, the presentation is not. This OVA is UGLY. The first half is hideously off-model, and things barely even move. The second half by contrast just looks mediocre, having absolutely no substance whatsoever. People complain about how bright the Madhouse Version is, but this version is no better with that. In fact, it’s even worse. At least Madhouse version used legitimately bright colors. This one has dark colors that are ran through a shitty computer that increases the brightness of everything. And keep in mind, this OVA came after the 2003 Version of Fullmetal Alchemist AND on the same year as Gankutsuou. People had figured out Digital Animation by this point! 
 
Sound: 
 
It’s basically 1999’ soundtrack, with none of the best tracks, and the few new ones were sorely forgettable. The songs are fine, but nothing here left an impact on me. On the plus side, both the Opening  “Believe In Tomorrow” and the Ending theme “Moshimo Kono Sekai de Kimi to Boku ga Deaenakatta Nara” are quite nice. Nowhere near my favorites, but they’re otherwise harmless. 
 
Voice Acting: 
 
This was Kaida Yuki, Takeuchi Junko and Mitsuhashi Kanako’s last chance to do anything with their characters, and while they do a fine job, they’ve done a better job before. Takeuchi’s version of Gon’s Jajanken scream in particular is a disappointment for me. It’s all done very quickly, with none of the buildup Han Megumi’s version has. Also, for some reason Higuchi Chieko didn’t return to voice Bisky, instead the role being given to Kimura Akiko. She does a fine enough job and I do prefer her over Higuchi, but the fact the change was done at all confuses me. Beside them, there’s also Yoshino Hiroyuki, Yusa Kouji, Nojima Hirofumi and Toriumi Kosuke. Oh, and Koyama Tsuyoshi’s Genthru is frustratingly dull. 
 
Overall: 
 
Needless to say, I was not satsifyed. With adaptations of an already visual medium, the presentation is extremely important, as if it’s not good, why not just experience the original source? It’s the reason why people are so critical of One Punch Man’s second season, and the same applies to this OVA. It is the most soulless adaptation of Greed Island one could possibly get, and I cannot recommend it. 
 
Final Score: 5/10 
 
And finally, my final thoughts on Nippon Animation’s Hunter X Hunter as a whole. This is not the perfect adaptation of the manga so many claim it is. While it is great whenever it is being dark and foreboding, it falls flat on its face whenever adapting a more lighthearted plot. Sadly, Greed Island is one of the show’s more lighthearted arcs, and to say it didn’t adapt it well would be an understatement. I’m sorry, but I can’t say it is better that Madhouse’s version. That one could be dark, that one could be lighthearted, that one could be anything it wanted! Here, the show can only be dark to be good, and as I stated before, the dark elements aren’t all that makes Hunter X Hunter a great show. It’s still overall pretty good, but a lackluster final arc does bring it down for me.

","Ah. Well. Let's cut to the chase. If anything I'm a defender of the Dragon Ball Z movies. It's a simple series that shouldn't be that difficult to write for, and a decent portion of the non-canon material has contributed cool new characters to the franchise and worked just as well as some of the better moments of the canon material. Yet even though Dragon Ball Z requires little more than ultra violence, an intimidating villain, an appropriate use of the existing cast, and well-choreographed fights, a few of these movies have failed to gather all of these things in a single entry. The ""Broly trilogy"" are universally some of the worst attempts at Dragon Ball Z movies. They're cut a lot of slack for introducing Broly who's a popular fan favorite character even though everything else about them is very weak. To be fair, Broly is one of the best new villains the movies introduced. He fits that earlier requirement of being very intimidating, and he's one of the few important non-canon Saiyans. 
 
But the first Broly movie was mostly an incredibly long, boring exposition with a dull climactic fight where everyone just gets beaten to death until Goku suddenly turns it around with no suspense whatsoever. The next movie somehow got worse, as superior characters Goku, Gohan, and future Trunks were all basically gone. Gohan settled things halfway through the movie, and everything before that is terrible slapstick and some more literal slapping as Goten and Trunks tease Broly and get their asses kicked for it. Not before pissing on him and ruining whatever goodwill Broly's coolness factor gave to him, though. In the stunning conclusion to one of cinema's greatest trilogies, an old rich rival of Hercule challenges him to come fight against his army of genetically-engineered creepy alien warriors, threatening to reveal Hercule wet the bed once as a kid if he refuses. It's riveting stuff, and since our heroine Android 18 was there valorously blackmailing Hercule into paying her millions for throwing the world martial arts championship she decides to tag along. And so do Goten and Trunks, because for some reason these derivative silly kid characters must be really popular in Japan. 
 
Well, it turns out that the annoying shaman from the previous Broly movie stole a frozen sample of his blood and somehow knew Hercule's rival would be interested in obtaining it to make another bio-warrior. So because of this moron Broly is back and in Goten's words ""the whole universe is in danger!"" This time Broly is looking rather pathetic, nothing more than a big, dripping green vomit man with a few golden locks sticking out of the back of his head being the only thing reminding you that this is Broly. Depending on your point of view, it could be considered less humiliating than being pissed on by a little kid. Regardless, not even the writers can take the threat of Broly seriously at this point. The token character to come in and save the day is Krillin of all people, and as always he fails and does nothing to change the situation. Meanwhile huge mounds of purple goop from the bio-warrior factory is spilling out and melting everything in sight. It takes Goten and Trunks far too long to realize they're obviously not going to beat Broly, just like they couldn't beat him last time at the same power level. Trunks comes up with the idea to spill some of the ovulating ooze onto Broly and melt him. Because apparently this man-made sludge is stronger than super-powered space aliens. Too bad they couldn't just throw this stuff on Frieza! 
 
Against all common sense, Trunks's plan succeeds and Broly dies a shameful death, changing his ice cream flavor from lemon-lime to the inferior grape. But wait, obviously the grape juice absorbs Broly's power and now, according to the presumably genius scientist who invented it, nothing can stop it and the world is doomed etc. Moments later it turns out seawater, one of the most basic substances on Earth, turns all the goop to stone for some reason. But wait! A giant Broly rises out of the sludge! And then promptly becomes stone. Well, all things considered that was pretty easy. No one is stronger, no lessons learned, and one of Dragon Ball Z's few victories won without brute force doesn't even make sense. 
 
Well, I learned my lesson, albeit a bit too late. Don't watch Bio-Broly. But of course you're going to watch Bio-Broly, you're probably reading this because you're like me and don't want to put those hundreds of episodes and $12 figurines from your childhood to waste. Even if you're interested in Bio-Broly for the lore, it's a waste because it's referenced by almost no other Dragon Ball Z media. I've never even seen one of the video games use Bio-Broly's appearance. This is the only Dragon Ball Z movie that's been practically erased from the franchise's history, and for good reason: it has nothing to offer. Unless you really like Hercule. At least there's no post-grunge music in the dub this time around. The final scene of the movie straight up shoves its butt into the audience's face, as the dead Goku is told that Broly is literally raising Hell and King Kai wants Goku and Pikkon to stop him. This sets up yet another unwanted Broly sequel that ironically wasn't made for once, and also ironically sounds like a far more interesting scenario than what we got. Still, please don't come back, Broly.

          
 
       Helpful Being the third title featuring the legendary super saiyan Broly, this one did not disappoint. 
 
Story - The story takes place during the Buu Saga (but does not in any way, co-exist with the main plot of this particular saga) and shows the aftermath of what happened after the fight between Hercule and Android 18. After some of Hercule's pleading and screaming and Android 18's demanding of what she was promised, Hercule finally comes to an agreement, only if she helps Hercule out with a matter of his own. This is where the actual story happens here. During the trip to this mysterious island, Jaguar (long term rival of Hercule) introduces Hercule to his bio-warriors but they are quickly defeated due to Android 18, Goten and Trunks (who sneaked in). Anyway, without spoiling anything any further, Goten and Trunks encounter Broly inside a pod and that is when things get really interesting. 
 
Art - Just like what you would expect from any DBZ episode. 
 
Sound - Pretty much what I said above. 
 
Character - This was an interesting move to pull off. The characters are not any of the main characters you would expect to see in a DBZ movie. Except they are the characters that you would most likely see in the sideline. So there are no surprise appearences from Goku, Vegeta, Gohan or Piccolo.  
Android 18, Goten and Trunks are the main characters for this film....I guess Hercule can be included as a main character, but I just see him as the comical relief more than anything :P 
 
Enjoyment - I enjoyed my experience watching this film, regardless of what other people might say, this one does not have a bad story, it doesn't suck. 
 
Overall - Adding on from my previous comments. This movie doesn't suck, its good, nothing that will change your whole perspective of the DBZ universe though. All the things you would expect from the DBZ show/movies are all there. Comical relief due to Hercule, great fight scenes and all that.

          
 
       Helpful Being a long time Dragon Ball Z fan, I will try not to allow my bias affect my review for this film. However Dragon Ball Z has always produced a long line of low grade straight-to-DVD films, with this film being no exception, however while a lot of the Dragon Ball Z films are well worth watching, this one however does not make the cut. With a mediocre story and very little character development, (a hallmark of a Dragon Ball Z movie), followed by a continuation of the Broly story arc which should have stopped at Second Coming, Bio-Broly will have you wanting those 50 minutes of your life back.

       Helpful Okay... I'm just going to get right into it. If you're wondering whether or not the sequel is worth watching, i'll be blunt. It is and it isn't. Don't worry, no spoilers, However I will explain why.  
 
First the reasons to watch it;  
 
A.) The plot follows as it should and sticks to the manga. 
 
B.) The characters don't change so much that you don't recognize them. 
 
C.) The character development is just like the original, but a bit more violent. 
 
D.) You get to further immerse yourself into the story with beautiful animations. 
 
Now the reasons not to watch it; 
 
A.) There is huge time skips that will leave you feeling lost, aka 30-100 chapters skipped. 
 
B.) If you're hoping to see a lot of previous characters, you will be a bit disappointed. 
 
C.) Lots of throw-away characters that you'll probably never see again. 
 
D.) At the rate the anime is going, you'll be left wondering what happened, 12 episodes is NOT enough for this much material. 
 
And that's a small sum to take into account on why you should or shouldn't watch this anime. The rest i'll leave for you to decide. Enjoy or Don't enjoy, the choice is always yours. 

          
 
       Helpful For those of you who went in watching UQ blindly, it is about as decent as other medicore animes from past years. I wouldn't really recommend it though as it is a rushed adapation, but like I said it's not the best and if you think it's worthy of your time then go for it. 
 
 
Now for the fans of the Negima! series. It was a horrible journey am I right? I admit there were good nostalgic scenes that made me happy (seeing class 3-A again with all their pactio transformations, oh especially Natsumi with her artifact!), but overall... no words can describe my feelings for this adapation I over-hyped about. But if you are reading this review, I congratulate you and thank you for your service. We should all atleast give a small appreciation for this adapatation for happening, even though we have very high negativity for a poor adapatation.  
 
But hey, if you all think about it, this could just be one of the many different worlds that could have taken place. No? Yeah I know, it's just me being optimistic as possible.

I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how well it compares to the original source material, but based off the 25 episode series I can safely say that there's a lot of humour and fun to enjoy, even if there is some repetition. 
 
The only thing that I found jarring was that sometimes the framerate for 3D shots was sub 23.97fps which gave it an awkward flicker effect. Early reviewers from Japan are saying the DVD doesn't have this issue, so I'll leave that down to encoding (from downloads) and how far away I was when receiving it via satellite (Japan to the UK) 
 
It's a shame there's no distributors lined up to take this show to an international audience, but the DVDs are available (Currently about $25 per 2 episodes 28/03/2016)

Sure, we all know the Transformers franchise only exists for purely one thing; 'to sell toys', but that doesn't really bother me. I still have my very own Beast Wars toys from when I was a kid if I may be honest. You can say all what you want, but I still do like the Beast Wars franchise - even though it's sadly discontineud. 
 
Story: 7/10 (Good) 
 
After the events of Beast Wars II with the dissapearance of the troops of Lio Convoy, many eons(?) later, Big Convoy gets assigned new crew members as Maximals (Cybertrons) to collect the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universe. This won't be an easy tast, since Magmatron's troops that are the new Predacons (Destrons) have their own purposes in collecting the Angelmois energy capsules. 
 
Caution: This anime relies a bit more on it's parent story named ""Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers"" then the previous season Beast Wars II. But I assume if you're a Beast Wars fan, you would probbably already know that the Beast Era story line is just a side story from the original Transformers line.  
 
Art: 7/10 (Good) 
 
For a show that aired in 1999 the art is pretty decent to say the least. You could say nowadays it's a bit outdated, but for a 1999 show I think it still passes. Compaired with the previous season Beast Wars II and the spin-off movie, I can say animation wise it's a much better improvement for sure. Transformation scenes aren't that re-used anymore compaired with previous installments and you will see some alternatieve transformation footage through the series which is a huge step-up compaired with Beast Wars II. Really, I don't have much complaints at all.  
 
Sound: 6/10 (Fine) 
 
Sound wise not much is improved compaired with the previous season and side story movie, but it still get's the job done. It's just a bit of a shame the intro song and the ending song doesn't get changed over the 35 episodes (32 episodes and 3 clip-shows) for this series. 
 
Character: 6/10 (Fine) 
 
Compaired with the previous season, I personally find it a slighty downgrade compaired with Beast Wars II. Let me hear me out. I liked the charathers in Beast Wars II slighty better than the charathers in this anime. For example: I find the Maximals Stampy and Break personallity wise they are almost equal with each other and I'm not a big fan of Heinrad iether. From all the charathers; I find the Predacons has the most interessing charathers for sure. I do like the Predacons named Dead End and Sling the most. Oh and our cute tsundere D-Navi that aids the Predacons. 
 
Here's a small summery of the main charathers in the show: 
 
Maximals: 
* Big Convoy: The leader of the Maximals. Can transform into a  woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) 
* Longrack: The most serious one of the bunch. Can transform into a giraffe. 
* Colada: Rather wants to work alone. Prefers hot envoirements. Can transform into a cobra. 
* Stampy: A bit of coward compaired with other Maximals. Can transform into a rabbit. 
* Break: Looses it's patience very fast. Prefers cold envoirements. Can transform into an emperor pinguin. 
* Heinrad: He's the mellow one of the group and the most Japanese cultured of the group. Can transform into a tanuki (Japanese folklore creature). 
 
* Navi-chan: a talking computer that aids the Maximals in finding the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universes. 
 
Predacons: 
 
* Magmatron: The leader of the Predacons. Is a combiner Transformer between three differnt Mesozoic reptiles. 
* Guiledart: The right hand of Magmatron. Can transform into a Triceratops. 
* Saberback: Often mocks Sling. Can transform into a Stegosaurus. 
* Sling: Often gets used for comedic purposes. Can transform into a Dimetrodon. 
* Dead End: Doesn't like team work. Can transform into an ammonite. 
 
* D-Navi: a talking computer similair like Navi-chan, but she's a bit of a cute tsundere and her design is differnt. 
 
Other charathers gets introduced trough the series aswell just like previous entries. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
 
Did I enjoy this anime afterall? Yes I did. I'm very glad I could finally completed the final missing piece of the Beast Era. I personally preffer this story line than the bullshit story we have gotten with Beast Machines here in the West. It just makes much more sense. Yes, I'd like to pretend Beast Machines never happend. Even today. 
 
Overall: 7/10 (Good) 
 
If you're a Beast Wars fan you would enjoy this piece of content for sure. Even with it's obvious flaws, I think it did a much better job than *shudders* the Beast Era ending we have gotten in the west with Beast Machines.

The day his father died he left his home to find the people from the town his father told him. Together with a small bear named Koro he starts the journey an runs into a great adventure fighting against Grunwald and his subordinates who want to rule the world. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Magic']","Set in an unspecified northern kingdom in ancient Norway, the film opens with the young Horus (aka Hols, voiced by Hisako Ōkata in Japanese and Billie Lou Watt in English) attempting to fight off a pack of ""silver wolves,"" and accidentally waking up an ancient stone giant, named Mogue (or Rockoar in some editions of the film). Horus succeeds in pulling a splinter from the giant's shoulder, which transpires to be a rusty and ancient sword. The giant proclaims this to be the ""Sword of the Sun,"" promising also that when the sword has been reforged, he will come to Horus, who will then be called ""Prince of the Sun"".
Horus' father, on his deathbed, reveals that their family came from a northern seaside village, which was devastated by the terrifying ice devil Grunwald, leaving them the only survivors. Before dying, Horus' father urges his son to return to the land of his birth and avenge the village.
On his journey, Horus and his companion, a bear named Koro, are soon confronted by Grunwald, who plunges the boy from a cliff when Horus refuses to serve him. Horus survives the fall and is rescued by the inhabitants of a nearby village. Horus soon becomes a heroic figure when he kills an enormous pike which had been threatening the lives and livelihoods of this fishing community.
The pike was a ploy of Grunwald's, who then sends the silver wolves to attack the village instead. In the battle that follows, Horus and Koro chase the wolves to a deserted village, where he meets a mysterious young girl named Hilda. Horus takes Hilda back to his village, where her beautiful singing is welcomed by the villagers, with the exception of the chief, who is increasingly resentful of Horus' popularity, and his deputy, Drago. Hilda, who is actually Grunwald's sister and under his evil influence, later collaborates with Drago and sends a swarm of rats to attack the village (in the original Japanese version, Grunwald wanted Horus to be his brother before he plunged Horus down the cliff; this ties in with Horus' first encounter with Hilda and her comment on how they both share the same fate that they're like twins). Drago frames Horus for his own failed attempt to assassinate the chief, and the villagers banish Horus.
Horus sets out in search of Grunwald, but is confronted by Hilda, and the owl who acts as messenger between Hilda and Grunwald. With her true identity revealed, Hilda reluctantly attacks Horus, who falls into a chasm and becomes trapped in an enchanted wood, where he is haunted by visions of the villagers and his father. Grunwald then sends Hilda, against her wishes, to kill Horus, and makes his own attack on the village, together with his wolves and a giant ice mammoth.
Horus is able to escape from the enchanted forest when he realizes that the sword must be reforged as a collective effort and that the villagers must unite in order to defeat Grunwald. After a brief fight with Hilda, who is thoroughly remorseful about her involvement in Grunwald's plan, Horus rejoins the villagers in their battle and uses the raging fires they ignited in their defense to reforge the sword. With the ""Sword of the Sun"" reforged, he is soon joined by the stone giant Mogue. Together they defeat and destroy Grunwald. Hilda, who had given her magical ""Medal of Life"" to aid Horus, finds that she is still alive without it, and rejoins Horus and the villagers.
","Well, this is a really really old video and let’s say that for its time, it might have been very high class but now, it feels like it lacks a lot. The animation is low quality and the voices feel forced and scripted.  
 
Horus seems to not think about what he is about to do, his heart being in the right place but his head just doesn’t seem to be happening there. He was made to be the purest of the pure but they made him come out as a rather young child, younger then he should be. Other characters randomly sing and makes it feel like we are in a old Disney movie.  
 
The animation is really old and they cut corners constantly. They reuse clips a lot and also jump around without any explanation on why they are except that they are travelling. Both people and animals look rather blotchy and not a lot of detail. In order to not animate some of the faces, they are covered in thick bushes of hair from eyebrows and beards.  
 
The script sounds cheesy in the English version, where the voice actors feel as though they are just reading lines. It’s rather narrative and descriptive in the beginning and then loses a lot of that as the story goes on, not explaining enough when it needs to later on. It feels like it should have been much shorter. They did do a good job matching the voices though so it does get some props for that.  


          
 
       Helpful This was a rather pleasant surprise, honestly. 'Horus/Hols' may not be the most elegant film, but it is certainly a testament to the sheer amount of talent found within the development team. With surprisingly fleshed-out characters and plotlines, accompanied by pretty competent artwork + sound, this relic will be sure to last in your mind for a bit. 
 
[Story - 7] 
 
The first 10-or-so minutes are pretty basic, admittedly: boy finds sword, is told of a demon, then is sent off to kill it after his father dies. After that, however, it takes a turn: he's almost immediately defeated by the demon, and is informally saved + adopted by a village by the river. Here, he makes a little home for himself after slaying some beasts and whatnot. 
 
Still sounds tame? I don't blame you, it definitely feels like that. However, then comes the second half of the movie: While out on a hunt, our protagonist Horus encounters a mysterious girl named Hilda. At first, she just seems like a plain love interest who can sing and whatnot, but she is soon revealed to be something of an anti-villain.  
 
After subtle sabotage that causes a storm to blow over, Horus finds his resolve and goes off to slay the demon. And, of course, he does and there is a happy ending. However, the road leading to it is teeming with themes of struggling with social dynamics, against fate, and with your own desires. It's pretty solid for a kids' movie, especially from the late 60's. 
 
[Art - 8] 
 
The art is also rather intriguing, and probably the reason most of you will go and watch this. It might not have aged as well in terms of animation (there's one notable action sequence where it's a minute of freeze frames), but everything else remains timeless. The colour palette is mostly based in 'nature'-types, while the character design gravitates more towards an earthy-type of tone. The setting is also pretty convincing as a 'nordic'-type of fantasy world. The animation isn't even that bad save for that sequence: for the most part, every action is pretty fluid, and some (not all) of the lip syncing is on point. Truly impressive to see. 
 
[Sound - 8] 
 
The audiowork is also rather competent. The music can be rather melodramatic and Disney-esque at times, but it does the job well. I especially liked the 'village songs', as they really do suit the vibe that those scenes were going for. The SFX are also rather well-timed and consistent, and I failed to notice any noticeable mistakes. The voice-acting is pretty solid - while Horus sounds like a stereotypical shonen protagonist, Hilda has a rather haunting voice (both in song and speech). Grunwald and Drago sound like standard villains, but I'll let it pass since they didn't get a lot of screentime.  
 
[Character - 7] 
 
Definitely the most surprising aspect of the film. It might not be the precursor to 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' or whatever, but for what it represented during its time, the characterization is great. Horus is certainly not a deep character, or even /that/ interesting, but he does somewhat serve as the audience's proxy during the film: we share in his feelings and reactions to the plot twists, and to a noted degree. Grunwald and Drago are rather flat characters, but I can see how they helped influence the succeeding generations' villains: cunning, but ultimately lonely due to the weight of their power. 
 
The most iconic character, however, is the previously-mentioned Hilda. She's astonishingly well-written: as she struggles a lot with her own will to live, her want to socialize normally, her relationship with the antagonists, and so on/forth, you can see her breakdown happen over the course of the film. Of course, her betrayal of Horus is what pushes her the farthest into this, and even towards the end of the film, it influences her every action. Her fate at the end may not please everyone, but I found it rather heartwarming. 
 
[Enjoyment/Overall - 8] 
 
Ultimately, this was pretty fun. May not be the most polished thing, of course, but I'll blame that on the time period and standards of that period. Otherwise, it's a stellar movie that both children and adults can enjoy. I would recommend this to anyone, ESPECIALLY Miyazaki groupies.

          
 
       Helpful Imagine the King Arthur origin tale mixed with vague Beowulf elements, then filter that through Kurosawa-esque scenery, directing, and atmosphere, and Hols: Prince of the Sun is approximately what the result might end up like.  Although still owing to its Western influences a great deal, Hols: Prince of the Sun marks the beginning of a divergence from Western formulas and animation traditions though its embrace of comparatively Eastern themes and presentation, particularly in its cinematic formalism. 
 
While the level of detail may not be up to most expectations of the casual anime viewer, it should be noted that it more than makes up for this with its smoothness and frame rate.  The opening sequence alone will have any audience hooked as Horus beats off a pack of wolves—and is shot so as to be easily one of the most memorable opening sequences ever filmed.  This impeccable level of quality is maintained throughout the film with only a few exceptions.  
 
The theme music is memorable, though the rest of the soundtrack is rather forgettable and fairly typical of its time period.  It nonetheless suits the visuals it accompanies, regardless of its dated nature.  The few ""musical numbers"" that peek up are used as plot advancements and tone-setters rather than merely to spotlight frivolous musical interludes--and several of them are used to highlight character development.  Which brings me to the characters, who--while perhaps two-dimensional--are solidly written and developed within the context of their narrative purpose. 
 
Superficially, it isn’t hard to draw comparisons to the Golden Age of Disney animation; the smoothness and overall quality of the animation is spot-on, and the character models, settings, and color pallet are all reminiscent of Disney’s from the same time period.  But that’s where the comparisons end; although the story takes place in a Nordic-like environment in the West, the story remains centered around themes concerning death and vengeance, communal acceptance, and rejection that are largely developed through methods that owe more to Akira Kurosawa than to Walt Disney—specifically the overtly dark atmosphere that hangs about the whole work, and the general level of grimness present throughout the tale.   
 
Hols: Prince of the Sun is a landmark for Japanese animation.  It is perhaps best enjoyed by the audience it was intended for, as many contemporary anime fans will probably be turned off by its superficial resemblances to simpler animation, its dated quality, or the fact that it was produced as a children’s story.  However, this should not dissuade any fans of older animation or animation in general, as it stands on its own as a great story with interesting visuals regardless.

Drawn to their beautiful swimming, almost more like flying, Ruka and the adults who know them are intertwined in a complex mesh... 
  
Meanwhile, an unexplained anomaly is occurring all over the world: fish are disappearing. Thus begins a marine adventure of boys and girls to captivate all the senses!","['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural']",none,"For those that are curious, this is an animated adaption from the manga with the same name, beautifully illustrated by Igarashi Daisuke. For starters, I think the film was definitely ambitious, but in honesty was all round lacking in a sense that the director could not successfully portray the clarity within the material of the original work.  
 
 
STORY: (7/10) Five whole volumes of plot, filled with existentialistic concepts combining science fiction and supernatural themes, delicate portrayals of the relationship between the characters and the panoramas of sea life- all of these are condensed into a mere 111 minutes, a little less than two hours. Nevertheless, I applaud the teams' effort in trying to follow the footsteps of the manga with their universal and surrealistic message; However, if you are a manga reader like me, I suggest that you don't keep your hopes too high that every detail would be the same. Some scenes were replaced and rewritten in order to fit in the time frame, while others, I really don't understand the choices for such replacements. I also felt that some of the more important and emotional parts were cut out as well, which really takes away the overall tone and message of the manga. (eg, Sora and Umi's backstory with Jim and Anglade, which would have provided a LOT more insight towards their relationship with one another, as well as the plot of the story). 
Kaijuu no Kodomo is a free form of expression, but Ayumu Watanabe doesn't seem to be able to grasp onto what is needed in order for the film to have become successful. Overall a promising story which gradually loses it's way to mass targeting. If I had to make a comparison- the film made me think of Finding Nemo or some fantasy related ocean cartoon. I felt comfortable watching the film, and that was the problem; The ocean in the manga made me wonder, doubt, and fear the terrifying beauty of the depths of the sea, as well as the haunting panoramas of the marine life.  
 
 
ART: (8/10) The character designs stayed true to Igarashi's indie, sketchy style, which I was very delighted to see. Precisions and details elaborating on the eyes of the characters give more emotional depths to our understanding of their roles within the narrative. I could also say the same to the way the ocean and the marine life had been beautifully animated, especially during the ""festival"" and Umi's ""birth"". Movements are smooth and stylistically 'wonky', yet again possessing the sentiments of Igarashi's funkiness. I'd say the minor flaw in the art was the use of CGI, which were not the best ones I've seen- it kind of takes away the mysterious feeling of the ocean when you compare it to the manga. The ocean in the film makes everything seem all too welcoming and friendly, instead of haunting and dangerous. Nevertheless, the animation is definitely something worth praising, and it's rare to see water, and movement in the water being drawn so smoothly.  
 
 
MUSIC: (10/10) It's Joe Hisaishi, nothing can go wrong when it's him. He perfectly captured the oceanic vibes with his use of 'random number technique', and uses the same melody throughout important scenes, just with different variations. The brass instruments give off a more exotic feel and really captures the cultural aspects of the story, while the orchestra as a whole representing life within the sea. I am not a music expert, but his melodies never failed to provoke some emotional response within me.  
 
 
CHARACTERS: (6.5/10) That being said, major characters such as Jim, Anglade (ESPECIALLY ANGLADE!) and Dede were robbed of their spotlights in the film due to the limited time. They had their defining roles, but were reduced to such labels- Jim was a scientist who merely looked after Sora and Umi, Anglade cooked dinner and did some chores, and spouted some universal nonsense under the starlights, and Dede? She repeated the same 5 lines about 10 times in the film, then drove away on a boat without contributing much to the plot. I was especially disappointed to see that they have taken away so much of Anglade's charm, since he was one of the most important and intriguing characters of the story. Like Sora and Umi, he was an outsider, he was intelligent, sophisticated and complicated- yet they have made him into a pretty insignificant person in the film, cooked some fish then left.  
Likewise, Ruka's mother also did not get her backstory, which I felt would have helped a lot with explaining Ruka's natural attraction towards the water. I don't understand the reason for having Ruka's father replace Dede in the final scene when they went to rescue Ruka too. Perhaps this film focused a lot more on Ruka and her estrangement with her friends and family- but I quite liked the idea of her reconciling with the girl she knocked over in the beginning, which is anime exclusive. It somehow added another kind of sentiment and changed the narrative (in a good way), as if to relay the message that life moves on. With the people Ruka met during summer gone, it's like she was being welcomed back to her ordinary life (which in this case, you may argue that it takes away her eccentrics and the fact that she doesn't get along with everyone, but again, they're children).  
I had no major problems with the three protagonists, but somehow felt that they were all lacking the charm they had in the manga- the film took all their most obvious traits (Umi and his naivety, Sora and his otherworldliness, Ruka and her curiosity) and made them kind of one dimensional. Ruka in particular became more taciturn in some major scenes, instead of being her usual curious self regarding the two boys who, in the film, were a lot less preoccupied with one another.  
 
 
ENJOYMENT: (7 or 8/10) Again, this was a promising film considering that the manga was particularly a masterpiece. It's ambitious, it's creative, it could have created something new for the audience- but the choice of director has allowed it to lose its colour throughout the film. It's not as philosophical or complicated as the original material, but nevertheless attempts to recreate the same message in a very condensed animated version. However, I overall thought it was still quite enjoyable. For those that may find the film confusing or constantly feel like it's missing something, I really suggest that you read the manga first, as it will help you understand a lot of aspects and ideas they don't mention and explain in the film. The characters in the manga are portrayed with such raw emotions, and Igarashi miraculously writes their relationship with one another through such vertiginous depths that you can't help but love every single one of their quirks.  
I do suggest the film to those that may be interested, but only if you decide to read the manga as well. Trust me, you won't regret it!

          
 
       Helpful From the everyday, to the simple, to the surreal and eccentric, visually and audibly - Kaijuu no Kodomo was absolutely artistically stunning. The artistic visuals and beautifully composed music was the best part of the film. These two elements blended seamlessly to create such a vibrant and well-designed world, with use of colour and music really visualising different tones and environments perfectly.  
 
Ultimately though, Kaijuu no Kodomo was slightly disappointing. Leading up to this film's release in my country, I was pretty excited and anticipating a similar enjoyment to the first time I ever watched films like Wolf Children or Your Name. With their stunning artistic styles and soundtracks, I was expecting Kaijuu no Kodomo to join these two fantastic films in glory. Unfortunately it did not.  
 
What this film lacks in comparison is in its story-telling. With an almost hyper-focus on the stunning artistic visual and sound design of this film, what gets left behind is the capacity to tell a story effectively. The pacing was uneven, and the events were never really explained or developed in ways that could actively engage me in the story of the film itself. I found myself greatly anticipating the animation and visual aspects more, rather than the events that unfolded. It felt messy and it ended messy. 
 
The characters were all played effectively, with no particular issues or key moments that arose. The voice actors all performed well for what they were given.  
 
Overall, it was a beautiful piece of artwork but just a mediocre film.

          
 
       Helpful Kaijuu no Kodomo is a strange movie that I find doesn't really fit into the typical blockbuster mold. Your enjoyment will come directly from your ability to understand (or at least feel like you understand) what it is trying to say. Basically, you won't know whether you'll like or dislike this movie until you watch it, simply because of the experience depending so much on factors outside of the four categories of Story, Art, Sound or Character. 
 
STORY: The film conveys its messages as unclearly as possible - you might be able to follow what is happening on a surface level, but having an understanding of the symbolism is essential for not being confused at the film's climax or its conclusion. I was initially confused at what was happening, but as long as you have a working idea as to what the film is trying to say you will be engaged. The film certainly doesn't shy away from going big, and I was very impressed by the scope and magnitude of what it was trying to say. 
 
ART: The art in this film is absolutely breathtaking. It's not your typical anime style - very rough and textured - but it gives each scene a more surreal, yet grounded feel. The fishes feel like they're actually there. The whales look majestic and mysterious. There were many moments where the animation completely blew me away. Regardless of whether you understand the film or not, the animation makes it worth going to see it. 
 
SOUND: How they got Joe Hisaishi to do the score, I have no idea. But it's excellent, as you would expect. The music really builds a sense of scale and epicness that adds to the stellar animation job and gives the story a wholly new dimension. Kenshi Yonezu's ED, ""Umi no Yuurei"", is a beautiful, ethereal song that ends the film off perfectly. I stayed back to listen to the whole thing. 
 
CHARACTER: Ruka's character arc isn't really a central part of the film - it's essentially a by-the-book coming of age story if you look at it in isolation and would only really merit a 5 or 6. What makes the character arc so impressive is how it's integrated into the film as a whole. Ruka's character provides the narrative thread that holds the film together while making its forays into more existential questions not feel out of place. That's why I bumped it up to an 8. 
 
ENJOYMENT: I enjoyed every second of this movie, particularly trying to figure out what its central message was. Finding the common thread that seemed to tie all of its disparate parts together was the most enjoyable part of the whole experience (as was trying to fit each new scene presented to me into my model). It also helped that the animation was stunning, and that the score was perfect. 
 
I would recommend anyone to watch Kaijuu no Kodomo. Even the film's message seems unclear, it's artistic merits alone are worth giving it a shot.

","A while ago I made a review on Digimon Adventure, explaining why I found it to be one of the best kids shows out there, one that had smartly developed plot and characters, great soundtrack, good animation, and overall superb enjoyment not just for kids, but for young adults as well. I also said that a 7.78 score was way too low for a series that achieved something as great as developing each character propperly, have the characters arc influence in the main story arcs and present mature themes to little children without being too dark for them. And so the expectations for Adventure 02 were far too high; I wish I could say as well that the score (currently 7.34) is also low, that the series is the great sequel Adventure so much deserved. Sadly, it is not, 7.34 is the score this sequel deserves, if not lower (even into the 6s zone). Why is that? Let's see: 
 
Storywise: The storytelling is not bad, but much has changed, including the pace; Digimon Adventure had 5 story arcs, each 10 to 14 episodes long, which allowed it to move at a pace that never felt too quickly or too slow, each arc started and ended properly. Here... not su much; we have 3 story arcs, one of 21 episodes, then one of 17 and the last one of 12 episodes. We find some filler episodes in the first one, some ongoing character problems on the second (I'll fill that in the next section) and a rushed and convulted final arc that tries to make up for what is kind of a lagging season by bombing us with too much material that never gets developed (Demon, for instance). 
Now, don't be fooled; despite all its flaws the storytelling is still enjoyable, there are still mature themes around and the air of greatness of Digimon Adventure, however the flaws are too notorious and the characters also dragg it down, but I have to admit that they are all thought through, none of them comes out of thin air (give or take the final arc) and they all get somewhat their propper ending. 
The plot is not as good as the first Digimon series, but the potential is there. Now, why wasn't it fully used? Mainly, characters problems. 
 
Character: Here is where Adventure 02 just outright failed. Remember how amazingly outlined the characters from the first Digimon series were? Remember how they were just broadstrokes that got developed into fully fleshed out character and how amazing was that the crest of each character represented the very scent of how they were? Well, Digimon 02 mainly hopes you forgot about all that. 
We still have our main 8 characters from the first series, but 6 are downgraded to supporting roles, while 2 remain and 3 new character join (one more joins lare on). Now these 3 characters are the main trouble of Digimon 02. 
Daisuke (aka Davis): he is arrogant, he is reckless, and he is a good guy deep down, we have our most stereotypical hero! Of course, that wouldn't be a trouble with the propper character work, but here there is... none. There is no background to explain Daisuke's personality, whereas in Adventure we had backgrounds for each character. We know he has issues with her sister, but that never gets developed (not to mention we never get to know his parents). As the series goes forward Daisuke changes and matures, for no apparent reason; granted, being in the digital world fighting monsters does change people, but Daisuke's change really came without propper building up. He passed from annoying to tollerable, but mainly he was just plot fodder. But he is not nearly the worst character. 
Miyako (aka Joley): now here is a character that mostly everyone will hate! Why is that? Miyako is all talk and no action. She is energetic and sometimes you picture her as the optimistic one, but as soon as she get into the real danger she freaks out and it takes her about 5 minutes of screen time to realize she has to fight. As the series progress her character is mostly ignored and she is left with her characteristic energetic self and food lover life personality, with no development whatsoever or any background at all. 
Iori (aka Kodi): Want someone as annoying as Miyako? Iori might be the one. He is rigid and barely makes an expression, if any. Unlike the previous two, this character does have a background which is not only in sync with his personality, but actually linked with the final arc and despite being kind of interesting, the character himself remains the same for about the whole show, with no actual changes and nothing more than his usual poker face. 
Takeru (TK) and Hikari (Kari): They came from the previous series, so everything should be ok, right? Sadly no; both Takeru and Hikari are mainly ignored in this series. Takeru has about 3 good character moments in the show in the first arc, and then acts as plot fodder later on. Hikari is... well, I wouldn't know, she really doesn't fullfil any function here, give or take going to the dark sea world or supporting the rest on battle. 
Ken: Here is a character that actually got good treatment; he is given a nice background which is consistent with his personality, he is conflicted, and while shy he is mainly likeable for showing the brave to move forward and attone for his wrongs. He is the only one that actually gets good character moments and a character arc that is mainly involved in the plot. Sadly 1 out of 6 doesn't make the cut for good character treatment. 
 
Music: Gladly, the OST from the previous series remains here with the addition of some more tracks made just for this one, which are good. The opening theme, while not as amazing as the one seen in Digimon Adventure, is actually pretty good, both endings are also good, and the tracks that plays in the new evolutions moments are quite nice (specially the one when jogress evolution is made). So, yeah, still a 10 if you ask me. 
 
Enjoyment: For all its faults and failures in the character department, I still think I like this Digimon series. It has some very bad moments that made me ask myself ""why am I watching this crap?"" Followed by some very glorious moments that kept me on the edge of my seat and reply ""Oh, yeah. That's why"". Sure, if I had to grade each episodes, most of them would be on the range of C to B-, but there would surely be straigh As in the ways, but sadly some Ds or Fs too. As a whole, the enjoyment is fair: you get some very clunky, cheesy and boring moments, but you also get profounds and exciting ones (thank you BlackWarGreymon! And Taichi and the rest too for that matter), and as such the enjoyement is in thin line between fair and good. 
 
Stray observations (funny facts and bits of information I got while watching the series): 
-Did you know that originally Adventure 02 had 64 episodes, but the order got cut to 50 somewhere around the way because of low rating? Now we may understand why the finale felt so rushed. 
-There was supposed to be a rivalry between Daisuke and Takeru, but that gets forgotten at some point and then Daisuke just ignores Takeru; and they want to make us believe they are friends... 
-Daisuke and Ken, Miyako and Hikari, all got some good character moments and emotional pep talks previous to achieving jogress evolution. Takeru and Iori got it by having Takeru tell Iori ""have faith: well, that escalated pretty quickly 
-Demon (being sent to the dark world in episode 45): ""you'll regret this"". Apperantly this was set up for Digimon Adventure 03, which you know ended up being tamer so... no, they never regreted it. Besides, what was his purpose in the first place? We'll never know. 
-Ken (in episode 42): ""por favor déjeme entrar"" Ken, tu español no es malo, de hecho mejor que el de mucho japoneses, pero no deja de ser raro escucharlo. 
-Best character: BlackWarGreymon, surely, as he is a sympatetic villian at first and then a tragic hero. His arc is also the high point of the series, as he wonders for the meaning of life; he surely got the best character treatment, closely followed by Ken. 
-Worst character: Miyako, surely, clossely followed by Iori. 
-Daisuke (in the finale) ""I want to have a ramen shop!"" Ken: ""I never knew about this"". Nobody did Ken, and nobody even cared. 
-Award for most forgotten character from Adventure: Mimi, somehow the writers though sending one of their most developed characters into USA would make the cut. They were wrong. Also, I think Sora was pretty much forgotten too. 
 
That's it for now! I hope you liked this review

       Helpful I watched digimon adventure 02 when I was still a kid, I did enjoy it very much. After I grow up, and rewatching it, I can't believe that it had a bunch of flaws in it. Let's go into it... 
 
Story: 5/10 
Being connected with 1st adventure series, the story involves about digimon kaiser, who make rampage on digital world, torturing digimon becoming his servants. New chosen children had to stop him for what he did. The story of kaiser become connected with the next villain and more. My problem is, the story had a LOT of annoying plotholes, especially on the dark ocean episodes. It's cliche, didn't make sense at all. It tended to be darker but it failed, more like a useless filler. It was nice to see the connection between the old villain with the next one until the last villain, making it become clear about the controversies. 
However, the ending of the episode is just not what it should be. I was disappointed for the ending. But overall, the story is okay-ish, degraded from the straightforward adventure 1.  
 
Characters: 8/10 
Despite of huge plotholes, the characters are more or less good, except the main character. It had fair enjoyable moments between characters, sometimes are annoying. And it had a few good teen drama. 
Daisuke was just an annoying generic typical shounen main character. He's the most annoying of all, he tends to be more anime-ish character. Even though so, he did a few best job especially in before last episode. Maybe that's what I can only appreciate him for. 
Takeru was a crybaby on adventure 1, but he get developed well in adv 2, becoming much level-headed and not being crybaby anymore. Despite being nice, there's a time when we can see his anger because of something traumatic of him. It had a burden of not being able to overcome the trauma. But eventually he could do it well. 
Ken, the former kaiser, was unexpectedly first a villain which later become the protagonist, but apparently, he's not that evil and tyrant. His back story were very sad and making it sympathetic. Deeper psychological problem goes to him. After being freed from being kaiser, he only thought that he's not forgivable, and just being depressed. Fortunately, he eventually can overcome that feeling and become developed really well. 
Iori is a kid with more level-headed person. He had a trauma of being left by his late father because of accident in his job as an officer. Somehow, he's still being childish and couldn't control his emotion well. He did developed well eventually, despite not much changes of him. Things got more complex with Iori when he found the truth of his father's relation. 
The rest of characters are good just the way they are. However character like Miyako seemed annoying, despite she had done some best job in a few moments. I have no comment for Hikari, but she's just so so. Most of old chosen children had developed well too. 
 
The villains are much better than cliche adventure's. They have their own reason of why they become the bad one. I really appreciate that the series can made the watcher being sympathetic for the villains. However, the last villain was a degradation, and not enjoyable. 
 
Music: 9/10 
As usual, digimon series are very well-known of their epic music. Opening was catchy enough, ending was nice as well. Soundtracks are good enough, but the thing that I really like was the insert songs. Break Up and Beat hit are epicness, fitted the evolution scenes really well. Bokura no Digital World was so good and memorable. 
 
Art: 8/10 
I have no comment for the general art, but they did really well with the 3D CG evolution scenes especially for imperialdramon.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
I still enjoy it as if I was still a kid, but it went down quite a bit when I found the big flaw on the plot. But I enjoy the characters very well also the epic insert song. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
Despite the degradation of the plot of the story, it still did well. However, I can still think that a connected story or second season of same story of digimon isn't that needed. Thanks for reading my review.

First things first: this anime's plot is generic and a bit bad; and it's a shame that the first half of the fist episode is dedicated to set up the plot and introducing characters that are not important until later in the series.  
 
But the shows knows this, so instead of boring you with the same generic plot of ""let's travel and save the world"", the show focuses on traveling though the fantasy world and the character interactions; and only specific episodes are plot ""heavy"", and even in those episodes there are more than enough gags to keep you entertained. Althou, my problem with this approach is that you'll forget why they were travelling in the first place (but you'll have so much fun that you won't care) 
 
Almost every episode is set on a different city/town and focuses on the adventure that the party has on each location. The location themselves are normal (houses with normal people), but the interesing part of them are the adventures the party in the city: maybe they'll have to defeat a monster using the power of a pumpking-god, or maybe they'll do random jobs (like fishing flying piranhas) so to gather money to buy supplies and don't starve to death, or maybe they'll have to help a gunsmith to save his sister because he is alergic to the guns he creates, or maybe one of the party members just scews something up and the all the party has to fix the problem they caused.  
 
But the most important thing about this anime are it's characters and their interactions: all of them are idiots (with good or bad intensions) and they're pissing each other off for the hell of it but, at the end of the day, they can't stay mad because they are all friends that care for each other.  
 
By the way, this show is a comedy. Without spoiling anything, the ""fights"" are not real fights... but, at the same time, they are there so that the conflict is resolved. Also, since the last a cople of seconds, they won't bother you.  
 
A side note; this show handles fanservise in the good way: most women are really hot, but their boobs are not the reason for why they exist.  
 
Its visuals and its sound are good: both of them are deliver a good experience but they are not remarkable enough to point them out. 
 
But maybe you'll read this review and ask yourself ""if this anime has so many problems, why does this guy gives it a good review?"". Basically, because it is that funny! It is hard to review this anime without spoiling anything because the things that heppens in it are hillarious and ridicule!  
 
If you've read this review and you have doubts about watching the show, go to Youtube and watch it's second opening. It doesn't contain any spoiler, it is a short adventure that shows how goofy and hillarious this anime and it's characters are.  
 
I hope you have found this review helpfull. Any type of feedback is welcome (send them by PM). 

          
 
       Helpful I'm probably being too generous giving this 8/10 overall, but I quite liked it. Before watching it, I heard many complaints. The priest's certain ""habit"", some ""Gonzo"" company made it, people said it was boring, and just made negative comments in general. Throughout watching it, I heard several comments about how people hated ""party call"" and a lot of other things. Some of the positive/negative comments people made led me to believe they didn't really understand the show. 
 
This show loosely follows the storyline in Dungeon Fighter Online. The show has many of your favourite NPCs from the game, which is just something fun to see if you've played DFO. GSD definitely looks like he's able to see, Bwanga wasn't in here at all, and there are a bunch of other inaccurate things. 
 
Anyhow... I'd have to say the show starts off horribly. The first part of the first episode is awesome since it involves Roxy and Aganzo. It's interesting since we don't know much about them even from playing DFO, just the little hints that they loved each other from some of the comments on newb equipment and that Aganzo is ""The Grey Slayer"". The show has a pretty serious tone at this point, which is also pretty cool. 
After that, things start to get a little silly and trivial. The show isn't really going in any direction and they're just sort of building up a party. I say the show starts to pick up around episode 5 or 6, by which time the party is assembled and we start to meet some NPCs. Now, in a good anime series, the introduction of a new main character would be an extremely interesting episode. Here, however, it was pretty boring and a bit of a grind to get through.  
 
Baron, the slayer, has been hated and discriminated against ever since he received Kazan's curse. Every normal person wants him dead. He simply wants to find a cure for it and doesn't really blame people for hating him; he just tries to ignore them and leave them be. His character was fine at this point... but then they turned him into a gold hearted hero who goes out of his way to save every single person he can despite how he was treated. It was just very poorly written and had no emotion at all, especially how he gave confidence to a little girl who just lost her parents. She was breaking down, but a thumbs up from Baron was enough to make her cheerful and hoping to meet this great guy again someday since he saved their town. Stupid. He's the main character and he was done the worst... Big mistake. He should've been a bit more badass. 
Capensis, the gunner, is pretty much just comic relief. He complains a lot, hits on women, gets treated like a slave, gets hurt the most, and nobody cares about his wellbeing at all (or even likes him). I found him to be pretty funny. 
Ryunmei, the fighter, was a pretty decent character overall. The show had to sneak in the extremely typical and unfunny joke about a flat-chested girl commenting on her large breasts... However, they actually had a good gag involving her large breasts somewhere in the middle of the series.  
Ixia, the mage, was introduced poorly. She was a total brat who was wanted captured. And our party did capture her. Then scolded her. Then... Then they let her go without resolving anything after she deeply insulted all of them. Guess what? They decide to treat her as a precious comrade out of the blue. They should've done a better job of converting her to the good side... She might as well have remained a spoiled brat since she only joined them because they accepted her, not because she understood that what she did before was wrong. She's a pretty decent character after that, though, and it's kinda fun to see how she gains new familiars/summons. 
 
Just had to get all that out there... Anyhow, the art takes a little getting used to. The animation is pretty average, maybe a little below average since the shading isn't too fancy and the animation is still only at this level. The battles are weak. Capensis takes out all the grunts, Ryunmei and Ixia help out with that and/or pin the boss, Baron finishes the boss off with an aerial attack, a single triple slash, neutral wave sword, or (for the final boss) ashe fork. Better than dragging battles on for 3-10 episodes, though, right? 
 
I found the ending theme to be particularly cool since it's done in a retro pixel art style. 
 
Last, but certainly not least, PARTY CALL~! Some people really hated this about the show, but I think it was my favourite part. This really made the show unique and added a good amount of humour. It's not a kind of humour that everyone an understand or appreciate, though. Some people take it a bit too seriously, but it's clearly a joke in itself. Some say it ruins the mood of battles, but the pep talk itself is funny and it lets them get the battle over and done with. If it weren't for the party call, how would you end an even match? Fight till both sides are totally exhausted, then the good guys use some kind of finishing move. Party call skips straight to the finishing move.  
 
If you like DFO and can find the party calls amusing, then you'll probably like this show as much as I did after you get past the first few episodes.

There's a curious phenomenon occuring in the entertainment industry, one that blurs the line between what you read, watch and play, and while we may all be familiar with the weird, wonderful, and sometimes downright appalling world of the adaptation, in truth the dividing line between the mediums is beginning to fade.  
 
Where am I going with this? Well, in recent years games and gaming, especially on consoles, has moved to the forefront of the entertainment industry, and in order to capitalise on the popularity of a given title various production companies and writers have begun to produce adaptations of games that have proven themselves cash cows. One recent example of this is the latest Hollywood release, ""Prince of Persia"", a movie which clearly signifies Hollywood's desire to make more money cashing in to the current games market, especially after the debacle that was ""Super Mario Brothers"" and the recent glut of superhero affairs.  
 
The problem though, is that game adaptations aren't really the best source material, especially MMO games. 
 
Slap Up Party: Arad Senki (or Slap Up Party: Record of the Arad War), originally began life as a Korean multiplayer fighting game called ""Dungeon & Fighter"" that incorporated certain role playing aspects, however the popularity of the game was such that it quickly expanded to include a more immersive RPG system. Now while the game itself is copmparable to the likes of World of Warcraft, the main problem with any adaptation is that in orderfor it to work, the story would not only have to fit into the game world, but also be accessable enough for those unfamiliar with the title. 
 
Unfortunately, Arad Senki seems to have fallen into the same trap as titles like Ragnarok, Ar Tonelico and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, amongst others. 
 
The story follows a young man named Baron through the land of Arad as he travels from place to place seeking a way to cure his particular affliction, namely a demon arm, which was caused by a curse that affected the land some time before (it's never clear when). Along the way he is accompanied by a small floating spirit named Roxy, and is later joined by several other companions. 
 
Sounds familiar. right? 
 
Like many anime of this kind, this tale oozes shounen sensibilities from almost every pore, from believing in one's friends to never giving up, and everything in between. The problem though, is that the plot has no real direction, and because of this haphazard approach the story proper takes a very long time to get going. However, even with the tale in full flow, there is still not enough substance to make one take the story seriously. Strangely though, this lack of focus and actual storyline doesn't impact one's enjoyment as much as one might think, as there seems to have been some realisation that the platform upon which the entire show stands is full of cracks. That said, these cracks have only really been papered over with a thin veneer of comedy that, in truth, is sometimes a bit hit-and-miss.  
 
The main reason for the lack of focus is the fact that the anime is based on an MMOG, and because of this the writers have had to fit the story into the pre-existing world, something which limits their creativity. On the other hand, if this type of anime is approached correctly, then there is scope for improvement as the game allows for a phenomenal amount of content and ideas that could be adapted.  
 
It's unfortunate then, that this hasn't been realised, however there is something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing (more on this in a bit). 
 
As far as looks go, the series is colourful enough, and the characters are designed reasonably well, however there is a comic element inherent in this that may not be obvious at first. The animation is generally pretty good throughout the show, and because of the nature of the series, Gonzo are able to show off a variety of styles, from comic to fast-paced action, something which serves the anime well come the end. 
 
That said, the show lacks a degree of refinement where the visuals are concerned. While it may be argued that a good portion of the series is stylistically designed to enhance this or that comedy or action scene, the viewer may find that the show has a ""rushed"" feel for the most part. 
 
Sound is also pretty decent throughout Arad Senki, with many of the effects being clear and well choregraphed. The acting is good for the most part, however some of the seiyuu really do ham it up, and in all honesty I can'tbe sure if this is by accident or design, as several scenes actually work better this way. 
 
Arad Senki is generally well served as far as the music goes. The tracks used throughout the show enhance the atmosphere fairly well, however the comedy element means it's difficult to take the action scenes seriously, even with the ubitquitous dramatic music. The show has two OPs, ""Party Play"" by Sakura Nogawa and ""Sokujin no Pandora"" by Nogawa Sakura, both of which are decent J-rock tracks. The first OP is fairly typical with it's visuals, however the second takes a more innovative and humourous approach to golf (that's right, golf). 
 
As for the EDs, ""Hateshinai Sekai"" by YMCK and ""LEVEL∞"" by Akiko Hasegawa, they are both made using music from what sounds like an 8-bit or 16 bit game. Of the two EDs, I have to admit that I do like the comedy Hateshinai Sekai's visuals, which feature the characters in a 16-bit game opening treasures and fighting monsters. 
 
The characters are on of the issues with the series, as there simply isn't any real development given to them, and the little growth that does occur is often formulaic and ""methodical"". None of the characters really stands out in any way, however it's not all bad, as while there is a distinct deficiency in this department, they actually work fairly well when there's comedy about. Rather than focusing on developing the characters, the creators seem to have gone in a completely different direction. Essentially, the characters are treated as nothing more than toys that are wound up and let loose in a given situation, the results of which aren't always successful or effective. 
 
I already mentioned that there's something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing, and that something is the tongue in cheek nature of the show. Where series like Raganrok take themselves far too seriously, Arad Senki has made a concerted effort to add some fun to the mix. While the result isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's enough variation in the anime to keep the viewer interested at the very least. 
 
Okay, so as a straight forward story the show doesn't work all that well, however if one treats Arad Senki as a series of short stories rather than one complete tale, it becomes far more palatable, and that's one of the things that it seems to actually encourage during the early part of the show. Unfortunately, there's only so far a series can go using this format before the viewer needs something more substantial to maintain their interest, and in this department the show doesn't quite deliver. 
 
It's a shame, as the idea of making an MMOG based is a good one provided the effort is put in to make everything work. While Slap Up Party: Arad Senki may not be great, it's actually a lot more enjoyable than the likes of Ragnarok, and although it may not be to everyone's tastes, there are occasional flashes of what this show could have been like. 
 
Still, at least it's not Super Mario Bothers again :)

Rather than getting mad, the principal admires Dandoh's swing and introduces him to the world of golf. It's now an adventure in golf as Dandoh is under the watchful eye of a former pro-golfer. They enter a tournament together and play for a shot at the national championships. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Sports', 'Shounen']","Dan Doh!! focuses on a fifth grader named Tadamichi Aoba also nicknamed Dandoh. Dandoh and his two friends are their baseball team's best players, but after an incident with their school principal, they are introduced to the world of golf. Dandoh and his friends are taught by a former professional golfer named Shinjō Mikiyasu, who believes that they can surpass even him. As Dandoh begins to play in tournaments, his friendly spirit, determination, and hard working and competitive attitude brings the best in the players around him and earns him many friends.
","I just finished watching Dan Doh!! which is a 26-episode sports anime about golf. GOLF. Well... 
 
The series is the typical prodigy story. A boy suddenly realizes he excels in the sport - so much that he is able to beat people who have been doing the same thing for a lot longer than he has. It helps that he has the backing of not one, but two, ex-golf pros. Oh yeah, did I mention that his father was also a secret amateur golfer who has unexpectedly (and still unexplainedly) quit the sport? Like we haven\'t seen that before. 
 
Animation-wise, it was a bit old-fashioned for my taste and there was nothing that spectacular about it. Sound - it was all about the \&quot;sonic booms\&quot; of the drives and the \&quot;clink\&quot; of the ball when it goes into the cup. The only character development is ALL the characters, except for one, turns good from being bad the first time we see them. The whole series is just too... nice. 
 
But Dan Doh!! is still enjoyable and entertaining in its own way. I would have liked to see more of what happened to Dan Doh, his friends, and if he ever went to bigger things in his golf game.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, no idea where to even begin with this mess... Let's just say the writers have an overactive imagination.  *WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD* 
 
Story: So we got Aoba Tadamichi ""Dan Doh"", some kid who starts off thinking golf is nothing because the ball you hit is stationary.  The principal of his school shows him otherwise by mimicking a golf shot with... a baseball bat and ball... Umm can I get a physics check here? Anyway, suddenly Aoba thinks golf is the bees' knees and wants to become the best. Does he do it? Oh yeah! This grade schooler puts Tiger Woods to shame. After two weeks of practice he enters his first tournament and birdies the first hole with a bunker chip-in and eagles the second with a wayward approach shot that's saved by the wind. In short, the biggest piece of bull crap I've ever seen and an insult to the game of golf and all the people who work hard just to get par. The saving grace of this hell-hole is the story arc where Dan-Doh caddies for a tour pro, Akano, and helps him win the Sapporo Open. Even then, the pro has a crazy number of hole-outs in approach shots for eagles. (NOTE: Tiger Woods did this ONCE in his ENTIRE 2009 season.)  The cream of the crop though, is Dan Doh getting away with hitting Driver in places other than the tee, something any pro wouldnt think twice about doing. This is just the tip of the iceberg though. If you're into golf, you'll likely be utterly disgusted by this crap. If not, don't be lured into thinking golf is an easy game (which this anime apparently depicts without fail). IT'S NOT! 
 
Anyway, thanks to the Akano arc, this piece of crap gets a 4 in story, and that's being generous. 
 
Art/Animation: Two words ****ing terrible. Yes, you can make out when someone is talking or swinging a club, but it's all about the latter in this anime.  Pretty much all the swings look like they are raised to their apex in 5 discontinuous stages. Then the character can wait for as much as 5 seconds before swinging through. It's a mess, and if you copy it, you'll be lucky to hook the ball every time. Ball flight is also entirely bullcrapped. At one angle, the ball looks like it's been hit with good loft and then suddenly it looks like it's hovering one ft above the fairway as it approaches the green. Clearly, their art budget for this pathetic excuse of an anime was nil. Since other things can be made out sort of okay, I'll be generous and hand out a 3. 
 
Sound: Opening theme is cheesy, bgm is cheesy, it's all cheesy, nothing special here and gets a 4. 
 
Character: I have to take marks off here big time because they make Dan Doh a golf-tensai right off the bat, which pisses me off royally. Besides that, everyone has a constant personality and doesn't really ""change."" The only really memorable one is Akano, who actually does undergo some transformation and thus I award it a 4 in this area. 
 
Enjoyment: As someone who knows what it's like to earn every birdie and every par with months of training, this anime pissed me off to beyond the depths of hell. Making the main character a sudden prodigy sensation who can best Tiger Woods with some of his shots and having every other shot be a hole out or pin hit was just a pathetic decision on the part of the writers. The only reason Dan Doh doesn't get a one in this category is, again, the Akano arc, so I give it a 2 for enjoyment. 
 
Overall: 3/10; a terrible anime and a disgrace to a great game.

          
 
       Helpful While watching Dan Doh!! you realize, that you sit in front of your TV - mumbling the same phrases, over and over:"" Doh I've seen that already! But in a much better way"", ""Doh, this character should seem cool, I guess!"", ""Now he is going to make some kind of intergalactic shoot which will hit! See I was right..."". 
 
Don't missunderstand me, if Dan Doh! would have been produced before: Hajime no Ippo, Prince of Tennis or Hikaru no Go. It would have been a ""good"" Anime. But even then, just good. There is nothing special it's getting boring to watch after a while and there is no real depth, or the wish to support the main character. The art is nothing special, the characters seem to be designed by some old fashioned guy, the whole picture is out of place. Some scenes where you are probably supposed to get excited - you just sit there and stare or even laugh... Well the only real reason to watch this anime would be that you are a golf maniac. But even then you probably won't be happy with it.

Digimon was one of my favorite TV shows when I was younger, and as huge fan of the series I was in the opposite side from my collegues, Pokemon and Dragon Ball fans. Adventure is an amazing show, with very mature themes in the plot and great characters. The sequel, Adventure 02 was not so good, with lame new characters and an awful ending. Tamers was so called Digimon 3 by TV marketing, but is a spin--off (a great one to be fair), so Digimon Adventure has ended with a bitter taste in the fans mouth.  
 
So I received the news of a new Digimon Adventure with great expectation. Despite the awful ending, was a serie that I cared so much when child. And also, I was sick for a better ending as well.  
 
This first movie/OVA was a great surprise, and made me fell in love again with these beloved characters. But wait... again or for the first time? Yes, for shure, they are no kids anymore, they are teenagers now, with brand new personalities, dreams and dilemmas. Taichi (or Tai) is no more the lighthearted and flustered leader, he's more responsable  and rational now, and is terrified with the destruction that giant monsters can bring. Yes, bein heroic and fight the evil is not so easy when you are grown up, and I liked very much this new Tai. Yamato (or Matt) continue to be the heart of the group, always thinking in do good to others, a great exponent to the crest of friendship he carries. And is still the bad ass. Sora is no longer a tomboyish ""need pretend to be strong"" character, is more like  a cartaker and it seems to be the glue that will keep the group together. Also, the movie draws a possible romantic triangle between her, Tai and Matt. Takeru (or TK) is no longer the whining brat and awful character, is more joyfull and a womanizer project. Mimi is back from a long stay in america, is not more the childish one of the group, is the extroverted happy-go-lucky that stole the spotlight. Izumi (Izzy) continues to be the great computer geek and genie of the group, but have showed a new facet when confronted with the brand new Mimi that activates his libido. Joe and Kari are overshadowed by the others, but are still great indeed. The first have a new dillema in his college aplication marathon and is seen more studiyind than doing other stuff, and the second one, well... continues to be Tai's atractive little sister. I hope she gets more screentime in the next movies, she was extremely important in the old shows .  
 
As you can see, the story is more chacter driven and this is the great merit from this first installement, is presenting a nouveau regard over our old friends. As their bonds intesifies, their challenges seems to be greater then fight giant monsters. Speaking on that, yeah, they are back. And yes, we have also great action scenes and new misteries surrounding the Digiworld. The villaneous Digimon are stronger, and the old pet monster have a lot of work to do in the next chapters. Also,  a new Digidestined is the house. What she will bring? 
 
The animation is simply gorgeous. Toei is a studio that lost the good animation tram and keep the oldfashioned style managed to make a great job here. Also, the OST is back with the great old themes renewed and is simply outstanding.  
 
So, Digimon Adventure Tri is a great work that is trully shot through the heart of the nostalgic fans. Presenting old friends in a new path, and putting them in a comming of age plot is an excellent ideia. The characters are the soul of a good story  and Toei knows that. It's a love letter to the old fans and a great invitation to new ones. Digimon is more mature, more realistic, and a 100% awesome. Now that the  adventure had evolved, I can't wait for more!

Pretty much. 
 
Story 6/10 
So I will have to say this is the weakest point of the 80 minutes I watched. Yes there are a lot of unsolved mysteries which I find highly interesting. However, the pace of the whole story was very very slow and some parts could have been made more epic like the most important reunion of the group. 
It was beautiful for a die-hard fan to watch the groups high school life, but as soon as we got to see fighting scenes I felt that something was lacking. Regarding this especially the last few minutes felt rushed making the end of the first movie really awkward. 
On top of that I dislike the way the movie was split into four episodes for streaming. Not only was it confusing at first, but the cuts felt really weird at points. I highly recommend watching the movies as a whole if you can! 
 
Animation 9/10 
I simply love the art. It's nothing special in style but I feel like it fits the concept of a series that grew with its audience. I honestly love to see the new definition of the characters while remembering how the drawing style was 10 years ago. Although it's also making it weird to see the characters so different sometimes. I guess this is pretty much what it must feel like to see your own children grow up. But it's good and makes the story a tad more serious. This also blends in well with the Characters. 
 
Characters 9/10 
Everything about this series grew up. It's really hard to write about this section without spoiling, but if you were in love with the characters when you saw the original series, you will also love them after this time jump. The character development on it's own is very reasonable. 
 
Sound 10/10 
YES! MY FEELINGS! It's absolutely the right thing to do: to take the old sound and enhance it. I nearly cried when I first heard the new ""Butterfly"" opening. And listening enhanced versions of the tracks within the anime was also a blessing. Even the ending would have been notable if I had watched the original series in Japanese. They knew how they could catch the old fans by using that music and I would say the sound was the main source for making fans remember the beauty of watching the original series back then. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
I think that you can truly enjoy this show if you loved the original anime especially if you watched it as a 10 year old child like me. There's just so many things that I love about the older characters, the new animation and sound. However, for someone totally uninvolved I think that their focus would lie too much on the story which is anything but outstanding.   
However, this is only what we know about 1 of 6 movies! A lot can happen here. After those 6 movies I would decide whether this series is worth a re-watch. Right now I feel more like watching the original series all over again. 
However, I don't feel like Digimon Tri. gave us a lot more until now. It's really just an addition to Digimon Adventure 1 and 2. 
 
 
Overall 9/10 
I'm waiting for more in march.

Keaton's parents separated when he was five, and young Taichi moved back to England with his mother. As an adult, he studied archeology at Oxford University, in part under the tutelage of Professor Yuri Scott.
At Oxford, Keaton met and later married his wife, who was a mathematics student at Somerville College. The couple years later divorced, with Keaton leaving his five-year-old daughter Yuriko in her mother's care.  After leaving Oxford, Keaton joined the British Army and became a member of the SAS, holding the post of survival instructor and seeing combat in the Falklands War and as one of the team members that responded to the Iranian Embassy siege.  His combat training serves him in good stead as an insurance investigator for the prestigious Lloyd's of London where he is known for his abilities and his unorthodox methods of investigation.
In addition to his work for Lloyd's, Keaton and his friend Daniel O'Connell operate their own insurance investigation agency headquartered in London.  Even though Keaton is extremely successful as an insurance investigator, his dream is to continue his archaeological research into the possible origins of an ancient European civilization in the Danube river basin.
","First of all, I'm a fan of episodic anime and let me tell you this. If you're a fan too, don't need to read my review, go on and watch Master Keaton as I regard it one of the best episodic show ever along the line of Mushishi, Kino no tabi, Jigoku Shoujo or Aria.  
 
Originally a manga drawn by the famous Naomi Urasawa, the mastermind behind Monster and 20th Century Boy, there is a certain level of expectation for me going to this anime and gladly it didn't disappoint. As the title suggested, this anime follows the life of Taichi Keaton-Hiraga, a man at first glance is anything but extraordinary. But what lies inside him might surprise you deeply... 
 
Due to its episodic nature, each episode is a different story and because of that, they covers various of topics: wars, love, hate, betrays, revenge ... And as expected of someone who wrote Monster, we're treated with a lots stories from WW2, what a cruel time it is. But stories that I especially love are those of everyday life, very peaceful and heart-warming. And no matter the stories, they are handled with carefulness and love, that's what make the experiences watching this anime unique, as unique as its main character, master Keaton. 
 
Not only a skillful soldier, Keaton is also a scholarly historical academic, a passionate archaeologist, a surviving specialist, a successful insurance investigator and above all, a loving father. He remarkably reminds me of Sherlock Holmes, a true gentleman of a long lost time. Who's always giving a hand for the weak and bring justice to life. And man, I do love Sherlock to death, so no wonder, I like Keaton very much. He carried the anime on his back, makes even the most normal thing become somewhat interesting. He's one character that I never got tired of seeing and that's something very rare for me.  
 
So if my review in a way persuades anyone to watch this hidden gem, I would be very happy. Master Keaton needs more love.

       Helpful If you want to watch a quality, fun and relaxing episode of anime, this never disappoints... 
Master Keaton, the now almost 18 year old predecessor to Urasawa's Anime classic ""Monster"", is a massively overlooked show. 
Just like the original season, this OVA shares a lot of the creative staff with its younger brother,  Naoki Urasawa having illustrated the original Master Keaton Manga and even supposedly written a large proportion of it  
(which is hard to say for certain, given co-writer Hokusei Katsushika sadly passed away in 2004). 
 
 
Story: 
The premise of this show is a simple one, telling short adventure stories from all around the world of the 1990s, usually in some connection to historical and/or criminal themes. I will not say much more than that. 
The setting is very western and in that way, I might add, very well researched. 
It is a bit different from the usual anime, but if you know ""Monster"" you will realise what you are getting yourself into. 
Due to the episodic nature of the show a lot of the focus is on the characters.  
Most of the One-shot characters are given just enough depth to provide the chapter with a satisfying conclusion, but naturally the spotlight would be on the main cast: 
 
 
Characters: 
Anyone who has seen the first season will be very familiar with the main character Taichi, our japanese, part McGuyver, part Indiana Jones, part Sherlock Holmes, ex-SAS, professor of Archeology, globetrotting investigator and master of life, in short ""Master Keaton"".  
He is in fact so amazing, that there never is any time in the story for suspense to build up, because we all know ""our Taichi"" will probably find the optimal solution to any problem by the  end of the episode. 
 
He however does have some flaws, and those especially come to light in his personal life. His father, the zoologist and bona fide ladykiller Taihei, shares Taichi's fate of being divorced, 
and his teen daughter Yuriko never fails to remind him of what his reckless lifestyle is costing him. However the whole family does share that same childish passion for adventure, making episodes focused around Mr. Keaton's family still fun to watch, albeit slightly more light-hearted. 
 
Then there is Taichi's partner, the very easy going and maybe careless insurance investigator Daniel. He is also nicely explored, taking the spotlight in a couple episodes and he makes a fun duo together with Keaton. 
 
 
Production values and Directing: 
It is easy to assume that this show was meant to be a direct sequel to the first season of ""Master Keaton"" (it being a 15 episode OVA), and that production was cut short for lack of funds. 
Do not expect a series that will blow you away visually, expect a series that sometimes looks good, but never offensively bad.  
The direction seems to be taking a quite practical approach, showing everything that needs to be seen. You will have difficulty finding many memorable shots, but looking for flaws would be futile. 
The soundtrack is lovely, high quality, mostly consisting of acoustic instrumentals, some being inspired by traditional scottish music (most notably the blasting bagpipes from the opening of course), some being more orchestral. 
The sound directing never appears too assertive (like in other episodic shows e.g. Bebop), together with the western style of the music just adding to the character of the show. 
I personally highly recommend the English Dub, since Japanese audio would only take away from the atmosphere. It is an internationally set series after all. 
All the different languages and accents are certainly a bit ""funky"", however not in a non-entertaining way, so I have to give a massive plus for effort in that regard. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
It bugs me, that this series is so overlooked. Sure, there is nothing extravagant and the explored concepts are never that grand, or especially remarkable,  
but there seems to be a bit of meaning to every story, which makes it very, very satisfying. 
In comparison to the first season of Keaton, I even think that the OVA is somewhat more consistent in creating interesting episodes. 
Especially in a time of so many mediocre new releases, ""Master Keaton"" has such an old-school, reassuring quality to it, making it recommendable to pretty much anyone. 
I would not consider this a must-watch like Urasawa's marginally younger work ""Monster"".  
Nevertheless, considering just how easy to watch this OVA is, you really have no excuse not to consider it next time you  want to sit back with an episode of anime.  
One episode of ""Master Keaton"" is 25 min of your day well spent. 
Yes, I would place this in the same realm as other episodic shows like: 
-Bartender 
-Mushishi 
And even absolute classics like: 
-Cowboy Bebop 
 
Rating: 
Finally, in consideration of the fact that ""Master Keaton OVA"": 
 
 -certainly does not stick out in terms of animation, cinematography, soundtrack and characters, 
                                                                                                                               -still is of such a consistently high quality, that I would do it injustice calling it anything but flawless, 
 
 my final score for it is a very good 84/100.

Some of these veterans heal with the aid of loved ones, and others choose to recover in isolation, reflecting on their losses and the friends no longer with them. 
 
In this epilogue to the hardships of Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala, the heroes come to terms with their roles in the recent war and prepare for adventures yet to come. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the ""Cosmic Era"" in which humankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as ""Naturals"", and the genetically altered super-humans known as ""Coordinators"". The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out between Earth and the PLANTS. The Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, ""For the preservation of our blue and pure world"". The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens.
Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth's crust that halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and radio, causing most areas of earth to go without electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits to rely on rechargeable batteries.
The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing many new technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very small population.  It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give their military the edge in the beginning of the war.
The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis, where five advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war effort are developed in secret in exchange of sharing of their technical data with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally, Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel, to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the PLANTS, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb Union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies. Unknown to ZAFT, the Earth forces knew of this attack ahead of time. They planned to sacrifice the Alaska base along with the Archangel in order to destroy ZAFT's army using a weapon of mass destruction hidden underneath the Alaska base. Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced, nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira is able to help the Archangel flee the destruction of the Alaska base. The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. The Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join Lacus Clyne's rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and Justice mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given an equally powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice. However, after learning of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's father and the radical militant faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a final battle, the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceler technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice Gundam's power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT's GENESIS, a super weapon microwave laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals. The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.
","This is a nice conclusion to the show that gives a snapshot of the post-war lives of most main and side characters.  
 
This special is just a 5 minute video after the end of  Gundam Seed but before Destiny.  I think it is a better conclusion to the show better than the somewhat abrupt ending from the 50th episode of Gundam Seed. You should definitely watch this if you watched gundam seed. I honestly feel this should have just aired after the credits on the last episode itself.  
 
It shows a snippet of the after-war life for most of the main and side characters. It finally ends with Kira, Athrun, Cagalli, and Lacus reflecting and contemplating what it is they are now supposed to do in life. There is not much content added, but it is certainly more satisfying than the ending of the 50th episode of seed.

","A story about a dragon girl that falls in love with the boy. It's kind of basic and everything feels sort of similar. I felt I needed to touch up on a few things. I actually enjoyed it very much. If you're looking for something to be like Bleach or Naruto in this aspect you came to the wrong place. This anime is only 12 episodes long, but is decent enough to enjoy watching it. Why? 
 
The story is pretty good. It could of been a lot better if it  summed up a good amount of the things going on. Which is why I gave it the lowest score of the categories. The story is there, and its probably in the light novels. What I will say is this, if you enjoy action/comedy type anime it's definitely worth it. 
 
The art to me is fantastic. On par with some of the other stuff out there. Visually appealing to the eyes. 
 
The sound is great. I gave this the highest because the music is INCREDIBLE from this anime. The OST alone is worth it if you can find it. The voice acting is great as well. I can sit here and enjoy writing this review while just listening to the OST. 
 
Character stories definitely could of used a lot of time to work on. I'm not going to complain though because it got the basic point across.  
 
Overall, I think this show is worth watching at least one time through. I love action/comedy genre the most. My enjoyment and my laughing moments were definitely worth the time I spent watching it. My rewatch value on this is actually pretty high. If you came for something serious, it's best to go another route.

          
 
       Helpful pls do not bash me because this is my first review. ^.^ 
(I WILL BASE THIS REVIEW JUST ON THE ANIME, NOT THE LN because i don't read novels) 
---- 
---- 
Let's get started, shall we? 
 
Dragon Crisis is one of those anime that never ceases to amuse you, even if you're having a bad day.  
 
Except at the end of the day, you'll still be thinking ""so, what does dragon crisis actually mean?"" 
 
I'd like to keep this short, no spoilers and give you a reason WHY I love this anime. 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
The story enough made me sit through the whole thing, sometimes laughing, sometimes made me think of how stupid this character is or how annoying that character is, or sometimes just sitting, watching the anime to see what happens next. It wasn't rushed, but it wasn't too slow. Each episode has something new waiting for u. The reason I gave it an 8 was in my opinion, some parts were just a bit boring for me. 
 
Art: 10/10 
 
Outstanding art quality, vibrant colors and smooth animation. That's probably all. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
 
This had the lowest score in this review and let me explain why. 
 
The OP was the one that let it down the most, because it was very random for this type of anime. I would've liked a much more happy OP, this anime is mostly comedy and action. The soundtrack isn't that bad, but it can get random sometimes. And at last, the ED of this anime. First thing that comes in your mind after hearing it is, ""what the serious fuck?"" 
 
I skip the OP and ED part though most of the times in anime, so the OP and ED doesn't really matter for me unless it's really good. 
 
 
Character: 7/10 
 
Kisaragi Ryuji, or let's just call him Ryuji like everyone does in the anime, is dense when it comes to love. If you realize a girl is very nervous when she's around you, then most definitely, she has a crush on you. He's not that dense though like Ichika from Infinite Stratos. But personality aside, is he smart? Above average. Is he strong? Pretty strong, if he's with Rose. 
 
Not a lot of character development, which doesn't really matter. I just wanted to see Ryuuji's parents, they need more screen time. 
 
I swear, half of Ryuuji's screen time is him being depressed. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
As I said, this show will keep you on your seat wanting for more. I watched the whole thing in just 1 day. Comedy? Awesome. Romance + Comedy? Pretty awesome. Harem + Romance + Comedy? Fucking awesome.  
 
If you're looking for another title that is comedic and has an above average story, watch this. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
Re-watch value: Sure but in the future, most definitely. 
 
ps: there is a subtle spiderman reference in one of the episodes, look for it!  
hint: it's in episode 7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I read the first 2 most popular reviews and thought to myself ""do these people even know what a harm means?"" This anime is not a ""harem"" anime. It is more like an action anime. The first episode you have a classmate who has a crush on the main character, then an older cousin of the main character pops into the scene, but there is obviously no love interest on either side there. Then you have a dragon girl who falls into their hands and that's where the real relationship and story is.  
Now for the review.  
The story I thoroughly enjoy. Stories are made out of the setting, characters, and the plot. The setting is very good and I can imagine a lot from it which continues my interest in the story, though the characters might seem a bit cliche and annoying at times they do not bother me to the extent to not watch further. The plot also might feel a bit cliche at times though most of the plot is the actual setting and it is new and interesting, and there are no gaping plot holes as of yet. For me all I have to enjoy is the setting for me to enjoy the anime, because I don't feel like I can predict what happens next. When I get to a point where I can predict it, that's when it gets boring. So the story is a 10 
The art isn't spectacular or new but it doesn't let down expectations of this day and age. Like Freezing has where I feel the art is lacking a lot. So I gave it an 8 
The sound I do believe the opening sequence and ending sequence is very catchy. Though the sound also means the voice actors and background sound too. I have no complaints about the background sound and Rie Kugimiya seems to be trying something new other than a tsundere role for once. Difficult to say if it fits her or not because I am so used to hearing her in tsundere roles. I also give this an 8. 
Characters is something hard to be unique in. The main character was very annoying at first because I really do hate those indecisive characters. But he seems to have gotten decisive come episode 3.. so hard to tell now. The other characters, eccentric scientist, older dependable cousin who only uses the main character and is really loose. Innocent young female lead who falls in love with the main character without knowing much about the world. Not really sure what to rate this but I don't rate the characters very highly, though there is only so many personalities you can actually use in stories and it's difficult to say you haven't seen them all. I give it a 7, might be being generous. 
Enjoyment, this is one of my favorites of the season. I'm looking forward to seeing the next episode. I don't give high numbers easily and think if something deserves a low rating it will get a low rating. I wont forget about the first 5 numbers! 1-5 if Something deserves a 4 I'll give it. 
 
So over all I think this is an 8. Not a miyazaki work. But it isn't bad in fact 8 means very good.

       Helpful Being the final entry in the Ronin Warriors series, you'd think this five-episode OAV would be filled with great action and a wonderful end. It's not. There is no action whatsoever in any of these episodes, except in the flashbacks that fill half of each episode. These ""flashbacks"" (most fitting word I can think of) aren't really flashbacks though; they are clips from the TV series and the Legend of the Inferno Armor OAV with pointless drivel spouted from the characters over them. The dialogue doesn't even discuss what is being shown - it's quasi-philosophical ramblings that have nothing to do with the Ronin Warriors series at all. 
 
Furthermore, every happy thing in the original series (the idea of friendship, especially) is cast aside, with the characters basically saying that they weren't friends, that they only fought beside each other to survive. It's as if the creators of these OAV episodes wanted to piss off every fan of the original series. 
 
Even if you can get past the lack of action in an action series and the wasteful consumption of time (this could have been two episodes, easy), you still won't find very much enjoyment. The plot is a joke, with next to no explanation of anything and a general lack of sense and substance. The idea that the story of the warriors has already been told in a book that is 300 years old is never even explored; it's just a background for a few brief moments. 
 
There is nothing redeeming about this. There is no reason to watch it, and there is no reason it should have ever been made.

This is a slice of life, comedy series based around the life of three sisters. 
 
Minami Haruka, the eldest sister, the sweet and motherly sister.  She is also the most reliable of the three sisters but is lazy when left alone. Although the oldest she is still a second year of high school. And in junior high through several misunderstandings obtained the nickname Banchō (or badass, used to refer to a leader of delinquents, etc, etc) 
 
Minami Kana (my favorite) the family retard, or baka if I may. The middle sister, second year junior high. The type of girl that nearly always acts before thinking, does poorly in school (she misreads kanji a lot) she tends to find excuses to make things more interesting. 
 
Minami Chiaki, they youngest sister in elementary (I estimate 5th year, perhaps sixth?) She is made out to be highly intelligent by her friends but it seems that she thinks of things in a rather simple way. She things VERY highly of Haruka and is very formal with her, but uses the term bakayarō (a more strict form of baka) with Kana often. 
 
Episodes: 13 
 
Story: 9/10 
I cant really explain much being a slice of life series, there is no real plot. There are plenty of ""love triangles"" but I use that term losely as really there is no proper shape to give it, the love goes all over the place and really does keep things about as funny as it gets. All in all the story all fits together, is easy to get, and is overall funny, A+ 
 
Characters: 10/10 
Great job on this, alto only 13 episodes you seem to get plenty of time to see almost all the characters grow and change in the series and really get to get a hold of there personality's, and all of them have there on style and stories, no copy paste at all. 
 
Music: 9/10 
Liked all the back ground music, and OP and ED, not mush else to say, I watched every OP (normally just do it on first and last episode) Love that OP song  ^^ 
 
Art: 9/10 
Art was clean and interesting, there were really two styles, which is sort of hard to explain unless you watch it, there is the main style (like the image above) and a more serious one that comes up from time to time, mostly between the three Minami sisters when they become more serious between one another, whicch I found weird the first few times but it became normal and then sorta grew on me. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
Has become me second favorite series behind Lucky Star with ease, that should say enough (for me anyway). Highly recommended and one with a high rewatching value in my opinion, also note it has a second season Minami-ke Okawari 
 
 
(Note that this was my first MAL review, hope you enjoyed)

          
 
       Helpful I just recently finished watching Minami-ke, and now, among other watchers, I'm sure, waiting to see the second series because I just enjoyed it that much. 
 
Minami-ke's story is simple: 3 sisters living on their own living their daily lives. The pacing is slow, but since the genre is slice-of-life, it doesn't need to go any faster. No romance can be found here (though there are the slight moments of infatuation and sexual references).  
 
Each episode had something about it that usually would make one laugh out loud. There is just something about the girls' personalities and their relationship with one another that makes it so funny- especially with Kana and Chiaki. 
 
I loved all the characters, personal favorite being Kana, the densest of this sisters and also the craziest. Chiaki, the youngest sister, doesn't take crap from anybody, yet she shows a gentle side around her older sister at times. The older sister is Haruka, the domestic sister who plays the role of the mother (where are the parents, anyway?!). All the characters are so silly and likeable- including every supporting one as well. 
 
The opening and ending theme work well; I  liked the upbeat and wacky feeling to the opening theme. I also really liked the music in the background, each track fit in with what was going on with the scene. The voice actors were perfect- especially with Chiaki, deadpan, arrogant, and with a no-nonsense tone. 
 
To the bored, to the comedic anime-deprived, to anyone at all, Minami-ke is a perfect choice to brighten a day with its antics.

          
 
       Helpful I couldn't have finished it if they wouldn't have justified the boredom with the intro sentence explaining that this is just a story about 3 girls and nothing special. To be frank, this series is absolutely boring. I do have a broad taste in humor an also often laugh about things most people wouldn't even take as a joke - in short - i don't hesistate when there's something remotely funny. But in this show the only real funny thing was the running gag about the drama tv show the three sisters are following. ""sensei!"" ... ""ninomya-kun!"" ... ""sensei!"" 
 
That got me giggle every now and then, but the rest was plain mediocre. At some point i was hoping that they would turn it into a love triangle rom-com. Then at least something interesting would be going on.  
 
But, i don't wanna bash this show. In all fairness they at least apologize before each episode so i can't be too hard on them. It was alright, but do take the intro sentence seriously! They mean it. It is ordinary and may be overlooked without regrets.

The deadline nears with an answer yet to be found, when a single letter from a child arrives late at the company. As the letter is about to be handled as a defect, Noel and friends set out on an adventure for the present - but will Noel find the answer to her assignment? 
 
Set a year after the events of the novel.",['Fantasy'],"The story revolves around Noel, a young girl to whom Christmas is a particularly lonely time, as her mother left long ago and her father is too busy at Christmas time to come home.  One day when she's heading to her apartment, the elevator instead opens into ""Santa Company"", the headquarters of all Santa's operations, in Finland.  After some confusion she is brought into the introductory class where she learns how the company works, and then meets her father who works at the company as head of the present department.  She decides to become an apprentice Tonttu, which here is an assistance role helping wrap and prepare presents for delivery.  She has until dawn of Christmas Day to become a full-fledged Tonttu, but if she screws up she will lose her job and have to leave her new friends behind.  Unfortunately, no one can tell her how one graduates from apprenticeship, except that she needs to be able to ""pass the exam"" and be able to say just what the most important task of the Santas is.
Late on Christmas Eve, a single request is received, but it is too late to deliver the gift.  Desperate to be sure that child's present is delivered, Noel pulls her friends together for a desperate mission, taking the last remaining sleigh with her friends, at risk of her job and her whole life at the company.  They recruit Rudolph III, the grandson of the original Rudolph and the only reindeer that hasn't been dispatched due to his disposition: years ago an incident happened with the woman who used to ride with him, and since then he's refused to work; on top of that, the females don't pay any attention to him, making him even more grumpy.  However, when he meets Noel, who on top of being cute is almost identical to his former partner, he quickly agrees to help.  Along the way, Bell gives Noel a bell he picked up as a protective talisman.
On the way Noel's friend Mint finally realizes that breaking the rules like this would put Noel's future in jeopardy and tries to get them to turn around, and as she struggles she accidentally knocks Noel out of the sleigh.  She's saved by the shopkeeper who provides the presents, and he advises her that the answer to the exam is not something that can be taught or told, it's something unique to her that she needs to find herself.  As they continue their journey, they're attacked by a collection of ""mukku"", sprites similar to ball lightning.  They're saved by Pedro and the other Santas, who came to their aid, only for the remaining ones to join together into a powerful spirit that grabs Noel and tries to consume her.  Bell continues to attack the spirit and barely manages to save her, with help from the bell he'd given her that turns out to be a powerful talisman meant to remain sealed.  With the danger overcome, Noel's father calls and tries to make her return and leave the delivery to Pedro; however, he is eventually convinced to permit her to deliver the present as long as Pedro accompanies her.  After delivering the gift and reading the letter the child left in thanks, she decides that her answer to the exam, the most important thing about the Santa Company's work, is bringing smiles to all the children of the world.  In the party after the deliveries had been made, the shopkeeper talks to Noel's father about her and her mother, who actually was consumed by a spirit in an incident similar to Noel's own experience, a fact which her father'd kept secret from her.
Along with the full-length movie, a shorter, twenty-eight minute version was also released, which cut Noel's initial entrance to the company, the fight with the spirit, and various other scenes.
","Santa Company is a simple anime story about a simple question of ""What is the most important thing for a Santa Claus"" and it answers it in a deadline ride to answer that question. 
 
Hello and Merry Christmas (when LA wrote this anyways) and welcome to LA's Christmas Anime review of 2016. 
 
Let's talk characters, Noel White voiced by Ayumi Fujimura is essentially the catalyst to how this Christmas story is taken place, with Bell Crystal voiced by Yuki Kaji, Thomas Dou voiced by Rie Kugimiya and Mint Rondo voiced by Haruka Tomatsu helping Noel to find the present as well as meet the child who brought them the letter. There isn't much of characterization besides some stereotypical attributes to them, all merely because of the deadline assignment looming over these four characters. Bell is the level-headed one, Thomas the reluctant but helpful one, Mint being friends to Noel but also causes a small rift between them because of the assignment Noel was given, but it's merely glanced over afterwards. 
 
The characters aren't really what moves this plot forward as it's the plotline of the assignment. Really for a simple story about Christmas and having 20 minutes to do it in, LA really didn't mind it, as the journey itself was better than the destination. To be frank the ""answer"" to the assignment was predictable but still had that ""spirit of Christmas"" theme to go with it. The journey these four took was probably the best part of the 20 minute run though it had it's strengths and flaws too. 
 
The strengths just rather came outta nowhere and seriously THEY START PACKING HEAT, that's as much of a hint LA will say and it was crazily awesome in that regard, the other is in this anime special's theming of Christmas, it may be simple and slightly predictably cheesy but still that in itself is a strength nonetheless, the flaws came from sudden rift between Mint and Noel to cause drama when it really didn't need it. LA isn't even gonna blame the weak characterization as firstly, it was based after a novel, secondly and lastly, the runtime, so it's passed as LA giving it a bit of grace on that part. Where LA isn't however is in the other problem is that since this anime special is based on the events after the novel it is based on, this anime special dumps you right into it and to those who haven't read the novel are completely clueless to both the setting and it's ""already defined"" characters especially at the start but worse from it's stereotypical defined characters. 
 
In terms of animation by Nexus, the character designs had it's festive themes to it and LA quite enjoyed looking at the watercolored-pastel backgrounds and the rather unique ""Christmas"" aesthetics it put to Santa Company (both the actual in-universe company and the anime itself). Character designs were ok at best as they are decent enough but only remembered them by their hair color at best. Really, animation was at it's best in it's backgrounding and Christmas theming it did. 
 
In terms of seiyuu's, well LA got a bit ""they sound similar"" with this cast, at first LA thought that Rie Kugimiya was voicing both Mint and Thomas (as LA immediately took notice of Rie Kugimiya's little boy vocals, but at times Mint sounded very much in the range of Rie Kugimiya's typical tsundere vocals to almost sounding like Kanae Ito!). Oooohhh sorry once again Ayumi Fujimura but you along with Haruka Tomatsu both had some squeaky yet annoying vocals at times, Ayumi through Noel's shouting and Mint during the ""rift"". Seriously Ayumi Fujimura, first Seiken no Blacksmith now Santa Company, ahh well at least Noel got better by the final scenes of Santa Company. *ahem* got off in a tangent, LA's favourite voice actor would just go to Yuki Kaji as Bell Crystal as it was Yuki Kaji doing his stuff really, LA aside, there is some squeak from those two but nonetheless, the vocal cast is ""ok to decent"" at best but nothing to get TOO annoyed over and again the runtime can make you forget that. 
 
Santa Company, for what it presents is a feel-good anime Christmas special, that has a simple tale to tell and it tells it pretty decently all round, yes if LA takes this story too critically, it has it's problems, but for it's themes of Christmas and what the main reasoning as to WHY this anime's plot purpose is, then it succeeded.

          
 
       Helpful ""What is the most important thing for a Santa Claus' job?"" 
 
A short adventure of an apprentice tonttu, Noel, looking to finding her answer to that question.  
 
Story:   
A holiday movie focusing on one particular journey that Noel and her friends at the Santa Company make on one fateful Christmas night.  
 
For such a compelling premise of Noel's loneliness and a distanced father, I thought an opportunity was  lost by leaving such relevant flashbacks out of the movie.    
But that's dwelling on what could have been and not the present that was delivered to us.  
 
Given the brief length of the movie, the simple relationships between the characters were pleasant to watch.  
 
Art:  
The part where Santa Company really excelled.  
The character designs were varied and the animation well-done.  
The environment and locations were pretty and the action surprisingly intense at times.  
 
Sound/Voice Acting: 
14 tracks reflecting Christmas   
6 familiar voices of a star-studded cast   
And a ChouCho song in the ending.   
 
Character:   
Cute characters for a cute Christmas movie.   
Not much of a backstory for any of them but their interactions were fun to watch.  
 
Overall:   
I rather enjoyed this ambitious project by Kenji studio.  
 
It's not a social commentary on the holiday season one might have expected but a lighthearted adventure of one girl's determination to discover what it means to be a part of the Santa Company. 

          
 
       Helpful Christmas is a time for being with friends and family, giving gifts, and all around good feelings. And one of the ways of getting into the Christmas spirit is a good Christmas special. Its a good way to get the family (and friends) together to enjoy something with each other. Besides the gifts and food of course. And one of the things that you can enjoy is Santa Company. 
 
Santa Company is an anime short film from 2014. The short started out as a crowdsourcing campaign on the Japanese site Anipipo by Kenji Studio, a company started by the director of the short, Kenji Itoso. It's original goal was 1 million yen, and unfortunately it fell short of that goal. It was later re-launched on kickstarter for the lower amount of $50,000, which it managed to surpass, which i am glad for, because this short was a real surprise. 
 
The story follows a trainer of the Santa Company, Moel White, as she prepares for her test to become an official Tonttu, with her assignment being ""To find the most important thing for a Santa Claus."" As the deadline for the completion of this test draws closer, a single letter, a wishlist, from a child arrives late at the company. Soon, Noel and her friends set out to try and deliver the present before it's too late. 
 
Being just less than 30 minutes long, there's not enough wiggle room to try and talk about much of the story after the initial premise, so i won't talk too much about it other than to say that even thought it's simple and a bit cliched, it is appropriately adorable and it's worth checking out. It definitely doesn't overstay it's welcome with it's short run time, like a lot of other Christmas movies do. 
 
There isn't an English dub, but i didn't expect one because of it's meager budget, so it does limit it to kids who can read. But i figure there are enough of those who still enjoy Christmas specials along with enough adults who don't mind or enjoy Christmas specials aimed at a younger audience that there is an audience for this. It is also definitely nicely animated and it does have an adorable art style. 
 
Santa Company might be short, simple, and not bring anything new to the table in terms of Christmas specials, but it's not a bad way to spend half an hour around Christmas for those in the Christmas spirit and kids old enough to read.

0,1946,92,4.317540743314914,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Ashita no Nadja,"This story takes place about one hundred years ago. Nadja is a bright, cheerful girl who was raised in an orphanage near London, England. Nadja was entrusted to the orphanage when she was a baby. So she thought her father and mother were dead. But before her thirteenth birthday, she found out that her mother might be alive.. 
 
Nadja sets out on a journey to find her mother! With all of Europe as the stage, Nadja's exciting adventure begins! 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Nadja is an orphan who lives at the Applefield Orphanage, in early 20th-century England. Nadja is called by Miss Appleton, the orphanage's owner, to receive a package delivered to her. The gifts sent for her thirteenth birthday are a dress and a diary. She is told in the accompanying letter that her mother is still alive. She later joins a traveling street performance act called the Dandelion Troupe in search of her mother after a fire breaks out in her orphanage. She travels the world, finding many friends along the way that teach her things about herself, ultimately having to learn the truth about her parentage and discovering her own destiny.
","A modern television masterpiece is what this show is. Very few television shows, let alone longer than 13 episodes, are so well built, thought out and whole as this one and to top it all even the animation and sound production values are on a par with today's standards. 
 
A very recommended show to everyone, and a must watch for lovers of epic dramas, romances and adventure. 
 
Nadja is a young orphan girl who sets out of her orphanage to seek her family origins around europe of the early 20th century, armed only with her mother's party gown, journal and heart shaped brooch. She joins a traveling performance group and mutually falls in love with a young nobleman whom she meets along the way. 
 
Nadja's personal and private journey is about to end up as an affair to fascinate all of europe, royalty and working class alike. But two steps back - as opposed to the later half of the series, it begins in a rather light note which seems to be radiating, easy going, cheerful and impossibly optimistic - all flows out of the titular character's beliefs and way of view. 
 
Some of those episode might be misleading as the show's main core is very hard, almost ruthless intense drama. Some viewers might need to hold themselves down while the show sets up its world and premise, but they would be rewarded beyond compare. 
 
The writers, and voice actress Ami Koshimizu, made an excellent work with fleshing out Nadja's character. I found her fascinating and a character to look up to, she is very strong willed, brave, thoughtful, humble and kind hearted. I was surprised at how deeply her ideals and beliefs are tested and challenged as the series progresses. 
 
While Nadja is the most examined character throughout the show, she is accompanied by an impressively large cast of unique characters from different countries, social classes and economic levels. 
 
There are almost no stock characters or stereotypes, each background character stands by its own right and almost all of them are being treated as seriously as a main character in a every other show. They have strong dilemmas and a distinctive take on life, they easily receive amazing closures, conclusions and catharsis. 
 
Other than the excellent writing, the direction is also very precise. Each frame is carefully crafted and there's an impressive weight to light, shadows, colors and compositions. Takuya Igarashi (Ouran High School Host Club, Soul Eater) is the one to be thankful for and now everything he touches is automatically in my watchlist. 
 
To sum it up i can not stress enough how amazing this show is and how important it is for it to be more known and popular. If you're thinking even a little about trying it out then by all means GO FOR IT. 
 
Thanks for reading, and enjoy your journey.

          
 
       Helpful Ashita no Nadja....oh my god this anime! Before I go on with my review let me tell a short little story. A couple of years back, my brother and I started watching this anime not knowing what to expect. But before you know it we got so hooked that we saw that last 8 episodes in Spanish not understanding a word they were saying and with no subtitles just to see what will happen. This anime becomes an emotional roller-coaster maybe unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's a masterpiece and it's sad that most people don't know about it giving it's from 2004 and the fact that it was so rare to find anywhere. But maybe now if more people see it they will spread the word because anime fans need to see this! 
 
Now on with the review! 
 
Story 10/10: Not spoiling anything, the story revolves around Nadja, a young orphan who finds out her mother might still be alive and her adventures around the world in the company of the Dandelion troupe, a travelling group of street performers filled with colorful characters. It's a magnificent tale of discovery, wonder and awe. The story starts and keeps a rather cheerful tone until the third act when things get serious. You will get so invested in this after the first half that you will have to see all of it in one sitting. And I'm not saying the first half is bad by any means it's just the tone of the overall plot that differs. Starting with a revelation and a quick departure on an adventure, continuing to explore the joy of travelling around the world and ending with intrigue and emotional conflicts.  
 
Art 9/10: The art is very good for 2004 being colorful and elegant. It's joyful, intense and refined getting you really immersed into the anime. You can definitely see the effort put into this. 
 
Sound 10/10: The sound in this anime is excellent! Starting from the wonderful intro to all the other songs that accompany Nadja's performance with the Dandelion troupe, the themes and the ending, the sound is perfect in this anime. Everything you hear is like an year massage, it just sounds great.  
 
Characters 10/10: Oh the characters. There are allot of colorful characters in this anime and you will enjoy each and every one of them for their role, from the over the top villains to the joyful warm Dandelion members that make Nadja feel like family and the seriousness of the heroes. Nadja herself if very enjoying to watch because you can see her grow and mature throughout her experience around the world and also you really want to cheer for her seeing how she tries her best never to give up and works hard towards her goals. The male lead or leads which are also the love interest are really interesting as well. They are equally determined in their goals and interest for Nadja and feel the need to help her in every way possible. Their ways of achieving their goals is very different and their view of the world is also different but you will find yourself rooting for one or another or both nevertheless. The villains are great as well rating from silly to charming and over the top or to diabolically clever and maleficent. But they are not villains just for the sake of it, they all have their reasons, be them good or bad and they play a big part on how much you will get invested in this anime.   
 
Enjoyment 10/10: If you can't already tell I've really really enjoyed this anime. I consider it a masterpiece, and although subjective as this opinion might be I think everyone who will see it will think of it as either good or excellent if they are being honest. Like I said earlier it becomes so griping that you will skip a night of sleep with having to go to work the next day just to see it to the end.  
 
Overall 10/10: I can't rate this lower than 10. It's just such a great experience which I wish on everyone. This anime will make a permanent mark on you and you will never forget it. Give it a try, disregard the fact that it's a little old or longer than your average 12/24 episodes running shows today and watch it! You will not be disappointed! 

          
 
       Helpful Oh, Nadja. Where do I begin? 
 
Set in a story that takes place ""a hundred years ago"" which is basically the twentieth century, and they do tell you this a lot if you do not skip the opening and closing parts of the anime, this story tells of a spirited blond filled with brimming light, and nothing less, simply known as Nadja. And, something that will also be incredibly muttered throughout the entire anime, she is on a mission. What is it? To seek her dear mother, of course. 
 
Ashita no Nadja is one of the very few anime I have seen where I can not say it feels like an anime. Heck, I could compare it to the Dragon Ball franchise in that regard. I know very well what I am watching is anime, but it looks like it takes a style of its very own. 
 
Humorously enough, Toei Animation did indeed animate Ashita no Nadja as well, which was something I literally just discovered well writing this review and it made me laugh quite a bit since I made this example before I found this out. Life sure does throw things at you unexpectedly. 
 
Anyway, this anime quite obviously has all of the commonplace themes you will find in an anime. All the girls have big eyes, all the boys don't, comedy will exaggerate their bodily portions; you get the idea. But, as you watch it, sometimes, you might consider it something else due to how uniquely it presents the world around it. 
 
Nadja has a bit of what you would call ""protagonist syndrome"" but with the most generic trait of all: she is kind to everybody around her and only wishes for goodwill among all. It certainly was not gearing up to be one of my favorite anime at all with such a character, and I honestly believed I would grow tired of her very quickly. But, surprisingly, after about a dozen episodes (yes, you really do have to dive into this one before it gets good), I grew to actually love this character. I would go so far as to even rank her in my top five favorites. 
 
As I said before, she is indeed a spirited blond. Nadja has nothing BUT unwavering spirit! Her character very rarely becomes despondent, and it becomes very admirable as you watch her go. A bit similar to most journey anime, she will indeed meet a lot of people along the way. Her determination for her unique idealism, her compassion among her loved ones and her cheerful, bright outlook on life will never leave you in anything but awe. 
 
The anime calls itself a ""romance,"" but I feel it should have clearly put itself into the ""comedy"" genre as well, since I laughed at a vast majority of the episodes a lot. The visual gags are what will really set you ablaze if you are not one that gawks down at your phone the whole time you're watching; and if you are, please stop reading this right now and go watch something else. This anime demands your unbridled attention if you want to get the best out of it. 
 
This anime is quite silly! Most of the time, Nadja will puff up when she is angry or show one of the most adorable expressions you have ever seen. One thing I can say for sure is that Nadja's design is something you may never see again for a while, as far as unique flavor goes. Despite how adorable she is, her design is pretty simplistic to look at. And this is especially surprising, considering the time this anime aired. 
 
Of course, this anime is also a drama and it does this very well, too. Some of the more intense moments will leave you in tears, but the intensity level is usually not all that high most of the time. It will really warm you up to the adventure and characters before you come across any seriousness throughout, which is a very good thing since, at the pace this anime goes, it does indeed thrive with this kind of story progression. And, as it is also a romance, expect some pretty deep lovers' quarrels to occur throughout. Some of them grow rather intense, well others are much more lighthearted. 
 
But, the strongest quality about Ashita no Nadja does not fall in just its characters, the journey or even Nadja herself. No, it is the scenery; more specifically, the environments they travel, the places they see and the soundtrack that compliments. This anime would not have been nearly as enjoyable if it was not for how rich the art style looks. It gives off a plain look if you are a pessimist, but to any art lovers out there, this one will sweep you away with its simplicity in detail. And the soundtrack is something that any anime enthusiast could enjoy. I am still looking for it myself! But, you know how anime soundtracks are. If they are unreleased, you will never find them. 
 
So, if you are still with me, you may now you ask ""great, you told me the characters, the unique landscapes and all that, but what make this anime so great that you give it such accolades"" well, it is just that: everything I mentioned. That may not be the answer you were looking for, but I genuinely mean everything I said with a passionate heart. This anime thrives from its unique flavor in the art, story and soundtrack choices. Every now and then, they will dip into the public domain as some characters do learn commonplace music and play it, but the soundtrack you hear whenever the natural scenes occur usually have something original in place. It will certainly not be a soundtrack that you can forget. It is one I never want to forget. 
 
This anime is also quite long for being an adventure journey about a more realistic setting. Normally, these ones take place in fantasy settings or are action anime, so it is quite interesting to see one where the setting is still a journey, but not really about fighting a bunch of baddies or anything extreme like that; rather, about a girl that simply wants to find her special someones. An anime like this is certainly hard to jump into knowing this information, but if you do like comedies, dramas, romances or all of the above, then this one is the one you should watch. Oh, and it most definitely has shoujo in it, so it is something you would feel a bit embarrassed to watch when a friend walks in the room. Or, better yet, they might fall in love with it too. 
 
Oh, and you better be sure to watch this one with a full night's rest, because this one will bombard you with historical facts at times. If you are a fan of literature, this anime will not disappoint you there, either. You will learn more of the ancient civilizations, rural landscapes and their history. Of course, this is not heavily prioritized, but in some episodes, it plays a major role in the story. 
 
I want to say more, but I feel I should end things here. It is an anime that I want to make sure you see as brand new if thou hast never lain thy eyes upon it before. And if you have, show it to the world, show it to everyone that loves anime. This is one that I can say would for sure show to you all of the positives about anime, well also showing some of the negatives every now and then and even some of the cliché every now and then. But, the last one will definitely not really apply for newcomers. 
 
So, what are you waiting for? Are you ready to ride on a long journey with Nadja? Are you ready for all the comical mischief that awaits you and Her, alongside the seriousness, the wonderful places and the beautiful melodies? If so, then stop reading this right now, go boot up your favorite anime website and give it a go! Just note that, as I said before, despite all the optimism I show towards Ashita no Nadja, I did admit that it took me quite a while to really dive in. It might be the same for you, too. Maybe it will take more. Or, perhaps, maybe it will take less. Either way, do not leave it without giving it at least an hour of your time with a few episodes. 
 
Despite how comical I was with this review, I, again, mean everything I said with a burning passion. I love this anime a lot and it was an experience that reminded me why I have never stopped watching the stuff after so long. Truly one that, despite it having embarrassing moments alongside the comical and sorrowful ones, where you would feel a bit abashed if watching with a friend, is most indefinitely worth it to see it all the way to the end. 
 
Indeed, it has achieved a lot of impressive feats, despite being an anime before a manga.

       Helpful The story follows Shirase a super hacker known as BPS and its this name that is (in)famous for being able to use a phone or a computer to create defense barriers and the like and gets him hired by all sorts of government people. 
 
The show tends to run on a certain formula, through out 15 episode arcs are split into three episodes each, and each arc we find Shirase being hired to solve a case using his computer skills, he also tends to end up in a compromising situation every time his employer comes to visit him in which said employer will ramble to himself about morale before deciding to ignore it accompanied by a laugh track, and many other recurring jokes. 
 
The art is not great, it is very simple and uses rather dull colors and not a lot of detail is put into it such as character designs are unoriginal and simple, backgrounds as well aren't brilliant but do fit in with he dull colors again. Animation is bellow average with characters barely moving when speaking and background characters don't move when they should be. 
 
Opening song is quite amazing, sounds a lot like Rick Astleys Never Gonna Give You Up which does give you quite a good laugh listening to it, especially the first time. Ending is fun but no original but does fit the show, all other music sounds like something from very early Nintendo games and doesn't really add much to the scene. Voice actors are ok, a couple of characters give a really annoying voice but tend to fit there over the top character. 
 
Shirase is known as BPS or Battle Programmer Shirase and tends to be and act like a bum, often found in a small apartment sleeping and having his meals made by his great niece Misao, they have a somewhat complicated relationship, Shirases sister is Misaos grandmother, and then of course Shirase is a bit of a pervert who tends to like younger girls as he is often persuaded to do a job for either a computer part or some otaku merchandise and tries to peak up Misaos skirt. Misao herself tends to be a bubbly girl who helps out Shirase. Shirase is employed by a different guy each arc whose name is always Akizuki. Other characters tend to be cliche, a genius kid working for the navy, a teacher and a bad guy that seems to think too much of himself, they maybe rather simple but do add a few jokes that tend to repeat. 
 
Overall Battle Programmer Shirase may lack in all areas but it is fairly enjoyable watching Shirase kick the bad guys ass each time. Its also not all that ecchi but does provide a few laughs through out, just as long as you do not go and watch having high expectations.

          
 
       Helpful This series are entertaining, the most interesting part is making a story about a programmer and his works in a fun way. 
The story is a little of suspense, a little of romance, a few of fanservice and a lot of comedy, the fun part is how he manipulates the computers be by PC or cell phone by its programming to help the people hiring him in turn but instead of asking for money for his services he asks for very rare gadgets or nerd items. 
 
Not the best anime I've seen but more entertaining than most anime that had come out in last years mostly because the concept and idea of the story is a little more original and each episode you'll be expecting in what kind of situation he will be and how he'll overcome it. 
 
By the way the lolicon factor comes by the character Misao whom the protagonist has a ""very close"" relation, and if you didn't notice or didn't know Misao come from another not very related series, Pretty Sammy from the Tenchi Muyô universe you can tell by watching the character designs.

Unlike the historical war period known to us, all inhabitants in this unique world look like high school girls. Coming from the medieval era and finding themselves totally amazed by everything they encounter in modern day Tokyo, the girls become best friends through their adventures.  
 
(Source: Crunchyroll) ","['Fantasy', 'Parody', 'Samurai']","GameThe story is set in the tumultuous Sengoku Era of historical Japan, when military masters circle the figurative throne of Japan's first shogunate. In the game, ""God of War Cards"" have been sealed in six hidden treasures, and fighting breaks out among those who seek the treasures. As a new military master, the player embarks on a journey to obtain the treasures by clearing quests and fighting bosses.

AnimeIn a different timeline, female versions of generals from the Sengoku period vie for power. One day, a mysterious light sends Oda Nobunaga and several other generals to the modern day world. As each of the generals adapts to this new lifestyle, Nobunaga goes on a quest to seek out the other generals and retrieve their secret treasures in order to return home.
","Sengoku Collection is a series of mostly unrelated short stories about samurai from another world wreaking havoc in this one. They do this not by fighting, but by being extremely eccentric. 
Each episode focuses on one character who is usually not seen again after that, but they are all complete stories, so this is not really an issue. 
There is an overarching plot, but it's sort of in the background for the most part. 
Sengoku collection is full of yuri, so steer clear if you don't like that. Otherwise, it's a beautiful, if strange show, and I highly recommend it.

Story -4 
Ok I expected that to get the treasures to return back to the past Nobunaga would fight and destroy enemies and obtain the treasures and end up fighting some super boss dude who set them up to go to the future. Who knows, I may be right. However from reading the sytopsis and checking the number of main characters(25) I would bet that I am wrong. Basically there is just a bunch of random stories about different girls accepting their positions in the new worlds and nearly no action. 
Art -8 
Ok the characters designs are not my favorite but not bad either. 8 for quite nice 
Character-7 
Switching to a new main character every single episode could get on to some people's nerves. Well I got to 3 and I just assumed it would be like that but I really couldn't care less about the backstories of random girls. 
Enjoyment-5  
I enjoyed the first episode and expected greatness but the next episode was cute but not exactly what I wanted. Then I started the third episode and I couldn't bare to watch anymore. 
Overall-j6 
It really depends on your tastes. If you want to watch 25 different backstories of random girls from the sengoku period- go ahead. It has cute gitls and moderate humor and ecchi. However if you are expecting more of a plot( as I was) expect to be disappointed. I personally cannot stand things without a plot but everyone has their different tastes.

          
 
       Helpful Despite some decent sales and a large number of fan art in pixiv of Sengoku Collection, this little show has gone relatively unnoticed. Practically no advertisement,  unappealing art, and other shows taking the spotlight and it isn't too much of a surprise. That said I'd still like to make a decent review for people who might want to try it out. 
 
The show is overall mediocre. One of the main problems of Sengoku Collection is that it lacks any appealing or interesting plot. Sengoku warlords come to our world; they live their lives, some wish to stay while others want go back to the old world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well. Each episode is centers around a Sengoku-period warlord and each episode deals with said character's problem and how they cope with their new life. The problem is that the episodes are very loosely related to each other nor do they serve much semblance to main story, leaving the viewer with a show that is practically just slice-of-life. And really, some people might be fine with that, but why even attempt a main plot when you choose to not properly work on it? There is a certain nagging feeling once you finish the show that tells you this show could have been much more. 
 
The episodes and characters themselves are problematic as well. Some of the episodes are fantastic, some are mediocre, and some are just plain awful and a chore to go through. The good thing is that you might find a jewel of an episode you love while going through the muck; but you have to go through that said muck. The same can be said of the characters, some of which are horribly written and have so little relevance to their Sengoku image that they might as well not have been a Sengoku expy at all, while others are created with good thought and creativity. 
 
You may notice a number of parodies throughout the show as this was the little gimmick the show tries to play out. Probably something a lot of people will recognize is the Bowling for Columbine parody, one of the fewer funny and good episodes of the series. A lot of the parodies however are Japanese-related media so the average English viewer most likely will not get references. 
 
It probably doesn't need to be said that the animation and art is pretty low-tier. Just look at Kanetsugu Naoe's face and tell me you can actually take that seriously. It's even noticeable that in some episodes the production values and art drastically drop. Expect harsh disappointment for those who need grand visuals to keep you entertained. 
 
The music is fair and good in most regards. Dependent on the episode and parodies the music will have different styles and ensemble, and diversity is always a good thing. If you bother with the character songs that are still being released, they are pretty standard J-pop. 
 
Overall, Sengoku Collection is just average. There are episodes you will love and episodes that will having you sleeping from boredom. With poor visuals it makes it hard for an average viewer to be interested in finishing the whole 26 episodes. It really isn't something I can recommend to someone that doesn't have free time to spend.

Till Next Time.

          
 
       Helpful This is a quick fix if you want to see a small romance story. But it's fairly accomplished. 
 
Story: 
What you'd expect from a 25 minute story. There's barely any time to create a setting. 
You see a boy on a school trip, and that's your lead male. You see a girl of questionable origins and that's your lead female. And of course, a way (no matter how randomly made) for them to meet. 
 
Art: 
It's probably the most unusual thing about this show. Every single thing (except for some backgrounds and details) is animated with 3D models. Every character (which is kind of cheating the animation process IMO). 
This results in some strange facial expressions (mouth especially). And a few weird movements, but only for those with seriously honed observation skills. 
 
Sound: 
The sound was perfectly fit. As for soundtrack. It's just there. 
 
Character: 
Nothing special. It's a boy meets girl while girl meets world thing. Frequent anime viewers won't see anything new. 
 
Enjoyment: 
It felt better than when described by my words above. If you like romance and don't need much of a reason to see one happen, you won't feel these 25 mins were for naught. 
 
Overall: 
I rate it 7 for the quick fix of romance I occasionally need. Now I can get back to the serious stuff.

          
 
       Helpful This reminds me of going to giant Buddhist temples when I was travelling Sri Lanka and took those memories and added robots, cute girls and thugs. Super cool! 
 
I probably enjoyed this more than most would as I've long been interested in science fiction looks at religion. So this light sci-fi OAV short with a reincarnated temple priestess and giant Buddha (daibutsu) robots scratched a rare itch for me. 
 
There's nothing particularly deep here, it's just an innocent and pleasant romance with pretty cool art and animation. It's really the depiction of future Buddhism (which looks a lot like current Buddhism, which makes sense given that it has been around for a long time) that makes me love it. If that seems neat to you, you probably enjoy, otherwise there's other stuff that might be better worth your time.

The show features various fairy-tale-like stories presented in a very childish way with a hint of subtle humor mixed in. The fact that the series itself is an adaptation of a manga created by Katsuhiro Otomo, most famously known for creating the legendary Akira, never ceases to fill me with a strange sense of glee. 
 
Story - 7/10 
Hipira-kun's story is refreshingly simple yet unique. The story centers around Hipira, a young vampire that enjoys pulling pranks and generally acting like a boy his age. Along with his ghostly friend, ironically referred to as Soul, he experiences many exciting events throughout his daily life in the town forever consumed by night, Selta.  
 
Art and Animation - 10/10 
Hipira-kun is one of the most visually appealing series I have ever seen. Selta is a city filled with some of the most contrastingly different areas. Houses range from mid-evil castles to small wooden huts, narrow canals act as streets in some areas, and not to mention the giant lizard and fish sculptures that line the city. Throw in some of the most detailed work since 5 Centimeters per Second, and you have a visually stunning background that never fails to draw a viewer in.  
 
In contrast to the amazingly detailed backgrounds, you have the characters. These characters are rendered in CG and have little detail to them. The CG is not the blatantly obvious kind you see in most anime, but a very subtle form of CG that allows the characters to move freely and in excess, unlike many other shows where the characters often stand in one place for a few minutes at a time. This CG style is so subtle, that I often found myself questioning whether it was even CG or not. I have no idea how the studio did it, but this is a very unique form of animation that I would honestly not mind seeing in other shows. 
 
Sound - 7/10 
The background music for Hipira-kun is practically nonexistent. However, this is more of a pro than a con. It gives room for the viewer to hear the sounds of the city - water fountains bubbling, clocks signaling the time, and footsteps across the surprisingly empty city streets. 
 
The voice actors are also spot on. Hipira's in particular is very memorable to the point where I can recognize him from various other series and movies. 
 
Characters - 8/10 
Hipira-kun is a show mainly focused on two characters - Soul and Hipira. Hipira is a scamp of a boy, often pulling pranks on his neighbors and being late to class. He symbolizes childish innocence and it's very easy for anyone to see their past in him.  
 
Soul is his friend who appears to be a tad more intelligent yet naive. He is shown reading difficult things to Hipira, but when it comes to more social matters he is slightly clueless. 
 
Enjoyment - 9/10 
This series is lined with childish adventures that you can't help but relate to. The short but sweet episodes can't help but enthrall its viewer into coming back for more. Throw in a bit of more subtle comedy that older viewers would be able to pick up, and you have a show that will either lure in viewers looking for a comedy or invoke feelings of nostalgia and happiness. 
 
Overall - 8/10 
It was a joy to watch this show. This is most definitely a slice of life show done right, and I would love to see another season. Hipira-kun's only major flaw is the fact that it only has 10 episodes running at 5 minutes each, totaling to about the length of two average episodes. 
 
If you're looking for a show similar to the popular Yotsuba&! manga, then this is it. I highly recommend it.

","I really hate those wannabe writers, who think that they can just write a rip off, of the rip off, of the rip off, of the rip off, while changing only the names of characters, and try to monetize it. And some of them get away with it, that’s how we’re getting these new shows, that are nothing more then absolute trash, without any soul. Isekai Cheat Magician is that kind of show. You shouldn’t expect anything good from this, but it’s  actually not so bad that it deserves nothing more than 1/10, the fact that it’s so unoriginal, makes it insulting to watch, for this reason the score is so low score. So, without further ado, let’s dissect this cancer. 
 
Part 1: F the Fantasy 
JRPGs made my childhood, not only mine, but also millions of other people. I played countless hours in Pokemon, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and The Legend of Zelda. The time spent by the creators in making these fascinting worlds made me apreciate these titles so much. That’s why I loved imagining myself in them, and wondered what I would do in a place of main character. Turns out that I wasn’t the first person to think that. A whole new genre was created out of these thouhts.  
Isekai is fascinating in concept, guy or a girl is transported into another world, or they’re trapped in a game, where they need to start a new life, using the knowledge they aquired in the previous, where it would’ve normally be useles. The problem starts with how repetitive this got. I absolutely don’t understand why they stopped at fantasy setting, there’s so many other interesting genres. Also basically every isekai excluding No Game No Life, is making the same flaw that Tolkien had started, and that is every species needs to do exactly what was established in the earlier story’s. For example the ogres are warriors, elphs live in the peace with nature, and thay’re skilled at handling the magic, and so on and so forth. There’s never an explanetion of why something like this occur, it’s just simple copy, and paste from other fantasy titles. Everyone is just pretending „that’s how it was supposed to be, and every difference is a heresy”. If the author doesn’t care, why you should? 
 
Part 2: Story is laughable 
Finally I’m starting to talk about this show, so let’s go with the plot. It begens with two main characters walking down the street, then suddenly the bike is atacking them!!!! 
Altough sadly they avoid it and are teleported by some magic ring, that has apeared out of nowhere, to another world. I must say that if they died by being hit by a bike, it would’ve definitelly grab my attention.  
The only difference that this anime is proposing is a female counterpart for a protagonist. Although this turns out pathetic later, I'm gonna talk about this in the next part. 
The rest of the story feels like it was written… no actually drawn by a todller, and some adult thought that it’s a good idea to write a story based on this drawing. It is full of plot conveniences, deus ex machinas, incostinent characters, broken power ascalation, in the end I still don’t undarstend why it is called „cheat magician”, and the worst thing – it’s boring. If the writer don’t try, then why he even started this in the first place? Of course it’s for the easy money. 
 
Part 3: Formless goo, not characters 
Characters are totally riped off from other shows. There’s litterally nobody, who would even seem to be kinda original. They’re remembering me of those creatures from one scene in Inside Out where Happyness and Sadness go to the inside version of Holywood, and there are those beings that take some form if you see them by „dream lense”, and the script from wich they were acting depanded from what happened in the day of Riley.  
What I meant by this comparison is that those characters are basically those beings, when you watch this show, the „dream lense” is your monitor, and the script for them are characters from other shows. 
 
Part 4: The visuals are awfull 
It doesn’t feel right to give this, and Kenja no Mago the same score, the second one has at least kinda original plot, and the visuals were actually good. What can I even say about Isekai Cheat Magician? Animation is bland and disgusting, nothing that stands out. 
 
Part 5: Soundtrack is passable 
 To be honest I don’t really remember anything at all from the soundtrack, but maybe it’s better that way, if something did stand out, it would probably be so bad it would’ve made my ears bleed. And these are harsh words to the composer of Dororo soundtrack. But actually there was something that made my ears bleed, it was opening. I’m not a fan of Myth&Roid, in my opinion they made, at best 3 good songs, and one very good. And the ed was painfully avarege. 
 
Overall Thoughts: 
Why would you even consider watching this. Everything that could be done better was already made. Watching this is a painfull waste of time.  
Isekai is probably making it’s dying breath, looking at how many of those shows they’re cramming now, where practically every one of them is avarege at best, which most of the time, is a sign of a bitter farewell. I asked some people some time ago „is there any good isekai left” the answer wasn’t very reassuring, the future does not look too bright for this genre. 

          
 
       Helpful You can tell just how bad this anime is going to be by simply looking at the cover art. But hold up! That doesn't mean that this isekai doesn't have some unique elements! 
 
For one, it isn't just the Legendary Overpowered Super Excellent Revolutionary dude, or LOSER dude for short, who gets isekai'd to a fabulous new word. No, his female friend does as well! How shockingly unexpected! Also, this anime subverts your expectations by making you think that LOSER dude is going to get killed protecting main girl from an oncoming bike, but PLOT TWIST! It completely misses them and they just get sent to a fantasy world via a magic circle instead. How exciting! Finally, this was the anime that's come closest to making me fall asleep while watching. If it had actually succeeded, then it truly would have been one of a kind! 
 
With great innovative twists like these and (maybe) some others, this anime is surely spectacular, right? Well, it does unfortunately still contain many qualities typical of mediocre isekai... 
 
It still has an overpowered protagonist who can't fail, can do no wrong, and must have accidentally left his personality in the real world considering how bland he is. 
 
It still has cute girls that unfortunately have absolutely nothing going for them except their cuteness and their singular defining trope that lets you differentiate between them. 
 
It still looks bland with uninspired character designs, terrible animation complete with choppy movements, and background and scenic visuals that I feel like I've seen before. 
 
It still sounds like nobody with any talent was involved...wait, hold up. This anime has the likes of Takahashi Rie and Myth&Roid involved? Ok, I take back what I said about the sound department. But nothing else! 
 
It still contains a paper thin plot that nobody, including we the viewers, the characters in the show, and the writer himself actually cares about considering how generic it is.  
 
It still is boring as hell and I won't be watching any more of it. Props to you if you're somehow able to make it all the way through! 
 
But hey, the positives outweigh the negatives so much that this anime obviously still deserves a perfect 10/10 cuz a gurl iz isekai'd...or at least it would, but I was told to be serious in my scoring so...1/10 instead. Hooray...

Piisuke grows too big to stay in Nobita's closet and has to be moved to a lake. Nobita continues to visit him every night, bringing him food and playing with him. However, Nobita becomes sick and can't make it one night. Doraemon tries to feed Piisuke instead but comes home saying Piisuke is gone. It turns out though that because Nobita didn't show up Piisuke came looking for him. At first Nobita is angry that Piisuke came into town but doesn't stay angry long. Doraemon takes Piisuke back to the lake once the plesiosaur sees Nobita is ok. However, the next day when Nobita goes to visit him he hears that Piisuke was seen and when he gets to the lake it's flooded with reporters. Nobita is unable to get to Piisuke without being seen and goes home.
When night comes, Nobita goes back to the lake to try to get Piisuke away from the reporters. Doraemon acts as a distraction while Nobita uses the shrink and enlarge torch to shrink Piisuke so that he'd get in a cooler box. He escapes with Piisuke and he and Doraemon use the time machine to take Piisuke back to the Late Cretaceous. On the way there however the time machine is attacked by hunters from the future who intend to capture Piisuke. Nobita, Doraemon and Piisuke manage to escape but the time machine is damaged. They leave Piisuke in prehistoric times and return home with Nobita crying the entire way.
Gian and Suneo show up at Nobita's home and he's forced to eat a giant plate of spaghetti through his nose as he failed to show them a dinosaur. He tries to convince them that he does have a dinosaur but they don't believe him. When he goes to Shizuka's house to complain she doesn't believe him either. Angry, Nobita uses one of Doraemon's gadgets to show his friends Piisuke back in prehistoric times. However, they see Piisuke being bullied by sharp-toothed Elasmosaurus. Doraemon says because they were attacked while on the time machine they've accidentally left Piisuke in Cretaceous America instead of Japan. Nobita immediately drags every-one back to the time machine against Doraemon's advice and they return to Cretaceous America to save Piisuke.
They find Piisuke and Nobita introduces him to his friends, which also results in them apologizing for their previous behaviour towards Nobita. They plan to take Piisuke back to modern times and then to Cretaceous Japan. Doraemon however suggests that there's no hurry and they should have a camp-out; the reason being that the time machine has been badly damaged and Doraemon hopes to fix it before the others notice. However, when they're attacked by a Tyrannosaurus rex and the kids want to go home Doraemon admits that the time machine is broken. At first the kids are scared but Doraemon says they can use the bamboo-copters to go to Cretaceous Japan to take Piisuke back home and they set off on a long journey to do so, exploring the prehistoric world as they go. They then befriend a flock of Ornithomimus with Doraemon's special dumplings, who give them a ride before dropping them off at a lake. There, the group encounter a herd of Alamosaurus and are once again attacked by a Tyrannosaurus, but they tame it with the dumplings.
Then, after getting chased by a flock of Quetzalcoatlus, they are cornered by dinosaur hunters from the future, who want to take Piisuke from him. They say they will consider it and during the night, they make clay figures of themselves, put into clay cars controlled by a remote. The next day, their plan is discovered, Shizuka, Gian and Suneo are captured. Doraemon and Nobita rush to save them and all five have to face being eaten by a ferocious Tyrannosaurus. As it nears, they realize that it was one of the tame dinosaurs and chase the hunters with it, as well as defeating the hunter's pet Spinosaurus. The Time Police arrives on scene to discover the hunters in a cage, and the group gone. The five decides to walk to Japan by themselves and encounters the Time Police, who acknowledges their heroic actions with a salute. Piisuke is taken back to where he belongs in Japan and all five of them return home.
Using the time machine, they return to a few days before they went to the prehistoric era. Nobita's mom asks why they all pass by, Nobita says, ""We have something to do!""
","I'm bad with writing and this is my first review but the feel is strong in me after re-watching so i want to write one. 
The movie is about friendship, courage, love, fighting for good,... typical doreamon story, but it will lighten your soul from ecchi, dark anime nowadays. 
  
What i like about this movie was the story and music, Sukima Switch did very well.Although it was a remake, but it carried out a lot of things: lambent,lively,colorful art ; the sound is well-made: dinosaurs's roar,running sound very true... 
   
 
The original movie could not be outdone but this remake kept most of the good parts from the original and successfully breathed new life into the franchise with refreshing animation and many nice new additions. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Music:9/10 
Art:8/10 
 
My recommendation: watch it with your loved one or family and have a funny, feeling times or you can watch it alone to think about something deeply? LOL 
 
May be after watching it, you will find something that you missed?

In their adventure they give a revealing account kept secret by the Emperor, which Chaika, Fredrica, Toru, and Akari decide to uncover.

The Empire's lands were then divided by the alliance, who later formed the Council of Six Nations to bring peace and order to the land. In addition, Gaz's remains, which possessed incredible magical energy, was divided up and granted to each of the Eight Heroes, who used their shares for various reasons.
In the present, Toru Acura is an unemployed Saboteur (乱破師 (サバター), Sabatā) who is unable to settle in this peaceful era as there is no demand for his Saboteur skills, and thus he sees no meaning in his life. While out foraging in the forest, Toru encounters Chaika Trabant, a white-haired Wizard (魔法師 (ウィザード), Wizādo) who travels with a coffin. After saving her from a man-eating unicorn, Toru, along with his sister Akari, are hired by Chaika to gather the scattered remains of Arthur Gaz. It is revealed that Chaika is the former Emperor's daughter, who managed to escape in the chaos following her father's death and wishes to find her father's remains so that she can give him a proper burial. Over the course of the series, the group faces difficulties while facing against each of the Eight Heroes. Frederika, a shape-shifting dragoon who belonged to one of the heroes, joins their party. Meanwhile, the six nations sends the Kleeman Agency's Gillette Corps to hunt down Chaika to obstruct their quest in order to prevent another war. Other groups led by girls claiming to be Chaika Gaz also pursue them to take the parts.
","Fight scenes were still as underwhelming as season 1 and the saboteurs’ “super mode” – the Iron Blood Transformation – was sadly still lacking in badassery. One thing that kept me going was the introduction of the saboteurs' master, Shin Acura, as I was curious as to see how he and the protagonists would interact. I expected a friendly reunion but I was in for a surprise, so well played there. Also, I thought that this was one of the few better fights that this show had. However, I was glad that they expanded some more about Arthur Gaz but the overall buildup felt messy or like it was lacking a lot for me. 
 
Would recommend if you enjoyed the first season and would want something decent, or if you wanted to see more of your favourite characters in this show (if any).

Where the story ends by finding all the remains of the most powerful wizard of all time.  
By this phrase, I think you can guess how is this going to end...you know...he is the most powerful wizard of all time, and the smartest (or not). 
 
I got to be honest, I was kind disappointed with the second season. The first season had most of the story pretty cooked to be eaten on this season..But still this being an action anime, we didn't get the opportunity to see much action. The fight were probably the down side of this season, were there was always an overpowered side, with no suspense or excitement. It felt kind empty and sad. (""most powerful wizard my a**"") 
 
Weren't you here to see that badass dragon to kick some a**? Or him?  
 
The ending, in one word - empty. 
It told me nothing, is it a happy ending? But where is everyone? Is she okay? What?  
 
Let's stop the chitchat and go to what you came here for.

---- Story 7/10 ---- 
 
It's basically the continuation of the ""hunting"" for the remains of the ""most powerful wizard"", A.Gaz, but now even with that, they throw in a new quest to found a lost treasure of the wizard boss. But the sad part of the hunting is that it lost interest, there is no more sneaky peek saboteur getting into fights to steal the remains. Now they almost give them with no problems. And, being the last season, you can guess they get all the remains, the rest you can imagine what will happen...he actually is the ""most powerful wizard""...but cmon the MOST POWERFUL with a battle of that style? Nhaaa...and the ending, really empty. Just some random images put together. Not that good to end an anime. But still it was a solid story.

Well, this season was kind weak on ""telling"" the story behind of the 3/4 heros left, where the one more ""strong"" was the one that had the head. But still, it was forgettable. 
There were even more 2 downsides for the Character's.  
 
One: The final enemy. Being final, we would say it needed to be a nice and long fight. But guess what. Nop 
 
Second: The final ""form"" of Tooru, was so cool, but with a final enemy like that we didn't even had the opportunity to see and feel its true potential.  
 
The rest of the new characters presented were all forgettable. And me being stupid as I am, I was still hoping for my ""Romance"", but no, dont get that idea. There is nothing like that for you in here. 
 
 
---- Enjoyment/Overall 8/10 -----  
 
I actually enjoyed this anime. Not as much as i wanted, but still was kind satisfying. You have the fight segments mixed with some comedy, what was the refreshing side of it, by keeping you attached to the anime. 
Tbh, I felt a sadness inside be when I saw that this anime would only get 10 episodes...I was like will the fights and hunts fit in there? Well...it did...not like I wanted...but still.. 
I know mist of you will not agree with my final score. But I actually felt bad by giving a lower score to it. 
 
Just keep one thing in mind. No epic ending, No epic sounds, Funny and relaxing, small and fast. 
 
Thank you for reading everything (like you actually did xD) and give me your response to it. I will delete any kind of hate/troll/irrational comment to my profile. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Story--Hitsugi no Chaika: Avenging Battle, takes place a short time after the first series's climatic ending which left allot of questions. 
 
The series starts off with our main characters continuing their hunt for Emperor Gaz's Body parts. we also get too see the other supporting characters and how they're coping after the events of the first series's ending. 
 
The series delves between casual episodes of Chaika and gang meeting new faces whilst collecting body parts for Chaika to collect and bury. 
 
halfway through we get too see the true history of Chaika and the many other chaika's which I'll keep quiet about. The series picks up it's pace to a conclusion towards the final episodes and becomes very enjoyable. Unfortunately the last half of the final episode is a bit of a let down because well to put it simple, it just ends very quickly and suddenly and I came out feeling a little un satisfied by the ending. Take away the un satisfying ending and the story is really enjoyable and rich in story telling. 
 
 
Art/Sound- There's not much to say if you've already watched series one and if you haven't you shouldn't be reading this review yet nothing much has changed and it's still to a very high quality. 
 
Characters- were introduced to allot of new characters in the second series as well as a fair few new chaika's, Unfortunately again too go into detail of the characters will spoil allot. 
 
Overall-  The second series is still as strong as the first and is just as enjoyable apart from it's anti-climatic ending.

Unfortunately, Kazuma chose to bring Aqua herself and has regretted the decision ever since then.

The fun ride continues from the first season and we get to see Kazuma and his friends up the usual antics. The plots are funny and the story is mostly based on the manga(which is good thing). I would recommend that you read the manga along with the anime. 
 
The story progresses as the same in KonoSuba 1. The crew is up to their usual pranks and you get all of them together. Also joining the journey is the cute Chomsuke, who has become a sensation on the internet(I don't know why).  
 
The sexy masochist Darkness, cute Megumin(and her cuter friend YunYun), the great Damegami Aqua Sama and our hero Kazuma. along with the their friends continue completing missions.

       Helpful KonoSuba’s second season is here and it’s a fantastic follow up to last year’s fantasy/comedy series which deservedly became a massive hit among the anime community.  
 
One of the strongest points of this series is the characters and their interactions, Kazuma is one of the weird cases where I find the protagonist to be the best character of a comedy anime, he’s just such a lovable troll that has to deal with the weirdos around him, the first of them being Aqua, a cute but useless crybaby that has a godlike talent for performing party tricks. However, outside of that she lacks any other abilities despite being an actual goddess. Most of the time she’s a hindrance to the group but damn she’s great.  There is also Megumin, a chuunibyou that wants to see the world explode (and she will be the one doing it, one explosion at a time). Last but not least there’s Darkness, a holy crusader that does her best in the front line, blocking the attacks of the enemies in order to defend her allies… well, that and to enjoy the pleasure of being hit, just masochist things.  
 
While the main cast are great, the side characters are certainly capable of stealing the spotlight. For example, there's Wiz, who is supposedly on the bad side but is probably the nicest person around, and Yunyun, another crimson mage like Megumin that really needs some love and headpats, poor girl.  
 
The characters are very enjoyable to watch and their wacky, random adventures are always hilarious. Their gags stay fresh and funny due to all the different situations the characters are thrown into.  
 
The RPG-like world adds a lot of variety to the comedy via fantasy elements and characters/monsters. Most series that use this type of setting tell a more serious story but KonoSuba uses it for comedic purposes. It’s a great, well-executed parody of the genre. Even the supposed ‘enemies’ are hilarious characters that add a lot of fun moments to this anime. 
 
Excluding the first episode, that for some motive had a derpier look, the art of this sequel was like in the first season, shining in showing the multiple reactions of the characters with comedic faces that add a lot to the humour of this anime. The music is similar to the first season, with a special mention for the new opening ""TOMORROW"". It does a great job of showing what the anime is about, a bunch of weird people having lots of random, fun adventures. It's so easy to get in the mood for an episode once that opening starts playing. 
 
As someone who really enjoyed KonoSuba, this sequel offers the same great comedy while putting the characters into new different hilarious scenarios. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season. 

          
 
       Helpful The adventuring foursome of misfit adventurers returns in the ever-exciting season two of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! With new adventures to be had and an overall shift in focus, does the second edition prove a fitting continuation? I would say yes, though it's not without its problems, all discussed in the following text. 
 
As a disclaimer, this is mostly a comparative review, therefore much of this review relies on comparisons to the quality, experience, and enjoyment of the first season. No major spoilers are unveiled for either season, but a proper understanding and foundation of the initial series (or light novel) is recommended. 
 
How do the seasons compare? 
 
What's changed for the better? 
-- additional character development for characters left lacking previously 
-- supporting characters are given more screen time 
-- more personalized dialogue, where inter-character relationship sees a boost 
 
What's changed for the worse? 
-- moderately reduced animation quality, moreso inconsistent than anything 
-- a deviation from the first season's identity as a RPG-style world 
 
Story 
 
KonoSuba 2 picks up from where the first season left off, as Kazuma Satou, notorious NEET and main character, is under trial for causing the destruction of a noble's mansion. He nearly faces execution until Darkness invokes her authority as a noblewoman and manages to get him a reprieve, though he must still pay back the debts. Prosectur Sena, meanwhile, follows him and the crew around in order to see whether or not he works for the Devil King's army. The series continues following the party around as they seek new ways to generate income in order to pay off their debts, continuing on further kill quests and even involving a dungeon mission. When a great wealth inevitably befalls Kazuma, does this spell fortune for the young man's otherwise misfortune stay in this wonderful world? 
 
For the most part, the plot of the second season is enjoyable, with progression being dominated by mini-arcs. There are two episodes where a specific dungeon is visited and revisited, an area that truly had some great dialogue and fun new characters. That zone, particularly, really seemed to get the spirit of the series, and it's there that the second season shines. Later on, a tourist city complete with its own hot springs and fervent cultists becomes another source of great moments. In regards to the ending, the crew was faced with an ""emergency quest"", as in another boss, and everyone got their own time to shine in the final battle, much to my appreciation. Each individual mini-arc had something unique to itself that let it shine as a part of the series. 
 
Once again, however, the season was relegated to a stunted length of ten episodes. As much as I complain about this low a count, it would be okay if the series progressed as a ten episode series should. With the first season feeling like it ended prematurely and without much conclusion, so too did the second. I can see this becoming a dangerous, even harmful trend for the series if a third season arrives and concludes with the same pattern. 
 
Considering the popularity of the series, I can't imagine that we wont be getting a third season, but personally I'm more inclined to combine everything into a standard 12- or 24-episode package and develop additional seasons from there. While the light novel / manga itself may be structured as a long-lasting epic, anime series constrained to ten episodes a season do not have that luxury (unless you're One Piece), and the creators may find themselves losing their audience if stability is not achieved. 
 
Genre & Characteristics 
 
On the whole, stylistically, KonoSuba 2 continues in its predecessor's footsteps. I do feel like the series undergoes a heavier ""adventure"" focus, with the group actually travelling around rather than just using the town as a questing hub. As for the other elements of the fantasy lore and lewdness, they remain strong, integral parts of the series. 
 
However, much of the ""gaming"" and ""progression"" appeal as previously shown in the first season was largely absent by comparison for this one, only showing any major relevance in the dungeon scenarios. While there are heavy moments of combat and even gear acquisitions, action slows to all but a halt in the latter half of the season, causing the series to develop more as a fantasy comedy rather than an action/adventure anime. Don't get me wrong, I actually think this season was far more humorous than the previous, but seeing a deviation from what I thought was one of the series' strongest and most unique elements in its RPG-style progression proves a detriment in my opinion. The biggest issue of the story for me involves the lack of direction or focus, and now I'm starting to see that indecisiveness bleed out into the overall foundation. 
 
Animation 
 
Most unfortunately, the biggest detriment to KonoSuba's second season is the distinct drop in animation quality. While I found myself a fan of the first series' visuals, the style of KonoSuba 2 often seems to skate the realm of laziness. Characters are much less fluid and even odd looking at times, quite a difference compared to what was experienced before. Whether it be an issue of budgeting or change in staff, my enjoyment was noticeably affected as a result. With this in mind, the reduced quality applies mainly to character animation, as the various backdrops and visual effects of combat aesthetically pleasing and even outstanding as before. 
 
Sound 
 
Fortunately, the soundtrack retained much of the coziness you'd find in the previous season, and the setting is represented well this way. Both the opening and ending were great, particularly the latter as its voiced by the characters themselves.  
 
The seiyuu, both returning and new, also performed their roles spectacularly. One of the strongest suits of KonoSuba, both new and old, has been that the characters feel exciting and live. Voices often have a serious impact on how accurately a personality is emphasized, from Aqua's high-pitched, pompous tone to Yunyun's shaky but confident spirit. 
 
Characters 
 
Further to the credit of the season, each of the main characters are as entertaining as always, and some of them received the development that was seemingly absent from before, notably Darkness through her mini-arc. The character cast remains largely the same, though we do have the introduction of new characters Yunyun, crimson demon and self-proclaimed rival of Megumin, Vanir, maniacal entrepreneur and Devil King general, and Chomusuke, Megumin's adorable black cat. Others, such as Wiz and Eris, receive a great deal more screen time, with the former potentially become a member of the party herself! 
 
There's an abundance of fun scenes between the characters, greatly highlighting the new direction of the series. The spirit of discovery and togetherness is really highlighted in this season as we see the party members further bonding together, though not without their previous incompatibilities. Personally, I really enjoyed the various ""rival"" matches between Megumin and Yunyun, as the latter tries her damnedest to match up with Megumin yet to no available. 
 
And yes, again, Megumin is still best girl. This will still be true in season three. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The best way to boil down KonoSuba 2 is that substantially it has improved, though aesthetically it has suffered, with an exception to the former regarding the ambiguous direction the series is heading. How good the second season is will largely differ person-to-person, and I've noticed it's certainly been a polarizing release. I personally found it more enjoyable thanks to the heavier character focus and improved adventures, though others may find themselves too distracted by the lack of focus or inconsistent visuals. At it's core, KonoSuba 2 remains a fun series, and regardless of whether you like it more than the first season or not, you'll enjoy it just for being KonoSuba.

And to bring even more worries, their new fleet commander is from the Bebous family, a family notorious for their ""Spectacular Insanity"".  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Military', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']",none,"Please watch  Crest of the Stars before starting this series for maximum enjoyment and understanding of the plot. 
 
Seikai no Senki, or Banner of the Stars, is the 13 episode sequel to Crest of the Stars. It follows the development of the relationship between Lafiel, the Abh princess, and Jinto, son of the administrator of a planet that surrendered and got his family made into Abh nobility. 
 
In Banner of the Stars, Lafiel is now captain of her own Assault ship. Jinto, who promised Lafiel that he would study hard and become a supply officer, has been requisitioned to join Lafiel's crew aboard the Basroil. He brings with him Diaho, the ginger cat Lafiel bequeathed to him at the end of Crest of the Stars. 
 
Banner of the Stars is about the Abh Empire's quest to retake territories they lost to The United Mankind. As such, a majority of the story is made up of battle scenes, which are quite well done. The only drawback to the animation is that they re-used those scenes a LOT, similarly with the soundtrack, or I would have rated it a lot higher. 
 
Character development again, is key. You identify with Jinto, and to a lesser extent, Lafiel. There are those characters that you love to hate, and those are well done also. Even Diaho, the cat, is a character in his own right. 
 
The story was a lot better than Crest of the Stars, and overall Banner of the Stars was good, just not as outstanding as some of the other high quality recent releases.

          
 
       Helpful Banner of the Stars, as you all know, continues from where its prequel series Crest of the Stars left off, and so the basic premise and setting is the same here too. Humankind is under attack by the Abh Empire, and it is up to United Mankind and their allies to stave off the impending advance after a temporary ceasefire...wait, that's wrong, you say? I didn't actually say anything inaccurate here...oh right, I forgot - silly me - this story is told from the invaders' perspective, and it's them that you're supposed to root for. 
 
Sarcasm aside, given just how utterly horrified I was by Crest of the Stars (scoring it a 1/10 in my review), you might wonder why I even bothered with the sequel. The thing is this - this show seemed to be more about its battle than about its political justifications, and given its undeniable artistic talent, I figured maybe there's actually some scope for enjoyment here as long as you could put the god-awful politics aside - temporarily, at least. Unfortunately though, even on its own terms, the battle simply isn't what it was initially made out to be - not unlike the prequel series. And on the other hand, it isn't long before the horrible politics creep right back and break your immersion anyhow. This right here is the long and short of it - the rest of my review will be about justifying and elaborating on this stand. 
 
The show starts off getting you up to speed with the current status quo, as well as the military logistics of the Abh fleet. It also introduces you to the crew of the attack ship Basroil captained by our lead character Lafiel Abriel, with our other lead Lin Jinto serving as a supply officer. A Terran combat veteran called Samson is notably part of the bridge crew, along with Ekuryua, a somewhat withdrawn and introverted Abh girl who seems overly attached to Jinto's pet cat, and another Abh lady whose name I forget. Also introduced are the various Abh military commanders whom I'll get to later. The show wastes no time getting into combat mode, and before you know it the introductions are over and you're thrust into the immediacy of the war. One thing that the Seikai series as a whole does deserve credit for is its pacing. 
 
Now there are two levels at which the battle is depicted: at the here-and-now tactical level, we're shown the trials that the leads face and how they deal with them; and at the strategic level, we're shown various higher-order commanders as they squabble amongst each other and come to crucial decisions. And here's where it gets interesting: at the level of the here-and-now, the show puts you in the hot seat of the front-lines alongside Lafiel and her crew, and gives you the impression of a gritty and dogged battle against overwhelming odds. Every one in the bridge is practically sweating from the tension, and sirens start blaring across the board as one sector after another of the ship take increasing amounts of damage. The tactical breaks provide very little in the way of relief. 
 
And in between all this, the focus shifts to the higher-order commanders as they deal with the bigger picture and strategic aspects of the battle. But in the war room, things seem almost downright boring - the commanders seem supremely sure of themselves to the point of detachment - one goes for a bath in the middle of all the fighting, and another makes a game of pestering his understaff about her personal relationships. All these 'cute' scenes in the high command ships are supposed to showcase the Abh's supreme competence, and their capacity for mischievous joviality even in the heat of battle. But when the show nears its conclusion, all this charm comes undone when an Abh commander commits a shocking act that reveals what the real stakes of the battle were all along, and makes all their previous joviality and nonchalance come across as rather obscene in hindsight. 
 
Another thing to note is that the battle is depicted solely from the Abh's standpoint: you only get to see the Abh side of the strategising, and you only ever learn of United Mankind's strategy or tactics through the obstacles the Abh side faces. So on one hand you get to see how chivalrously the Abh face off against their opponents; and on the other hand how dastardly the enemy is...because that's what they tell you. One unintentionally good thing about this one-sided view of the war, though, is that the enemy is never given a face this time. You only get to see either their ships or mines being blown up. No dastardly, gratuitously-villainous, moustache-twirling military commanders from the ranks of United Mankind plague the screen this time around (that job is taken over by the Abh commanders, albeit unintentionally). 
 
With that out of the way, it's now time to address the Elephant in the Room i.e. the two-faced politics of this show. No, you saw this coming a mile away - and no, there's no getting around this. Because quite simply, not only is it thematically central to the whole story, but it also taints and utterly poisons everything it comes into contact with. So anyways, we're right back to what Crest of the Stars did worst - any humans who do not wholeheartedly and with tears of gratitude accept Abh overlordship are portrayed as corrupt, greedy, morally broke or otherwise generally pathetic. The president of the Aptic system, which the Abh forcefully took over, gives a defiant speech to never surrender to the Abh invaders - but he is shown to do so just to look good to his voters. He even suggests behind-the-scenes that the Abh retort with racist and condescending insults to spice things up for the cameras. The Abh's offer to accept surrender from the Aptic government without imposing any deadline on them is made to look like a magnanimous act of generosity. Even those working for the Abh fare no better - a nation is shown to have joined with the Abh simply because the Abh didn't object to their dietary habits whereas the Terran alliances were absolutely appalled (if you must know, they ate cats - no, I'm not making this up). 
 
And then of course, there's the United Mankind - the only force in the Galaxy that poses any credible threat to Abh dominion. Their policy is depicted not as a legitimate political resistance to the Abh's unilateral aggression (which it easily could and should have been), but as a dogmatic mission to either enslave or exterminate the entire Abh race. And surely enough, they are portrayed as genocidal fascists (albeit off-screen this time) who do not consider the Abh to be human, and thus see it as fair game to disregard their enemy's basic human rights - during combat or otherwise. 
 
On the other hand, Abh commanders like Crown Prince Abriel and Baroness Spoor or even the Bebaus twins, whose actions would have clearly branded them as war criminals in just about any other narrative, are not only never (intentionally) made to look bad, but rather made to look like eccentric geniuses whose outwardly obnoxious antics belie just how ""wonderful"" and compassionate they supposedly are beneath the surface. The show accomplishes this with its singularly worst act of hypocrisy - while it's abundantly clear to any rational person that these commanders took many of their decisions with a callous and blatant disregard for human lives, their actions are ultimately justified by the show on grounds that these decisions somehow end up working out for the best. A related point is how the show expects you to overlook all of Abriel's needless endangerment of his own troops because he expresses the coy sentiment that he'd never be able to forgive himself if anything happened to Lafiel (his distant descendant) or Jinto. The exact same issue loomed in Crest of the Stars as well, and Banner of the Stars continues in the same dishonoured tradition. 
 
Later on in the series, the Terran-born Prime Minister of the Abh Empire has a brief parting talk with the infamous eyepatch-wearing ambassador from the last series, where he praisingly refers to the Empire as ""the only force in the galaxy that can impose modernity on the surface worlds"". That right there is the big pretext that the show provides to justify all of the Abh's military aggression over anyone who seeks to oppose their completely one-sided dominion over humans. I continue to be surprised at how many people seem perfectly fine with this. 
 
To make things worse, the show doesn't just leave things be even here: even when the crew are on their down-time and just breathing, either reflecting on their lot or even just making small talk, the show takes every opportunity to illustrate how superior the Abh are in every conceivable shape and form, and just how hopelessly unattainable that superiority is to ordinary humans (again, this ties in with the show's justification of the Abh's forceful takeover of human worlds). It may not be as blatant as it was in Crest of the Stars - but it's there, believe me. And it's done much more subtly this time. 
 
Which brings me to the show's perhaps craftiest sleight-of-hand: during one of their breaks from the fighting, Jinto has a chat with Lafiel - reflecting upon his lot in life, the position he's been thrust into, and his possible career options from that point on. Lafiel also shares some of the decisions she's made about her own future. Throughout the span of that discussion, their relative lack of freedom and legroom within their position as Abh nobility gets brought up time and again, given just how pervasively it is a part of their reality. But under no circumstances is the Abh system itself, which is actually the root cause of their plight, ever brought into question or criticised. The most dumbfounding moment is when Jinto briefly contemplates giving up his title as Count of Hyde and simply returning to his homeworld, but then decides against it because he thinks the people would look down upon him for chickening out of his role as their overlord. Are you KIDDING me?! The people of Martine long for Independence from Abh dominion, and if an involuntarily-appointed governor were to turn down that post and return home, that would make a bold and heroic political statement against the Abh, and the people would have welcomed him home as a goddamned HERO!! Nope, Jinto has no choice (in his own mind, at least) but to continue in his dual roles as a petty officer in the Star Forces on one hand, and a puppet figurehead for Abh rule on his homeworld on the other. Interestingly though, there is one character (and an Abh one at that, to boot) who implicitly criticises the ways of the royals, but  the show plays it away as an intentionally spiteful remark made by someone holding a personal grudge, rather than a genuine grievance. 
 
On the technical side of things, the animation is somewhat better than the positively freakish fare that you had to endure last time. The sound and audio cues are pretty much exactly the same as last time, and they mostly do their job quietly and unobtrusively. The opening score, on the other hand (and especially the eerily ominous drum-rolls whenever the voice-over narrator or anyone else speaks Abh-tongue), made me feel deeply uneasy and nauseous - in much the same way that Richard Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyrie"" today invokes imagery of cold-blooded monstrosity because of its rather unfortunate appropriation by the Nazi regime. 
 
As for the characters, things are more or less exactly as they were in the last series. Jinto once again proves himself to be an accomplished sycophant. This time around, he is given more space to ""develop"" - as in, more airtime to express his self-pity with melodramatic wistfulness. Among other things, he broods that no one will miss him when he dies (awwww), and that he won't be around for as long as Lafiel. You know what, his worries might be unfounded - even in his early twenties, he still looks like a 14-15 year-old, and still retains a husky adolescent voice...maybe he has defied the odds and hit the genetic lottery after all! The show also tries to ""humanize"" Jinto by showing how he winces and cringes in embarrassment at having to read out the Abh's official statements of hostile takeover, but it's a diversion from the plain-and-simple fact that he is perfectly OK with what the Abh are actually doing - the hypocrisy on display is simply sickening. Lafiel is, of course, exceedingly good to Jinto as always, and unfailingly dutiful to her crew - but underneath even that generous and dutiful personality is an uncritical mind, and an unwavering loyalty to the very system that serves to oppress her (and not to mention entire planets besides). 
 
Overall, Banner of the Stars retains the core essence of what made Crest of the Stars so sickening and reprehensible. But where Crest of the Stars provoked shock and outrage, Banner was more of just constantly annoying. The stakes are not something you can sympathise with without rooting for criminal invaders, and that's primarily what breaks the immersion factor whenever you're reminded of it. As for the battle itself, as gripping as it may initially seem, it proves to be more one-sided than it was made out to be, and basically depicts the wholesale slaughter of conveniently ""evil"" enemies in a glorifying light. If it seems ""better"" than Crest of the Stars, that's only because it has less obviously-offensive scenes, and instead goes for making subtler insinuations during the more ""quiet-time"" interactions between the characters. And finally, as much as you may try, it proves impossible to separate the artistic good from the thematic poison of this show, as every event and every interaction is inextricably linked to its reprehensible ideas. It proves once again that it's just not possible to make good wine from bad grapes.

When looking at an anime like Banner of the Stars I, it becomes an interesting task to put one's own life into perspective. While they are dealing with space, war, and strategies, it makes our own problems seem miniscule in comparison. Forgetting to turn off the light in that room, misplacing the car keys, or not having something nice to wear for dinner become afterthoughts instead of vitally pressing issues. But what this next iteration in the Crest of the Stars series shows is that, despite such massive hardships encircling our persons, those insignificant details somehow always matter. 
 
STORY 
 
Banner of the Stars I takes place three years after the events of its predecessor, Crest of the Stars. Jinto has been educated as a supply manager, Lafiel has taken command of the assault vessel Basroil, and together, alongside a few other crew members, will be joining in the war against the Triple Nations Alliance. 
 
Banner of the Stars I looks to separate itself slightly from its initial season by attempting to strike a more unified balance between the space-time exploits and the more grounded character exploration. Whereas the first season focused mostly on Jinto and Lafiel's relationship with the war acting as the backdrop, the second season spreads out the character focus while having the war acting as the stage. What is given, then, is a look at the various people attached to the battles and a surprisingly high degree of diverse scenarios. For example, the anime will show the terror of fighting a disadvantaged battle or the bravery needed when abandoning a ship one moment and having crew members sit down for a drink or showcasing the commander and his chief-of-communications bicker about her love life the next. The aforementioned talk of perspective encompasses the entire season, showing that both the large scale conflicts and the smaller scale conversations are equally important. 
 
And this is something that is desperately needed. Not that it can't be one way or the other, but because the show requires both time and connections for the cast at play in order to make their inclusion meaningful. Having such brutality depicted means nothing if the majority of the pieces are expendable or forgettable. This obviously isn't true for Jinto and Lafiel; we have their background and established relationship, and therefore their predicaments carry the most emotional weight. Which is why so much focus is placed on Samson the country-dad, Atosuryua the Hecto-Commander, Admiral Abriel the calm and persistent leader, and the insane Bebaus Brothers. But it also serves another purpose: showcasing the multitude of parts, or perspectives, on the war itself. Not everyone revels in the fighting for the same reasons. Lafiel does it out of honor, to prove her worth; Nereis does it to combat his and his family's unkind reputation; and Admiral Spoor does it because she has nothing better to do. The sequences themselves are always well done, but because the anime nurtures the characters so equally, it makes them all more than just action without substance. 
 
Unfortunately, Banner of the Stars I follows the same negative that Crest of the Stars employed, and that is losing itself thematically. There are essentially three different ideas being tossed around by the show: the concept of death, having a place, and knowing ""who you are,"" each of which revolves around Jinto. The first, on death, is looked at nicely enough. The previous event of Baron Febdash's killing sparks thoughts in him, he witnesses destruction all around, and he has personal, near-death experiences. And so what is discussed are the ""duties of the living"" and learning that nobody, no matter their standing, has someone there who cares for them. Sort of piggybacking on this motif, ""having a home"" is loosely talked during particular scenes, but only when convenient and therefore being rather lackluster. The final theme of existentialism comes out of nowhere and only serves to cloud the already explored messages. The anime wants to tackle these ideas, but cannot, due to either time, focus, or (most likely) both. These halfhearted attempts thus serve as nothing more than hindrances in the end. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Much of the action and the ""action"" within Banner of the Stars I takes place within space and the inner confines of the vessels, respectively. The locales usually don't contain a wealth of originality -- space is expansive and black, space-time fusion is sometimes colorful, the main deck and other rooms are almost always bluish-gray, etc. -- but they do contain a nice amount of detail. Banners, three-dimensional maps, aquariums, viewing windows; in order to combat the ""staleness"" of the environments, the show does what it can to make each one feel separate and unique. 
 
The character designs remain more or less the same for Jinto, Lafiel, and Admiral Spoor (besides seeing her with her hair down). The newcomers each have their own signature looks -- Samson with his scar, Ekuryua's glazed eyes and short hair, and the Bebaus Brothers' twin-style designs -- are futuristic but not overly unrealistic. Alongside everyone's respective war outfits, everyone fits the part. Also of note are the differing vessels -- the attackers, the patrol ships, the flagships, etc. Some appear specialized (Spoor's red-and-pronged behemoth), most appear similar (the Basroil's black painting and anti-proton cannon are common, as are the United Mankind's signature green ships), yet all are nicely detailed. 
 
Banner of the Stars I contains many more battles and skirmishes when compared to its former season. For this reason, the actual animation is above-average. Lasers fly, mines target, explosions are rampant, battleships move, characters react; there is a plethora of opportunities for the anime to strut its stuff, and takes as many of these chances in which to do so. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
As has already been pointed out, Banner of the Stars I effectively spreads out its resources when dealing with its characters. While this provides a more well-rounded experience, this leads to a poor side-effect: the stagnation of Lafiel and Jinto's characters. 
 
Crest of the Stars introduced, characterized, and developed our duo quite nicely throughout its run. This time, they simply seem to stagnate. Lafiel remains proud and determined, but doesn't receive nearly as much attention as should be warranted to her. The show provides her with some humanization in the form of very tiny reactions and monologues when thinking or interacting with Jinto. But they're rather insignificant and often ignored, even by her. Other insights are given -- such as her stance on death and her convictions as a captain -- but they only help to drive the story, not propel her character. 
 
Jinto suffers the same fate. Even after taking into account all of his philosophical questioning, he never seems to take any of it to heart. Focusing solely on the most concentrated theme, the war surrounding him gives ample opportunities to try to understand life, death, and his position within it all. But there is no real resolution to the thinking; it merely ends once Lafiel comforts him by stating that she would most certainly be saddened by his passing. This peace of mind is cute, and while it moves their relationship forward ever so minimally, it unfortunately doesn't mean much in relation to this season since so much time was spent away from the couple. If anything, Jinto pulls out marginally ahead of Lafiel due to Diaho. The cat garners a lot of attention, both from the crew members and from the narrative, serving as symbolism for what Jinto's person should be. He is constantly debated on: with Diaho's memories of others questioned, whether the ship is appropriate for him, and his seemingly carefree nature in terms of the situation. In other words, everyone (including Jinto) describes the lovable pet in such a way that is applicable both to him and his master. Diaho isn't worried about death, doesn't mind the home he has, and hasn't questioned his being; he simply looks to enjoy the time he has now, doing what he loves (catching mice), relishing in other's company, and experiencing what life has to offer. That is, having such a grandiose perception of the world may not always be the right way to take things. Sometimes, all that you need to worry about has been next to you this entire time. 
 
The newfound focus on the side cast is a boon, despite it simultaneously being a hindrance to the main cast. There are essentially three other duos besides Jinto and Lafiel: Nereis and Nefee, Admiral Abriel and his chief-of-communications, and Admiral Spoor and her chief-of-communications. Despite all three of the couplings being more or less the ""same,"" each has their own nuances and specific interactions that make the war itself feel more human. The Bebaus Brothers are true siblings; they bicker and quarrel, but respect each other's viewpoints. Abriel teases his right-hand officer constantly; quite uncharacteristic for the leader of the largest empire in the galaxy. And Spoor revels in riling up her closest confidant; she finds it more fun to be a sadist towards him than actually participating in the battles. Each dynamic never feels abnormal, even with the craziness of the skirmishes enveloping everyone. And it's not just these pairings. Jinto and Ekuryua, Lafiel and Atosuryua, and Samson and Sobaash are other relationships that provide similar offerings: a unique and realistic set of interactions. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP remains nearly the same as the one used in Crest of the Stars. It's majestic, orchestral, and fitting, making it a wise decision to keep it around for this season. 
 
The ED is surprisingly good. The catchy drums, guitar, and vocals start off plain enough. But by the halfway point, the background singers kick in, and the power of the song does, too. Oddly, the song's lyrics focus on love and togetherness when the majority of the season does not, making at least that aspect of the track rather puzzling. 
 
Like the OP, the rest of the soundtrack remains relatively the same when compared to the first season. Synth, drum, and guitar tracks are used during tense moments, flute and piano pieces during the calm ones, and resounding trumpets and drums during those triumphant times. Once again, the track fits the anime well but doesn't have the capability of standing on its own. 
 
More reiteration, but voice-acting is again average across the board with no special shout-outs to be had. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
This season was a bit more of a spectacle. Many of the fights in space were all over the place, in a good way. Directed attacks, multiple strategies, combat prowess, winning and losing; watching everything go down, both the good and the bad, was a lot more fun and involved. Especially since Jinto and Lafiel actually have impact in what eventually plays out. 
 
And while the newer characters are fun and interesting, it was a shame to see such a drop in attention on Jinto and Lafiel's relationship. I like their characters, and I like their dynamic -- it reminds me of a husband and wife ""arguing"" about the smallest of problems. What was given falls in line with the way the previous season ended, but I would have liked more from them, both in progression and focus. 
 
As it stands, Banner of the Stars I is a small improvement over its first season. With a stronger story, better animation, yet small dip in character development, what is offered is a nice continuation to an already established tale. Hopefully Jinto and Lafiel can juggle both their relationship and the war in the events to come. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Good, balance of war and character exploration, varying perspectives, still thematically lost 
 
Animation: Good, nice art style, good character and battleship designs, above-average actual animation 
 
Characters: Good, Jinto and Lafiel stagnate somewhat, side-cast dynamics and characterization help to alleviate this issue 
 
Sound: Good, good OP, good ED, nice soundtrack, okay VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Good, cool space battles, fun new characters, but needed more focus on Jinto and Lafiel 
 
Final Score: 7/10

In short, anyone viewing this series expecting a remake of Yamato/Star Blazers will be disappointed. Sadly, Yamato 2520 is largely unconnected to the classic series - a totally different look for the ship, completely different characters, no Gamalons, none of the extremely cool music - it's Yamato in name only. 
 
What we are left with is a series that, although looks nice, doesn't have the same emotional quality of the original. The series is way too short to tell this much story. Instances like relating the whole 100 years war done in a brief pre-credit sequence, and could have easily been expanded up to several episodes. There's no time to sink our emotional hooks into the characters. 
 
Technically, the series is passable. The animation is fluid and looks nice, although Leiji Matsumoto's art style and directorial touches are sadly missed on the project. The music doesn't contain the power and majesty that Yamato deserves - nay, requires. As a result, it ultimately fails to support the series. The voice acting isnt bad, but not outstanding. 
 
Is Yamato 2520 bad? No - if allowed to stand on it's own, it might have been enjoyable. Does it live up to the original series? Not even close - the worst entry of the Yamato saga is still superior to 2520. In the end, it's all academic, however - the series was aborted before the final four episodes were completed, and the odds of it making it to US shores are slim at best. In the end, Yamato 2520 will remain a footnote in the Star Blazers story.  
 
Go watch Yamato 2199 instead.

After the loss of his girlfriend he works as a debt collector to forget his troubles only to encounter more than he had imagined. Accompanied by his constant companion Solid Gold, Ning ends up in a ghost town and from there the adventure ensues. This movie explores some of China`s myths and fantasies as the viewer is taken through a world of drama, romance, and battles between good and evil. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","The production time lasted four years with computer CGI being used as graphical enhancements.  It was debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. The story is loosely based on a short story, titled Nie Xiaoqian, from the ancient Chinese literary work Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio by Pu Songling. It was dubbed into English by Ocean Productions and licensed by Viz Media and Geneon Entertainment.
Tax collector Ning wanders the land with his pet dog Solid Gold grieving over his lost love Siu Lan, who dumps him over another man. He goes on, and along the way, he runs into two monks, White Cloud and Ten Miles. The two Buddhist monks, who appear to be trying to purify unholy spirits and send them to the underworld, are on rivalry with another ghostbuster, Red Beard. After a meeting and a hasty farewell to the monks who leave, Ning continues his journey.
Somehow, at night, Ning enters a ghost town, inhabited by many different monsters, ghouls and spirits. He tries to adjust himself in the street life there, but he realises that it is hard to fit in the life of the dead. Just then he gawks at a beautiful lady called Shine in a carriage scene like royalty and he falls in love with her. Unknown to him, Shine is an agent of Madame Trunk, an evil tree spirit who devours life forces from anything. Ning follows Shine and tries to acquaint with her, but Shine is at first cunning and was thinking of selling him to Madame Trunk, with help of her friend, Butterfly. But she realises that Ning is a man who seems very different from what she thought.
When mayhem breaks out in the ghost town, it turns chaotic. Ning and Shine are caught between it, and in the midst Ning saves Shine as they jump upon the Immortal Golden Dragon Train, that ferries souls to the underworld to be reborn. Shine suggests they hitch a ride to safety, and so they do, getting off sometime later.
When morning arrives, Ning notices Shine is missing. He tries looking for her, only to realise she was hiding in his shadow under sunshine. She is a ghost, and any exposure to the sun will make her disappear, as she explains to Ning, and so he protects her. Ning sets her in his umbrella, then casts the umbrella in the water of a pond where she can survive, while he stays on ground and camps. As they stay together, the two of them form a semi-romantic relationship. In the midsts, Ning and Shine encounter Red Beard. Red Beard wants to slay Shine as it his profession, but when the group is attacked by the two monks, they flee to safety, but Red Beard's ""robot"" is destroyed to save them. Ning then pleads with Red Beard to not slay Shine, but after some time Red Beard relents and promises he won't do any harm to Shine.
While Shine is away, Butterfly is heavily questioned by Madame Trunk about where Shine is. Butterfly tries to deny the fact she knew anything, but eventually under torture, she reveals some information on Shine, with a human man who is Ning. Madame Trunk, who is running low on life force, is desperate to get Ning so she can live, and enlists Butterfly to get them.
At night, Ning and Shine return to the city, where a celebration is taking place. Mountain Evil, a mountain spirit, seen as a superstar, performs that night and charms Shine into staying on him. But when Shine pulls by accident one of his long, white, elegant hair that he claims nobody except him should touch, he is enraged. He tries to punish her, but the two monks appear and attack the ghost town. Ten Miles handles the ghost citizens, while White Cloud takes care of Mountain Evil. In the onslaught, Mountain Evil's hair is completely shaven by White Cloud, who thinks that his hair should be shaven like his to repent. But Mountain Evil tries to flee back into his mountain form, dragging Shine with him. Shine manages to escape, where Ning and her settle in a forest.
Shine reveals her background about working for Madame Trunk, in which Ning says to free her he would do anything, even losing his life force to free Shine from Madame Trunk's clutches. Shine takes him to Madame Trunk, but when she changes her mind at the last moment being unable to part with Ning and that by letting him be sacrificed for her freedom makes her selfish and Ning not in peace, she tries to save Ning. Butterfly understands the situation and when she realises humans can coexist with spirits, helps Shine by ensuring Ning and Shine's escape. Because Madame Trunk has no more life force with Ning taken away from her, she rots and disappears, thus breaking the bond Shine is bound to her.
Shine admits she loves Ning since he helped her so much, and that Ning returns her love, but worries that humans and spirits can't be together. While they share a tranquil moment, Mountain Evil appears and tries to take Shine away for the punishment she was to have from him. They hide, and when the Immortal Golden Dragon Train arrives, they sought refuge in the train. Mountain Evil tries to attack the train, but is seen by Red Beard who destroys him. Ning asks Red Beard why he would do such a thing, Red Beard claims that he understood about spirits and ghostbusting the unholy ones are what he should do, and not just to bust all spirits.
Shine then suggests that she be reborn to stay with Ning together as they go through the Heavenly gates. Ning agrees that he'll reborn to be with her, but in the midst, White Cloud and Ten Miles appear to purify the spirits themselves. Red Beard goes on a duel with them, while Ning and Shine alter the train's course to take them safely to the gates. In the scuffle that follows, Ning is thrown into the gates that are sealing. The path they took in fact made them too late. Ning struggles to keep the gates open as the train passes through him. Shine takes him and fly into the portal of rebirth, but they have to encounter the hammers of mismemory that will wipe out all spirits' memories before they are reborn.
White Cloud, Ten Miles and Red Beard fall into the portal, where they are reborn into babies. Ning and Shine are separated, where Shine tells Ning the location to look for her when she is reborn. Ning awakens in a village where he sees the two baby monks and a baby Red Beard, and meets his lover Siu Lan who carries a newborn child which he thought was Shine. He takes the child to the meeting place, but realises the baby is a boy and Siu Lan Fu arrives, teaching Ning a lesson. Ning thought he had lost Shine forever, but when he sees his umbrella acting weird, he casts it in a river's water and he dives in, just like before. Shine appears and the two of them reunite. An ecstatic Ning swims madly down the river as his dog Solid Gold smiles before the camera as the film ends, with the scene turned to a Chinese painting as the credits roll.
","Xiao Qian was released in the late 90s from the studio Triangle Staff. That's right, one of the studios behind Uchuu Kaizoku Mito and the studio we have to thank for Serial Experiments Lain. It's based off of the short story Nie Xiaoqian. So, let's see how it holds up as a film.  
 
Story: 
 
We follow a young debt collector, Ning as he takes a journey to forget his former beloved Lan Siu who left him on account of his ignoring her in favour of earning money. Dude, we get it you need money but a successful relationship is built on communication. You can't just ignore your partner. In any case, he encounters a pair of ghost busting monks who purify some evil spirits in front of him. While he runs and  waves his arms about like a right useless bastard. After the excitement, he continues on his journey only to find himself in  city filled with spirits and uncertain how to survive.  
 
Let's dig right into the primary issue that plagues this film. The pacing. And this isn't like yesterday's subject either where the pacing could have been better but wasn't that bad. In this it's an absolute mess. Once the film's gotten going we can't get a couple minutes between one long action sequence involving a lot of shouting and the next. Its like Ning's whole shtick is getting carried into absurd situations where he's completely useless. He's like Yamcha. There's also the big romance plot. Which is complete tripe. Our leads have no chemistry, seemingly nothing whatsoever in common and no apparent reason behind one being attracted to the other. He basically looks at her and thinks ""wow, she's pretty."" then she sees him and thinks ""I'm going to steal his life force"" but then changes her mind and falls for him for no apparent reason. Which is a general problem with the film. A lot of the ""motivations"" are nonsense. The ending is pretty shit too.  
 
Characters: 
 
In addition to the motivation problem, one of the big character issues has to do with consistency. I touched on that with the romance, but it goes deeper than that. There are characters who will quite literally switch their positions in five minutes without any compelling reason to do so. But the worst element of the characters has to be Ning. Not only is he pretty damn annoying, but he's a completely useless character. This isn't like Spirited Away where an everyday protagonist goes to a world of spirits and does well for themselves. This dude is completely out of his depth the entire time. And that type of character only really works in a comedy and even then you don't want them as the lead.  
 
Art: 
 
The art is a bit more mixed than the other elements. On the positive side, some of the supernatural designs look pretty good and the film does do a good job with making the city of spirits look pretty vibrant and unique. On the negative side, the animation is very clumsy and the designs for the more ordinary parts of the world are crap. There's also the issue with the CG elements not meshing well with the more traditional animation.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is, at best, barely passable. Maybe it's just that the script involves a lot of frantic shouting and it's really grating. Maybe it's that the actors, as a whole, sound like they don't give a shit but the consequence is that the performances just aren't very good. The music is okay.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There is none. Which suits me fine because, judging by what they do with the romance they do have, it wouldn't have been good.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Xiao Qian is pretty bad. It's riddled with story problems, characterisation is weak and inconsistent, it doesn't look or sound good. I'm going to give it a 3/10. Tomorrow  I'll end the week with a look at Aki no Kanade.

I believe I watched this Movie/Film at my very young age, maybe when it came out or later, the thing is I couldn't really find it anywhere during year I never took it off my head, till someone once asked if it wasn't just a Dream, well maybe, cause in my head the Umbrella was Red, and she travelled inside it. There was even a scene where they stopped by a blossom tree in a little lagoon of lotus flowers in the middle of Green Plains. Also the pirate was more like sonic pirate or the ones from icecream, he had no legs and the robot was a ship with legs. The karneval was abit different the houses were more like the stone ones like in animes as Magi but they were way taller one above other with tons of Karvenal/Festival stuff and also those guys with long legs walking around, it was wonderfull, there was also the train travelling the universe in its way to a giant clock with clock pieces floating and etc, I didn't remember the dragon as a train but a guardian of the train or something since people where trying to capture or kill them, the part of that Tree witch was more like underwater cave and that other girl was a mermaid or something, the bad witch was their mother and wanted his soul then her sister closed the shell to stop her. Then after passing the rebirth clock, he woke up in a room with no roof doors windows (only the holes of doors windows etc) and paper chinese lamps to illuminate the place, blossom threes, etc, he went looking for her in every house.. he couldn't only find babys, he was one.. then he look up to the sky seeing the stars up there while screaming and crying.. 
 
ETC, didn't say all details but that was how I imagined.. a love story between a boy and a ghost girl  
( how come I forgot that lovely dog.. maybe because my first dog got kill at my young age..it was my first friend/male dog, till then didn't have any pet that was just mine nor any male dog, my pet had 3 dogs but only a female dog survived.. later we had to give her away..etc..)  
old animes always look better in our heads than when watching again years later.. I kinda made it the only reason to continue here inbetween such garbage humanity, I thought about make the movie myself in 3D since I ended up studying 3D overall for 3 years, now I don't know... maybe I could make a different version but the movie exists, in my dream or memory was abit different, even the guy cards when they run away was like they grew up and made floating stairs.. Idk now. There's nothing else for me in this place 
 
The movie was released in 1997 so.. yeah older than myself , the dubbed ver was released in 2002 I guess, maybe I watched around that time or later, I was very young, like they say, before learning how to write you need to learn how to read. I believe I could read subtitles but not write at that young age.

          
 
       Helpful Before watching this movie, I made some research on it and ""don't expect to understand this one"" seemed to be the key phrase. Still, the synopsis was interesting enough and so I watched it anyway (I'm a sucker for Chinese folklore), although just expecting eye candy. In the end, I liked it! Though I warn you in advance: if you are not familiar with Chinese folklore (specially the tale of Xiao Qian and the tax collector Ning), you will find some of the concepts awkward, at best. Like, for example, the idea of ghost busting: if you are not familiar with the myths of supernatural powers possessed by Taoist masters, you will most likely laugh at it while recalling a certain American movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it. 
 
Story/World: 
Although it's not mandatory to know Chinese folklore in order to watch (and enjoy) the movie, you will miss out on a great deal if you don't keep up with all the Chinese mythological references (which the movie expects you to know, since it doesn't explain any of them). That said, the story is very singular, although odd and many times incomprehensible. 
We follow Ning, a debt collector, and his dog Solid Gold. They're wandering around (seemingly aimlessly) and end up in a ghost town. It's a story of a human falling in love with an enchanting ghost, followed by bizarre giant monsters, with some generic warriors helping along the way. And don't forget all the Chinese mythology references too (eye candy). 
Basically, don't watch this for the story if you have a short attention span. Although the creative storyline isn't necessarily directed to adults, it demands the comprehension of those at least 10 and up. 
 
Art/Animation: 
The art is nice. The character designs are Disney-ish in an unique way. 
Animation-wise, watching it now, don't expect something grand. The animation is quite good for its time (for the characters and its motions, I mean) but it's outdated (this movie is over 10 years old). That being said, lets also not forget that this is Chinese animation so, obviously, the style is also different. Animation excels in character motions, specially in action scenes, which are greatly done, using very creative camera angles and charming colors. Down side would be the the CG used, which is on the very low quality side. In fact, the use of both 2D and 3D don't go very well together: the 2D is great, the 3D fails. 
 
Character: 
Character designs are unique to the individuals. A lot of the personality can be deduced from how the characters look like. Of course, most of them are pretty linear, like the ""I trust everyone"" Ning (you wouldn't expect that kind of personality on a debt collector xD), the ""worship me"" Evil Mountain, the ""I'm awesome"" Ten Miles, the ""I'm god"" White Cloud or the ""too good for you"" Shine. However, although there is nothing utterly wrong, nothing really stands out in this department. 
 
Sound: 
Sound, sadly, is its biggest failing. The film was originally designed specifically around doing both Cantonese and Mandarin so you'd expect some failure there but, oddly enough, that's not where the failures appear. Actually, both audio languages are quite nice: the Cantonese brings less harsh character voices, since the dialogue sounds more like singing than talking, while the Mandarin is far more serious, with the extra work gone into drama. No, the problem is not the audio language. 
We then have a few Disney-ish musical moments throughout the movie, although they sound lovely in both audio tracks. No, the problem is also not in the songs. 
Unfortunately, it's the effects that fail the whole sound experience. They are mediocre and banal, at best. I even recognized sounds from a game, as well as numerous other films. 
Although the dramatic aspects are well held, very often the sound intrudes on a well animated tense moment, ruining the whole experience. 
The English dub is another fail, although not as prominent, because I recognize that it's somewhat hard to translate Chinese into English without it reading rather strange (cultural relativism). Nevertheless, the dialog is incredibly cheesy and, on many occasions, fails to deliver the original meaning of the story. I don't recommend it. The Mandarin and Cantonese tracks are both quite good and, although you are probably used to the clearer Japanese language, Chinese is very melodic so give it a try. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I liked the story and there were a few hilarious moments and awesome action scenes, but that was it. You can tell the movie is very ambitious and wildly imaginative. The love story portrayed is universal enough to be understood by anyone. So, if you can overlook the pathetic CG and the miserable sound effects, this movie will be something worth your time, otherwise, you watch it for the myth references only. 
 
Overall: 
Sadly, it fails to stand out thanks to several factors already stated and though it is re-watchable once or twice (to hear both audio tracks), that is about all.

Kai's request shrouded in ambiguity, Jil will have another chance to work towards completing his destiny and ascend the Tower. With his hopes and aspirations seemingly slipping out of his hands, Jil must rise to the challenge once again on this never-ending adventure. 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","It has been eighty years since King Gilgamesh defeated ""the tower"" single-handedly, and now the tower is reborn again. The ""Summer of Anu"" is a season that comes every few years during which the powers of the monsters within the Tower wane thanks to the grace of the great god Anu. Each Summer of Anu, the armies of the Uruk Kingdom secure their strongholds within the Tower, aiming to eventually conquer the upper floors. The story begins with the third Summer of Anu. The city of Meskia is the first stronghold built on the first level of the Tower. In addition to the Uruk Army preparing for their third campaign against Druaga, innumerable adventurers called ""climbers"" have been drawn to Meskia by rumors of the Blue Crystal Rod, a legendary treasure believed to be hidden on the top floor of the Tower. Jil, a young guardian, has traveled to the tower and Meskia, the last safe stop on the first floor of the tower. The story follows Jil, a new climber who wishes to reach the top floor of the tower. On the top floor is the evil lord Druaga, and numerous monsters and traps inhabit the floors along the way.
The second season, titled The Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk, picks up ""half a year after"" the events of the first season. With Druaga's guardian defeated, the monsters of the tower have disappeared and a period of peace and prosperity have descended upon the people. Jil and Fatina, having survived the tower's collapse, attempt to move on with their lives while still coming to terms with Neeba and Kaaya's betrayal. This all changes when they rescue a mysterious girl from a group of soldiers. They learn that this young girl, Ki, may be the key to unlocking a great secret within the tower. Armed with this knowledge and haunted by a troubling vision of the future, Jil once again prepares to climb the tower.
","Well just like some other people have said they made a decent sized gap from where they ended to where they are starting again. The new attitude of Fatina made me really happy when I noticed she calmed down and wasn't so prissy anymore. I extremely enjoyed the first season although I could have done without some of the comical satire they aired in the first two episodes. Overall I can see this anime going places. The artwork pleased me just as much as the first season as well as most of the other aspects of it. 
 
I would definitely say give the anime a chance. It has excellent potential to glue viewers to their seats. 
 
And obviously watch the first season before you try to watch this or you will have no idea what's going on :)

          
 
       Helpful Since Sword of Uruk is just a sequel to Aegis or Uruk I thought I'd save some time and include both of them in this review. 
 
I'll get down to it Aegis of Uruk was mediocre at best, it started off great the first episode was just one cliche after the other thrown at you in a hilarious fashion. After that however the series just went downhill. In a hard to explain way it was just bad.  
The story seems rushed, they switch from scene to scene ungracefully and it feels like there are parts missing in between it all.  
The fight scenes are uninspired and just no fun to watch. 
There are about 3 worthwhile episodes worth watching in the first season and thats just sad.The only thing that barely redeemed the Aegis or Uruk (and I mean barely) were the comedy segments, occasionally they'll get more then a slight chuckle out you. 
 The cliffhanger in the end however did draw me in mostly because I just wanted to see what would happen. But surprisingly the second season didn't disappoint.  
 
The Sword of Uruk started off much better, but at this point the whole thing became really serious and it felt like a letdown compared to the first season. 
Most of the issues present in Aegis or Uruk are here but are far less in number. 
The fight scenes were a little better and continued to get better toward the end. 
They filled in all the plot holes (at least as far as I can tell) but it dragged a bit towards the middle kinda making you want to just skip to the end, but dont worry it picks up. 
Overall it was much better then the first Season and the end leaves you with a nice feeling inside. Id tell you just watch the second season but then you'd be missing out on a lot of story. Its a nice series overall but Id only recommend the whole thing if you are willing to put up with the failure that is the first 12 episodes.(excluding the first episode, My favorite ^.^)

          
 
       Helpful The second season of Druaga kept me more invested than the previous season, having a slightly more interesting twist in the story and a decent outcome. 
 
I didn't feel overly impressed or enchanted by the whole entry, but found no major faults in it either besides some loose ends at the conclusion and some disagreements with the main character. 
 
The premise is essentially sibling rivalry with a lot thrown on to it, with brothers Ji and Neeba fighting it out.  
 
Ji is the lawful good entry and Neeba teetering from true to neutral to chaotic neutral and eventually...evil in some capacity or another. 
 
I found the main character to be insufferably stupid and naive on occasion; not to say that unless every lead has to be a labyrinth of emotion and thought or Machiavellian, but the heroic ideal that he embodies seems to clearly hinder his progress for little more than thinly-veiled egotism that's never addressed or worse, seemingly encouraged as part of the tone and message.  
Child-like innocence and ignorance make for great contrasts to gradual transitions in a long-term arc, but I felt that without a few secondary characters bluntly stating ""Man, that Ji guy has come a long way"" I would've scarcely seen that major of a change between episode two and twenty.  
 
This is a bit of a minor point and I think one that might be more personal than anything.  
 
I enjoyed watching the series and would recommend it to someone that wanted a lighter anime that wasn't too cliche or trope-ridden to be un-watchable.   It accomplishes what it sets out to do with (mostly) fun characters and a weight that while mostly fantastical in tone and nature, still delivers a few mild punches to the viewer that weren't entirely expected.

This OVA picks up where the series left off, continuing the adventures of your everyday life, only cuter.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","
","Ichigo Mashimaro OVA is indeed a continuation of &quot;cute girls do cute things in cute ways&quot;. The only differences from the original 12 episode series is, this one only has 3 episodes and it has a new OP and ED theme added to it.  
 
As you may know from the original series, their fun and adventures of their daily lives continues on by 4 adorable 3rd graders and 1 big carefree sister. As a group, they continue to entertainment themselves from the activities they do and the things they say on a  day to day basis and for us,  its joyful entertainment while we are being amused by their vivid imagination and events in which they occur.  
 
No doubt, this series could easily turn out into another 12 episode series where more fun and games can be introduced into their daily lives. As long as they keep the activities different, I don't see how it will fail.  
 
In conclusion, a good way to finish up the whole series in general. While there no real ending, you just can't help but imagine what new adventures they are up to next.

The Ichigo Mahimaro OVAs basically continues the saga from the series of the same name, its extends the running time a bit longer this time around, which helps considering this is only a 3 episode OVA. 
 
Story: 9/10 
We once again re-join the story about 4 grade school girls and their layed back older sister!The same good stuff from the series, it remains overall plot-less (as usual) and just has the girls continuing their day to day lives, with crazy antics and situations to follow them. I actually found it to be a bit more funny than the series was, as they seem to have polished the humor in it. Nothing very deep by any means, but quite fun to watch! There is no real ending to it on episode 3, as you could pretty much mix all the episodes up with each other and it wouldn't make any difference. You could even watch these OVAs before the series itself, since the only major thing that actually happens different there is they meet Ana. (a fellow cast member) Still, the girls always keep their day to day antics funny and interesting. Depending on your taste though, the whole ""day to day"" lives can be a great positive, or a big negative! If your a fan of a more ""layed back"" genera, then you will find that this title does indeed do it right, as the comedy bits come at the appropriate time and don't arrive as an overkill! 
 
Artwork: 8/10 
The artwork has been tweaked from the series as well, and this time comes off a bit more sharp, and the backgrounds are better detailed. Not the best looking series by any means, but it does polish things up from the more blander texture found in the series. Still quite colorful and cute (especially cute). 
 
Soundtrack: 7/10 
New opening and closing (party stlye) themes have been added, all sung by the cast themselves! Some scenes are remakes from the series opening too, both are quite fun and memorable to watch. Though I personally felt the original opening theme was a bit more lively to look at. The background music is pretty sparse over all, and most of the time has little to no soundtrack at all, though they did add a bit more music cues. It does help to increase the calm mood they were going for though, just don't expect to be ""wow-ed"" by the background beats that are there. 
 
Characters 8/10 
Same lovable cast from before, cute and lovable that you just want to give each one a hug! This time I felt it wasn't left soly on Miu to hold the show together, as each girl acted a bit more comical than before. Still, if it wasn't for Miu this series wouldn't be nearly as funny, as the others remain more down to earth than her. But each girl is likable, though we never get any real back story or depth to them. They do compliment and interact with eachother very well, so you never feel that one is out of place with the other. 
 
Bottom line 9/10 
Ichigo Mashimaro stays true to its ""everyday life"" formula, but manages to stick out amongst the rest from this style, as all the girls antics remain different and fresh throughout. For slice of life fans like myself, Ichigo is one of the best titles out there! It certainly won't win everyone over, and isn't going anywhere with its over all story. (honestly, they could probably go on and on forever with this series) But its a nice warm hearted tale that fills you up with warmth and happiness!  I recommend it to the ""slice of life fans,"" or to people who are looking for something comforting and lite to watch after a bad day! 

          
 
       Helpful Can't say much that I haven't already said in my Ichigo Mashimaro review to be honest, so this one will be pretty short.  
 
Stories in this one were along the same lines, but had even less drive to them than the other series. Not a real big deal, it's SoL so it really doesn't need a knockout storyline. Still, some of the previous series' ones like Nobue getting a job were pretty funny and fresh, with only 3 episodes to make you'd think they could do more of that.  
 
Art's the same as before, pretty good and consistent. Girls are animated well and the environments look pretty good too.  
 
Voice acting was the same as before, pretty good from what I can tell. However, the OP and ED are pretty crappy. Wish they would have kept the original one or done something better. The ""Sour, Round...Hazy Girls"" made me go ""What series am I watching again??"" lol 
 
Same characters, delivering the same style dialogue. Not much to say here, it's the same as the regular series. Feels like going from Lord of the Rings to The Hobbit, not really a big disconnect here.  
 
It was fun to watch! Obviously if you liked the other series you'll like this one since they are super similar. I was HOPING that some of the uncomfortable stuff involving the little girls would be nixed, but it wasn't. Too many close cutoff shots of the girls wearing too little clothing or whatever, and of course Nobue being her creepy self with Ana and Matsuri *eye roll*. Overlooking all that, it was fun and cute.  
 
If you liked Ichigo Mashimaro, definitely watch this one. However, just skip the OP as it's really not worth sitting through LOL

","Before I start I will say that you should watch this Dubbed. The Japanese voice actors are good enough, but I feel that you only get the energy that the comedy requires from the American ones. It might also seem silly that I would rate this show a 10 out of 10 too and you would probably be right, because this show doesn't look good, it doesn't have a deep and interesting story, and to be honest the jokes probably wouldn't even be funny half the time if it weren't for the dub. Yet I not only enjoy Papuwa, but I adore it, I adore it enough to put this on my favorites list, and not because the show is as flashy and stylish as something like Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei or Bakemonogatari, not because its as deep as Cowboy Bebop or Serial Experiments Lane, but because it makes me feel good. 
This anime is fun to watch, and that is what makes this a 10. For starters the characters are all very strange. Not only is the main villain (or what could pass as the main villain as they're isn't really a central villain) a man who's anxiety is so extreme that he practices his lines to a wooden posing doll, but one of the goals of the main character is to become the most beautiful boy in the world.  Then there is the variety and admittedly large cast of side characters that each get an ample amount of screen time to give you an idea of what they are like, or at the very least what their gimmick is but that in itself gives them some personality where other anime have characters that have no personality despite their gimmick. Then the large cast of sort-of villains have their own unique quirks that get built upon and give them personality as well.  
Now before I  get too carried away, I will briefly explain the plot: The main character Kotaro suddenly awakens from a deep slumber some time after the events of the first series, and yes it is a sequel series but you don't need to read the first manga series (there is a show but as far as I know it hasn't been subbed at all) to know what has gone on as the show explains at the beginning that Kotaro destroyed the first Papuwa island (where the events of the first series took place) and now through the magic of a blue and red orb a new island was born where the second series takes place. Kotaro then escapes the place where he was being kept and through a series of events lands on the second Papuwa island where he meets Papuwa, a boy who become his best friend and Liquid the man maid, who looks after him. After that the series is fairly episodic and needs to be seen to be believed. 
Sure, maybe this isn't going to be someone's 10/10, maybe you'll even hate it, but I've watched this series several times over, and I still feel the same about it as when I first saw it. It's a comedy at heart, so the show is only as good as you believe the comedy is, and no amount of explaining is going to help you laugh at them. I've probably talked too much too, and the only reason I unloaded everything like this was because no one saw this, no one, and that's a shame.  
For those who just skim towards the bottom: It's not deep, it's not beautiful, it may not even be funny to some people, but it has heart, and so does the manga its based on, so watch it please, and read the manga obviously.

Seriously the English Dub cast were top notch in this anime like seriously, things they came out with was just so clever! I think Paul Sidello and Eric Opella who played the fish with the hairy fish net human legs and the snail were one of the best characters. Their Cross-gender acting skills (thanks wiki) just impressed me!

       Helpful When I was 12 years old I went to fye and looked at anime and found a lot of really underrated anime which also came from exploring animes to watch next. One day at fye I found papuwa. I only found the first three volumes watched those and I thought it was the whole thing until I saw a preview for the next episode. After years of finding it I finally went online and got them when I was 14. Ever sense then I've been thinking what made this anime entertaining and why it stuck out to me and why is it so underrated? 
 
I haven't seen the original papuwa kun anime but this one basically told you what happened before.  
 
So today I will be reviewing papuwa. 
 
Story 7/10 
The story was unique in a lot of ways. Basically before this one kotaro explodes the papuwa island and comes back later and older with amnesia. So liquid changed his name on his underwear to rotaro which in simpler ways of explaining コko to ロro. So kotaro or the newly named rotaro can't argue with his underwear so that's his name and what happens is other people go to the island to find him and get him back but instead live their. 
 
Art 8/10 
The art style and character design were very good because its colorful and fun to look at. But the animation was OK it wasn't horrible it was just normal looking. 
 
Sound 8/10 
Originally I gave the sound a 6/10 but I forgot about the english dub. The english dub was AMAZING, the voices were fitting for each character the acting and emotion in the voices were solid and it was amazing in its quality. The good dub aside, I thought the opening and ending songs were good but not great. The the soundtrack was a little forgettable. 
 
Character 8/10 
This is one of the parts that makes me surprised the anime is so unknown because the character cast was one of the most entertaining to watch. I feel like the interactions with each character was great. I liked almost every character. Plus a lot of the characters were really memorable too. But one thing that bothers me is the anime totally ignored introducing the names of the characters sometimes . 
 
Enjoyment 7/10  
Despite all the good things I said i think i enjoyed this less than i thought i would I laughed a lot it was good too. But sometimes I felt like i want enjoying to the most of it because i feel like I grew out of being a big fan of comedy. But something took away my enjoyment that I just don't know. Sorry i can't because I just don't know I could think of a few theories but I cant always be sure.  
 
Overall 7/10 
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good crazy comedy with a story. I would also say that you should watch it to know you've watched something really underrated but I think overall it was a good series that shouldn't be taken to seriously

I watched the show with the ADV Dub and it was pretty good though not without one major and unfortunate flaw. For some reason Ahab got a typical 'Shiver Me Timbers' Pirate accent which is some terribly lazy direction. I think the actor did an okay job with it but it was pretty bad they chose that, very close minded. Even some of the dialogue was changed specifically to play up the Pirate Accent. Shiver me timbers is seriously muttered by Ahab in the dub on multiple occasions. Anyway yeah other than that the Dub was fine and while I have moaned about it Ahab's accent choice is not a deal breaker in my opinion. 
 
Animation was delightful and I have to say this is without a doubt a fantastic transfer from ADV for the DVD boxset which is how I watched the show. Clearly they had access to great masters. Series was beautifully detailed throughout but I do wish the show wasn't always so dark. Seems alot of shows around this time favoured a dark blue hue and palette, Perhaps it was a cost cutting measure? I think it was almost halfway through the series until we actually saw something resembling an actual daylight scene. Dezaki's classic still painted shots are a plenty across the 26 episodes and all were superb. Character designs were a nice slightly modernized (for the period) version of Dezaki's classic style also, I liked them. There was some really outstanding scenes for the animation that I can't really go into due to spoilers of course but just know that in the shows more climatic moments the series often looks breathtaking for cel TV animation. I was floored by certain sequences. 
 
Soundtrack didn't really stand out to me as anything overly special, though often times thats something that tends to change overtime as I tend to listen to OST's after watching a show. But at least in the moment the OST sufficed and that was about it really. Maybe over time I'll come to love it but as of right now it served it's function and that was it, no tracks really stood out. The OP/ED's were fine. 
 
Overall this Anime is a good show but not quite a great one. There is a ton to enjoy about the series and it has a certain amount of whimsy that's hard to not love. Story might not be quite as grand as perhaps the creators had intended in many ways but it was always interesting. It was a strange ride at times but with plenty of left turns the show did a good job at keeping a stranglehold on me. I was never left bored by it as I could never really confidently predict what it had in store next. So with all that said I give it a solid 7/10 'Good'.

          
 
       Helpful Hakugei: Legend of Moby Dick is certainly an interesting blend of space pirates and cyborgs. While the series goes back and fourth between serious and goofy, it still manages to have a dark yet melancholy story.   
 
To begin, the story has very little to do with the original novel of Moby Dick and only borrows the titular whale character but re-imagined as a cyborg. The planet Moad is under martial law and is set to be destroyed. A kid named Lucky requests the help of Captain Ahab to save the planet and its people. Ahab agrees as the Moby Dick acts as the destroyer of the planet and it also responsible for Ahab's loss of his left eye and leg.  
 
 Initially starting as an episodic  space pirate anime, it gradually shifts into a darker tale of cyborgs with a doomsday clock. Part of the serie's lore are the punishment of criminals who are turned into cyborgs to further extend their suffering. Similar to the law of robotics, these criminals are given certain commands they cannot break such as killing humans or committing suicide. The science fiction plays a larger role in the last act of the story as it becomes more serious with our character's backstory, specifically the characters Due and Jacobs.   
 
While does have a darker tone it is sometimes unbalanced by the goofiness of Captain Ahab's crew. There are many scenes where a very tragic event occurred then the next minute will feature a very comical art style filled with very outrageous slap stick gags. The animation certainly helps demonstrate such energy in these comic relief scenes. I don't exactly hate this instability but I can certainly many others to be bothered by its mood swings. 
 
Despite the lack of stability, I found myself enjoying the series since it incorporated a manly pirate, very gruesome science fiction, a war story and giant Moby Dick cyborg to tie it all together. Captain Ahab is a really manly character; being the best interesting character in the story. There's a scene in EP 15 that really sums up his opinion of God, thus possibly being the best scene in the anime. Whether he's being serious or goofy, he still possesses a charismatic charm; a bit similar to John Silver from the Treasure Island anime of 1978.   
 
The story of Moby Dick has really nothing to to do with the novel( aside from the whale), but delivers variety from episodic space adventures to plot related drama and even a little bit of boxing in episodes 18-20. At the same time, those episodes also feature a couple of intriguing antagonists, Madame O' Hara & Jacobs, who become tragic characters as the series reaches its conclusion. Speaking of the ending, I accept the tragedy but something about the very last scene felt a bit abrupt. Personally, I felt the series needed a short epilogue to better end it as there are some events occurring in the universe that are a bit unresolved. I probably expected a tad more since each episode opens with a narrative from the viewpoint of Lucky, implying the series events have already occurred as it's told in the past tense. 
 
 Regardless, Legend of Moby Dick is still good but its complaints will all be very subjective due to its constant comedy. The series is directed by Osamu Dezaki who once again shows his iconic style through visual stills or post card memories. Hakugei excels in its art as there are plenty of fascinating imagery scattered throughout the anime and with its sci-fi setting allowed more room for creativity. I recommend Moby Dick in English dub simply because of John Swasey's performance as Captain Ahab. The Japanese is good too with Akio Otsuka but the pirate slang works better in the english tongue. Oh and Vic Mignogna & Stephanie Naldony are also in it. Legend of Moby Dick is definitely one of ADV Films best dubs and is a show that deserves to have a license rescue.

          
 
       Helpful A quick ramble on Hakugei.   
 
First, Hakugei is not Melville's Moby Dick.  It is not a modern interpretation of the classic novel, nor a space-age reimagining.  Typical of the anime industry, the writers of Hakugei have merely appropriated high-profile elements of Melville's classic and have applied it, unnecessisarily but to interesting effect, to a space opera that reminded me in equal parts of Star Wars, Dune, Blade Runner, and, perhaps more so, of The Seven Samurai (indeed, I'm now convinced Gonzo's Samurai 7 was a remake of Hakugei rather than of Kurosawa's classic.)   
 
So, does all this derivativeness make Hakugei a bad show?  Nope.  It's pretty decent, usually entertaining, and occasionally fantastic.  While not exactly fast-paced, the writers do a good job of maintaining narrative thrust.  The first half is a fun space adventure with stand-alone episodes that effectively build a believable, if occasionally unsettling universe as well as a collection of likeable, rag-tag characters.  The second season is far more ambitious and has perhaps too many plot threads without the thoughtful writing to pull them together.   
 
While the animation is lacking, a typical flaw of late 90s productions, and is occasionally too cartoonish for its own good, the art design is fantastic.  This is especially true of the setting second half of the series which features a burned-out environmental disaster of a planet and some awesome neo-noirish spacecraft. 
 
The characters are for the most part a positive element of Hakugei (the annoying android parrot and the ""journalist"" notwithstanding)- especially Ahab, a combination of the quintessential anime alpha-male and a prototypical wacko goofball.  This is what I imagine most shounen brats would be like when they grew up.  Ahab's crew is a fine, if typical, cast of characters.  The only complaint with them is that they turn into something of a greek chorus of sophmoric slapstick comedy in the more complex (and grim) second season.  Thankfully, the second season features a couple of the best villains I've seen in anime in a while.   
 
Sadly, like many anime, Hakugei has some seriously annoying flaws that make it hard to recommend.  The second season is downright schizophrenic in tone (cartoonish one second, melodramatic the next) - and much of its humor seems both dated and geared toward a Japanese audience (this added a bit of character for me, so I didn't mind too much.)  It also simply fails to successfully address its ambitions in the second season - it's not necessarily a bad thing to want more when an anime ends but in Hakugei's case, a lot of plot lines are, not so much left hanging, as poorly managed.  Still, the ending wasn't a bad one compared to many anime.  So long as you don't expect too much (and it's Hakugei, so why would you.) 
 
So, who would I recommend this to?  If you just can't get enough of 90s sci-fi anime and have seen Bebop, Outlaw Star, Captain Tylor, LoGH, etc, but just want more, try Hakugei.  Or, if you enjoy the occasional quality, oddball anime that seems to have disappeared from the radar (Neo Ranga, Shingu, Stellvia, Clockwork Fighters, etc...,) try Hakugei.  But if you're looking for Moby Dick?  Try yer Kindle.

","Seccond movie made from the Dragon nest game environment realy hit the sweat spot of mine. In contrast to the first movie, this story is centered around less characters, which given them more screen time and room to interact and develop. 
Even tho, Story-vise it isnt anything outstanding and it uses all the old movie/anime clishes, it realy doesnt loose its momentum, and throw you into the seat and wont let go, until the post credit scene, which leaves you with the funny smirk on the face. This kind of storyteling realy makes it kid-friendly, even taking in consideration it gets somehow scarry at some point of the movie. 
As far as the animation goes, when i first saw the characters in the first movie, I cannot help but to think of the new ""Thinkerbell"" movies. Which means that for me, getting used to the animation style wasnt realy all that hard. Visuals were overall great and the action scenes were breath taking. 
 
I realy hope, there will be more movies in this franchise. It has potential, and delivers some nice DnD action, that isnt full of the ""fanservise"" in the way it is in almost all new anime...  
 
I do recommend to watch it, if you like shows with the feal of the Dungeon and Dragons.

","Short summary: 
 
Not as good as the first season, but still worth watching. 
 
Long summary: 
 
Season 1 of Natsu no Arashi!, if I had to describe it in one sentence, was a captivating mixture of drama, romance, comedy, and some action with a quirky ""retro but modern"" feel. Akinaichuu manages to retain all these things to varying degrees, but unfortunately ends up falling a bit short of matching season 1. 
 
Story: (6 - Fair) 
The concept of Arashi and Hajime traveling back in time to the World War II era to save people was a big part of Season 1. However, for most of the first portion of Akinaichuu, this concept seems to have been replaced in favor of mostly pure comedic episodes, and only late in the season do we start feeling the spirit of season 1 again. The comedy episodes, while well written and definitely in line with the witty humor of the series, are essentially stand alones and thus end up feeling almost like fillers. 
 
However, within these fillers are a few indications (such as the concept of predetermined destiny) that build towards the final arc near the end of the series, which I found to be a great finisher that made me remember why I like Natsu no Arashi so much. If the whole season had been like that final arc, this season would have been that much better. 
 
Art: (8 - Very Good) 
Season 2 managed to keep that ""old fashioned yet modern countryside"" feel of the art in season 1, which is a good example of ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" 
 
Sound: (7 - Good) 
The VAs of the series voice their characters just as fittingly as they did in season 1. The opening and ending songs were good as well, with last season's opening doing a better job of that ""retro yet modern"" feel, but this season's ending better than last's in achieving that feel. 
 
Character: (8 - Very Good) 
All the characters are back, and don't suffer from any (unintentionally) awkward character changes. All of them get a chance to make us laugh (which they do quite well), and various relationships, like that between Jun and Hajime, are further explored in funny yet insightful ways, without neglecting the main relationship of Arashi and Hajime. 
 
Overall: (7 - Good) 
Akinaichuu managed to keep a lot of what was so entertaining about season 1, but the lack of an encompassing plot made it harder for the series to be engaging until near the final arc of the season. Nevertheless, I still had a good time laughing at the antics of the characters I've grown very fond of, and anyone that enjoyed season 1 would likely enjoy this season as well.

          
 
       Helpful We were young once; wishing that summer would last forever, getting worried over the most trivial matters, falling in love with the wrong people, and thinking we knew everything. And then comes that certain age when we are confronted by the ghosts of our past to remind us that it was that rose-colored youth which shaped who we are today. Caught in the crossroads of growing up, reminiscence is a therapy session we all could use every now and then. So grab the nearest ghost of the past, and jump straight into two seasons of Natsu no Arashi’s unconventional ride of history-redefining proportions. 
 
STORY - 6 
 
Hajime Yasaka, spunky 13-year-old, moves in with his grandfather in the countryside and experiences a summer he will never forget. Taking place as a distant memory from Hajime’s youth he meets the most unlikely bunch who changed his life. Along with a tomboyish model, World War II ghosts, a ripped detective, and a foxy con artist, they run a vintage cafe with occasional time traveling during their free time. Combine that with the growing man’s search for love and we have ourselves a supernatural, slice-of-life, historical, coming-of-age romcom about a 13-year-old’s journey through time and self. As intriguing and loaded the premise is, the main hook of the series lies in its puzzling time travel mechanic. 
 
Instead of the usual objective of do-overs and clairvoyance, Natsu no Arashi bypasses the time travel paradox by treating the very act of time travel as part of the natural timeline. Time travel here is not an intervention but a phenomenon that triggers inevitable events we took for granted. Simply put, destiny factored in time traveling, making for some interesting retrospective story progression. 
 
Whether it’s for playing a prank, disposing spoiled food, saving air raid victims or uncovering past secrets, time travel is an entertaining constant in Natsu no Arashi. 
 
But how does the plot actually fare? The first season was an origins story for the people Hajime encounters while the second attempted to develop character relationships. Though the first had more impact and direction due to the second being too distracted by gags, both suffer the same problem of lacking plot movement. It could’ve used more episodes since some of the development seemed erratic. But for how everything's been presented, the gaps and irregular flow gives it the feel of a scrapbook. You get a peek of the fun and memorable bits adding to the show’s episodic nature, in exchange for some plot investment. This doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi fails to grip its viewers. It has its share of powerful moments to the effect of historical dramas, unrequited love, and themes of fleeting youth. At its most relaxed, it plays around with time travel and the cafe setting; often employing slapstick to reference and trope humor. The School Rumble cameos for Jin Kobayashi writing both mangas were also an awesome touch.  
 
Bottom line is, while Natsu no Arashi can flaunt a fun and creative premise with unpredictable execution, it falls short with aimless pacing and sluggish plot development come the second season. 
 
ART - 9 
 
Shaft? I’m in. That being said, I expected the usual sleek designs, exaggerated movements, barrages of text, and random color filters spilled on every scene. Upon finishing the first season, I had one question in mind. “What year was this made?”  
 
2009. 
 
From the slightly dated color palette and wishy-washy ambient lighting down to the clunky character designs bearing yesterday’s eye style, I could’ve sworn I was watching a show from the early 2000’s. To put things into perspective, Natsu no Arashi was aired in the same year as Bakemonogatari. I guess we know where most of the animation budget went. Second season was up just four months after the first, with more refined production values as shown by increased clarity and smoother movements. Despite that, it still stuck to the classic feel of the first. Setting technicalities aside, did Shaft just deliberately retrograde their own show? Even for them, that’s reaching a whole new level of creativity. 
 
That doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi lacks any visual highlights. 
 
Animation is deceivingly smooth. Further aided by Shaft’s frequent scene cuts, this produces the illusion of a continuous flow of actions which gives the impression of something always happening on-screen.  
 
Character designs are also a plus; pronounced in gender, personality and social class. General appearances are bold and brash for men while slender and meticulous for women. Personality is captured by each character’s unique face while the eyes have it for social standing. Take Arashi’s and Kaya’s features vs. Kanako’s and Yayoi’s features for instance. As a whole, Arashi and Kaya, being the elites, have more elegant designs with vivid eyes. Arashi, having the more cheery and liberal disposition, has the livelier face of the two. Kaya, her polar opposite, sports blue reserved eyes, and delicate white skin and hair; suggesting a more conservative and ladylike attitude. On the other hand, Kanako and Yayoi of the working class have more basic features with duller eyes. Kanako’s freckles and braids with small eyes resembles her uptight and unrefined nature while Yayoi’s wide, pupilless eyes and hair let down make her come off as loyal yet frail.  
 
And of course, don’t forget all the other details that have Shaft written all over it: artstyle shifts, random camera angles. DIY live-action takes, cryptic segments about summaries of popular manga, a surprising amount of belly button shots for the lack of head tilts, and even accentuated magazine-cover poses with awkward dancing mid-conversation. 
 
Though watered down than their other more dynamic works, Natsu no Arashi still stylistically succeeds. It’s amazing how the art perfectly blends with the historical atmosphere to visualize what the good old days felt like. Technical resourcefulness and proper theming had me giving near-perfect marks for the art; overall quality being the only hindrance to a 10. 
 
SOUND - 9 
 
Natsu no Arashi’s art isn’t the only thing that decided to backtrack. 
 
For one thing, the BGM is divided into the cafe jukebox tracks and the instrumentals. Actual tracks were used as ambient music in the cafe which mostly consist of yesterday’s hits of pop and rock. The jukebox plays a different song almost every episode in the background, it’s ridiculous. As for the instrumentals, occasional action scenes get the upbeat, brass- and synth-filled sentai showdown songs. Meanwhile, touching moments are graced with serene tracks of gentle piano, evocative strings, hushed chimes, and solemn woodwinds.  
 
Don’t even get me started on the openings and endings that just scream retro. For the first opening, what seems like the cheesiest opening ever with the groovy vocals and brass melody comes out as an ingenious shout-out to 70’s Japanese cover girls and album sleeves. Live-action time lapse shots of walkways against old-fashioned espionage-esque pop music with suave guitars and showtune horns make up the first ending. The second season starts with black and white storyboard-themed fanservice shown along catwalk-worthy synthpop. And lastly, the second ending uses chiptune and 8-bit art against trippy live-action takes. 
 
Voices are also surprisingly good for a low-key anime adaptation. Hajime goes all-out as a hot-blooded roughneck with the shounen heart. Jun’s pre-pubescent voice still enters androgynous territory with her seldom squeals sounding absolutely adorable. The detective gets all the gruff while the con artist attempts seductive but comes out as mischievous control freak. Arashi bears the girl-next-door voice contrary to Kaya’s pure and well-mannered shrinking violet while Kanako gets a sharp tongue with Yayoi pulling off the innocent ditz very well. All of them have their key moments and man, do they deliver; especially Arashi, Kaya, Jun, and Hajime. 
 
Even in this department, Natsu no Arashi doesn’t fall short in style and subtle quality. Very good seiyuu performances and the most fitting soundtrack selection seal the deal for the hidden genius at work here. 
 
CHARACTERS - 6 
 
Let me just say it right now. Character development is stunted and interactions get formulaic. The redeeming factors are their striking personalities and the clash of ideals resulting from the generation gap between the characters. We have the youngsters (Hajime and Jun), the old-fashioned adolescents (Arashi, Kaya, Kanako and Yayoi), and the modern adults (the detective and the con artist).  
 
Hajime is the little rascal. Part-skeptic and all-bro, the dude’s the epitome of the uncouth hero who fights his own battles and saves the weak and downtrodden; all while keeping his eyes out for the ladies. Carefree genki girl, Arashi, is noble but more outgoing than Hajime. Kaya nails her role as the traditional damsel who would perish the thought of showing skin and wasting true love’s kiss. Kanako lives by the sweat of her own brow; representing the bitter working class who envy all the privileged few. And Yayoi remains the vulnerable sweetheart.  
 
The budding romance centered on Hajime, the historical immersion from subtle hints in characters and setting, and the “what ifs” that never happened with the ghosts’ lives are definitely the show’s high points. The ghosts have it rough; saving bombing victims who would never predict their demise, making sense of the social divide and strict policies during the ongoing war, and going back in time only to constantly replay a love confession that will never happen. Natsu no Arashi gets pretty serious and it’s compelling moments like these that make the best out of the distinct characters; enough to pardon the amount of faffing they do most of the time. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 7 
 
The story felt inadequate, relationships were unresolved, the characters could have done so much more and the WWII setting was just asking for more explanations. But for what it is, I have no regrets watching it. Comedy can get stale. The drama creeps up on you. And the romance is a fresh take between modern and traditional views. The weak development was never really the reason to get into this show.  
 
Natsu no Arashi is a humble effort at making a love letter to the past by conveying how much we’re still connected to it. It’s a nostalgia trip that stands as a testament to the zeitgeist of the 70’s; clever on all fronts of production but a casual watch at best that hits home on seldom occasions. It proves that the past was once real. And that we’re fools for living like it never happened. 
 
So love the past. It’s the only illusion we know that existed. Because by the time we forget, we start growing up.

       Helpful If you enjoyed Natsu no Arashi!, then it'd be natural for you to be watching the second season right? DUH! I really loved the first season and I expected nothing less in the follow-up!~ Turns out I was more or less right! Anyways, here a little bit of my thoughts on this 2nd season! 
 
*Btw, I refuse to write a short a summary of Natsu no Arashi!Akinaichuu at the start of my review. I believe I'd be wasting your time and it'd be just re-summarizing the summary provided on the ""details"" tab.  
 
Story: 9 
As with my review for Natsu no Arashi!, I fairly liked the one-shots per episode and I thought that's what kept each episode of both seasons high refreshing and new. It made me want to keep plowing through the episodes just to see what's the next surprise! The only reason why I think it's shy of perfection is the lack of a centralized plot, therefore I believe one-shots has it's pros and cons! I'm sure y'all will enjoy Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu's storyline if you enjoyed the first season's. 
 
Art: 10 
Also explained in my review for the first season, I'm an extreme Kobayashi Jinn (the mangaka for both Natsu no Arashi! and School Rumble) buff, so I enjoy the artwork he draws. For me, I love the way he designs each individual so they stand out from each other and doesn't get too confusing! 
 
Sound: 10 
Somehow, I thought it was an improvement from the first season! Because I pay a lot of attention to OST, this section I marked fairly high as somehow during Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu!, there was more OST than the first one. The OST was fairly well paired with the situations in the anime, therefore no questions on that. I was fairly pleased with the opening and ending themes which I thought was very original! Just the opening theme was slight awkward...I'll explain below! 
 
Character: 10 
No doubts about the character section as being a solid 10! Each character was a pleasure to watch and the versatility of each character helps override my initial impressions about how a small character list can become a good series! I've said in the first review, I really like the characters that Kobayashi Jin makes, and it is shown through each of his series that they are very unique and original! Definitely something I enjoyed about this show! 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I loved Natsu no Arashi! and Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu! There was no question on the enjoyability of this series. My attention did not waver at all in any episodes, and trust me, it's not entirely because of Arashi or Kaya! Regardless which episode or featuring which character, Natsu no Arashi provided me a solid 5 or something hours of enjoyment that I'd never regret spending! 
 
Overall: 10 
I don't really get this ""overall"" section...basically isn't it just the ""enjoyment"" section repeated? Anyways I'll try to make it sound a bit differnt ;D! LOL. Anyways, I thought this series was really amazing to watch and I thought it was definitely one of the best i've seen in a while! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a crazy fanboy, but despite the low ratings you may see, I believe (and i'm sure some others) that Natsu no Arashi! & Akinaichuu was way too underrated! It may be overshadowed by moe moe series such as Kaichou wa Maid-sama (which is actually very very good as i'm the same age as the people in the series! Hehe), but Natsu no Arashi stands its ground on it's own genres, which frankly, isn't all too popular with the otaku group of today's world. Not that i'm saying all Otakus will dislike this show, i'm just saying they will expect too much moe moe and will be disappointed by such a down-to-earth and realistic (just the character's emotions, not the supernatural stuff!) show such as Natsu no Arashi! Anyways, back to Natsu no Arashi!. Was it only me who was confused by the opening?! Is that blood that Arashi is showering in? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on my profile page! LOL!!! Meh, in a way, I wish there'd be a 3rd season, but due to it's rather low popularity, I doubt it. If you're wondering what happens to Arashi and Hajime and everyone else, I'd suggest you read the manga, but it isn't fully scanlated into English....Being a half japanese is such a bonussss hehehe.... LOL I hope you'll enjoy Akinaichuu as much as i did!!!

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.
The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, who, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate Red-Haired Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry, and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, Franky builds the Straw Hat Pirates a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
","This is my first review of anything ever and it's fitting that it goes to one of my all-time favourite things ever.  
One Piece is what got me into the manga and anime community, by now everyone has heard about its great world building and I'm not going to go into that because there are better and more informative reviews for that.  
I just want to say as a massive one piece fan who is all caught up with the manga is that every anime and manga fan should watch or read one piece, it deserves all the hype it gets. 
 
Now I know that this review is not at all organized but, there is one fault that I think sticks out. In my opinion, Oda writes all the backstories of the characters from the same template. It could be his style or it could be that he just hasn't realised but all the characters follow the same pattern - as a child, the character went through some trauma and now that trauma affects the said character in some way which defines their worldview. 


          
 
       Helpful One Piece is an anime frequently classified with Bleach and Naruto as one of the ""Big 3"" in anime and manga. These 3 have ruled at the top in terms of popularity for over a decade, and their popularity is still high as ever, if not higher. I personally find it really hard to get into long-running animes (+100) but surprisingly, One Piece was an exception, a rare one at that.  
 
One Piece was one of my first anime I've watched. (first being pokemon ofc) It was the anime that got me into anime, especially when there was a time where I thought anime was boring and a waste of time. I literally thought that they didn't have anything special about it. However, after getting a recommendation from my brother, One Piece really changed my views on anime. Since I barely knew about anime at that time, I was really intrigued by the aspect of pirates and adventure. I watched one episode, then another, and another... and I was hooked to the show in no time at all. Because I was impressed by One Piece, I started watching other shows, mostly of the similar genre. From then, my love for anime has grew and grew, and is still growing to this day and it's all thanks to one great piece of anime. 
 
One Piece takes place during the Great Age of Pirates, which started when the King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger announced to the world shortly before his death that he had hidden his greatest treasure, the ""One Piece"" somewhere, and told others to find it. About 20 years later, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gomu Gomu no mi devil fruit, also interested in finding the One Piece and exploring the world, sets out on a journey full of exciting adventures, dangerous pirates and marines, and meeting new friends. From there, he makes many new comrades to support his journey. 
 
The story itself seems nothing special, but it evolves as the time goes on. At the time of writing this review, One Piece is at 670 episodes, which might tell you that it is rather drawn out. However, during those 670 episodes, they slowly build the world and characters into something unique and huge, enhancing the story bit by bit. The story arcs are fantastic and well thought out, sometimes leaving you in awe. In the story arcs, you are usually introduced to other minor characters, some who are equally interesting to watch just as the main characters. And the fights as a whole, are really well paced and entertaining, mixing blends of action, humor, and drama to keep you hooked. 
Also, like most other long running anime, One Piece does have its share of fillers. BUT, they have nowhere near an overwhelming amount of fillers and some fillers can even be enjoyable as well. The fillers also introduce you to new characters, who although non-canon, are still pretty likable as well.  
 
Like many other animes, One Piece also has a system of supernatural powers. In the world of One Piece, there are things known as Devil Fruits, which essentially take the shape of real-life fruits, but taste horrible and give consumers a unique power. Depending on the user and how they use it, the Devil Fruit can become something very powerful. The concept of the Devil Fruit is one of the most impressive aspects of One Piece. There are three types of known Devil Fruit: Paramecia, which gives you the ability of superhuman ability or traits, Zoan which lets you transform into an animal, and finally Logia, which can transform your body into an element like fire or ice.  
 The idea of eating something and getting superpowers is nothing new, but the fact that One Piece has shown an immense amount of Devil Fruits already, and that no two fruits are ever the same, is quite impressive. Oda really exercised his creativity level on this part, as while some abilities might come off as goofy, you cannot deny the creativity and work Oda put into some of the fruits and their users. 
 
For the Art... now this is the section I've heard the MOST complaints about. To be honest, I was bit skeptical myself when I first saw the art style. It can come off as cartoonish, childish drawing for the most parts, possibly turning off viewers. However, as I watched on and on, I forgot about it. After a couple of episodes, I honestly didn't CARE for how the art looked, as I was just immensely enjoying the hell out of the show. It's really a hit or miss however, as it can turn many people off completely, while others might not be bothered by it so much. 
Also, nowadays, the art in One Piece has improved dramatically. It is much more pleasing to the eye than it ever was. The artwork is fresh and clean. The character designs are also outstanding as well. Some might be drawn rather silly, but the uniqueness in some of the character art is very fun to look at. 
 
Now, I've heard some people say that the soundtracks are rather silly and lame. This really depends on your tastes in music, but I personally found most of the soundtracks amazing. While some of them do come off as silly, the osts all fit the scene and atmosphere very well. The voice acting is also equally impressive, with each of the voice actors fitting their characters perfectly, and also being able to deliver emotion, or intensity depending on the scene. 
 
The characters in the Straw Hat Pirates are special. Not really because they will be the most unique characters you'll ever see, but because of the bond they share with each other. The characters are very well developed, have interesting/fun personalities, and most importantly, they are easy to love. They all have interesting backgrounds, some which are tragic, and are striving to achieve their dreams as they adventure together. As they travel along, they start to care for each other so deeply to the point where they would do anything to protect each other, creating extremely powerful and emotional episodes or arcs at some point. 
The Straw Hat crew members are exceptionally great, but the supporting characters themselves are no slouch either. Most of them are designed well and have unique, interesting personalities. Unlike many anime, they aren't just pushed to the side, no. Most of them have interesting, yet traguc backgrounds and goals,  and you can't help but cheer for them as they try to achieve their own goals. Some even are just as lovable as the main characters themselves! Hell, I even cheered for some of the antagonists at one point as well, as they were just too likable and unique.  
 
One Piece is an amazing anime. Although not perfect, it still is one of the most fun and entertaining experience I've ever had. I know many people who won't even give One Piece a chance for couple of reasons. Most are turned away by the art, some are discouraged because of the episode count, and some are even victims of the infamous 4kids dub (which was HORRIBLE btw). Well, I can't force people to watch it, but I really think everyone should give One Piece at least a chance. In one anime, you'll be taken through a journey full of adventure, good action, comedy, and drama. Who knows? You could enjoy the hell out of this show, and possibly forget about every downsides I mentioned above.  
 
I sure did, and maybe you could as well, if you just give it a try.

          
 
       Helpful Hahaha... I love one piece. I really do. Found it when the straw hats hit the new world. Watched it from the beginnng like 3 times. I just wish that the show would break for a year so episodes could have more content. Cause with it on the a$$ of the manga. It’s quality is dropping. Dressrosa was the worst arc to get through because it seemed like they were so desperate to slow down they didn’t put anything into any of the episodes. Getting better with the current arc but they really do need to do something. Wether they put the show on hold. Or just add some fillers that would at least have something better than crowds running and a 10min intro

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","The series, based on the Lupin III manga written by Monkey Punch beginning in 1967, centers on the adventures of Arsène Lupin III, the grandson of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc's series of novels. He is joined by Daisuke Jigen, crack-shot and Lupin's closest ally; Fujiko Mine, the femme fatale and Lupin's love interest who works against Lupin more often than with him; and Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman and the descendant of Ishikawa Goemon, the legendary Japanese bandit. Lupin is often chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata, the rather cynical detective who has made it his life mission to catch Lupin.
","I really, really love Lupin III. I'm definitely a biased reviewer, because Lupin is my favorite anime franchise out of everything I've seen, but I really can't express how much I adore it.  Red jacket can really be considered the essence of the Lupin franchise, and is often the one that people think of when anyone says Lupin. 
 
Story: 10 
Personally I'm a big fan of episodic type shows, and that's definitely what Lupin is.  The story isn't always captivating or original, because after 155 episodes it becomes impossible to not reuse the same gags, but I really enjoy it just because of the fun, casual writing and the characterization. 
 
Art: 10 
The art isn't exactly extraordinary, but it's an older anime- I love it because it lends to the feeling of the show and the franchise, and it really wouldn't be the same any other way. 
 
Sound: 10 
One of my FAVORITE parts about Lupin. The Lupin VA, especially in this series, do a fantastic job, and Yuji Ohno has been producing music for this franchise the entire time it's been airing- don't get me started on the music scores for the new Italian blue jacket series. It doesn't feel right without Ohno's gorgeous jazz composition, and they're the kind of OSTs I'd listen to in their own right, as music separate from the show. 
 
Characters: 10 
The piece de resistance of Lupin is definitely the characters. Because it's so episodic in nature, the characters are really what set the Lupin franchise apart. I can't say enough about how much I adore all the characters. They are very much stereotypes- a cocky ore-sama type thief, a Girl With Boobs, the best gunman and the best samurai, and a cop- but at the same time, they subvert their stereotypes in a way that makes them all the more engaging. Lupin treasures the loyalty of his friends more than anything, Fujiko has the brains and the brawn to seal the deal, Jigen is a secret romantic, Goemon's biggest weakness is women, and Zenigata loves Lupin to the point where he doesn't want him to die, despite and because of being his greatest rival. The uniqueness of each character in their own right is one of the biggest things that keeps me, personally, coming back. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall: 10 
I really, really love this series and this franchise. I'd say it's definitely a quality watch, and if you're interested in getting into Lupin but don't know where to start, either this or the 2015 blue jacket series (if you're hesitant about jumping straight in with pre-2000s anime) is a great place to jump off. Before you know it, you'll be like me, downloading every TV special and OST... ;)

          
 
       Helpful In Anime, there exists a few great works that structured the road and pioneered the way for those who came after them. Lupin the 3rd is one of those works. 
 
Starting the grandson of the first Lupin, Lupin the 3rd. Known all around the world for his thieving skills, charismatic personality, and monkey face. 
His gang of The marksman Gigen, the samurai Goemon, and the charming cat-thief Fujiko all link together for what to be a humorous set of adventures. 
The plot mostly consist of single-case episodes. Familiar faces pops-up every once a while, like Detective Zenigata, whose sole purpose in life is see Lupin behind bars. 
The series will take you into a world-tour journey as the great Lupin's adventures know no bounds! 
so you won't get bored of the same stages every episode. 
but you might get bored of its the simple nature, as the show itself is considered primitive, and you will find yourself laughing sometimes on things that were not made for that! (lazy drawings, goofy sounds) 
The staff behind the show like the animators and producers didn't really make a good impression, but you will love the classic voice actors who've done a great job with their characters. 
So basically, if you didn't like the characters, then you better off not wasting your time on 100+ eps anime with no serious plot. 
but if you do , then you will have your fare share of fun adventures and comical situations. 
I can finally describe this series as being very simple, yet very fun! 
The red-jacket Lupin is the best amongst the 3 Lupin TV series! and it made it possible for all the movies the came after it, much to the joy of the fans! 
 
This franchise has carved its mark on anime history, and it's on of those fine classics that any anime fan might want to check out

          
 
       Helpful After completing the first series which I enjoyed pretty much I immediately started watching this second one. And it really began good. Great episodes like their stay in Rio or the adventure with Nessie in Loch Ness, Scotland, are what I now simply call ""classic"".  
The problem with this series, though, is, that the episodes don't relate to each other. Ok, just watching one parter again and again can be fun, if you have to watch 155 episodes, though,  it can be really annyoing (I'm a Lupin fan ever since I watched some of the 90's films, so dropping was no option for me). This was also the reason I put this series on hold after about 40 episodes. 
 
Well, I continued watching it of course, moreover, I stumbled across  some nice to great episodes. One of them I'd like to highlight is Jigen's escape from Russia with a prima balerina. Amazing! 
However, after about 80 episodes the subtitles became horribly to read, why? Subtitles layed over other subtitles, really no fun. This continued until episode 130. 
 
As for the art and sound - don't expect anything too great. This anime aired from '77 to '80, besides, the music is mostly annyoing (especially the ""Super Hero"" song) 
 
In terms of characters...yaaay! Jigen Daisuke has become one of my most favourite ones while watching this series. Cool and calm, always ready to help Lupin, the womanizer out of his pinches. Lupin himself can be a pain in the ass, when he's trying to hit on women (and always fails xD). Goemon, who is cool, too and Fujiko complete the gang.  
Always persuing them is the (sometimes) lunatic Inspector Zenigata, a man who devoted his life apprehending Lupin bringing about more damage than he stops lol. 
 
All in all, if you watched the first series and you enjoyed it, this is a must watch, although there are so many horrible episodes. As a fan of the films I just had to watch this. And although I only give this a 6/10, I really don't feel as if I wasted my time watching it. The last episodes, by the way, where so good, that I'm looking forward to watching the third and last of the series.  
 
Thanks for reading x> !!!

Enjoyment (7/10) - This was a nice OVA, a little different hearing the original voices since I'm used to watching the Dub.

Story:- The story revolves around new police recruit Natsumi Tsujimoto, who arrives on her moped (this is a really personal awesome moment for me, as I want to join the police and also my only method of transport, as I live in the country, is a moped.) She gets chased by her yet-to-be-known future partner, Miyuki Kobayakawa, and they are also part of an amazing cast including an intelligence officer, a police motorcyclist, a shinto priest and a chief officer, to name a few. I won't spoil it, but each episode revolves around something you'd see in a police drama, so it's 30 minutes of awesome police action! 
Art - the art is pretty awesome. It's an older anime (airing in 1998) so CGI wasn't in use so much, so the hand-drawn style is unique, as every artist is different. It works well even in a pseudo-reality anime, which is nice, as you can see how it would work well in a fictional anime, but to know that it also works in the complete opposite is interesting. 
Sound - the sound is what you'd expect from a action police drama-esque show, with no wierd sound additions that could've been implemented, which is really awesome. The intro theme is pretty cool too. 
Character - now this anime has bags of charm. Each character feels like a different person, and aren't too odd like anime characters can be, even in a pseudo-realistic anime like this. With these separate characters come connections that different people will have. Having recentley grown up around bikes, I really relate to Ken Nakajima, the police motorcyclist. Others will relate to the stern, but kind-hearted chief officer, while others to all-round nice guy and secret cop, the shinto priest. It really fleshes these characters out, and it works really well! 
Enjoyment/Overall - overall, this has become one of my favourite animes. It would be litreally my all-time favourite, but Love Live! School Idol Project takes that spot, but that's for another review. So, taking everything into account, I think this anime is oustanding, I cannot wait to watch the father behind this animes other creation, Oh my Goddess!, and it deserves it's 10, out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful 逮捕しちゃうぞ - Taiho Shichauzo is as captivating as an unusual and nice slice of life anime based on a popular novel of the same name. The review covers both the four episodes OVA (1994-1995) and the later adapted television series (1996-1997). Old but worth to sneak a peek! 
 
Story: Simple but profound way to portray human warmth and values (7/10) 
A police comedy drama about the two patrol officers Tsujimoto, Natsumi and Kobayakawa, Miyuki and their daily adventures in the traffic department of the Bokutou police station in Tokyo. The little adventures that you might find too fluffy, but the characters are brought into some slightly thrilling situations and the way in which the little everyday disasters are solved is credible and provides a lot of fun on the other hand. One can criticize that a police officer should not show up at work with a hangover and that the overall tone is a little too breezy for a series about policemen, high-speed hunts and natural disasters. There are no shootings, no deaths of any kind. Instead, villains are arrested, people rescued and dates enjoyed. Maybe that's why I like the show so much, because everything is solved in a human and understandable way. 
 
Characters: cute and well portrayed, therefore sympathetic & interesting (8/10) 
The characterization is well done and focuses on how the two very different women become friends and how their partnership helps them to become better at their job. This is also the summary of the OVA. If you asked me for a recommendation, it would be like this, watch the first four episodes (OVA) and if you don't like it, skip the series. 
 
*The description of the characters may include spoilers, so better watch the anime first.* 
 
Tsujimoto Natsumi: 
She is open-minded, funny and has a certain inclination to see everything as a competition that has to be won. She's the type: female buddy, which sometimes leads to very funny scenes. However, she is friendly and kindhearted, very credible and adorable in her own way, a true friend. 
Kobayakawa Miyuki: 
She's the perfect counterpart, she's serious, patient and a hell of a mechanic. Call me old-fashioned and typically male, but a woman with whom you can spend a whole day in the garage repairing a motorcycle or a car, and she also has a very good taste in terms of classical cars, drives in private life a Toyota GT 2000, I'm in love ;) 
The supporting characters may be stereotypical, but they are well-structured and fulfill their roles. On the other hand, the diversity of different characters keeps the story interesting and remains exciting until the very end. 
Kachou (Captain): 
At first glance, a strict but loyal superior, to whom all others show great respect and trust. He fulfills his role well and the more the series progresses, the more human he appears. His character is gradually revealed, which is done very well. 
Fox Oshou (temple priest): 
My personal favorite among the secondary character. I don't want to reveal too much at this point, except that I`m sure if you watch the show (esp. the OVA), you will understand why I think the priest is pretty cool.   
Nakajima, Ken: 
I know that he is 100% stereotypical, but his character is so brilliantly described that fits perfectly. He respects the law, is decent person and just a little naive and so wonderfully clumsy about women (esp. Miyuki) that you can only laugh about it. Nevertheless, his character gets a development, which is very slow but steady, you almost don't notice it, only in the end you think, Oh! What happened? 
Nikaidou, Yoriko: 
She's kind of cute but she's also the worst kind of gossip-monger, what often causes misunderstandings and additional problems. 
Aoi, Futaba: 
Beside Natsumi and Miyuki one of the most interesting characters of the series. The way the character is introduced may be a little embarrassing at first, but the rest of the series shows an excellent character portrayal. Even this extraordinary personality meets all human facets and the character as well as his motives are comprehensibly developed out of the situation.  
 
*spoiler alert end * 
 
Visuals: Art and animation are handled very well (8/10) 
Art shows a great deal of skill and ambition, not only for the time in which the anime was created. It is a well-known fact that Fujishima-san is a fan of cars and motorcycles and therefore the drawings of the vehicles are very detailed. But also the character sketches, for which Nakajima, Atsuko (OVA) and for the TV-series again Nakajima, Atsuko and Matsutake, Tokuyuki were responsible, are very well done and make the individual characters very lively. For a time when computer animation was still in its infancy, the colours may not be as varied, but beautiful in their entirety. Furthermore wonderful shadings and successful transitions were created. In addition, the animation especially of the pursuits drives are awesome. A really great example are the multiple chases in bad weather, these passages are simply gorgeous. 
 
Sounds: sound effects, voices and BGM match the series well (8/10) 
The BGM by Ōtani Kō is very well done (Ep. 1-4 OVA), accompanies the plot well and in particular is not used continuously. If you think of City Hunter and Gundam Wing, you are already familiar with his works. A very positive aspect of his arrangements is that the characters obtain the opportunity to show a development based solely on their facial expressions and actions that are not influenced by background music. I like this signs of professionalism and creativity very much, which offers the characters space to unfold a great deal of complexity and leave it to the audience to interpret it unaffected by the BGM. Iwasaki Yasunori joined the team for the musical design of the following TV series (Ep. 5-51). 
The OP for the OVA is „100mph no Yuuki"" by Hiramatsu, Akiko & Tamagawa, Sakiko. It`s a cheerful title sung by the Seiyū of Natsumi and Miyuki and sounds like a typical idol song but lyrics and melody convey the right mood. 
The ED is again sung by Tamagawa-san & Hiramatsu-san and is called ""Arittake no Jōnetsu de"" a gentle, soft ending sequence. Both OP and ED impress with very good art and animation, especially considering the fact that they were created around the mid 90s. The two similar sequences that revolve around the two policewomen are very pleasant to watch. The movements of the characters are natural, there aren't a lot of still frames used and as mentioned above, the sketches of the characters are pretty well done, with lots of details and a grandiose play of light and shadow. 
The TV series starts from Ep. 5 to 25 with the title ""Boku de Aru Tame ni"" by Flying Kids, a real catchy tune from the 90s. You can listen to it or dance Fox Trot, if you like. 
The ED for Ep. 5-25 is ""Thank You, Love"", sung by Terada, Keiko a really wonderful song, a favorite of mine. A good musical arrangement and the tender singing Terada-san is a pleasure to listen. 
The opening of Ep. 26 to the end is ""Love Somebody"" by Fukui, Mariko, also beautiful, but the Japanese pop singer sings a bit faster and more lively. The title was also her debut. 
The ED from episode 26 is ""Sora o Miagete"" sung by Shirai, Takako. It is a beautiful song, a really great melody and a gorgeous voice. Maybe the ED animation is a bit simple, but the character images are incredibly beautiful. 
The voice acting and dialogue directing in Japanese were done very neatly, of course not without clichés, but also many scenes that are quite funny with typical Japanese puns and cultural jokes. A little sad is that the the lip-sync was not done correctly. Sometimes there is a sound without mouth movement, but that`s just a minor mistake. For those looking for an English dub, before you get your knickers in a twist, a little warning that Natsumi sounds like a West Coast beach beauty. Also, AnimEigo's English dubbing is not faithful to the original, but surprisingly the English subtitles have been done much better in this regard, so I would recommend the original with subtitles. 
This leads us directly to the voice actors, a very good overall picture of the character roles. I particularly liked the voice of Kobayakawa Miyuki, spoken by Hiramatsu, Akiko. She added a very feminine and caring softness to the character role, which fit well. 
Also, the voice actress Kozakura, Etsuko as the voice of Nikaidou, Yoriko has shown a very good performance and Yoriko`s character as the gossip of the police station is vividly presented.  
And last but not least, Matsumoto, Rica as voice of Aoi, Futaba was a very good choice, a pleasant sound, warm and mellow. 
 
Taiho Shichauzo focuses on it`s characters and their personalities and doesn't seek to entertain the audience with excessive bloodshed, shootings and cruelty. A series that is really worth seeing, charming and enjoyable, at a good pace. All in all nice entertainment, recommended to fans who like a cop story a little easier and humorous. 
 
 
Thanks for reading and have fun watching.

          
 
       Helpful Here I find myself writing a review for a underrated show that from what I noticed doesn't get the love and attention that it needs. Well let's get on with it! 
 
You're under arrest is a blast from the 90's providing everything that I wanted from this kind of show: Characters who steal your heart with their personality and charisma, jazzy ost during each episode and catchy op and ed song that makes you dance, unique animation style used during the 90's(glittering water animation is one my favorites) and finally a solid story that gives you a nostalgic feeling if you were a kid of the 90's. 
The sound of the car engine  running on the highway, the jazzy ost that accompanies it, a monologue filled with substance and depth told into the sunset, a dialogue line that emphasize the characters traits, a one second decision that changes everything during a car chase, this is what You're under arrest offer to it's viewers. 
 
You're under arrest is a show that focuses on the daily life of its characters but also on their job as policemen/policewomen. It aims on the both sides of the coin and it does a great job at doing so, the result is a action packed slice of life with great female characters who steal you're heart with their personality and charisma, and capable male characters who despite their lazy and funny personality when they're is no room for mistake they are the ones who you can rely on them. 
 
The characters are what makes this kind of show great! They have their own moments and spotlight during the show were they manage to shine. A single glance to their partner is enough to make both of them understand  the next course of action is, one dialogue line filled with substance that changes everything, a flashback used at the right moment, well done collaboration to solve a case, these are the things which You're under arrest uses for the development of its characters.  
 
You can easily distinguish the characters from their course of action and unique personality traits. We have Miyuki( best grill of course) a mechanical freak who loves to make adjustments on cars and motorcycles but she also has a sweet side and a crush on one of her colleagues, Natsumi who relies on brute force and her competitive spirit to manage everything, Nakajima a professional bike rider who has a crush on one of her female colleagues but he is to shy to confess, the Chief who is always lazy but serious and does his job perfect when it counts, Aoi who is one of the best traps that I have seen, her character and reasons are so well handled that you can relate to why he dresses as a women and finally Fujiko who looks like a hopeless policewomen at first glance who likes to gossip  but when you get to know her she is really suited for her job. What I am trying to say is that the characters have depth, substance and solid reasons of choosing these line of career. 
 
As many shows with a length of 50 episodes you will find some so called ""filler episodes"" that are only for the comic relief or to take a break from the serious episodes. Don't worry this show has some serious and dark arcs that portray the pride and stake of what means to be a police officer and how the public perceives this institution. You will see sweat on the face of the characters, you will see them putting everything they have at stake to protect their pride and honor as police officers during those arcs so you won't be disappointed at all. 
 
 
The music is one of my favorites aspects from this show, the opening song is so catchy that I almost find myself dancing on it, the ending song is so 90's and has a nostalgic vibe and the jazzy ost during each episode makes me raise the volume higher. While the animation quality is not as great as the one from the ova(you will be amazed  how each detail was so well crafted despite it's 24 years age) the visuals still manage to capture my attention and  during the the action scenes the animation is top notch for its time.  
 
I gave this show a 9 because I want others to try it out especially for the slice of life lovers who want something different you will not be disappointed, contrary you will be surprised like I was about how good the sol moments were handled. It's the magic of Studio Deen that manages each time to create something enjoyable and solid for its audience. Well then thank you for your time and patience reading this and I hope you will have a blast  watching this anime!

","This is not a place for those who seek best design, animation, soundtrack. This anime only portrays more on a well written story over everything else (including character developments, interactions, story flow). 
 
After dedicating myself to all 3 seasons , the anime has played a role in showing the realization that best story are not only to be told from Japan, for it can also be found from other countries as well. It is not a simple task to win over this in terms of story plot.  
 
My review of this anime series (all seasons):  
 
Story S1 + S2 10/10  
Completely mindblown Jin Yong is a masterpiece. Story flows consistently well from the start until the end. All main and supporting characters plays an essential role, some sticking to the series until the very end, including the big bird in the opening song. Character grows over each seasons. The naive and childish Yang Gua in S1, evolving into a legendary, matured man in S3. Yang Gua and Xiao Lung Nu love to each other: lovely and pure. 
 
Story S3 8/10 
Disappointed with the last few episodes. 
 
Animation and soundtracks S1 6/10 
Decent designs, just not up to today's standard. Love both the OP and ED. Japanese dub is average.  
 
Animation and soundtracks S2 + S3 5/10 
1)Animation doesn't look like much effort is inserted. Crushing sea water onto ship looks like mountain emerging from the bottom. 2)Repetitive long flashbacks, flashback of Yang Gua rescuing Huang Rong shown twice. 3)Certain scenes repeated broken soundtracks. OP and ED songs changed yet uses S1 OP animation, doesn't fit.  
Cantonese dub is otherwise, good. Perfectly fits the character. Made me laugh.  
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
Because of the story. 
 
Overall 10/10 (ignoring animation and sound) 
Love it. Lots of meaningful messages to the audiences: grow over mistakes, independent life, knowing when to stop, never stop learning, be helpful, be a good example, forgive and forget, etc. 
 
I give my credits to the author Jin Yong for introducing such an amazing story. Also a big thanks to the production staff for making an anime version of the Condor Hero series.  Have no regret watching it. One of the world's greatest ancient chinese story ever told! 


          
 
       Helpful The art, sound, and even action sequences were nothing more than mediocre, but the story is where this anime really outshines so many others. It is true that it is a little on the older side, and the animation quality is definitely not the best. Even so, I was so enthralled in the love story between the two main characters that everything else hardly mattered.  
 
Still, I would strongly suggest watching the English Subbed version of this anime. I happened upon the dubbed version, and the voices were a little hard to listen to, so for this, I would say the subbed version may come across more appealing. 
 
So overall, if your looking for an anime with top notch art and visual effects, this is not the one for you. But if your looking for one of the most beautiful love stories involving a little Kung Fu ;), then this is precisely the anime to watch, and I would recommend it to any anime lovers out there. So go for it!

          
 
       Helpful For anyone who does not know, this is anime adaptation of one of Chinese Classic love stories. Even though there is a lot of drama adaptations(by the Chinese), I find the anime appealing in some ways as it gives a simpler design of characters that have been overemphasize through the years.  
 
Nonetheless, this anime is not without flaws. 
 
The title is incorrect: Unless you read the original story, the actual title of it is actually Return of the Condor Heroes/Condor Heroes and Companions for direct Chinese translation. The title that it is currently named by refer to the prequel of this story 
 
Some of the appearances of characters are incorrect: the main protagonist Little Dragon Maiden(literally how you translate it) is known as a peerless beauty of her time with pale angelic skins and long black hair. I mean I know Japanese animators love to color in women of all different hair colors, but it would be nice to get the lead girl's hair right..... 
 
Over repeated scenes: I guess this is the biggest turn down as the animation is probably run on budget. During the process, if this was to compete with other Japanese animation of its time, it would not do well. However since it is a Chinese classic, the story starting at Season 2 was exclusively Chinese and I believed it was air in Chinese Kids shows 
 
Despite these aspects of it, I really enjoy seeing this story again as at least in the first season of the show, it was faithful to the original story. Yang Guo the lead male is a trouble maker and trickerster(he actually more devious and cunning in the original story) while Little Dragon Maiden other than her martial arts is a sweet innocent girl who just want to settle for a peaceful life with her beloved.  
 
 
P.S. If anyone has any questions on this story or comments about this bad review, feel free to message me. In terms of romance that I have watched, I usually don't feel this way about it other than Inuyasha.

Lupin and his gang travel around the globe in search of the world's greatest treasures and riches and always keeping one step ahead of the tireless Inspector Zenigata, who has vowed to bring Lupin to justice.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"Lupin III: Part III is an interesting case as far as Lupin goes, to say the least—of the six total Lupin III series, (""The Woman Called Fujiko Mine"" included) it's the least talked about by far, and generally gets a bad rap. The exact reason for this is unknown, but is likely a combination of these three factors: 
•Highly questionable subtitles produced in-house by either Crunchyroll or TMS 
•Character designs that seem to change on a per-episode basis 
•Specific expectations from fans coming off other Lupin works for what ""Lupin III"" should be 
 
Despite these circumstances, opinions on Part III have begun to improve over the years, with some fans even calling it their favorite outing in the Lupin franchise. In this review, I'll be breaking down Part III, in an effort to inform readers on its ups, downs, and what shows I'd recommend as companion pieces to this anime. 
 
~STORY~ 
The first thing any Lupin fan will likely tell you about the franchise's stories is that, with the exception of recent installments, the only thing that stays the same is the basic cast of characters. Part III is no different, thrusting the Lupin gang into a new (sexy) adventure every episode. This makes this show (and Lupin III as a whole) extremely easy to pick up and watch, as no prior knowledge of the story is needed. 
 
But how do the stories themselves fare? Part III suffers from the same problems as its predecessor in that sometimes, the stories are, like Darth Vader, more machine than man. Typically, there are four types of Lupin stories: ""Heist,"" ""One-off villain or helper,"" ""Assassin gunning for the gang,"" and ""Previous lover/associate."" 
Part III mixes it up a bit with a few outstanding episodes (one has Lupin using a dolphin for a heist, only for it to fall in love with him and force him into dolphin-marriage.) and the introduction of the ""War zone"" episode to the formula. Furthermore, rather than shooting towards a specific tone, Part III features a blend of the silly, outrageous stories told in Part II, and the more grounded, hard-edged stories told in Part I. 
 
~ART AND ANIMATION~ 
The art and animation in Part III is BY FAR the most interesting aspect of the show. Long story short, Yuzo Aoki, an animator who had contributed greatly to Lupin since its animated 1969 pilot, was chosen to direct the show as well as its character designs. Aoki looked long and hard at his project, and came to several conclusions: 
1. Every past Lupin's art has been an interpretation of Part 1's art, and not the manga's. 
2. I have a gigantic animation staff. 
3. It would be cool if I could create the base designs, and then let said gigantic animation staff do whatever they want with them. 
 
This decision by Aoki paved the way for Part III to become something unlike any anime before, and quite possibly after. Early on, the designs are really clean, with slightly conservative animation. At about the halfway point, though, they start to become loose, angular, and hilariously animated in a way reminiscent of Looney Tunes. The second opening, and the final ten or so episodes in particular, are the peak of this style, and the areas in which it goes into COMPLETE overdrive. 
 
~MUSIC AND VOICE ACTING~ 
There isn't really too much to say about Part III's soundtrack. Yuji Ohno is back from Part II, but with more atmosphere-oriented music. It does the job just fine, but you won't find a moment outside the opening and ending songs where you'll go ""Man, that's my favorite!"" 
 
Also returning from Part II's sound division are the five main characters' most iconic voice actors: 
•Yasuo Yamada - Lupin 
•Kiyoshi Kobayashi - Jigen 
•Makio Inoue - Goemon 
•Eiko Masuyama - Fujiko 
•Gorō Naya - Inspector Zenigata 
 
Their performances in Part III are, in my opinion, their absolute best, with everyone portraying a variety of emotions. Makio Inoue's Goemon even gets to loudly sing Japanese folk music while eating noodles on one occasion—something extremely rare for the stoic samurai. 
 
~CHARACTER~ 
Part III's interpretation of the Lupin characters is almost top-notch, with the only straggler being Fujiko. Part III's Lupin is a nice blend of the previous ones, still a bit silly, but not constantly pining after Fujiko to the point that it's annoying. Part III's Jigen is a mix between early Part I's sarcastic Jigen and Part II's somber one. Goemon here is the same as ever—he cuts things. This time, though, they really ham up his traditional samurai thing (singing to noodles). Zenigata is a whole lot more creative with his set-ups in this series, with the Lupin gang often having to adjust or adapt their heists to his presence. 
Fujiko is played just a bit too straight here, with her always going behind enemy lines for the gang or betraying the Lupin crew. She also doesn't have any real character moments like how she did in Part I. 
 
~OVERALL~ 
Overall, I believe Part III is definitely a good watch, particularly for seeing its art evolve into the second half's amazing, pastel-colored madness. Here's how I rank each aspect of the show: 
STORY: 6 
ART AND ANIMATION: 10 
MUSIC AND VOICE ACTING: 7 
CHARACTER: 9 
 
~COMPANION PIECES TO LUPIN III: PART III~ 
•Lupin III: The Mystery of Mamo - Same crazed style as Part III, except the crazy is in the story. 
 
•FLCL - Similar campy and at times bizarre feel. 
 
•Monkey Punch no Sekai: Alice - An OVA adaptation of another manga by Monkey Punch, also directed by Yuzo Aoki. 
 
•Lupin III: The Legend of the Gold of Babylon - A Lupin movie with the same visual style as the late second half of this show, but poorer execution due to Development Hell.

          
 
       Helpful Lupin III: Part III is without question the least talked about out of all the Lupin III series. If I had to guess why that is, I assume it would be because of it's choice of style for one. It has more of a cartoony feel and makes some questionable changes to the looks of the characters. These changes vary throughout the course of the 50 episode anime. It can take some time to get use to if you're familiar with the previous series which in itself was pretty different from the original series. Part III to me resembles the art in the manga.  Monkey Punch (creator) was influenced by a few artists who worked on Mad magazine which is fairly obvious if you have read the manga. I could go into more detail about that but I'm going give you some basic knowledge and also tell you why the show is a blast. 
 
I'm not going to sit here and tell you about the characters because this is the third series and it's only common sense to assume that the person reading this has already checked out part I and II. Just like the previous series, there is no long term narrative. Each episode is it's own story. There is nothing to really invest in except for the fun adventures the characters go on for 24 minutes. It's quite similar to part II in terms of the kinds of stories they tell. Silly, weird, humorous, and usually lighthearted just to name a few.  It's always enjoyable to see what ridiculous item Lupin plans to steal that episode. The episodes themselves are much more exaggerated and abstract due to the cartoony style they're going for. Yuji Ohno returns to compose the music. Instead of it being jazzy, It feels more funky to me which I guess is to go along with the ""80's"" look. It still sounds incredible nevertheless if that's the kind of music you enjoy. 
 
There's not a whole lot to say about this series that a person who's already watched Lupin already knows. If you enjoy adventure comedies or shows that are character driven, then watch this. It has the greatest group of characters in all of anime. It's the kind of show you can relax and turn your brain off for an hour or two. It's pretty fast paced and at times witty. I'd say it's pretty refreshing to watch after viewing some of the red jacket films. Give it a try.

0,5300,116,4.117773018462173,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou,"As with its prequel,  Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou  is about Takashi Natsume, a boy who has had the ability to see youkai since he was young, and his bodyguard youkai Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei. Natsume attempts to return names written in his ""Book of Friends"" (which he inherited from his grandmother Reiko) to youkai in his village. Throughout these adventures, he meets some youkai that are friendly, some that want to steal the Book, and some that want to kill him, as Natsume learns about himself and his relationship with these mysterious beings along the way. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","For as long as he can remember, Takashi Natsume has had the ability to see spirits, inheriting the power from his grandmother Reiko Natsume. This ability resulted in his having a lonely childhood because children his age considered him strange. He had also been passed from one relative to another. Upon her death, Reiko bequeathed to her grandson her Book of Friends, a book containing the names of spirits she had bullied into servitude.
The Book of Friends is considered a highly prized item in the spirit world, and spirits -
both good and malicious – haunt Takashi constantly because of it. Takashi spends his time dissolving the contracts that Reiko created and releasing the various spirits that come to him for help. Malicious spirits on the other hand try to kill him to obtain possession of the book, which is where Madara (called Nyanko-sensei by Natsume) comes in. Madara serves as Natsume's bodyguard and spiritual advisor of sorts, even though ostensibly he is motivated by his own desire to possess the Book of Friends. He later begins to become more attached to Takashi, with the latter forming a similar bond with Madara.
","NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run. 
 
Natsume Yuujinchou covers a familiar kind of story. We are presented with a teenage boy, who is unusually airy and doesn't socialize much, and frequently seems to be looking intently at things that aren't there. As you may have guessed, Natsume sees dead people. Well, not exactly... he can see Youkai, a kind of spirit told of in Japanese folklore. 
 
Many of the Youkai themselves seem to possess an unusual interest in Natsume. One day, as a pair of Youkai are chasing him, he accidentally breaks a seal containing a powerful Youkai... one that knows why Natsume is being chased. You see, his grandmother Reiko had the same gift as him, and used to go around beating up Youkai and making them give away their names to her (which allowed her to command them), which she collected in a book, the titular Yuujinchou (Book of Friends). And now that Reiko is dead, Natsume has to attempt to return the names, but without losing the book in the process. And his new Youkai friend Madara has agreed to help protect him, as long as he is entitled to the book upon Natsume's natural passing. 
 
What is really impressive about Natsume Yuujinchou is that, from that plot summary there, you will mostly likely think of many other series from various different mediums that follow a similar blueprint. And yet Natsume is significantly better than them. Natsume, as a series, takes on this theme with a brilliant level of poignancy. Rather than being a generic shonen action series as it so easily could have been (many of the bare bones of the series show parallels to Bleach, for example), Natsume is more concerned with telling the stories of each of these Youkai. While there is the occasional flash of action, this is never really the point. It's extremely refreshing to see a premise so frequently used for nothing more than cheap kicks done so beautifully. It even strikes something of a contrast with excellent series such as Mushishi and Mononoke, in that while these are focused on the abnormality of the creatures the series is based around, Yuujinchou is far more down to earth and human-feeling. 
 
Plotwise, this series is episodic, with the episodes focusing on individual youkai, with the stories not generally intertwining or crossing more than one episode (though there are exceptions). Almost all of the episodes are excellent, though there's two or three I didn't really care for. The second season in particular ups the quality of these, with the last four standing out as being firmly the best out of both seasons. There's not really anything in the way of an overarching plot or any clear goal, but it's all tied together through the furthering of Natsume's character and the additional insights into Reiko which we see through the Youkai's memories, both of which are excellent features of the series. 
 
The characterisation in this series is truly unique. Every character is very down-to-earth and believable, and yet not quite your everyday average Joe either. They all have distinctive personalities, and yet feel totally natural. The character designs are much the same way: simple-looking, but effective and distinctive. The only characters who are consistently in every episode are Natsume himself, and his Youkai bodyguard Madara A.K.A Nyanko-sensei. Madara is mostly comic relief, but effectively so. In his true form he's much easier to take seriously, which is often used to good effect. Natsume, on the other hand, is definitely the pinnacle of the aforementioned style. He doesn't really have a clear, character-defining moment or trait, which initially makes him seem like an uninteresting character. However, the more you get to know him, the better a character he seems. He is slowly but surely characterised through musings and realizations gathered through his experiences with all the Youkai he meets, painting a subtle yet excellent portrait of his character. In the third season, this reaches it's peak, as he slowly comes to not only accept, but value his unique circumstances and all the friends he's made because of it. 
 
In terms of production, the animation is superb. Oddly, though, it's quite restrained about it. Aside from some really beautiful, picturesque background art, it doesn't attempt to beat you over the head with its visuals, letting them stay in the background but subtly lending a lot to the series. In the second season especially, though, it dishes out quite a few animation bumps in some of the series more excellent moments, when it really needs to be rendered better. With this, combined with an excellent character art style, Natsume Yuujinchou just plain looks beautiful all-round. Musically, the OST does much the same as the art: it is distinct, amazing, perfectly fitting, but not overbearing. The music is invariably perfectly matched to the tone of the scene rather than being used to create the tone. The voice acting is all-round excellent, but my only problem with it is, strangely enough, Natsume himself. Hiroshi Kamiya was, in my opinion, a poor choice of casting. He does, however, put in an excellent performance which is hardly surprising given how good of an actor he is, but his voice seems terribly unfit to the role, and far more suited to more average and highly strung protagonists like those he usually plays, as opposed to the awkward, airy Natsume. Still, it's hardly distracting. 
 
If I have any real complaint about Natsume Yuujinchou, it's that almost every episode's plot is built from a random contrivance. Generally, Natsume encounters something vital to the plot of the episode by sheer coincidence that is not directly tied to the plot at all. It's not terribly distracting, but it's done repeatedly and always seems far too convenient. 
 
Nonetheless, Natsume Yuujinchou is an excellent series. It's a calming, relaxing show that simply does its job well. The second and third seasons are better than the first, with the second having better standalone episodes, along with better art and directing than the other two, and the third contributing more to the overall story and Natsume's development. Which season is the best is really a question of style vs. substance. 
 
Final Words: Something I would solidly recommend to anyone looking for a calming, soothing anime.

As the first series continues, Natsume Takashi learned that many youkai have different powers with different purposes. 
 
The Story... 
 
It’s a continuation of the first series as they made a slightly different way of development because it shows more involvement of youkai and his capability to use his own power. It focuses of using the same method of youkai solving as new tale to tell and to discover as it goes deeper in its arc. The drama and mystery here became more interesting and entertaining than before as they add some twist to cope up viewers on watching. 
 
Definitely a different way of continuing the preceding series as it really goes very well. 
 
Art & Animation... 
 
Beautiful backgrounds, detailed character designs, and impressive scenery just like the preceding. Noticing the difference from before, it’s jibing better and more appropriate in its settings. 
 
The OP and ED theme is just truly wonderful… better than before. 
 
Sound... 
 
The OP and ED song is lively, dramatic, calm. Both of them matched its theme that contains such wonderful and harmonious art and BG sounds adds up the enjoyment through the show. 
 
Character… 
 
Hmmm… Natsume Takashi, he's kind of weak in physical appearance, a compassionate type among youkai, not that free spirited among human beings but reverse among youkai, and improves a lot in this series. As for Madara the other main or the best supporting character on the series that keeps the level of boredom on the bottom became sillier, and more knowledgeable in puns. 
 
And for the other characters who sometimes make an appearance in this series, they help the series to be complete and entertaining. 
 
Enjoyment… 
 
It's quite redundant in its case; it might be an anime that will keep you interested in their arcs, art & animation, sounds, but not quite in the characters. It has a plain and calm feature. 
 
Overall… 
 
Recommended for those who wants a slice of life with different style of maintaining its peaceful feature. A style where people tend to communicate in other species for resolving what must be done to solve its problem. 
 
It is a mixture of drama, supernatural, and slice of life that will give you depth in life.

          
 
       Helpful Ahahaha~ I rated everything a ten. No. I'm not some mindless idiot who thought this series was the best thing since sliced bread. I'm a fellow reviewer who KNOWS this series is the best thing since sliced bread. Anyway, on with the review! 
 
Story: 10/10 
If you loved Natsume Yuujinchou's storyline, then you'll love Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou just the same. I honestly have a thing for 'characters who are shunned by others because of their special abilities' when it comes to anime. And I loved how they developed the story throughout the series. Makes it more enjoyable to watch. 
 
Art: 10/10 
The art . . . The art's amazing. It fitted every single moment perfectly. Plus, what I loved about this anime? No awkward animation. At all. Even with creepy Youkai. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
The same goes with the sound. They chose the best music for each situation: A battle against the Youkai, times when it's peaceful, the episode breaks . . . Well, you get the point. ;P I especially loved the theme song, which, again, sets the mood for the series 
 
Character: 10/10 
There was not one character whom I detested/hated/was disgusted with at all. And even if I was, I got over it quickly. I'm not saying you have to like all the characters, though. What I'm trying to get at is that this anime's characters didn't undergo any moment where they weren't acting like themselves. Each and every character kept with their personalities straight through and didn't alter it because of what somebody said, like many anime characters tend to do. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Geez. If I didn't have so many anime on my planned to watch list, I would re-watch this over and over and over again. I enjoyed each and every episode thoroughly. I never laughed so hard at an anime like this either.  
 
Overall: 10/10 
Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou. Simply the best of its kind. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes anime with the ghostly aspect with splashes of humor thrown into it.

       Helpful We have one of the best if not THE best exponent of the golden era of hentai, the 90's. Character design is VARIED, not like we usually see in 2000+ anime; we have the common niche personalities and girls who look more of age than what modern anime fans nowadays are accustomed to see (loli bodies and loli-pitched voices, even when they're over 18). 
We also have the comedy factor, an element that has been long lost in hentai and when tried to implement in newer series they simply don't manage to fit the genre very well. 
All in all, animation isn't laid-back, music does its job, and characters have that aura one is attracted to, factor which was lost since 1999 approximately.  
A definite must-see.

       Helpful Ramen is universal.....apparently 
 
Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san has a very loose plot, that of Koizumi-san voiced by Ayana Taketatsu eating ramen and giving the flavors of that ramen in question with Yuu Oosawa voiced by Ayane Sakura along with her friends Jun Takahashi voiced by Yumi Hara and Misa Nakamura voiced by Akari Kito following Koizumi's trips of ramen. Plot-wise, the structure of most episodes follows the setup LA just talked about repeated twice or thrice depending on the episode. The plot doesn't have any overarching elements to it besides Yuu trying to constantly befriend Koizumi but we get to know the characters and especially the mysterious Koizumi in the process. 
 
On speaking of which, character-wise, the characters have some of the typical archetypes of the typical ""cute girls doing cute things"", from the tsundere Misa to the shy Jun to the genki Yuu and the eponymous Koizumi-san taking the ""deadpan serious"" archetype. Out of the ""main cast"", LA's favourite character would had to be Jun, mainly because most of her interactions to the cast and especially Koizumi was LA's favourite and gave out some fair few laughs, probably being the best audience surrogate in the anime. Yuu...well she's a bit difficult to say to say the least and we're talking about one of the more narratively focused characters in the anime (the other obviously being Koizumi).  Well time to get the elephant of the room and that's she's EXTREMELY clingy to Koizumi even defying common sense some times and to some extent LA can see Yuu's plight in just wanting to be friends with Koizumi but where it's difficult to like Yuu is her extremely stalkerish behavior she displays especially in the latter episodes and sure...bring in the yuri undertones...but tone it down is all LA is saying, even with that LA doesn't mind Yuu as a character as MANY detractors seems to find her as, there is at least some plot thread making the episodes flow together, no matter how annoying. Koizumi being the central character in all this, she does for the most part move the ""plot"" forward considering her ONLY interest is towards ramen and she's just a database of ramen trivia, some LA didn't even knew existed, but towards her interactions with other characters she's mostly deadpan and carefree and subtlety helps characters in need...before or after eating ramen of course but Yuu is the exception to all this.  Koizumi is the ""mysterious"" character and by the end of it, that's what ends up as, knowing VERY little of her besides her love for ramen, but LA thinks it's fine, we ""don't"" need as she's essentially the ""guide"" for ramen for the uninitiated. Keep the ""mystery"" alive ya'know? 
 
But to the detractors of this anime, LA DOES get that there is barely any substance in this anime besides ramen. It's ALL about the ramen and because of that it substitutes ramen with character development and that's very much at the expense of it's characters and by an extent, it's loose plot. BUT LA will give that the interactions towards the main cast is enough for this kind of anime to see some sense of characters ""wanting"" to come through as well as accentuating it's more comedic moments. 
 
But on the other hand, Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san did it's job in making LA crave for ramen whenever LA watched it, by showing amazingly detailed and beautifully made ramen, it's essentially felt like Shokugeki no Souma: RAMEN EDITION (but obviously without the Shokugeki's) by the level of detail of animation it had and yes quickly transitioning into that would be that the animation done by Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ did amazingly in the food porn, while the character designs were no slouch either giving us very distinct and instantly noticeable character designs while still having it's super chibi moments for one-shot comedic moments. Cute girls doing cute things was in Studio Gokumi's ball park so LA was expecting the animation to be moe and it's easily succeeded with the deliciously tasty looking ramen food porn to go with it. 
 
Voice acting was again expectedly moe and seems like Ayana Taketatsu moved on from dagashi to ramen eh?. The thing LA was really unexpected was Ayana Taketatsu's role as Koizumi being soo deadpan serious, LA was thinking she gonna be more of a Hotaru Shidare (thus the comparison) but LA kinda understood Ayana's and by extent Koizumi's deadpan cadence through this anime. Ayane Sakura was great to be honest, with her genkiness shown to a rather absorbent amount in this anime with her enthusiasm with ramen and Koizumi and fine LA will say she DOES get annoying BUT, praise is praise and Ayane Sakura nonetheless did decently as Yuu. LA found Akari Kito and Yumi Hara as Misa and Jun respectively to be great all round even if this isn't exactly their ""best"" LA saw from them but nonetheless but if LA had to pick an MVP in this anime then it'll be........a tie between Ayana and Yumi Hara. 
 
Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san has it's faults and it's strengths in being a ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime centred on ramen, but this is easily a case where the anime likes to focus more on ramen than it's characters or it's barely there plot, but if you like ramen be it the instant or the real Japanese deal then Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san will slurp your way into your psyche.  
 
For LA, LA will get LA's fill and be.......just satisfied with it, nothing more, nothing else. 
 
Thank you for the anime...

          
 
       Helpful It's hard with comedies nowadays. Be it their lack of original characters or overusing the same jokes over and over again, you can certainly find a lot of reasons to critisise them. And while that critisism takes it too far at certain times when people forget about what comedies are mainly supposed to be about, it is a required thing to do in goal of making non-moe comedies rise to the top again. Because outside of Gintama, they haven't been on the top for a while. 
 
Which brigns us to a very important question. Does Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san improve my opinion on the modern non-moe comedies? No, it doesn't. In fact, RDK most likely contains most of the flaws that have rissen recently on this historicaly popular genre. And even though that doesn't necesarilly mean that Koizumi-san is a bad anime, the fact that it's just another 'cheap' comedy without any ambition is the thing that hurts it the most. 
 
The anime is, as the name suggest, about a girl Koizumi-san, who really likes ramen. She likes it so much infact, that you really question yourself if she eats anything besides the traditional Japanese food. But that's not really the point. Koizumi is cold towards people, doesn't give a damn about things not related to her hobby (ramen eating) and I don't think I've ever seen her smile. She's also very beautiful, which is why the second main character of this show Yuu takes interest in her. 
 
Well, interest. It's more like obssesion honestly. Yuu falls in love right after seeing her and starts following her everywhere she goes. Stalking is on her daily basis. She does that in order to get closer to Koizumi. Who herself doesn't want that, because as she says, she enjoys ramen more when she's alone. And considering she's doing that 24/7, it gets a bit awkward. Which all sets up the comedy that is about to last for the whole show. Comedy that is suprisingly not bad at all at the start, as the show has some nice gags during interactions between Yuu and Koizumi and can build around those two quite well. As it happens however, it sadly isn't able to keep producing good and original jokes for the whole thing and so it gets less and less funny as it goes on. 
 
One of the things that were supposed to avoid that are some of the side characters. Especially Misa and Jun, that appear quite alot. While I don't thing their existence hurt the purpose of the show directly, they only add to one of the main problems of Koizumi-san. And that is the genericity of characters. We have an emotionless beauty, a lousy and high-pitched chick with twintails and a cheerfull but dumb second main lead to even out what Koizumi brings. All of these wouldn't be that big of a problem, it they weren't so over-used in all shows nowadays. Especially the loud twin-tail girl, I feel somebody like that appears in 90% of comedies lately. Like the whole show, the characters themselves are not necessarily bad. But they are just so one-way and forgettable that you don't really care about them in any way. 
 
In which we can get to be whole premise of the show, which is of course ramen. The way show approaches the whole ramen thing is a bit interesting, because it itself knows that 12 episodes about eating ramen can't really produce much in terms of quality content, so it atleast tries to give you something from the history of the food itself and inform you about it's different variations. Which there a tons. Honestly I didn't even know you could have so many flavors of ramen and there are some which just don't make any sence at all. But since the show said they're good, I ain't gonna doubt it. Because if anything, ramen is the one thing in which the creators know what they're doing. And even though I don't really feel enlighted about knowing a thing or two about ramen, as there is a pretty low chance I would even get to eat one any time soon, the fact that the show was able to inform me about something, and did that in a funny way through the nerdism of Koizumi-san, it gives you atleast something else besides the comedy. Oh, and the ramen made me really hungry at times, though I don't really know if I should count that as a positive or negative. 
 
The art is what you really could expect from not the highest funded show out there. It doesn't look bad, but little is actually animated. The character desings atleast were appealing to my eyes this time around. The sound is something more interesting I would say. And i'm not talking about the OST or the voice-acting, which are both very average. The interesting thing is, believe or not, when the characters eat the ramen. That happens a LOT in almost every episode and so if you are a fan of sound effects with somebody eating, I guess you're gonna have a good time with Koizumi-san. I personally didn't really care all that much. 
 
--------- 
 
Do you remember when I said this anime contains most of the flaws of todays comedies? Although I didn't really express myself earlier, the answer it pretty clear. They're easily forgettable, they don't have high production values and most importantly, they just don't have any real ambitions. Which is the biggest problem of Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san. It doesn't try to be different, it doesn't try to be more extreme. It feels like it's okay with being just average and forgotten after a little while. And no matter from which angle you look at it, that's just an approach calling for a failure. And anime forgotten in a month can be considered a failure.

En route to Mount Farlos, Rid is kidnapped by the bounty hunter Marone Blucarno, and the party is compelled to head to Belcarnu, an archipelago far from the major cities of Inferia. A series of adventures forces them to remain on the islands, where a more immediate threat to Inferia sleeps. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","
The game follows Reid Hershel as he tries to prevent the Grand Fall, a cataclysmic event that would destroy his planet along with that of newly found traveling companion Meredy. Specifically, the Grand Fall entails the violent collision of twin planets Inferia and Celestia. The two planets face one another while being separated by the Orbus Barrier. Interaction between the two planets has been infrequent over the last few centuries despite their proximity; the Bridge of Light linked Inferia and Celestia in the distant past, but the link has been severed for an extensive period of time. The Aurora War, an ancient conflict that set Inferia against Celestia over two thousand years ago, continues to generate persistent mistrust between the two groups. The Orbus Barrier has shown recent signs of weakening and possible collapse due to the actions of an unknown external force.
The journey takes Reid across both planets, as he seeks out those responsible for this movement towards the brink of annihilation.
","Tales of Eternia was originally a Playstation RPG which I didn't get to play until it got a PSP remake that actually got released in my location in 2006. I've talked about Tales anime adaptations before with Phantasia, Zestiria and the first Symphonia OVA. The anime adaptation is a bit of a different animal. It was released back in '01, shortly after the game's original launch. And it doesn't actually show any of the events from the game itself. Rather, it's a side story occurring shortly before our heroes travel to Celestia. Honestly, that's not a bad idea. It gives audiences something new that can, if done right, supplement their playing experience. So, how did Production IG & Xebec do?  
 
Story: 
 
While on their way to Mount Farlos so that they can take the bridge of light up to Celestia, our heroes find themselves waylaid. You see, a bounty hunter named Marone Bluecarno captures Reid and takes him to a small group of islands in order to help her bring down a sea monster. The rest of the party gives pursuit and the entire group ends up side-tracked for various adventures. But there's something not quite cricket going on that threatens our heroic quartet.  
 
The biggest issue with the series is just that a lot of their futzing about on the islands isn't really doing anything. Marone and Farah have a swimming race. The Black Wings show up and do their usual comedic nonsense. Meredy partners up with a girl from the islands to try and earn money through part time jobs, shenanigans ensue. And the vast majority of it is just filler until the last few episodes where the proper plot actually kicks into gear. The “romance” aspect is also an issue. A lot of the series revolves around the various attractive women on the island getting wet over Reid while he doesn't notice at all. Just in case you're one of a dozen people who really wanted to see what Eternia would look like if it had shit harem elements. There are also some contrivances where things are set up so that they look bad for our heroes, but then they catch a lucky break or get rescued at the last moment. These guys seriously have Milfeulle Sakuraba's own luck.  
 
With those criticisms out of the way, the story does have some decent moments. The Black Wings' appearance is pretty funny. The big narrative, once it gets going, has some good ideas behind it. And I do like the concept of having a side story with some new characters instead of a straight up adaptation. If it had been really well executed then you would actually have had a lot of tension around the new characters and their fates. As is, there's a bit but not much.  
 
Characters: 
 
I will give the series some credit here. The game characters are recognisable as themselves and there are some original characters who are kind of compelling. Corina has some moments. Although her connection to her “mother” doesn't make a lot of sense when you get into her back story. Marone has some strong points as well. If she wasn't interested in Reid, she would've been pretty damn awesome. I mean, she's a bounty hunter with martial arts and sword skills, she has a dragon and her back story is pretty definitively the best part of the series. Because she can do what she wants, she was voiced by Hayashibara Megumi. That being said, most of the side characters are kind of mediocre and the antagonist's redemptive qualities don't work particularly well.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork in this is pretty middling. It has some nice visuals at times but it's also bogged down by excessive fan-servicey nonsense and quite a few cost-cutting measures. Like focusing on a character who's attacking during an action sequence and not actually showing their attacks land or repeating frames.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is one area where I have to give the series nothing but praise. It has an exemplary cast. I already mentioned Hayashibara Megumi. We also have Ishida Akira, Horie Yui, Minaguchi Yuko, Minami Omi & Hoshi Soichiro. All of whom can act very well. Horie Yui even manages to convincingly act like she can't sing. Even though we all know she can. We've heard her do enough good theme tunes. The music is good too. Especially the song Marone sings in that one bit.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There are points, particularly later on, where Marone seems to like Farah as much as she does Reid, and vice versa. It's almost like they're trying to give us a Skies of Arcadia dynamic. There are also a few moments where Meredy & Corina come across as more than friends. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Tales of Eternia is a series where the premise was a surprisingly good idea. Give your audience a side story so they don't know what to expect based on having played the game and introduce some new characters so that they have somebody to feel tension for. Unfortunately, the series is bogged down by filler, trite harem shite, lazy artwork and excess fan-service. I won't say it's bad, since it does have some strengths as well, but it's pretty below average. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. If you're a major fan of the game, you might appreciate it just for some extra content with the characters. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother watching the whole thing. Watch Marone's musical bit because it's amazing and, maybe, the Black Wings episode since it's the funniest part. Next week I'll continue looking at game adaptations with Devil May Cry.  

          
 
       Helpful This is not a masterwork of anime by far, but it is a fair anime. The show is short, sweet and the most enjoyable part is seeing the game characters more alive. 
 
I am a huge fan of tales of eternia for Playstation and i only wished the game was longer once i beat it then i found out they made this anime. Tho the two are unrelated and this is more like a side story to the game, i still just liked seeing the characters so animated. The animations from the game were always to short so i never got a real feel for how the characters would really be. Its charming to see them come even more to life and see the little expressions they make. 
 
If your a fan of the game you may be satisfied like i was if your not you probably will not be as the plot is short, not very intense and is meant more for big fans of the game. Someone who has never played or heard of the game most likely would not enjoy it very much. Use your own discretion but i say fans should watch this if not just to see farahs jealousy and meredys adorable attitude.

          
 
       Helpful Most people would watch something titled &quot;Tales of&quot; because of the famous video game franchise by Namco. Others randomly come across unique titles such as these. While the video game Tales of Eternia for the Playstation was great, and sold wildly throughout Japan, the anime based off of it is most certainly not. 
 
The plot isn't even based off the game, but just has the group of four: Rid, Farah, Meredy, and Keel residing in a town. The story actually starts off while they're ON their journey, basically like a filler. It has nothing to do with the actual story of the game. 
 
Whatever &quot;fighting&quot; they have in this anime is really pathetic. You could give it some pity, but it's not interesting at all. They show the others as pathetic, and the main character, Rid as all powerful. How many times do they do that in anime? Instead of making Farah and the others an ounce strong, they made them look completely pathetic. The anime-only characters are stronger than them, which makes this even more pathetic. 
 
The Characters were probably the worst aspect of this anime. The characters themselves aren't that annoying, but the character development is. Farah is portrayed as an anxious, jealous girl, while Meredy and Keel aren't shown much at all. Rid is portrayed as his usual lazy self, but they threw in qualities that don't suit his character. Farah in the anime and Farah in the game and manga are so different, it's not even funny. 
 
In conclusion, as you look at the aspects of this anime, you can thoroughly observe that this was created solely for fanservice, as they did not even have a point in it. I don't reccomend this anime, especially if you're a fan of the Game/Manga.

On the captain's burial, they found the Blackburn Rock ship sinking with animals within. 
They set up camp at the shore of the beach but are soon forced to relocate and make a house on a treetop due to the presence of jackals/striped wolves. They have John the dog who was the pet of the captain, and they befriend a petit baby cuscus and they name it Mercer. They also rescue some chickens and donkey from the ship and goats living solitarily at the island. Dr Robinson and Franz spend most of the day exploring and doing carpentry work, while Anna prepares food and does farming. One time, they saw a ship coming and try to fire a rifle to signal it, but they fail to catch its attention. They spend their days mostly surviving and building boats/ships and doing household chores and for the children, studying. Once heavy rain and wind set, they set out to find a water-proof home, and they come across a cave. They found a skeleton in the cave with a diary near it, as they read they realise the man, whose name was Eric Bates, never made it off the island and died, presumably from malaria. They give him a proper burial. As Flone explores the cave and fetching water, she sees a silhouette of a boy running but the family assume that it is a wild animal although they, especially Flone have a hunch that there are other people living in the island. The next day, Flone finds a boy stealing melon from their garden. The boy, whose name is TomTom, an orphan Australian Aborigine who survives in the sunken boat. They find that he lives with an injured ship captain, Mr Morton. Anna is initially repelled by him due to his rude nature and after he tried to get Jack to smoke an improvised leave cigarette, but soon warms up to him after she read a letter founded by Ernest on the canoe requesting for possible ship to rescue the Robinson family and after realising he had good intentions at heart. Like Ana, Franz  as well does not like Mr. Morton. TomTom initially refuses to interact with the Robinson family as his family was subjected to slavery at the hands of Europeans but warms up to Flone and the rest of the family soon. One day, Tamtam with Mr. Morton went to the treehouse with the ostrich that they caught, Mr. Morton slapped the ostrich to run so that Robinsons siblings will be able to leave the house to catch the running ostrich. While Franz, Flone, Jack and Tamtam are chasing the ostrich. Mr. Morton climbed the tree and enter the treehouse and stole a rifle, magnifying lens and some of Robinson's family accessories. That night, He left Tamtam without a word sleeping on the cave. The next day, Tamtam went on the Robinson family to see if Mr. Morton was with them, The whole day, He spent each hour on the shore hoping Mr. Morton will return. That night, while Robinson family is sleeping, Tamtam left the Robinsons and return to cave and Ana notice that Tamtam gone that morning. Flone while looking for Tamtam entered to the cave and notice that the underground water was warm. While Tamtam was with Robinson's family, the animals on the island began to behave strange. That night, while the Robinson family is sleeping, an earthquake occur twice.  On his return at the island, Mr Morton asks the family to build another ship as soon as possible, to leave and find their way to Australia after they find out the island is actually a volcanic island which may erupt soon, further there were frequent earthquakes. After staying on the island for over a year, they finally leave to Australia on the boat they built with. The voyage takes much longer than expected but they finally make it, barely alive. They landed at the north of Sydney in winter and travelled by train to Melbourne. The family is greeted by Dr Elliot who provides them with a nice house to stay in, while TomTom stays with the Robinsons until Mr Morton finds another ship. They find out that Emily made it alive and was training to be a nurse, hence after a short reunion, she decides to leave for England to study medicine and become a nurse for three years. It happens to be the same ship Mr Morton and TomTom were sailing in. The Robinson family say their goodbyes and the anime ends.

Story: I loved the story. It was VERY useful in case you get stranded on an island. Real life tips are amazing and what I'm THE HAPPIEST with is the consistency of the story parts. I'm a huge WMT fan and this has just been a joy. Wonderful slice of life. I cried so much at some parts.  
 
Art- As a big fan of old style animes, the art is perfect to me. Simple but nicely done. 
 
Sound - I've lit. downloaded episodes to post sounds from it how wonderful it was. 
 
Character - Well, other than the mother being , well, overly whiny and motherly[ I do like her though] I loved all characters. They were very realistic.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']",none,"It is a light-hearted anime that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has plenty of relatively light fanservice. It is also quite silly, but that is what makes it interesting. The anime also has surprisingly nice art/character design... and at the same time occasionally displays significant dips in music quality. I would say the series are a bit underrated. Detailed breakdown below. 
 
Story: 5/10 
It is based of several japanese legends, but mostly those are an excuse to make heroine travel around, doing various silly things and often changing costumes. The story isn't exactly DUMB despite being silly, meaning I didn't get any facepalms while watching.  Occasionally story gets a bit predictable, and its quality drops in several filler-like episodes. 
 
Art: 7/10 
It is surprisingly good/solid. Very nice character designs on everybody, without rushed drawings anywhere. Most characters are visually very interesting, from girls/women which are cute (onihime specifically) to the large detailed onis. It is definitely not a super high budget designs, but it is surprisingly solid and above average quality. I think the only issue with art is odd design of momoko's primary costume, but everything else looks good. 
 
Sound: 4/10. 
The music is odd. There are a lot of interesting or average sounding tunes, but the anime frequently switches to some very weird electronic music that at times sounds almost like a chiptune. Those fragments feel completely out of place. 
 
Characters: 5/10. 
It is a light comedy, meaning characters are mostly plot devices and thier primary purpose is to be entertaining, so there isn't much to tell. THey aren't horribly written, and main characters are okay. There's nothing deep in character, but they're entertaining/amusing enough without being overly predictable. In short - archetypes, but no or at least not many horrible cliches. 
 
Enjoyement: 6/10. 
I liked it. It is a good anime to unwind while watching some characters doings something silly. It is not a super high quality comedy, and honestly the main reason to watch it is eye candy in term of character designs.  
 
Overall: 6/10: 
Worth checking out if you're okay with light fancervice or like/don't mind a bit of ecchi. However, this isn't really an strong ecchi title... to put it bluntly it doesn't ever show a nipple, and characters (surprisingly) don't have a habit of falling into some sort of risque/provocative pose every time. Still, there were several obviously fanservicey episodes.  
 
Bottom line: Light comedy with cute characters and some ecchi overtones. Worth a watch if you want to unwind, skip if fanservice offends you. 


          
 
       Helpful Momo Kyun Sword 
The story revolves around a naive Momoko and her 3 animal gods that took care of her and trained her since a little girl. 
 
Story 
It was a typical fan service anime, where this group of girls have to find some stones of power so the demons don't control the humanity, where there's little action and a lot of fan service. 
 
Art & Animation 
The art on this is very good being a fan service it has to be, for some reason their boobs shines, and the animation is really colorful. 
 
Sound 
It wasn't something great, it was fine and the ED for some reason was hypnotizing. 
 
Character 
They were fine, it wasn't anything remarkable but the fan service on them was. 
 
Enjoyment 
It was fine to see the fan service and the colorful art but more than that there wasn't anything. 
If you are here for the fan service then don't there are better anime series that has better fan service but this is fine.

          
 
       Helpful This is the best bad anime I've seen in a while. It isn't good. It doesn't really stand out. Due to Momo Kyun Sword's rather shallow exterior and interior, there isn't really a good way to write a long review about it without some filler. Therefore, I'm going to keep this review short. But I'm going to try to recommend that you watch it, despite the low score that I think it deserves.  
 
Here's the story: Follow Momoko, her boobs, and her 3 animal friends as they travel Japan, meeting more boobs and changing costumes along the way. Beware of predictable plot twists and cliches.  
 
The art is colorful, but isn't all that special. Everyone's shoulders and cleavage and various other body parts are blushing at almost all times, unless they are male and are therefore not sexual objects. But who cares about them, right? 
 
The music confuses me, it's usually generic and more annoying than not, but then sometimes I can almost dig it. I was left with a feeling of vague satisfaction coupled with deep disappointment in the sounds in this anime. 
 
Every character falls into some archetype and doesn't expand on it or do anything out of the ordinary. Onihime was my favorite. That's really all I can say here. 
 
Enjoyment: Well, I enjoyed this. I'll explain why, but that's where this review kind of gets long, so if you want to leave off here, just know that it's possible to revel in Momo Kyun Sword's lack of substance, but that doesn't at all make it a ""good"" anime. It is inherently bad, as (hopefully) evidenced by my brief description of everything about it above. I didn't really leave anything out, I think I've described the entire anime in this review.  
 
Anyway, here's where my ""short"" review ends, and my ""long"" analysis of why I enjoyed this anime despite its terrible-ness begins: 
 
This is a very simple-minded anime made with a very simple-minded audience in mind. It doesn't look down on its viewers at all - it puts itself exactly on their level and celebrates the mediocrity. I assume that if you're going so far as to read a review about Momo Kyun Sword, you aren't the type of person it was intended for. So, in order to enjoy this anime, you need to exert some effort. There is no meeting halfway here. You won't be rewarded for your trouble with anything that is at all redeemable by the end of this story. No, for someone that enjoys thinking critically about anime, the only surefire way to make this worth your while is to go all in and lower yourself to the very standards it expects of its audience.  
 
At least, that's what you have to do if you want to enjoy it and also rate it higher than a 3. I, however, enjoyed this anime without respecting it. It was risky though, I very easily could have hated it (still probably giving it a 3, but without the fond memories). All I had to do was start watching this anime, fully anticipating something underwhelming. I know that people say that you shouldn't watch this anime if you're wanting something deep, but I'm going to change this to ""only watch this anime if you're wanting something shallow."" It's not enough to know that this anime is bad, you have to WANT it to be bad. If you want this enough, you will be rewarded with exactly what you want, and therefore enjoy this anime! 
 
But really, everyone needs a mediocre anime or two under their belt. Not necessarily to accentuate the better anime, although that's not a bad reason. I just kind of like to take a breather, to stay grounded in reality. If I throw in some bad anime along with the exceptional anime, I won't get bored with my favorite medium always meeting my expectations. But that may just be me.

       Helpful Pita Ten is a slice of life comedy kind of show. I found the characters to be the most enjoyable part of the show. It comes off as being silly a lot of the time. However it also has some more serious elements as well. If you have read the manga (I highly hope that you will read it.) you will notice the show is much more light hearted and quite a bit different.  
 
I also enjoyed the Designs very much. if you like Digi Charat the artist who created those characters also made Pita Ten.

          
 
       Helpful I didn't very much care for this show but from an analytical standpoint this show has a lot going for it. Also, please read this before passing judgment on my score thank you. 
 
First off, the story is obviously geared toward a younger viewing audience. It's a simple premise of an angel in training coming down from heaven. Her main goal is to train to become a full grown angel, but of course, things don't go the straight and narrow. They'll get caught in all sorts of crazy high jinks and silly antics only a magical angel can make up. Obviously this isn't going to have a deep story line like Gunslinger Girl. But for an afternoon kids show this does serve up a decent amount of laughs.  
 
The art doesn't look anywhere near as beautiful as the manga art. But none the less it has a hint of Di Gi Carat inspired work. Complete with black beady eyes on chibi looking characters. And like in Di Gi Carat, the art is pretty forgettable it look slike everyone in the Pita Ten universe are either ten years old or thirty years old.  
 
Sound is very generic and below average. You'll manage to get all the typical comedy sound effects and songs, but thats all that you get. By episode 5 you've pretty much heard everything you are going to hear from this show.  
 
Also reminiscant of di gi carat, how insanely high the cute factor is in this show. Sure giving a description of short beady eyed characters might remind people of Golum from LotR. But this happens to be the direct opposite. Each character has their own unique cuteness on one way or another. But what takes the cake though is the characters seiyu cast. If you take the time to look at the japanese seiyu's anime history you'd be surprised. Who know that C.C., Shinku, Emma, and Mai Kawasumi would appear together in a show like this. If anything good came out of this show, it would have to be how the seiyu's managed to star in a lot of todays hits.  
 
As for myself, I didn't really care much about this show. All though I did watch this in it's entirety, I really wish i could get my 9 hours of my life back. Then why did I watch this show? For the most part I wanted to experience one of the early works of my favorite seiyus (the ones I mentioned before). Although I did like the voice acting, the characters themselves were really a disappointment. Overall, this was a show strictly for kids, if you want to watch a fun anime with a childish sense of humor watch this. Anyone else, avoid it with the only exception of observing your favorite seiyus early work.

0,5940,123,4.08626189938907,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Seiken no Blacksmith,"Once upon a time, there was a tragic war, in which the power of the devils was involved. After the war, the devils' power was banned and the world was restored to peace. Cecily Campbell is a knight, who has been looking for a blacksmith to repair her old sword given by her father. One day, she saw a man fighting with a ruffian who used the tabooed devil's power. The man defeated him with one blow of his weirdly shaped sword. The man turned out to be a blacksmith called Luke. The fateful encounter was the beginning of the adventure. 
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']","Forty-four years ago, a great war known as the Valbanill War ravaged the land. One of the war's most dangerous weapons was the Demon Contract, where humans sacrifice their bodies to become powerful demons. Realizing the damage the contracts have caused the land, the surviving nations made peace and banned the use of the Demon contracts.
Cecily Campbell is a 3rd generation Knight from Housman, one of the cities of the Independent Trade Cities, a democratic federation of cities. As her grandfather was one of the founders of the Independent Trade Cities, she is proud of her heritage and wishes to protect her city as a knight, like her father and grandfather before her. One day, she fights a mad veteran of the war causing trouble in the market, and, inexperienced and outmatched, faces defeat. But she is saved by a mysterious blacksmith named Luke Ainsworth. Cecily is impressed by Luke's katana, a weapon she has never seen before, and asks him to make one for her. Her involvement with Luke will bring her to an adventure she never expected.
","When you think of blacksmiths, you think of large, strong men who make swords, horseshoes and other appliances for a medieval world. What you normally don’t see is a kid doing all this with a smaller kid as an apprentice. That’s what happens when you watch this one.  
 
The characters seem not fleshed out enough, and we barely see a back story to any of them except Luke and even that happens a little to late in the game. By that time, the characters felt a bit stale, and hard to relate to. In a 12 episode show, they shouldn’t be dinking around like they do, mostly bringing up jokes about Cecily’s breasts and her strange breastplate that seems to be way to close to her to not of been molded on her breasts. And what’s with her mother even bugging her about it? Really? It’s not enough that the whole town talks about her breasts but her mother too? I’m not fond of how this show seems to move a bit too slow this show gets, but once it gets to the point, it is pretty good, and then it ends... Really, they spend more time talking then fighting and nothing really gets said. 
 
It seems that everything leans up to the climax but many of the things are lost in the first part. For instance, the only time I find out that that Luke has a fake eye is to the second to the last episode. If it was a big thing with the story then it should be said earlier in the story along with Luke’s story. I feel like I only got half the story through the show and I wish there was much more to help me see the lines. It just screams second season to and from what I know of, there isn’t one.  
 
The artwork is pretty nice though some of the characters look familiar to other shows. Little Luke reminds me of Sora from Kingdom Hearts and I can pick out little things hear and there that felt like rip offs. And don’t get me started on the creepy monsters that attack. It plays out mostly like a monster of the week style though the story makes it hard to watch them out of order. The comical parts in the art seem forced in whenever we have a serious point and trust me, that happen way to much for this show. I wish they chose a side, ether comical artwork with comical plot, or serious artwork with serious plot. 
 
The voice acting is pretty good but I am a little put off by one or two of them. Lisa isn’t that great a voice, making me sigh at the high pitched sound from her mouth. Some side characters really need deferent voices because sometime it makes them feel way too important then they should be. 

          
 
       Helpful This is a review of the DVD version of ""Sacred Blacksmith"" (Seiken no Blacksmith) released by Funimation in 2011. It was viewed with English voice overs. 
 
""Sacred Blacksmith"" falls into the category of fantasy action adventure with some minor elements of comedy. 
 
Parental Advisory: 
The age rating is listed as 17+.  However, this is absurdly high - the show's content does not merit this high of an age rating.   Two or three of the episodes include some very brief scenes with female topless nudity.  There is combat violence in several episodes, but it isn't overly graphic.   As a result, this show would likely be suitable for teens 13 and up. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The show is comprised of 12 episodes.  During the episodes, several characters are introduced including the main protagonist Cecily, the blacksmith Luke, his assistant Lisa, and a few others from the city.  Along the way, the world's history is revealed bit by bit.  Without giving away too many spoilers, there was a previous war involving a demon and the repercussions of that are still being felt.  Some of the main characters are directly related to the events of that war. 
 
Much of it is fairly typical for a fantasy story, but there were a few interesting elements introduced related to the blacksmith and how he is able to magically craft weapons with his assistant.  Some of the ultra-powerful demon swords can also take human form which is explored in a few episodes, but is never fully explained. 
 
Near the middle of the series, a new set of characters are introduced almost out of the blue.  At one moment they a supposed to enemies, and then suddenly they are allies, and the sudden shift doesn't make much sense.  A few episodes later, they are whisked away.  The few plot developments and pieces of information that are introduced by these characters could have easily been provided in other ways, and leaving these characters out of the series entirely would have led to a stronger series, and provided more time to focus on some of the other characters. 
 
The series ends on a cliffhanger, which seems to indicate that a 2nd series was planned.  However, I have found information about this, or when it might be released. 
 
Characters: 5/10 
Visually, many of characters in ""Sacred Blacksmith"" are more normal in size and appearance compared to those in other modern anime titles.  Most of the females are especially demure, and the males aren't overly muscular. 
 
The main character, Cecily Cambell is an overly inept knight.  She is a very weak character to serve as the main protagonist, and this is a drag throughout the entire show.  Through the series, some other characters make jokes the size of her bosom, but these fail to be humorous, partly because her breasts aren't really that big, at least not compared to characters in other modern anime.  Her breasts are shown briefly in a couple of episodes in an apparent attempt at humor, but the scenes barely register on the funniness meter, and could have been left out. 
 
Luke, the blacksmith, and his assistant, Lisa, are more intriguing characters.  Some of the key plot developments relate to these characters.  I would have liked to have seen them involved in more scenes instead of Cecily. 
 
The main antagonist seems overly cliché.  He's presented as a mysterious figure in a black cloak, before his real identity is uncovered.  However, it was really obvious from the beginning who it was for those paying attention.  The lack of originality of this character is a bit of let-down, as are his motives. 
 
Other characters are introduced such as guards and key members of the city government, but they don't get much screen time.  Rounding out the characters are a couple of living weapons one of which gets a fair bit of screen time, but not enough to fully explain their background. 
 
Art / Animation: 7/10 
The animation in ""Sacred Blacksmith"" was good overall, but not spectacular.  It seemed to use a lot of recycled art through the series.  For example, scenes of the city show an ominous, yet never-changing volcano apparently spewing a large ash cloud over the city.  This erupting volcano is never mentioned or explained.  I liked the blacksmith's magic weapon forging scene, but that too was essentially recycled a few times with few or no changes in later episodes. 
 
Some of the character designs are a bit basic but nice, and thankfully they were not as over-the-top as some characters found in other modern anime.  The outfits evoked a fantasy atmosphere, and their style had a simple elegance.  I found Aria's outfit to be quite lovely and rather fitting for her wind-nature. 
 
A few of the combat scenes were enjoyable to watch, and they seemed to capture elements of the action rather well. 
 
Sound / Voice: 7/10 
The soundtrack and background music used an orchestral piece which was quite good.  Other sound effects, such as during the combat scenes, were fine.  The English voice acting seemed ok. 
 
Enjoyment: 4/10 
While I enjoyed parts of this show, it really wasn't that enjoyable to watch it.  At times, it seemed like the story could be quite good, and it had the potential to set things up for a serious fantasy adventure, but then it would shift gears and try to inject comedic elements that didn't really work.  A big part of that problem is due to the main character Cecily - her ineptness more or less forces her to be used as comedy relief for many of her scenes.  It's like trying to inject a character from “Slayers” into “Record of Lodoss War” - the results are predictably bad. 
 
Final Verdict: 6/10  
I really wanted to like this show.  It had a cool fantasy setting with a very interesting backstory, some enjoyable combat scenes, and a few characters that were intriguing like the blacksmith.  However, the unimaginative villain, the sudden introduction of extra characters, and the focus on Cecily end up derailing this story, never allowing it to climb out of mediocrity. 


          
 
       Helpful Guard, Save, Belive. No, you didn't just misread that. These are in fact the words etched into the stone of Chester Cambell's grave; spelling errors and all. I guess he must've been a little dyslexic. After he passed away from a serious illness, his daughter and only child Cecily was left with the responsibility of becoming head of the Cambell House, which has long been a prestigious representative of the Independent Trade Cities of Housman. Having now succeeded her father, Cecily enlisted as a third generation knight to uphold the tradition and respect of the family name. However, she is inexperienced and clumsy, and often has to rely on intimidation using her title as a knight to hide her weaknesses. Eventually, this strategy ran out of luck, and when her combat skills finally had to be put to the test, Cecily was defeated and her family's precious sword shattered. Now she must seek out the blacksmith Luke Ainsworth to forge her a new sword, which consequently thrusts her into an unexpected chain of events that threatens her life and involves her in a dangerous plot. Between this and the fact that no one can take her seriously because of her huge breasts, it's needless to say that Cecily has plenty of stress on her hands. 
 
Yes, you'll find that there's no shortage of fanservice here. In fact, it's pretty much the running gag of the entire series that everyone pokes fun at Cecily's chest. This is further explored by convenient costume malfunctions and shameless bathing scenes. Thankfully all the pandering is at least tasteful enough that it never interrupts the flow of the story. The writing carries enough wit to know when sexual humor is appropriate. 
 
At a glance, much of Sacred Blacksmith's story is standard procedure for an average fantasy anime. It has all the elements one would expect; knights, magic, demon swords, and giant mythical creatures are abundant. It even comes complete with an angsty tsundere romance. Where the series falls short in originality though, it makes up for this in its near-flawless execution. All of the main characters are rich with distinct personalities and deep backstories that are revealed steadily as the plot unfolds. The story progression also strikes a perfect balance between comedy, drama, and action; constantly keeping the viewer engaged with these three elements while the pacing never stutters or moves too quickly. Even episodes that could potentially be considered filler don't really feel like it, as they serve up plenty of character development to excuse them. Although at its core the plot is fairly familiar and straightforward, Sacred Blacksmith is not without some of its own twists on the genre either. It mixes a strangely light-hearted tone to the story with very dark and mature medieval themes, and while demon swords may sound conventional for the setting, their ability to transform into rather unassuming humans with more nuanced intentions is quite unconventional. Though it may seem like this odd mixture wouldn't blend well at first, the series somehow manages to make it all mesh together nicely. 
 
It's worth noting that Sacred Blacksmith's narrative is heavily character-centric to such a degree that traditional fantasy tropes one would expect to see in its setting are often absent or take a back seat to character development. This may be off-putting for some coming into it expecting to see a Tolkien-esque expansive epic, which is unfortunate because the series does otherwise tell a very good story for what it is, but it often gets a bad wrap from critics who may be judging it based on something that it was never aiming to be. Sacred Blacksmith takes its time to flesh out its characters and doesn't invest much in the adventurous side of fantasy or exploring its world. Although it's clear that there is still a rich history behind it from the brief glimpses we are occasionally given, nonetheless this is not the story's focus. 
 
The series' character-driven plot does often work to its advantage though, because where Sacred Blacksmith truly shines is in its ability to masterfully craft a cast of characters whose interactions make them instantly likable and constantly engrossing; never leaving the audience with a dull moment. Cecily's unwavering dedication to helping others is interesting to see being put to the test as her inability to defend others frequently conflicts with her convictions. Aria's mysterious past as the demon sword of wind hides behind the veil of her lovable friendliness, making you eager to find out more about her history and motivations. Even the most seemingly loathsome characters can become hard not to sympathize with as more of their histories and backgrounds are uncovered. It is commonplace that conflicts arise between them purely because of of how sharply contrasting and vibrant their personalities are. Luke's cold and dismissive attitude perpetually clashes with Cecily's stubborn determination, which makes for some particularly entertaining dialogue. The script is often written rather heavy-handed, but it helps establish the strong characterizations of the protagonists. Still, Cecily's melodramatic monologues can occasionally overstay their welcome. 
 
The production values of Sacred Blacksmith's art and animation are nothing short of superb as well. Character designs are thoroughly detailed depicting even the subtleties of Luke's fake eye, and animation is consistently smooth and fluid. Couple this with its epic orchestral soundtrack and solid voice acting that fits the characters and effectively brings them to life, Sacred Blacksmith satisfies in nearly every aspect of its design. All of this is accompanied with quality intro and ending segments set to some J-pop tunes. The ending in particular has a rather catchy and cute arrangement, which is further enhanced by the associated artwork with it that really shows off the impressive designs of the characters. In fact, it's possibly my personal favorite ending piece just because it's so adorable and the music and visuals play off each other so well. The intro on the other hand has a decidedly more standard song choice that isn't quite as interesting, but it more than makes up for this with a good mixture of action scenes and beautiful perspective shots of the characters. Sufficed to say, this is one of those rare cases where I found myself watching both the intro and ending for every episode because they were simply that enjoyable. 
 
With everything right that Sacred Blacksmith has going for it however, it's difficult to take notice of any of its major flaws--until it ends. Just as soon as it feels like the journey is only beginning, it is abruptly cut off. This unfortunately is Sacred Blacksmith's greatest shortcoming. By the time the series come to its conclusion, many major plotlines and ambiguities in the story have yet to be fully fleshed out. It's clear judging by the finale that there was still much more of the story to tell, but for one reason or another there appears to be no sequel coming in the foreseeable future. As of the writing of this review, you will need to consort the manga that the series is based on if you wish to delve deeper into its story. Despite this, it's not enough to break Sacred Blacksmith's strong momentum from start to finish. Even with these problems, the anime still manages to deliver as satisfying a resolution as can be reasonably expected while leaving the plot open for continuation. With its colorful cast of characters, high production values, and engaging narrative that has its own twists on the genre, Sacred Blacksmith is sure to entertain many fans of fantasy anime.

Little Nemo - Adventures in Slumberland is the first Japanese anime to receive a national (wide) U.S. theatrical release. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","The film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel, Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed. Upon actually falling asleep later that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.
Nemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes ""the nightmare"". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, ""The Nightmare"" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.
Nemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him into the ocean. Genius discovers Nemo and tells him not to blame himself for all that has happened and that Flip is to blame, but Nemo accepting the situation pledges to find the King.  When the two return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon because he has a map of Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Oomps who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter but awakens in his bed instead. The Oomps appear in Nemo's room and the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently imprisoned in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter. Nemo soon uses the scepter to finally eliminate and defeat the Nightmare King but almost at the cost of Nemo's life. Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom. Camille escorts Nemo home on the dirigible. The two nearly share a kiss before Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window as he looks forward to his new day.
","Overview: 
 
Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children's movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn't re-watch this film until recently. 
 
Background: 
 
Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s, right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid's movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like  The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki's Nausicca, and America's Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy""  led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca. 
 
Plot: 5/10 
 
The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn't much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children's films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn't really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn't have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.  
 
Characters: 3/10 
 
The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan's favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn't dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that's...better? 
 
Sound: 5/10 
 
It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don't blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn't really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious.

          
 
       Helpful What an odd little movie. So bad, and yet such a colorful history.  
 
You may notice I generally gave some poor scores, but highly recommend this movie. Why? It's a perfect example of why communication is important. This movie has everything it needs to be amazing. It was worked on by some true animation giants. Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame, who invented many standards of animation that are used to this day. Ray Bradbury, writer of Fahrenheit 451. Music by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a ton of music I guarantee you know! Even Hayao Miyazaki, the man the myth the legend, worked on the film for a brief time. If you look closely you can see their influences. And there are some other big names linked to this project. 
 
So why do so many rights make a ginormous wrong?  
 
Lack of communication.  
 
Some are quoted as saying they asked the animators what they were working off of, ""we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing"" and when Bradbury was asked what he doing he said ""I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing"" 
 
Insert screaming melty man pop art. I highly recommend you watch this movie simply because it is such a piece of animation history with so many big names on it. You can see Chuck Jones' influence in the design of the squirrel Icarus. And some scenes, like them fancifully bouncing around the kingdom on balls while a song plays, are clearly worked on by Miyazaki. It's fun to watch and try to spot who animated what. 
 
This is definitely a film to watch when you're in the mood for a bad movie.

          
 
       Helpful ""Little Nemo"" is one of those movies where the backstory on it's creation is more famous (and probably more entertaining) than the movie itself. With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it's not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be. 
 
To start with the animation itself, it's actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It's smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...  
 
I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best. 
 
This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie. Cheers!

Nami immediately senses money and endeavors to convince the host to give her whatever information he had given him. The other Straw Hats join in and soon he is persuaded. He shows them to a backdoor, behind which they find a long and winding tunnel. That tunnel leads to a large underground chamber, where a number of pirate crews have a gathering. The island they are on, turns out to be the starting point of an irregularly occurring, anything-goes sailing competition. For a moment, the Straw Hats weigh whether it is wise to join in the race, considering that two giants and a crew of fish-men, who were once the rivals of Arlong's gang, were participating as well. But once they learn the height of the price money, not entering is out of the question. From the bookmaker they receive an eternal pose, to lead them to the goal of the race. Free food is available at the bottom of the chamber and Luffy makes extensive use of it. His eating habit of stealing other people's food quickly angers the bounty hunter Shuraiya Bascùd (シュライヤ・バスクード, Shuraiya Basukūdo), as well as a group of men led by Gasparde (ガスパーデ, Gasupāde). Gasparde is a deserted naval officer, with a bounty more than three times as high as Luffy's and said to be the race's favorite. A fight arises, and after Luffy and Shuraiya beat up his men.
They find themselves standing before the general himself. He is impressed with their skill and offers both of them to work under him. Of course they refuse, but Luffy finds some insulting words to do it and is caught off guard by Gasparde's right-hand man, Needles. Luffy's courage impresses Gasparde even more. He renews his offer, orders Needles to let go of the rookie pirate, and leaves the room. The next morning, a strong ocean current starts the race, by pushing the ships upstream over the island. As soon as they are over the top, the various crews start shooting broadsides, board each other's ships, and ram their competitors out of the water. But once the island is left behind, the field quickly clears up, leaving the Straw Hats time to eat. While inspecting the ship, Zoro discovers a boy named Anaguma (アナグマ), who had stowed away to earn money by killing some pirate to buy medicine for his adoptive grandfather, who works as an engineer on Gasparde's partially steam powered ship. The race continues. After fighting yet another rival crew and an encounter with a group of large sea kings, they arrive at the island the eternal pose is pointing to. The eternal poses were all mislabeled and led the fleet of unsuspecting pirates into reach of the cannons of the navy stronghold Navarone. Luffy has no doubt to whose fault it is. They turn around and using Chopper's fine nose, attempt to catch up with Gasparde's ship. Shuraiya, who had followed Gasparde's invitation to come along on his ship, turns against him to take revenge for Gasparde's killing his parents and sister. He fights Needles and throws him over board, but stands no chance against Gasparde's Logia-type powers, which allow him to turn parts or all of his body into liquid or solid candy. The general is about to kill the bounty hunter, when the Straw Hats arrive and catch his attention. Luffy confronts him and the two engage in a fierce but one-sided battle. Any attack Luffy throws at his opponent causes his limbs to get stuck in Gasparde's body. Only after Sanji gives two sacks of flour to Luffy, can he overcome the villain's ability. Anaguma turns out to be a girl and Shuraiya's thought-dead sister, Adele Bascùd (アデル・バスクード, Aderu Basukūdo).

","After reviewing the shitty film OP movie 3 was, I feel the need to write another one about the 4th movie: Dead End race. 
If you have seen the 4th one, you would have probably seen the 3rd movie too, and I hope so, because I will be comparing this masterpiece to that failure of a film. 
 
 
This film differs from the other since the very beginning, as the strawhats find themselves involved in a pirate ship's race in order to get some money. This is a nice basis for a OP movie, because as we all know, they alway run out of money due to Luffy's monstrous hunger. We rarely see the mujiwaras looking for a treasure in the manga, but they always need to get some money. 
 
First of all, I would like to exalt the island where the movie takes place: Anabaru. This island gave me that pirate vibe im not used to see in OP. The different pirate crews that were in the casino impressed me: Great designs, great ideas and lots of different characters, from giants to gyojins, showing the large amount of different people that coexist in the huge OP world.  
Every scene in the first 30 minutes was fucking great. The strawhats having fun together in a tavern (we dont see this type of scene since episode 200 or something like that), the fight in the casino or even the flying shot which showed us the passages of the city. Pure greatness. 
 
As I always say, the best thing about OP is that everything can happen, and Toei know this better than me. The start of the race was impressive and the island design was so good I could have believed this was a canon movie if somebody told me. 
 
The film path was pretty good (when I realized it, I had already seen half of the movie) and the way the different character are connected was unexpected, as opposed to the other 3 movies. One Piece is an adventure and this film too.  
 
 
In the last movie, Chopper was supposed to be the MC, but he was pushed back to a second place for almost half of the movie. In Dead Race Bouken, every character has its moment to shine. Zoro and Sanji dont need a 1v1 fight to have importance the film, Robin, Usopp and Chopper werent useless as they are in a lot of OP arcs (specially the latest two) and the scene were Nami yells at Adelle because she lost her will to live is just amazing. Toei captured the essence of the mujiwaras perfectly in this movie. 
 
The non-canon characters were good. So good I just want some of them to be canon.  
This time, the villain is Gasparde, a 95 million berri pirate who left the marine looking for power. This guy isnt the best villain of the show, but he is intimidating as fuck. That bounty was not a joke in this part of the show (remember this movie takes place exactly after the Arabasta arc) and his subordinate was also strong. 
 
The other character I want to talk about is Shuraiya Bascud. This guy emit CHARISMA. He is a bounty-hunter who arrives to Anubara seeking for revenge. A pretty simple story but a great character design and development (I wish he was canon lmao). He was the one who dealt with the first mate of Gasparde, taking the spot Zoro and Sanji always get. That fight was thrillering, smooth and in conclussion, amazing. I wish they animated it entirely. 
 
As opposed to the 3rd movie, the art style and animation are great and the characters arent bright anymore. The final battle was pretty good and the effects surprised me in a good way.  
And talking about the music, here is where I have the only complainment about this movie: Please Toei, use some new themes. OP has a great OST but it can be boring if you overuse it, and Toei certainly did with 800+ episodes of this show. 
 
 
Finally, I would like to applaud the ending of this movie. Those last 5-10 minutes in the ship made me change my rating from a 9 to a 10, and the last scene where the people in the town recognize Luffy due to the arrival of the new bounty is amazing. 
 
In conclussion, Toei have proven that they know how to make a good OP movie so I will be disappointed at them if the following films are trash. If you made it this far, Ty for reading!

          
 
       Helpful This is the fourth One Piece movie, theoretically taking place after the Navarone arc and before they go to Water 7. Just like all movies, it is a filler mission with a good budget and a simplistic plot. But unlike the previous ones, this is quite darker and more violent. It also has some nasty backstabbing going on, as well as interesting cameos from all over the main series to further give you a feeling of familiarity. 
 
The story is just about the Strawhat Pirates taking part in a race of pirate crews. The first to reach the goal at an unknown island will receive a huge amount of money. Although the premise seems simple and unimpressive, along the way it becomes a lot more complicating thanks to some cool plot twists. Amongst the strongest competitors is Gasparte, an ex marine with a huge bounty who has a bounty hunter after him, because he killed his family many years ago. These two turn the tables to the point the race becomes a death trap and you literally feel like people are actually dying in here. And this is what I liked about the whole thing; the premise ends up being smokescreen for far more sinister plans. 
 
This is where I will tribute some words for the main villain. Gasparte doesn’t really care about winning, as much as being the last man standing. He is extremely powerful and doesn’t seek more power like all the previous bosses did but rather to take out the competition in any means necessary. He is also modelled after Crocodile from the main series in a way, since their looks, powers and even their bounties are almost the same. It must also be noted that originally the movie was only supposed to be dedicated to the latest addition to the crew, Robin (and her voice actress). But guess what, she only ends up being a minor character in the whole film and all the focus is given to the new characters of the film. Something of which I found to be very cool. 
 
Then we have the bounty hunter. Far stronger and macho than the typical useless brat that asks for help and is even fleshed out nicely with the drama in his past and his quest for vengeance. If there is a part I didn’t like much is when he ends up finding another brat … which hasn’t aged at all despite all the years he knew it. Some sort of plot hole I guess. But hey, that kid can fight, and has killed people, and he feels proud about it. Good sidekick. 
 
A thing I liked was the action scenes. You didn’t feel like it was the good guys versus everybody else, since many crews were fighting each other. Plus, the mini-boss of the movie is surprisingly not even dealt by one of the Strawhats. Furthermore the final battle had some strategy in it instead of being Luffy with his unstoppable power just owning everything without thinking. Although the method he used was similar to the one he had for Crocodile, it’s the feeling of tactics that matters; something quite rare in the anime. 
 
Another thing is how there was nothing here for Oda to take ideas from and add it to the canon story later on. In the contrary, this movie was a big tribute to all the major events that have happened so far to the point it felt like the movie was part of the main series. 
 
Oh, they also used some quite impressive 3D effects here, like the introduction scene where the camera zooms through the alleys, as well as creating waves during a storm. Although rather crude after all these years, they were great to give motion and life to the setting of the movie. There is also a lot of darkness in this; a huge contrast to the cheery ones of the previous movies. Helps to build up the necessary tension for such a dark tale. 
 
Although it is mostly a cameo parade as well as a slight alteration of the Arabasta arc, it is one hell of a ride and a movie I openly recommend to the fans of the series. 
 
And now for some excused scorings.

       Helpful Well this is the 4th One Piece move that was made and IMO it is still the best. 
 
story: The story follows the straw hats pirates while they are on a Island and in need of money, they soon find out that there is a great pirate race. That alone should be good enough to catch anyones interest. The whole movie is amazing and the enemy is one you can hate. 
 
Art: The only reason that I didnt give this a 10 is because One Piece is art style is a little differnt to other animes but it is true to itself and is even better. 
 
Characters: Great characters, if you follow the series I dont need to say anymore, if you dont then all I have to say is you will never see better characters than this group. 
 
Enjoyment: I love this movie, it is the best out there and I have seen it many times and each time it still makes me smile. 
 
Overall: Best anime movie I have ever seen.

But even though all those things sound wonderful, I tended to get bored easily when watching this series. The repetition was almost unbearable about 8 episodes in. 
 
~Art 7/10~ 
The art was fairly well balanced between the comedy and seriousness, however, the style changes were nearly every 2 seconds, making the show seem a little less wonderful. I didn't know 5th graders could make themselves look like serious adults in just seconds, and suddenly look like two foot tall characters when they are flying across the room from even more violence. 
 
The continuous style changes just drove me nuts, which is probably why I didn't enjoy the series very much. 
 
~Sounds 5/10~ 
Nothing extravagent about the music nor the dialogue. 
 
~Enjoyment 6/10~ 
The series wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. The continuous art style changes drove me nuts, the violence of 5th graders didn't really attract my attention and I truly didn't know 5th graders were almost perverted to the point they should be in jail.

       Helpful If you have not seen the OVA I would recommend not watching the OVA until finishing the TV series. That way you will not feel let down. It was like Tenchi, I first saw Tenchi in Tokyo and enjoyed it, then I saw the OVA and was blown away.  
 
For what it's worth I rather liked the TV version. The OVA had the ecchi and more perverted stuff apparently, but I don't think they're really missing that much from this one. Maybe the TV censorship is just getting around to everyone. I'm not the least bit surprised. I won't only blame Xebec for that. They're censoring anime nowadays too.  
 
The animation, I didn't mind one bit actually. Maybe I'm getting too used to the blobby-animation techniques by a lot of Gainax anime and something like Death Metal City that doesn't worry too much about sticking to a static look. But honestly, I really liked what I saw for the most part. A lot of cute 5th grader antics and some Minami-ke-esque realistic-faces parts always turned out pretty funny for me. 
 
The characters are cute and their interactions fun in a childish way. The animation when they get serious and they are drawn as teenagers adds an interesting element. The loli echii undertones throughout the whole thing make me wonder what exactly the creator is trying to say or who the audience is intended to be. 
 
Not sure what to say honestly about this anime. It's fun but silly. It has child like situations but throws in adult like interactions. It seems to have some romantic element in it but then at the same time it down plays the romance and up plays the echii innuendos. Not much of a story, just a good-ole-fasion slice of life told through the eyes of seven fifth graders.  
 
After what I thought was a really rough start, the series finished up nicely after they found their pace and speed. I also liked the opening and ending themes which were sung by the entire cast and quite catchy.

       Helpful My second Review! If you want my shtick about how I'm veeery biased and just live and let me live, go to my first, cuz I'm not repeating myself! Also, for those of you who've noticed, I don't really plan on doing a review, I just sum up the series in a manner as spoiler free as possible to allow people to actively decide whether or not they'll like it or not, because honestly those are the best types of reviews! 
 
This anime is essentially Azumanga Daioh during elementary school, if mixed with some males and a little bit more peanuts (the comic) thrown in (The male lead, swear to god, is some weird combination of Sunohara from Clannad mixed with Charlie Brown). All of this is done to a beautiful art style and character designs very remniscent of Strawberry Marshmallow (I.E. Everyone is REALLY well drawn and characters do actually change clothing and occasionally hairstyles as time flows). 
 
That's it really! Hope this helps!

0,861,127,4.024664678108262,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",xxxHOLiC,"Kimihiro Watanuki can see spirits and other assorted supernatural creatures, which is quite a bothersome ability he strongly dislikes. On the way home one day, while plagued by some spirits, he is inexplicably compelled to enter a strange house. There, he encounters Yuuko, a mysterious woman who claims to be able to rid him of the ability to see and attract the troublesome creatures—for a price. She demands that he work at her ""store"" that grants wishes to people, and thus begins Watanuki's adventures through weird and wonderful events. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']","Kimihiro Watanuki is a high school student plagued by ayakashi spirits which are invisible to everyone else but him. The series begins when Watanuki stumbles, seemingly by chance, into a shop that grants wishes. The shop is owned by Yūko Ichihara, a mysterious witch of many names and esoteric renown. For a price, she offers to grant Watanuki's wish to be rid of the spirits. The price, according to Yūko, must be of equal value; so, as payment, he must become Yūko's temporary, part-time cook and housekeeper. While his established job consists of household chores, Yūko increasingly sends him on errands of a supernatural or spiritual nature as the series develops. Himawari Kunogi, Watanuki's love interest, and Shizuka Dōmeki, a classmate whom Watanuki initially detests, occasionally join him in his work as per Yūko's request. The three become increasingly close, and though Watanuki is often annoyed with Dōmeki, he grows to value the new friendships he makes and his life at the wish shop. At the same time, though, he begins to worry about Yūko, wondering if she who grants wishes to others ever has anything to wish for herself. Eventually, he makes a promise to try and grant her a wish, should she have one.
With each supernatural encounter, Watanuki becomes more familiar with and connected to the spiritual world. A crossing plotline with the concurrent series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle reveals that Yūko is actually on the verge of death, and she is only alive now because her personal time was accidentally frozen long ago by the powerful wizard Clow Reed. As the magic binding her in time begins to dissolve, Yūko's ability to maintain the shop's magical existence fades, and she eventually passes on, telling Watanuki that he will finally be free of his ability to see demons. However, Watanuki chooses to retain his ability to see spirits in order to maintain Yūko's shop and take over her role of shopkeeper. Further cross-over plotlines reveal that Watanuki was born as a result of a wish to turn back time by a shop client, Syaoran of Tsubasa. Since Syaoran was able to go back in time (at the cost of being removed from his timeline and becoming imprisoned by the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed), Watanuki was born to replace the void in timespace Syaoran left behind, and thus while they are different people, they share an ""existence"". As the series reaches its conclusion, Syaoran and Watanuki become trapped in a void by Fei-Wang and must pay a price to become free and continue existing. While Syaoran decides to keep traveling through dimensions, never stopping in a single place, Watanuki chooses to stay inside the shop and act as its owner, granting wishes until the day he sees Yūko again. As time progresses, Watanuki continues working in the shop without aging. Dōmeki, his assistant, frequently visits him, and the tradition continues with Dōmeki's descendants. After 100 years pass, Watanuki has a dream of Yūko, who tells him that he has finally become powerful enough to leave the shop. Despite this, he decides to continue waiting inside the shop for the day that they meet again.
xxxHolic was conceived when the group Clamp wanted to link the supernatural and fantasy series they made with a realistic one. This idea was further worked with the creation of the character of Yūko Ichihara who would bridge the stories from xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. Clamp proposed the idea of writing xxxHolic to Young Magazine after Chobits. In the end they decided to publish both xxxHolic and Tsubasa in weekly magazines to make serialization easier. The manga's title was originally going to be ""addicted"" but it was changed for the less ambiguous ""holic."" Like Clamp's previous work Tokyo Babylon, xxxHolic focuses on social pathologies but with a more esoteric tone.
The ""xxx"" before the holic is the Japanese way of saying of ""fill in the blank."" Therefore, the title itself gives a hint about what the series are about. It is talking about the people with the problems such as an alcoholic, or a workaholic. Being a fantastical series, these ""---holics "" can have very different pathologies.
The art style of the manga draws on the influence of ukiyo-e wood prints. When making a chapter composed of about twenty pages, Clamp takes around two days to make the artwork, the time differing with the ones from other series they made. The script of the series made by Nanase Ohkawa, who the other Clamp members ask her about any confusion they have before starting drawing the chapters. The illustrations and character designs are mainly done by Tsubaki Nekoi with assistance from Mokona, although Satsuki Igarashi also draws various parts. For the series, they decided to use Japanese and Chinese themes, but avoided using tones. Mokona is mainly in charge of designing the female characters, while Nekoi draws the male ones and all the spirits featured. The artwork is also inspired by Alphonse Mucha who Mokona is a fan of. This leads to all the tankobon covers being gold or silver and then color printed over it. The series was retitled xxxHolic Rō ever since volume 16 because of how Watanuki replaced Yuko as the shop's owner.When first presenting the idea of running xxxHolic linked with Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, although Ohkawa expressed concerns for the strain the weekly pace of such a series would place on the artists, she whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The reasons for linking these two series was because Clamp wanted to have two protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and design, yet during the ending they would be stated to be same person, and had to go on different paths. Because Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was more focused on action scenes, Clamp sometimes took breaks from xxxHolic or create autoconclusive stories so that the storyline between the two series would always be linked. In April 2010, Clamp stated that the xxxHolic was taking longer than what they expected, causing delays to some of their other works. When the manga finished serialization, Clamp felt it was more the ending from xxxHolic Rō, pointing that xxxHolic had already ended. Regarding the series' finale, Clamp wanted to express that while Watanuki's decision to stay in the shop may seem sad for readers, for Watanuki it was his happiness. Clamp was satisfied with people's reaction to the last chapter, as when discussing Watanuki's fate, they were also thinking what is happiness for them.
","(Spoiler Free) 
A misleading title is one of my only qualms with this series. Far from being some sort of ecchi comedy, xxxHolic was one of the most thought provoking, moving, and beautiful animes I've had the pleasure of viewing. 
 
The roots of the show are set deep in the grounds of Japanese folklore. Fans of the animated movie Spirited Away or of animes like Natsume Yuujinchou are sure to love the world of spirits and mysteries crafted in xxxHolic.  
 
The story is mostly episodic with numerous different stories taking palce over 1 or 2 episodes each. While I usually prefer serial animes with longer arcs, xxxHolic succeeds in connecting many of its episodes together. Instead of 20+ independant, stand-alone stories, we instead get what are more like snapshots of the characters life. Each 'picture' is different, yet all are connected and make up a larger story. Not only is this an excellent way to present a series, but each of the 20+ stories are masterpieces in and of themselves. Story earns a 9/10 
 
The art in xxxHolic is, in my experience, unique. I personally found the original style to be completely beautiful, but not all will agree. Many find the slightly off human proprtions to be odd, and some find fault with over the top character movements. However most can agree that many of the backrounds, stories, and characters in xxxHolic are simply breathtaking. Scenic landscapes, a lantern parade of 1000 spirits, and an ever mysterious fortune teller's shop are just a handful of the many original and gorgeous scenes crafted by the show's masterful artwork. A deserved 10/10 for art in my most humble opinion. 
 
Sound was also impressive. I, like most, don't often notice a soundtrack unless I'm listening for it. Yet the oftentimes powerful, and beautiful music of xxxHolic perfectly meshed with the art and story to create some truely moving moments. Character voicing was superb, from the exasperated voice of the protagonist to the lofty, confident tone of a fortune teller, the actors of the show did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. And lastly, a catchy opener, and two decent endings left me smiling. Sound earns a 9/10 
 
Many characters in xxxHolic are familiar arcetypes. Yet even though I'd seen every character's personality and mannerisms before, I hadn't always seen depth in those characters. Specifically the protagonist who, albeit slowly and more towards the end of the series, reveals himself as a person. Meanwhile a relationship forms seamlessly with his mysterious employer, a relationship that by the end of the series becomes a real, and believable bond between the two. Characters are by no means perfect however. A few cross the line from being 'familiar' to full blown cliche, and at times, the main character can be somewhat of a brat. Overall however the cast in xxxHolic carry the story well. An 8/10 for character. 
 
I loved the series from start to finish. The beautiful stories, the sporadic, but no less enjoyable humor, and the overall depth of the show were simply incredible, and a joy to watch. Enjoyment earns a solid 10/10 
 
Overall xxxHolic earns a 9/10 and my eager reccomendation. Beautiful art and stories that range from scary, to hilarious, to proverbial combined with solid characters and sound make this an anime well worth looking into.

          
 
       Helpful On the technical side of things, I have many bones to pick with the art and animation here. Actually there are too many bones to pick out on these spaghetti people, who I feel like I could easily snap across my thumb if I ever pat them on the back, even the supernaturally voluptuous Yuuko. Seriously, that woman should have SPINAL PROBLEMS with a rack of that magnitude on that beanpole, and throughout the entire series’ run, I never got used to the tiny-headed, long-bodied creatures they call people in this show, or the way they move either. Really fluid animation could have compensated for this bizarre art style, maybe even made it really cool, but the animation here is middling at best, and oftentimes slips into shaky and poor. It’s just unsettling.  
 
The music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it’s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY!  
 
The dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki’s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I’ve ever heard. I’m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki’s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it’s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there’s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I’ll get to slam some bad voice acting…but not yet. 
 
This series really isn’t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word “wasting” probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute “what the heck was that?” Let’s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another.  
 
Mixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can’t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, “The Monkey’s Paw,” are a few among them. Still, I’m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb.  
 
It’s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki’s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his “destined” servitude to Yuuko. It’s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP’s many other series, and if that’s a draw, you know you’re in trouble story-wise. 
 
So, while there’s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino’s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I’ve reviewed that I can’t honestly recommend. It’s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise. 
 
All in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it’s a hollow façade hiding a frequently boring show.

The evil secret society, ""White Snake"" abducted Shinnosuke and Prince Sunnokeshi of the Buri Buri Kingdom, who looks very much like Shinnosuke, in order to get the kingdom's hidden treasure in the golden palace underground. Shinnosuke's parents, Hiroshi and Misae fight with Lulu, the major of the palace guard of the kingdom, against White Snake, trying to recapture Shinnosuke and the prince.  
 
(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","Buriburi Oukoku no Hihou was a bit disappointing compared to the first movie.  
 
The jokes do not feel as tight and clever, and I would say that this second film suffers too much from what I would call ""TV-series gets made into feature film cliches"". I lost interest in the story pretty quickly, I kept looking at my watch, and the movie felt much longer than one and a half hours. The new supporting characters felt lackluster. 
 
It did still however have its moments here and there. The animation in the fighting scenes escpecially is pretty nice.  If you are a fan of Crayon Shin-chan it might still be worth checking out.

(Source: FUNimation)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Supernatural']",none,"Alright let me just say that of the majority of anime I watched this was probably my tenth biggest disappointment ever in anime history not because the idea sucked but because the implication of the idea was half-assed (no other way to describe it). The first season while good left a lot of holes and unanswered questions I was fine with that at first because I knew there was going to be a second season where I expected to at least have some of my questions answered but no instead I got a bunch of filler (dang it if I wanted filler I'd just watch bleach or naruto). The story did very little advancing and worst of all failed to answer any of the important questions. Luckily for us there's going to most likely be a third season (hopefully this time they don't just half-ass it and actually get to the point). If I don't read the manga to this and get an organized story I'll beat my head in with 2x4. Now that that's out of the way let's get to some quality looks at it. 
Story- As far the story that this anime is supposed to follow it's really good some people have underestimated it and called it just a beat em as they come storyline but in fact that's not entirely true villains are reoccurring and do not always die after the first encounter with them and the plots are pretty deep. The only problem with the story is that it's not organized at all (at least in the anime) things are choppy and thrown in and there are tremendous amounts of filler that take away from the story. *sigh* When will people learn to just stick to a dang storyline and not smear it with fecal matter until it becomes repulsive. 
Art- As far as art goes I was impressed this series is very well drawn the only critique I have is that sometimes the animation didn't flow right. 
Sound- Sounds are interesting to say the least not all of them are good but for the most part the sounds will match a situation. My favorite part is that the same person who voices Shana is the same person who voices Louise in Zero no Tsukaima (it made me smile every time she talked). 
Character- This anime did a decent job with character development I mean it's not like I needed to know about more than the main characters to begin with but hey who cares if you want to spend an entire episode focused on a character nobody cares about far be it from me to kick you down for it. 
Enjoyment- I was disappointed to say the least I expected great things from this anime when I first started watching it but as it progressively went on it became like that new shirt you thought planned on wearing until it was stained with ketchup (i.e-filler). I enjoyed battles in this as most were pretty interesting and I even enjoyed the romance aspect of it which is strange because at first I found the romance to be kind of annoying. So my advice is if you watched the first season just go ahead and watch the second season chances are if you like one you like the other.

          
 
       Helpful Generally, the sequel of a successful series, or any series for that matter, falls short of the fame attained by its predecessor. For the first half or so of the second season of Shakugan no Shana, I must say that I was slightly disappointed with the content. However, by the end of it, I believe that season two has more or less achieved the same level of success as season one. With that being said, there were some differences - both good and bad - between the two seasons. As with all second seasons, I tend to raise my expectations and score them more critically.  
 
Art (7/10) 
Despite airing two years after season one, the animation quality has not improved as much as I expected. The backgrounds still had that less-than-real feel to them and the lack of detail in the characters disappointed me the second time around. Still, like in the first season, the battle scenes stood out from the rest of the mediocre animation. A phrase that describes this season's animation could be: season one's animation in 720p.  
 
Characters (8/10) 
Last season, Yūji was totally useless, save for a few situations. Those who hope for the supposed ""main protagonist"" to play more of a role in the second season do get what they want. The development that Yūji undergoes in this series is astounding. However, most of it happens in such a short amount of time that many wonder about the sudden change in personality. Honestly, this was the first time where I questioned the benefits of character development. As for the other characters, I felt that the slow first half was necessary in order to give them the development needed to make the second half successful. As far as I can tell, Shana, Kazumi, Keisaku, Wilhelmina and Margery were greatly developed over the course of this series - some to a greater extent than others. One point of criticism I would like to make is that the lack of new characters disappointed me. True, one may argue that this may cause some unnecessary confusion, but I believe that adding more characters adds a sense of ""freshness"" to the season, allowing it to distinguish itself further from its predecessor (i.e. preventing the ""this seems so familiar"" thought from surfacing in the audience's minds).  
 
Sound (7/10) 
Understandably, the BGM and seiyūs of the first season are the same for the second season. With that being said, the only parts left to judge in this category are the OPs and EDs. Starting off with the OPs, I felt the first OP, ""JOINT"", was much better in terms of preparing one for the episode to come when compared to the second OP, ""BLAZE."" Like ""Hishoku no Sora"" (season one's OP), ""JOINT"" is also sung by Kawada Mami and it delivers the same sense of intensity that I enjoyed. Unfortunately, KOTOKO's ""BLAZE"" wasn't up to par with its season one counterpart, ""being"", and left me missing ""JOINT."" Moving on to the EDs, both were decent, just like in season one. Overall, this season's sounds were generally on par with last season's.  
 
Story (8/10) 
Honestly, I wanted to drop the series during the first half because of how slow the story was moving. When I first started to watch Shakugan no Shana, I expected a good dose of action with a pinch of romance/slice-of-life to spice things up; not the other way around. If I had wanted a romance or slice-of-life story, then I would obviously go watch a romance or slice-of-life anime. However, I am glad that I decided to stick with it and continue my way through the show. As the story started to pick up in the second half, I was instantly reminded of why I liked season one. The cliffhangers and twists really entertained me and it was good to know that there's a season three as I finished the last episode. It's surprising how a story can be this long and still be interesting.  
 
Overall (8/10) 
Two seasons down, one more to go. A generally successful second season leaves me with both doubts and hopes for the third. If given the choice between the first or second season, I would have to choose the first, simply because it entertained me throughout. This is not to say that season two was not good; it was just not as good as season one. Those who watched season one and enjoyed it will probably feel the same way about season two. Now it's now off to the third and final season of Shakugan no Shana!

          
 
       Helpful For the second season of Shakugan no Shana, it was a lot more based on the romance and love triangles, where as the first season was a lot more based on action. The second season brought a lot more emotion and drama that actually had me crying my eyes out at one point for three episodes straight. If you have already watched the first season, you should already have a good idea what's happening in this anime so I won't spend my time explaining about the details. But overall, it was a 7/10. The only thing that bothered me this season was to how oblivious the main male protagonist was towards all the girls that shared feelings for him, otherwise, I think you should give it a chance :)

He has stopped believing in the supernatural long ago, but after being forced to join this club based solely on that, he has seen things that cannot be explained logically.  
 
Joining Kyon on his various misadventures is the shy and soft-spoken Mikuru Asahina, the bookish Yuki Nagato, and the ever-cheerful Itsuki Koizumi. Whether it is summer vacation or a school festival, things involving their club and Haruhi herself always end up becoming strange.

He is dragged along by his classmate, Haruhi Suzumiya, an eccentric schoolgirl who seeks supernatural phenomena and figures, such as aliens, time travelers, and espers.

I am enjoying the series so far though, even after the endless eight, I'm lookngi forward to seeing whta happens next :D

          
 
       Helpful The Endless Eight arc is the focus of this review. 
 
Suzumiya Haruhi's Endless Eight arc seems to get a lot of hate. Although, not fully unjustified, I still think there's something some people are missing about the Endless Eight arc. 
 
It's the uniqueness. Now, that isn't to say unique anime can't be executed poorly. And, that relates to my point, the Endless Eight arc is executed well. Just not executed well for people coming into it expecting normal story techniques. These techniques are completely devoid of boredom if done well enough, so it creates a feeling that boredom = bad. The Endless Eight arc is done well, AND boring for some. Doesn't mean you have to put up with the boredom, or, even think it's good at all. That just means it's not for you. 
 
That last paragraph was referring to people who found it boring. Now, onto my experience with it. A little bit of boredom, and a fun spot-the-difference game kind of like if you played Where's Waldo over, and over again. For me, the arc was about paying close attention, and searching for differences over the whole run. Yes, I watched all 8 episodes in one sitting. And it was really fun. 
 
The shift into realization of the loop was well executed, with a good early build-up. The romance talk was very nice, even though it happened every time, if I remember correctly. I haven't watched it in a year, so my knowledge may be a little off. 
 
Of course, the comedy's the same as usual. 
 
When I first watched the ending, it was heartwarming, and felt really rewarding after the 2 hours, and 40 minutes I spent on the repetitive Where's Waldo Anime Edition game. 
 
In conclusion, some people will like Endless Eight, some won't, and both aren't wrong, but I quite enjoyed it, and wanted to express my reasons for liking it. Also, I included the third paragraph for people who found it boring trash, trying to get them to understand why some people like it even if they agree it's boring. The fervent dislike isn't completely unjustified, but I disagree with it, basically.

          
 
       Helpful There is something to be said for the distasteful arc known as the relentless and unending ""Endless Eight"".  
However, what was forementioned has already been said, countless times by reviewers over and over again. The irony in this is that the people complaining about how ""Endless Eight is annoying and the worst thing ever"" are annoying others with their own endless rants on the prementioned topic. While I understand and coincide with their intentions, it does get annoying when others repeat the flaws that have been already pointed out get recycled in what I call a ""make-shift review"". 
Furthermore, the very same people who bash the unfortunate sequel continue watching it, and with each episode that passes, become further infuriated. They are simply fanning their own flames of anger. 
So, to those who are considering writing a review of this anime, please, abstain unless you believe you have new input that could benefit the myanimelist community. If you do not have anything new to add, simply support and campaign an already existing review, and your words and thoughts will spread.

0,415,131,4.024664678108262,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Tonari no Yamada-kun,"Join in the adventures of the quirky Yamada family—from the hilarious to the touching±brilliantly presented in a unique, visually striking comic strip style. Takashi Yamada and his wacky wife Matsuko, who has no talent for housework, navigate their way through the ups and downs of work, marriage and family life with a sharp-tongued grandmother who lives with them, a teenage son who wishes he had cooler parents, and a pesky daughter whose loud voice is unusual for someone so small. Even the family dog has issues! 
 
(Source: Disney)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","The film is a series of vignettes following the daily lives of the Yamada family: Takashi and Matsuko (the father and mother), Shige (Matsuko's mother), Noboru (aged approximately 13, the son), Nonoko (aged approximately 7, the daughter), and Pochi (the family dog).
Each of the vignettes is preceded by a title such as ""Father as Role Model"", ""A Family Torn Apart"" or ""Patriarchal Supremacy Restored"". These vignettes cover such issues as losing a child in a department store, the relationships between father and son, or husband and wife, the wisdom of age, meeting one's first girlfriend and many more. Each is presented with humour, presenting a very believable picture of family life which crosses cultural boundaries. The relationships between Matsuko, Takashi and Shige are particularly well observed, with Shige giving advice and proverbs to all the family members, and having a great strength of character. Takashi and Matsuko's relationship is often the focus of the episodes, their rivalries, such as arguing about who has control of the television, their frustrations and their difficulties, but the overriding theme is their love for one another despite their flaws, and their desire to be the best parents possible for their children.
","Despite being a fan of Studio Ghibli, this release somehow passed my by. Today, I'm adding it to my &quot;re-watch&quot; list, somewhere near the top. Whatever you may think anime is, throw it out the window, this is not a typical show.  
 
You watch the first few minutes thinking that it's the credits and you wait until you realise, this isn't the credits, it's the story! The unique style of animation throws you in for a loop, but it's not bad. Yes, it's simple, more like a moving comic strip than animation, but simple does not mean sloppy. Each line and curve of the drawings is thought out and perfectly placed and the motion smooth. You can't help but like the characters, the director perhaps explores their stereotypical side - the salary-man dad, slightly lazy stay at home wife, reluctant student son, cute as a button younger daughter and grandmother with a sharp tongue - but that's what makes it funny.  
 
The story is told in snippets, sometimes interrupted by metaphors or one of the character's recollection of an event past, all wrapped up neatly by humour: sometimes a great belly laugh and sometimes  a gentle smile. The movie leaves you feeling good and, somehow, cuddled. Perfect family viewing; I suspect that one appreciates this movie more as the time goes by.

	My Neighbor the Yamadas is a very interesting film, even by Studio Ghibli standards. While it’s one of the lesser known films by the studio, and takes place in a more “realistic” setting, it was still one of the most magical films I’ve seen in recent memory. 
 
	When people think of Studio Ghibli, a few familiar people and films come to mind: Spirited Away, Totoro and of course, Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki’s praise is well-earned - every film of his I’ve seen have become instant classics in my book (fitting to his Walt Disney comparisons, I hope my children have these movies on repeat the way I watched Toy Story and The Lion King multiple times a day as a kid). Though Miyazaki lies at the epicenter of Ghibli’s style and success, there are plenty more creative geniuses at the Studio – in particular I speak of director Isao Takahata. 
Co-founder of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki’s right-hand man, Takahata has found his own success directing a handful of Ghibli films. His most notable work as a director was his first film, Grave of the Fireflies, perhaps one of the most powerful and depressing rides I’ve been on. Following Grave of the Fireflies, Studio Ghibli bounced back and forth between Miyazaki directed films and Takahata directed films. After the critical success of Miyazaki’s Princess Mononoke in 1997, Takahata was back at the reigns with his next film, My Neighbor the Yamadas. 
 
	The transition from Mononoke to the Yamadas represents a key distinction in Miyazaki and Takahata’s styles. We move from a story of immense scale, to one the size of a small house. We leave behind vast and intricately drawn forests, and enter the 12 x 12 tatami floor space of a middle class family. Where Miyazaki shines in telling fantastical tales and creating stunningly imaginative set pieces, Takahata finds his niche in exploring the mundane existence of humanity. 
 
	And that is exactly what My Neighbor the Yamadas is. 
 
	There isn’t really an overarching story here. My Neighbor the Yamadas is a slice of life in the purest sense of the term. We follow the lives of, you guessed it, the Yamadas, consisting of Takashi (dad), Matsuko (mom), Noboru (older brother), Nonoko (younger sister), and Shige (grandma). This is no chronological narrative of their lives either. The movie entails short 5 to 10 minute scenes, highlighting everything from the classic ‘leave your daughter at the mall’ scenario, to father and son playing catch (as well as growing past such a silly game). Though it isn’t the first time an anime attempted to capture ordinary family life, My Neighbor the Yamadas is impeccably accurate and well-executed. I’ve rarely had nostalgia sensors go off as often as I did watching this movie. Though every scenario doesn’t strike a chord, there are enough representations of daily obstacles that I’d find it hard for someone to find no connection to anything the Yamadas go through. 
 
	Miyazaki is known for teaching lessons of reality through fantasy, and the culmination of his magical stories tend to reveal a hidden truth about the world, tucked behind his surreal imagery. My Neighbor the Yamadas does the exact opposite, showing its hand from the get-go. 
 
	We begin by introducing the family. But rather than beginning in reality and moving into the bizarre, we open with the bizarre - a metaphorical representation of the Yamadas, their journey through life, and in a sense, the journey of everyone. Rather than build toward some lesson or realization, the film’s intentions are made clear immediately. A monologue at the film’s start perfectly encapsulates and prefaces the rest of the movie, as well as what it expects you to take away from it. Since it’s at the beginning, I don’t really think it’s a spoiler, and I found it too important not to include, so here it is: 
 
“Life, as they say, has its ups and downs. At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells. But take heart. It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own. But even a couple of losers can survive most things if they're together. So listen, take some advice and have children as soon as you can. Children are the best reasons for riding out life's storms. Nowadays, people say child-rearing is challenging and difficult, but we've done it from time immemorial. Children grow even without parents. So hold them close to your heart as they crawl, then walk. They'll be fine.” 
 
	That right there is what this film intends to sell you on. The idea that life is hard, but we persevere through the strongest bond we have – our family. It’s a rather simple idea at play, but with each scene we’re reminded of the small hurdles we face every day, and the importance of family in times of struggle both big and small. Oh, also, the context of the monologue in the story is very clever, but I won’t tell you about it here  
 
	Though it remains one of the least fantasy-oriented films in Ghibli’s collection, the art style used is one of the most abstract. The transition between Mononoke and the Yamadas is also very significant on the production end of things. Following the meticulously hand-drawn process of Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor the Yamadas became the first ever Ghibli film to be created 100 percent through digital means.  
 
	Besides the new digital process, the art style itself is a big departure from the instantly recognizable style developed by Miyazaki over the years. It takes a turn for minimalism rather than hyper-detail. Characters and backgrounds retain a muted water-color aesthetic, complementing the light, simplicity of the narrative, as well as conveying a sense of hazy remembrance, as if we were taking a trip down memory lane with the Yamadas. Though not as immediately beautiful as the lush and vibrantly colors of previous Ghibli works, the basic art style used for the Yamadas is very fitting. 
 
	The rather loose style carried throughout the film also allows for some exploration. A specific scene comes to mind in which Takashi has to deal with a loud biker gang parked outside his house. I won’t go into detail, but the sudden switch in style during that part was exceptionally cool. 
 
	Mind you, this is not the most memorable Studio Ghibli movie. Especially when we have scenes like Chihiro entering the bathhouse in Spirited Away, riding the Catbus in My Neighbor Totoro, or Kiki flying along the countryside in Kiki’s Delivery Service. These scenes are a spectacle for the eyes, and perfect examples of the incredible talent at works behind the industry’s most magical studio. No, My Neighbor the Yamadas isn’t like that. The magic found in this film is of a different variety.  
 
	For Miyazaki, anime’s potential to explore the depths of our imagination is the fuel that drives his creative ventures. Bridging the gap between reality and fantasy is what makes Miyazaki’s films so enchanting, while also being so relatable. But for Takahata to take a medium like anime and restrict it to the bounds of ordinary life – there’s magic in that too.  
To suddenly throw us into the lives of the Yamadas and create bonds with them is no easy feat, but humanity’s struggle is a familiar one across all places and within all people. There are low points and there are high points. Sometimes it feels like the burden of the world rests upon your shoulders, and sometimes you’re as light as air, losing track of the days as they drift by. One day you’re on top of the world, and the next it might seem like there’s no hope, but humanity has proven that we can keep going, generation after generation, struggle after struggle.  
 
My Neighbor the Yamadas is just a little snippet of the struggles we face every day – some you’ve conquered effortlessly, some that have challenged every part of you, some that have broken you, and some that have built you up. Takahata shows us that the little details are as important as the big ones, and the most magical piece of humanity is its ability to move forward. As long as we persevere, we’ll be fine. 


          
 
       Helpful I hate the visual style but if you're a fan of greeting card illustrations, maybe you'll dig it. There's some traditional family value messages in there but not to the point where it's a big problem. Just a little boring and cheesy. 
 
I think this movie is for the more family-oriented crowd; those of you who like curling up with a big mug of tea and vibing with the very grounded but nostalgia-drenched fuzzy love memories of your own family.  
 
It's got a gentle sort of charm but, like, it's not overly charming. Not a bad film, but, in the end, just kind of... whatever.

My Daddy Long Legs or Watashi no Ashinaga Ojisan as it is know is a 1990 anime based of the 1912 novel of the same name by Jean Webster. This is a part of Nippon Animation’s World Masterpiece Theatre which was a bunch of novels which were turned into anime by Nippon Animation.  
 
 
Story 
 
This anime follows Judy Abbott, a child from the John Grier orphanage. She was abandoned in the slums of New York as a baby and was taken in by the orphanage. She is forced to stay there for all of her pre-teen life. Until one day, Judy is selected out of a possible four to go to the prestigious Lincoln Memorial High School in New Jersey by a mystery man. Judy never sees the face of this man however she does the shadows of this man. Due to his freakily long legs in the shadows, Judy affectionalty calls him “Daddy Long Legs”. She also has to write to him every month which is referred to in almost every episode. 
 
 
 It is at this school where we meet her friends, Sallie McBride and Julia Pendleton. There is also another roommate who comes in around episode 20 called Leonora Fenton, however she only lasts a couple of episodes as she is forced into Florida. This series lasts throughout the girl’s high school life, up until its graduation. I like how this is done as the older they get and the more they learn, the more mature they get. This is different from the novel as the novel is based in college. Throughout their time, relationships start to form and more characters start to form, Jervis Pendleton, Julia’s cousin who Julia does not like at the beginning however Judy falls in love with him since he is not your “typical rich person”, Jimmie McBride, Sallie’s brother who is a Quarterback at Princeton University who falls in love with Judy however Julia also develops feelings for him (even going as far to learn American Football), and Bob, Jimmie’s friend and captain of the football team who Sallie also develops some feelings for (however since they are both awkward, this does not really end anywhere). There are also some minor characters introduced who really do not do much in order to me to really talk about them. 
  
 
The last 15 episodes or so changes the story up a bit since Judy wishes to become more independent. This leads to her arguing with “Daddy Long Legs” and disobeying things by taking jobs despite Daddy telling her not to. She also is taken to a Farm against her wishes (this is most likely set up by Daddy Long Legs since some story plots take place here which may ruin the entire series if I tell them here). Despite this, Judy finally makes up with Daddy. Judy is asked to deliver a speech for the graduating students, Daddy even promises to show up, however he gets very sick and eventually, Judy has to go out and find him. It is here where finally, Daddy Long Legs is revealed.  
 
 
I rate this story an 8/10 
 
 
Characters: 
 
Judy: I actually like Judy quite a lot. I do find her to be quite a sympathetic  character. I do think she should have listened to her father a lot more during the last arc however I do understand her position based on her lifestyle and the fact that she has never allowed to experience true freedom before. I was cheering for her all throughout this series. She does grow up in maturity as well the teachers at the school (mostly the English one), her friends and especially Daddy Long Legs teach her about the world around her and how to act in situations. She was definitely the best character in the show as a show based around her should be. 
 
 
Sallie: She is the nice, kind and helpful friend to Judy. She has some quirks like her anxiety to public speaking however for me she was a little too bland. She really does not develop that much which is mostly due to the fact that there really is not many situations that you can develop her. Still, she is not a bad character by any means and won’t make you want to skip forward or anything. 
 
 
Julia:  She starts out as the snobby rich character who starts of as friends with Sallie however Judy doesn't like her. She does however get the 2nd most amount of development behind Judy (Around the time she meets Jimmie is where it really starts) and she does start to get friendlier with Judy. Furthermore, when you see her parents, it does become evident why Julia is not really happy with her life since her parents are absolute shitheads. I did really start to feel sorry for her at the end. 
 
 
Jervis: I did like him, however he really didn't offer much in terms of personality. He is the friendly, goofy guy in the series. I also find it a bit weird how he straight up falls in love with a minor even though he is about 30 however it does make more sense at the end of the series (It is a pretty massive spoiler). Still a pretty good character though as you do really feel his love for Judy 
 
 
Jimmie: Again likeable, however not given to much development other than his relationships with Judy and Julia. Does seem to be a nice guy, even though he blatantly ignores Julia’s feelings for him because of his feelings with Judy. 
 
 
The other characters are really not given enough screen time or development for me to really comment on them too much. 
 
 
I rate these characters a 7.5/10 
 
Art 
 
I love the art. Not because of the actual art style or quality since it is good for the time but not specular. What really gets me is the fact that they ACTUALLY manage to make the characters grow. Not from teenager to adult or kid to teenager but year to year, the 3 girls actually do grow in height. This is especially noticeable from flashbacks. I believe not enough anime that last years have this sort of continuous physical growth and that this should be more prevalent. I did have a few problems with the art/animation (especially those basketball scenes) however they are not really noticeable enough to ruin this series 
 
I rate the art at an 8.5/10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
I like this anime quite a bit. It is not the best series out there I’ll admit however if you are looking a good lengthy show or perhaps an older style show then this would be a good one to watch. Your views may be different in terms of how you feel of the characters or story however I do believe this is suitable for pretty much everyone. 
 
I give the series an overall rating of 8/10 


          
 
       Helpful This is a part of Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theatre, and I believe it to a masterpiece indeed. The story chronicles the life of an orphan girl named Jerusha 'Judy' Abbot through her teen-aged years up to her young adulthood. 
     The many characters in this series truly have depth and are far from being one-dimensional - It is amazing that the writers can introduce such characters and without giving them hours upon hours of screen time are able to define their persona.  The feelings and opinions of Judy that is conveyed through her actions, interactions with other characters, narrations, and letters (she writes them a lot - like a journal) are very sincere but most of all original and this makes a very interesting main character and a very interesting series. 
     The animation itself is very good, showing a very early late eighties to early nineties style with beautiful frame-by-frame hand-drawn characters and watercolour backgrounds - none of that cheap cg you get nowadays. 
     This anime is not a kiddy anime, it is suitable for all ages and not only children but adults will enjoy it as well, and are sure to appreciate the more complex storyline.  This anime also slips in some nice americana and historical references in once in a while that is absent from the book (e.g. the first solo transatlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh on the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927).  This is truly a classic anime that is not to be missed, especially if you are as big an anime fan as I am! 
     Once you have seen the first episode, you are sure to continue on and follow Judy throughout her adventures from a child yearning to break free from the shackles of an orphanage and attend school; to her coming of age years when she discovers love and has her first crush; and in high-school where she develops ambitions of becoming a writer and a fully independent woman!

If this is what's going around your head, then all I have to say is ""Just do it"". This is my first time writing a review here in MAL and this show has amazed me. This show has influenced me in  ways I have never imagined. This show without a doubt is the best anime up to date. The first thing that got me interested about this show was the plot since it seems unique and was adapted from a novel by Jean Webster. I love the characters development even tho it has 40 episodes long, it make me feel like I have growth along with the characters which makes me sad and happy at the same time. One thing to do while watching this show is grab a tissue box and enjoy the show.  I will never forget this show, as it's one of my most memorable anime I have ever seen. I want to thank the producers and ofcourse the author Jean Webster for an amazing job on this series. Much love :)

 The characters of the Yamada family are not very deep, as the focus is mainly on Chi. The boy (Youhei) is fairly sweet, and his parents are funny but they are still only background characters. Their purpose is to make things happen for Chi, the main character. 
 Chi is the reason that almost anyone will love this anime. Nobody can fail to squee when Chi doesn't understand things that are basic to most of us. It may be her utter confusion in every day situations that makes her so innocently sweet.  
 The length of the episodes is only three minutes so there is almost no effort needed and it's great if you have a short attention span like I do. 
 A final point: If you love cats this is a must watch. If you're allergic to them, watch it anyway. :)

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Chi's Sweet Home has a pretty linear storyline: a kitty who lost her mom and now wanders on a journey to find her. She always thinks about her mother on her journey, and always has kind memories of her. So far I've seen there aren't so many obstacles in her way, nor any big trouble. This anime is to make you shout &quot;KAWAII&quot;, it doesn't have a complicate plot. 
 
Art: 
The art is linear, clear and chibish for the most characters, Chi in the first place, but also humans; it fits well the kind of this show. Expressions are so funny, believe me they'll make you laugh and enjoy yourself while watching. 
 
Sound: 
It also fits quite well the animation, and though there isn't so much outstanding background music, there are often carillons' sounds, or funny music to fit funny scenes. The opening song (there's no ED) is cute and childish enough to make you melt. 
 
Characters: 
Chi is sooooo sweet, and everybody of you must at least agree with that. Also every other character shown is friendly. All the humans shown at the time I'm writing are pretty funny themselves. I'm really glad nobody hurt the little Chi, elseway it would have also hurt my heart. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Her story might turn out being something funny, sad or sweet, it's too early to say that. I really enjoy Chi's Sweet Home, and although I think 2:50 minutes are too short for an episode I enjoy every second of it. It's probably the cutest anime I've ever seen!

          
 
       Helpful Chi's Sweet Home is not your typical run-of-the-mill anime. It is short and sweet. 
 
There are about 104 episodes of pure love in the series, and even though the episodes are about 3 minutes long each in length, the series remains to be interesting with the short stories. Sometimes, it spans into a few episodes to create &quot;story arcs&quot; that equate to half a regular anime episode. 
 
Chi's Sweet Home is about a little kitten named Chi (the circumstances of her naming is quite humorous), who gets lost from her mother, and is found by a family of 3. And that's when it all starts. 
 
Since they are not allowed cats at their apartment, and they cannot just leave her outside, and they cannot seem to find anyone to take her, the humor starts with this crazy kitten, and trying to keep her secret. 
 
This is for certain not deep or thought-provoking. It is a great little thing to watch if you want to watch something sweet. Or you feel a little down. It's hard to feel upset over a sweet little kitten. 
 
Anywhoo... This is also great for young children. As long as they can read subtitles ok, or maybe not (sometimes it's funnier just watching Chi, and you needn't have words), this is great for them as well. 
 
A very good anime you don't have to commit to, and watch at your leisure. Good for all ages.

The atmosphere and story for the people in the hidden city is very interesting, kind of like the tales in Arabian Nights, thanks to this soundtrack. The short scene with the wounded girl at the beginning of the movie was also great. 
However the rest of the movie comes out very lacklustre. A little more action, may be some swinging of sword (considering Boice's resemblance with Guts, and having Marc Diraison's voice) , or some moral obligation to avenge the wounded girl could bring some sense of intrigue and struggle. But that was too much too ask I guess. 
 
I had some fun with this movie nonetheless. Wish there was more to it, other than the novels which I will never read. In the end an weathering continent had a good concept, but failed in the execution.

          
 
       Helpful We've officially arrived at our last film of this year's festival. This one is based off of a light novel series that was going from '88 all the way until 2006. The film came out in '92 and was brought to us by the letters IG. As in, Production I.G. That's right, the Psycho Pass, Suisei no Gargantia, & Blood+ studio.  
 
 
 
Story: 
 
Three travellers are walking through the desert, hoping to find more water, when they encounter the corpses of a group of people. One small child is still barely alive and is shown a small kindness before she goes into the good night. Our protagonists continue on to an abandoned city called Azec Sistra. A city populated by the dead and being targeted by a gang of looters.  
 
The biggest issue with the film is that it drags. We get a long stretch with them just walking through the desert, a long stretch with them wandering through Azec Sistra. Even the climactic final sequence involves long stretches of talking and flashbacks. There's barely even any action as our heroes have blades that are mostly decorative. You can definitely get by with some of that to build the world, set up the atmosphere and such. But what we see of this world is just a vast expanse of desert and the atmosphere is just a bit dreary. Which doesn't need that much set up. I get taking some quiet moments for atmosphere in a film like Glass no Hana where there are shifts and those quiet moments are building up to something but not so much in a film like this.  
 
There's also this general feeling that everything interesting happens outside of this film. We don't know how our heroes got together. We don't know what their ultimate goal is beyond just finding water. We don't even know why Lakshi cut her hair and left her old home. We know the villagers were pressuring her brother to have her do something, but there's no hint as to what it was. It could have been something reasonable like ""Please ask your sister to stop stealing our dogs. She does not need every dog in the village to cuddle."" It could have been something kind of shitty but understandable like ""Please convince your sister to marry that rich noble who will provide our village with the resources we need in return."" Or it could have been something insane like ""Just let us sacrifice your sister to our God of prosperity. You know the great God Lovecraft demands the life of a young girl of colour. Just be cool and respect our stupid, toxic religious beliefs."" 
 
And yes, I could read through the light novels and get some of those answers if not all of them. However, this film is not nearly compelling enough to make me want to get further into this world or these characters.  
 
About the most credit I can give it is that some of the scenes illustrating the restlessness of the spirits in the city are quite effective.  
 
Characters: 
 
The same issue plagues the characters as permeates through the story. They just aren't interesting. Boice is a big, strong dude whose defining trait is that he's a bit taciturn. Tieh is a gentle healer. You know, like the vast majority of healers you get in any fantasy work ever. Lakshi is a good-hearted and naive type of character. And their villains are pretty much assholes who want to raid the city because the Temple probably has a good treasure. They also want to rape Tieh, mistaking his androgynous appearance for him being a woman. So, pretty much a hive mind of being terrible.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork is definitely the best part of the film. While it isn't the best I've seen, Azec Sistra is pretty well detailed and there are some strong background details. If the action sequences weren't boring, this element would actually be good.  
 
 
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is passable. I know that Seki Toshihiko, Takayama Minami & Yara Yuusaku can deliver stronger performances but I would also be pleasantly surprised to hear them do really well with the material they have to work with. Oshima Michiru's soundtrack is a bit bland in this. Which isn't something I can recall being able to say about any of the other soundtracks I've heard from her. I mean, she did compositions for Fullmetal Alchemist, So Ra No Wo To & Rokka no Yuusha. All of which had strong soundtracks.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
We do have a bunch of guys referring to another as a ""beauty"" but they also think he's a woman so it barely qualifies.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Less wandering, more substance. Yes, atmosphere and world building are important. But this film forgets that you need a hook to get your audience interested in order for those factors to work.  
Give us the context behind why Lakshi left. Okay, they show fragments of her flashback at least three times, maybe more. If it's really that important, give us the reason she left beyond the vague ""the villagers wanted her to do something she didn't want to do."" Otherwise don't waste our time with the same goddamn flashback of her cutting her hair over and over again. 
Characters with personality, please. You'd think with how much time they just spend wandering and looking at things, we could get some dialogue to give them a more complex level of characterisation. Which would also help add some investment.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
This film has quite a few problems. It's slow. Its characters have nothing to them beyond clichés. There are way too many flashbacks. However, I hesitate to call it bad. I just don't think it has quite that level of problems. So, I'm going to give it a 4/10. If you want to watch a walking tour of a dead city with the world's dullest tour guides, go for it. It may be worthwhile if you're a fan of the light novels. I wouldn't know since I haven't read them and, after watching this, I doubt I ever will. 

          
 
       Helpful A decent movie that feels like a small portion of a larger tale.it uses the farmiliar scenario of a global catastrophy that forces the human race into degradation and shows how a few inhabitants try to survive by finding food and water while avoiding bandits,pretty much like what you'll see in  animes like fist of the north star or violence jack. 
 
The plot is pretty straight-forward  three wonderers finds the last remaining survivor of a group of treasure hunters who were attacked by bandits and eventually find the Azec Sistra a city that serves as a tomb for an extinct race of people who build it as a means to store their wealth and live in splender even after death.when they arrived at the tomb they find the bandits there as well.The leader of the bandits group wants the mysterious treasure that is held in the tomb that legends claim to hold great power.Our heroes must escape the tomb while avoid being killed by the bandits or the curse that is placed by anyone who enters the tomb. 
 
This movie is just OK,it suffers because all the characters are just very bland and not even slightly interesting.The three main character consist of the big guy with the even bigger sword,the boring female priestest and thick headed female teen. watch it if you need to past the time but there are shorter and far better movies out there {psycho diver,twilight of the dark master}.

","Review in brief: 
 
This OVA is about Hōkago Tea Time planning for the overseas trip they take in the movie.  The focus on this leaves the episode a tad light on comedy, but it’s still K-On! at heart. 
 
Review in full: 
 
Released roughly a month after the K-On! Movie was announced, Keikaku! could be seen as a prequel episode for it.  It didn’t need to be an episode, but this is K-On!, so a simple story isn’t really an issue.  Not much happens, not just because it’s K-On!, but because the setup of “planning an overseas trip” is actually what this is about rather than being the backdrop for a bunch of goofy moments with the Keion-bu.  There’s still goofing around to be had of course, but with what is effectively an actual plot focus that lacks drama it leaves less than K-On’s optimal amount of room for tomfoolery.  Like a fair amount of K-On!’s 2nd season, it’s more mundane than it needs to be. 
 
That’s not to say it’s a worthless watch. K-On’s colorful cast of characters are still very much themselves, and there’s even little sprinkles of minor development for some of them through their dialogues.  Plus, the comedy that is present is of good quality, even doing a better job with some jokes than season 2’s versions of them.  While the episode’s conclusion isn’t very solid in the context of why it was made, loose endings are little more than a nitpick in slice of life stories as standard as this. 
 
Though this OVA certainly hits KyoAni’s above-average standard for production quality, it is a step down from season 2.  Sure, there wasn’t very much to animate in this episode, but even then, the imagery was a little more static than normal.  Perhaps it was the framing; there are a few noticeably odd choices with it, and K-On! usually has excellent framing.  Still, the visuals overall are colorful and highly detailed.  This episode is rather quiet in the background, and calming background noise with a lack of K-On!’s usual pop is a tad odd.  Plus, the Keion-bu does not so much as set foot inside the club room, so there’s no real place for insert songs either.  The important thing is that the ever-talented seiyuus still found ways to be creative, this time with the Engrish portions of the OVA. 
 
Verdict: 
 
Keikaku! Is hardly a necessary watch, but fans will appreciate getting an extra episode out of what could have been just a movie preview, and that’s what matters in the end, not whether it’s the best K-On! episode ever or not.  If you ask me, it’s not the worst episode of K-On! either.

          
 
       Helpful I gave everything an 8 except for the overall is a 9.  Why, you ask?   
 
This ""ova"" is basically just an extra episode that could have easily fit in either season of the amazing anime that is ""K-ON!"" but for some reason they decided to have it be an ova (which is fine I guess). 
 
This episode basically starts out with them all passing around gifts (I guess) and one of the girls mentions how she got it on a trip when she went on vacation, so one of them says ""fuck it, let's go on a trip"" and they decide to spend an entire episode getting their passports.  But not before trying to learn whatever language they need to know before going there (which they never use in the movie anyway so that was a waste). 
 
The art/sound/characters are all the same from the main show, not really much to talk about here.  Let me just say that this might be the only episode in the entire show where they have a glass of iced tea instead of hot tea like they normally do (I could be wrong but trust me on this one).  I just thought that was kind of funny. 
 
Reason I gave it a 9 is because I gave the whole show a 9, and I don't really want to change my rating because of one episode.  I personally liked every episode of the show, and I don't really want to discriminate on the rating so there. 
 
Overall, watch it if you are going to watch the movie.  It's a fun episode with a couple fun scenes and Yui acting like Yui (which is always great).

       Helpful Yasuna is a chipper, energetic high school girl with bravado that’s entirely fueled by her lack of brains. Her everyday high school life might have consisted of endless pep rallies and air-headed trips to the mall with friends, had she the ability to make like-minded friends... Instead, she wound up making friends with the girl seated next to her in the back of the room in their homeroom class, the cold foreigner Sonya. It’s difficult to say what black magic lead these two oddballs to become so tight with each other, but ever since their paths became intertwined, Yasuma’s ideal school life has become nothing but danger and abuse at the hands of her new BFF, who turned out to be an assassin! 
 
Assigned to their school as part of her career, Sonya has little patience for her bubbly friend, who interferes with her work, constantly ropes her into crazy schemes, and even more constantly sets off her PTSD, to which Sonya always has a wrestling hold and a broken wrist to give her in return. And if these two didn’t sound like enough of a classroom disruption, Yasuna soon meets Agiri, a mysterious acquaintance of Sonya’s who claims to be a ninja, and is always ready to supply her two pals with acme-style ninja gadgets, for a small fee of course. With these three nuts in the same basket, school life is sure to be anything but normal or average for everyone involved. 
 
I’ve talked about JC Staff before, to the point that I should probably replace Gainax Month with it. I won’t, of course. JC’s animation production tends to fall into three different camps; In one camp, you have beautiful animation that obviously had lots of effort and resources poured into it, like the first 7/8’ths of A Certain Scientific Railgun and most of Toradora.. Then you have bafflingly ugly anime that tries to look more expensive than it actually is, like Okami-san and her Seven Companions. Finally, you have the camp right in the middle... Anime with moderate budgets that save money wherever possible and make up for it whenever necessary. The majority of their work falls into this category, like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga, and of course Kill Me Baby. 
 
Keeping with the trend, Kill Me Baby isn’t a show that really demands a high budget... The characters are chibis, despite technically being in high school, and they don’t demand a wide range of movement to express their parts in any given situation. The budget is normally saved for the rare special effects and lighting techniques, as well as some surprisingly smooth action scenes. The money they do spend on slapstick and physical humor is well spent, causing little to no visible hiccups in the process. 
 
What’s equally impressive, though, is the art style and use of color. This show features a very restrained sense of artistry, using minimal and often recycled illustrations for the backgrounds of any given scene, but they’re still relaxed and detailed enough to blend and come to life in the story. The backgrounds are adequate at the very worst, but what I found myself more attracted to were the colored backgrounds that appeared behind the characters whenever the actual backgrounds disappeared. At first glance, you’d think they just took a bunch of white boards, gave crayons to a few elementary school kids, and pasted the result onto the background in place of actual environments. 
 
On closer examination, however, it becomes clear that each of these backgrounds is intended to express the feelings of the characters and what’s going on in each cut. Imagery similar to a sunrise will be used when Yasuna has what she perceives to be a great idea, and when you cut to Sonya bluntly explaining why it’s a bad idea, you’ll instead see what appears to be the last few rays of Yasuma’s sunrise being trapped under a blue screen that’s covered by vertical white lines... In other words, Sonya’s raining on Yasuma’s sunrise. Mixed colors, whether blended or overlapped, are used respectively to convey agreement or mixed feelings. Weird purple bubbles will look as though their pushing back a calm blue background to convey that Yasuna is disturbing Sonya’s piece, etc. 
 
It’s simple and not terribly deep, but it’s still a really nice touch, and once you start noticing it you likely won’t stop. The character designs should be somewhat on the generic side... The genki girl has messy short chestnut hair, the cold-hearted foreigner has blonde pigtails, and the mysterious girl has long dark hair... But the chibi aesthetic makes these choices feel like more of a deconstruction or parody than it actually is. The facial expressions are thoughtful and detailed, and expressive enough to serve their purpose. The music is kind of forgettable... It’s the kind of samey generic music that you’d expect from a slice-of-life gag show... But the opening and closing themes are just awesome enough to make up for it. 
 
The opening theme is called Kill Me no Baby, and I had a hard describing it until I read someone on ANN calling it sped-up polka music, which sounds about right. It’s catchy, and it’s sung by the main cast members, who repeat the title of the show over-and-over again in in the chorus. The ending theme, The True Secret Behind Our Feelings, is a bit slower, and features the same two actresses singing over a low-key techno beat The songs are cool, but what really sells them both are the videos, which I could watch over all day. The opening’s video features the three girls (and one unnamed character) fighting off an alien invasion! No, I’m not kidding, it shows a UFO attacking the earth, with the ninja, the assassin and the idiot fighting them both inside and outside of the ship. The ending is somehow even funnier, as it features Sonya and Yasuna doing a synchronized dance that looks like it’s going to be morning exercises at first, but turns out to just be a series of hilarious moving poses. 
 
The English dub is... Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but at least the good and bad points are very clear cut. This is a Sentai dub, and based on the period that it came out, it’s fairly obvious that the scripting and ADR directing was in the hands of one Stephen Foster. This isn’t Foster’s usual kind of dub, though... To start with the good attributes, he didn’t rewrite it. It stays very faithful to the original script, with the only real changes being the odd ad-lib from Luci Christian, and these normally work for the better, making her character’s snarky sarcastic humor more accessible to a western audience. 
 
Speaking of Luci Christian, one of the usual positive aspects of a Stephen Foster dub is still present here, and I’m surprised people never gave him enough credit for this... The acting in English is really good, maybe even slightly better than the Japanese. Luci growls and grumbles her way through the long-suffering straight man Sonya, and Hilary Haag turns her childish charm up to 11 for her role as the bubbly Yasuna, and the two of them work off of each other brilliantly. Rozie Curtis also does a fantastic job as Agiri, making her character sound aloof and nonchalant, yet with condescension and some distinctly bad intentions lurking below the surface. Brittany Karbowski is enjoyable as usual, playing a nameless character who’s only known by the descriptive term “Unused character,” and wants nothing more than to find some sort of purpose in the main cast. 
 
Unfortunately, such uncharacteristic quality comes at a steep price. This is a somewhat common thing in Foster’s work, and I plan on talking about it more if I ever review Medaka Box or Kids On the slope, but in order to stay faithful to the script of an anime, Foster compensates by completely ignoring lip flaps. Yes, he makes no attempt at directing his actors to match what they’re saying with what’s on screen, it’s ugly but true. What the characters are saying in English will begin before they’ve opened their mouths, and end afterwards, and no pause is acknowledged. I’d say to ignore it, but it’s really distracting, and it’s hard to get over just how well a better director would have been able to make the dub look and sound a lot better without having to sacrifice one for the other. 
 
I’m not the first person to make this observation, but comedy is hard to review. Humor is subjective, and thus there’s no way to predict whether or not other people will find the same things funny that you do. Kill Me Baby is a slice-of-life slapstick comedy, told mainly through extended vignettes, so I can understand many viewers will likely find themselves losing interest during the full length episodes of a show that ideally should have been presented in 12 minute chunks. I like to find other things to discuss when reviewing comedies, but in Kill Me Baby, the only thing I can really discuss IS the comedy, so bare with me through this. 
 
The style of comedy that Kill Me Baby uses is the classic ‘Straight-man-Goofball’ type of style... Where you have one character acting like a fool and trying to get on their counterpart’s nerves, and that counterpart delivers by either pointing out the goofball’s foolishness or just flat out smacking a bitch. This style is used often in the genre, and I must say I’m quite fond of it myself, but unless both characters take their roles to extreme levels, it’s hard for this dynamic to carry a series. Luckily, both Yasuna and Sonya take their respective roles and make them the central elements of their characters, so that the style can be carried to some very versatile places. Yasuna isn’t just a happy-go-lucky idiot, she’s a prankster, and thrives on the chance to get the better of her BFF, making her a very active goofball. Sonya is extremely edgy, and has a laundry list of trigger warnings, as she’s frightened of most animals, and is quick to become offended, making her a perfectly reactive straight man. 
 
The rest of the cast is small, consisting mainly of two-bit extras that we’re not supposed to commit to memory, such as “Girl who lost wallet belonged to,” “owner of annoying dog,” and “Old man who keeps getting roped into stuff.” Agiri makes for a great third wheel, as her weirdness and casual antagonizing is one of the only things that Yasuna and Sonya are ever on the same side about, giving us rare glimpses of camaraderie between them. Unused Character is, surprise surprise, kind of useless, and doesn’t do much other than act as meta-commentary on the small size of the main cast. She could have honestly been left out, basically, and she knows it. With her and Agiri acting as occasional crutches, this show survives primarily on the strength of it’s two central characters and the wide array of interactions they can have. 
 
For the most part, the story really only has three settings... Walking to school, hanging out between classes, and walking home from school, and the amount of material they can squeeze out of these settings is amazing. Yasuna always has something to bother Sonya with, and even when she doesn’t, she still has enough dimension to carry a satisfying vignette. Sonya herself does of course have the violent and sour reactions in good supply, but for whatever reason, she’s still more or less game to TRY and enjoy her time with Yasuna, and she even shows some shockingly real vulnerability in her occasional confusion over Japanese culture, as well as in the ways her PTSD has believably affected her reactions to otherwise non-threatening noises and events. 
 
I could easily file this show away under the long list of plotless slice-of-life shows, but when I really think about it, that wouldn’t actually be fair. Yes, there’s no long term plot, nothing over-all that the girls are trying to accomplish, despite Yasuma’s futile insistence of a motive in the final episodes. The plots, believe it or not, come in the lengthy vignettes that make up each episode. This isn’t like in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, where entire stretches of story can be made up of just interchangeable interactions that seemingly have nothing to do with each other... For the most part, an episode of Kill Me Baby will consist of quarter-to-half-length stories where something happens... Yes, things are constantly happening in this show, to varying levels of importance or impact... And there’s almost always a clear goal, even if that goal is just the two characters getting the best of each other. 
 
While this style of storytelling doesn’t wear thin easily, the jokes themselves can become kind of repetitive, and it can sometimes feel like the writers were stretching for ideas. Vignettes that remove themselves from the normal setting, such as Yasuma’s New Year’s dreams, kind of fall flat, and the humor can lose steam if you’re bingeing more than a few episodes per sitting, meaning a portion of one episode per day would probably be ideal. Having said all that, I still say that Sonya and Yasuna are the backbone of this series, and while the execution isn’t perfect, it’s still a great concept that the writers are at the very least having a lot of fun with, never having to resort to cheap fan service(Which is good, because seriously, how do you make small anatomically disproportionate bobblehead characters sexy without failing at it like Lucky Star did?). The writer of the original manga, Kaduho, clearly loved these characters, and you probably will too. 
 
Kill Me Baby is available from Sentai Filmworks, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray. It’s also available for free on Crunchyroll, and you can find pretty much the entire series dubbed on youtube. The original manga, by mysterious author Kaduho, is not available stateside. The follow-up OVA series, Kill Me Baby super, can be viewed online in many different places. 
 
Kill Me Baby is a really fun series built on the strength of one really strong concept, enthusiastically explored in enough creative ways to excuse the somewhat lackluster backdrops that it’s set against. But like many others of it's ilk, it’s biggest problem is just how simple it is. Sure, there’s some complexity to the characters, but there’s little to no depth to any of it. It’s not really worth a second look unless the humor really worked for you, but in my case, it definitely did, and as fast-paced as the jokes in it are, you’re sure to find at least a few moments per episode that’ll work for you to. It’s a decent comedy that promises some great laughs, and that’s all it really needs to be. I give Kill Me Baby a 7/10.

0,5760,137,3.9648969392467626,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Dororo to Hyakkimaru,"Hyakkimaru is a young man who lacks 48 body parts because they were taken from him by demons before birth, as payment by his father, Kagemitsu Daigo, to obtain his wish to take over the country. When the baby boy was born he was missing 48 parts of his body, and thus was abandoned—thrown into a river. Hyakkimaru has grown up and now has obtained fake body parts so he can eliminate the 48 demons that were made from his body, and to retrieve his missing parts. Along for the adventure is the boy thief, Dororo, with whom he becomes friends. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Supernatural']","Dororo revolves around a rōnin named Hyakkimaru (百鬼丸) and young orphaned thief named Dororo (どろろ) during the Sengoku period. The rōnin was born malformed, limbless and without facial features or internal organs. This was the result of his birth father daimyō Kagemitsu Daigō forging a pact with 48 sealed demons so that he might rule the land and increase its wealth and prosperity. In return, he promised the demons anything that they wanted which belonged to him. This enabled them to roam free and commit atrocities along the countryside.
After his mother Nui no Kata was forced to set him adrift on the river, lest he be killed by his father, the infant was subsequently found and raised by Jukai, a medicine man who used healing magic and alchemist methods to give the child prostheses crafted from the remains of children who had died in the war. The boy became nearly invincible against any mortal blow as a result of the prostheses and healing magic. Grafted into his left arm was a very special blade that a traveling storyteller presented to Jukai, believing it was fated to be within his possession given that ever since the boy had been discovered, the doctor had been visited by goblins. As revealed in a short tale about the blade's origin, the blade had been forged out of vengeance to kill goblins as well as other supernatural entities.
After the sensei was forced to send him on his way because he was attracting demons, the young man learned from a ghostly voice of the curse that had been set upon him at birth and that by killing the demons responsible he could reclaim the stolen pieces of his body and thus regain his humanity. Across his travels, he earned the name ""Hyakkimaru"" (百鬼丸) among other names for his inhuman nature. On one such hunt of a demon, Hyakkimaru came across a young orphan thief named Dororo who thereafter travels by his side through the war-torn countryside. When Hyakkimaru met Dororo, he had already killed 15 demons.
Throughout their journey, Hyakkimaru killed six more demons, bringing the total to 21. Along the way, Hyakkimaru learns that Dororo was hiding a big secret. Dororo's father, Bandit Hibukuro, hid money he saved up on his raids on Bone Cape to later be distributed to the people squeezed dry by the samurai. Itachi, a bandit who betrayed Hibukuro and sided with the authorities, crippled Hibukuro. Hibukuro escaped with limping legs, along with his wife and young child. Hibukuro dies trying to let his remaining family escape. Fearing that she, too, will die, Ojyui had prayed to Buddha and, with her blood, drew the map that will lead him to Bone Cape. Three days later, she froze to death.
Itachi kidnapped Dororo and used the map on ""his"" back to lead them to Bone Cape. A mysterious boatman ferried them to the Cape but he had two demon sharks with him. One of the sharks ate half of Itachi's bandits while the other shark left with the boatman. However, Dororo and the remaining bandits managed to kill the shark. When the boatman and the second shark returned, Dororo was able to separate the boatman and the shark. Hyakkimaru arrived to stab the shark in one of its eyes, but It escaped. They held the boatman prisoner and then they landed on Bone Cape.
The boatman told the thirsty bandits of a spring not too far from their camp, and they went to drink, leaving Itachi, Dororo, the boatman and Hyakkimaru. Dororo later found their corpses and blood leading to the half-blind shark. Hyakkimaru killed the shark and the boatman, then recovered his real voice. Itachi went to search for the money but only found a letter from Hibukuro saying that he hid it somewhere else. The Magistrate arrived under the pretense of getting rid of the bandits but actually came for the treasure. Hyakkimaru, Dororo, and Itachi kill them, but Itachi was left for dead. Hyakkimaru and Dororo continued on their journey.
Sometime later Hyakkimaru learns that his father, Kagemitsu Daigo, was possessed by the 48 demons, and went to slay him. Things were going badly on the Daigo clan's land, and the citizens were forced to build a fort for him. The slaves were planning a rebellion, but one of the slaves told Kagemitsu of their plans, and he was prepared. His archers shot and killed many slaves and the remainder hid in a tunnel they had built under the fort.
Hyakkimaru left Dororo and ran into the fort. Dororo joined the slaves in their ambush, but Kagemitsu Daigo's soldiers caught Dororo. To prove his loyalty, Kagemitsu told Hyakkimaru to kill Dororo. Hyakkimaru acted as if he was about to kill Dororo but turned around and threw his sword into the dark stabbing the physical manifestation of the 48 demons, however, some of them managed to escape. The slaves charged through the tunnel and attacked Kagemitsu's soldiers. Kagemitsu, weak because of the slain demons, escaped with his wife Nui.
After he regained his eyes, Hyakkimaru figured out that Dororo is female, though Dororo rejects the notion and refers to himself as a boy despite Hyakkimaru's insistence to act more feminine. This is in part due to Dororo being raised as a boy by his parents in order to be tough. Hyakkimaru also wanted Dororo to fight with the farmers against those in power because Dororo's father was a farmer. Hyakkimaru gave his sword to Dororo, the one that he had desired throughout the series. Hyakkimaru planned to continue his journey alone, agreeing to meet Dororo again when Hyakkimaru's body was whole. They parted with Dororo crying at the doors. It was not until 20 years later that the last of the 48 demons was slain, and he reunited with the full-grown Dororo.
","I must warn you at this point: even if this is a children's anime, it is very gory, and has cruel themes going on (starvation, child slaughter, war...). But no sex nor rape, obviously. Many of the monster scenes would be considered way too scary for children today. 
 
As of writing this, only half of the episodes have been subbed. I understand some japanese, so the lack of subtitles wasn't a problem, since the story is quite straightforward. Knowledge of old fashioned and slangy japanese is useful, if you wish to keep up with the characters' lines. 
 
Story: 
 
I haven't read the manga, so I didn't have any expectations when I started to watch this. The story took me by surprise! It was enjoyable and reminded me of some old japanese folk stories. I would compare the feeling to watching Mushishi, except that Dororo has lots of action going on and less monster lore thrown around. 
 
The first half of the series has a gripping storyline, with a lot of character development. The episodes' storylines could span 2-3 episodes. After that the series gets a bit loose, and I can't help but feel the episodes have a filler feeling to them. They also change to the one-episode-per-storyline format, which didn't do good for the pacing. 
 
The last episode ties things up hastily but is okay. The ending development could have started a bit sooner, so the pacing would've worked better. 
 
Art: 
 
I'm actually pleased that this anime stayed black and white. The colored pilot doesn't have the same eerie feeling. I also like it that they made Hyakkimaru look older than in the pilot. The animation is okay, though there are some wonky parts here and there. As an animator, I can forgive them. 
 
Sound: 
 
I really liked the music in this series (though the opening theme is too catchy :D). If you like biwa, you'll like it too. The music reminded me of Ninja Scroll, which is my favorite. The sound design is old fashioned, and I recognized some nostalgic sound effects that were a norm even in the 80's.  
 
Sometimes the growling sounds were more funny than threatening, and I would've liked more variety in female voices. 
 
Characters: 
 
The first half of the show is a bit more focused on Hyakkimaru, and the last half on Dororo. It's not too black and white, but I would've liked the story to be more evenly divided between the two. I liked how Nota (the dog) also had important moments in the plot, and wasn't there only to look cute. 
 
The series has a wide cast of secondary characters, of which some are more memorable than others. But I liked it how they were easily distinguishable from each other; a trait that isn't that well handled in more recent anime. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
As mentioned before, the plot was great in the first half, but lost it grip in the second half. I did watch the whole series during a few days, so I guess it was gripping enough. 
 
Overall: 
 
If you like wandering samurais, yokai and old school kids' anime, this is for you. This is like a children's version of Ninja Scroll and Mushishi put together. I'd say you could watch the first 13 episodes and skip the rest to the final one, without missing anything important in between. 
 


          
 
       Helpful even though i've only watched two episodes of this amazing anime, i felt i had to write a review, as no one else has, also because anyone who really loves great anime should check this out...based on one of my favorite manga by osamu tezuka, this anime takes place in the sengoku period in japan - a boy name hyakkimaru's father offers up forty-eight of his body parts to demons in exchange for unlimited power and the boy is left for dead - this is the story of his quest and travels with an orphan named dororo to reclaim his body from the demons by killing all forty-eight - this anime has all the atmosphere of a great japanese ghost story - amazing and eerie, it draws you in to the dark story with amazing direction that reminds me of kurosawa's great samurai epics - the sound is also genius: great seiyuu, amazing orchestral ghostly incidental music, and an amazing and gorgeous theme song - if you love great ghost stories, samurai tales, or anything by tezuka-sama, i highly recommend checking this out if you get a chance!!!

 Daigo Kagemitsu is a man who desires power. Political power, to be exact. One night, he decides to sacrifice forty-eight of his unborn child's body parts to forty-eight demons to gain more power within Japan. When the child was born, it only had a head and a torso. The baby, soon after it was born, became an orphan. One day, a doctor named, Juko, found the baby and decided to take care of it. He named it, Hyakkimaru. As Hyakkimaru got older, Juko had to create prosthetic body parts for him, and that's when Hyakkimaru noticed that monsters were around him on a constant basis. He was being haunted by the forty-eight demons, and was told personally that if he wanted his original body parts back, he must slay all of the forty-eight demons. Whenever he defeats a demon, one of his body parts is returned to him. Hyakkimaru, while on his journey, saves a young boy by the name of, Dororo. Dororo is a orphan just like Hyakkimaru, and after being saved by him, he admires Hyakkimaru and chooses to follow him on this dangerous journey. 
 Dororo to Hyakkimaru is a pretty good show. The only major flaw that I noticed while watching was with some of Hyakkimaru's body parts. I mentioned earlier that when a demon is slain, Hyakkimaru gains a body part. Halfway into the show, Hyakkimaru is given a voice. He says, ""Dororo, I can finally speak!"" Up until that point in the storyline, Hyakkimaru was a mute, yet he speaks for the entire show. Dororo responds with, ""But you've been speaking this entire time."" Hyakkimaru explains to Dororo that he hears everything he says in his mind or some bullshit like that. Same thing goes for his eyes and ears; he was incapable of seeing and hearing from the very beginning, yet he interacts with other characters within the show, and slays demons ಠ_ಠ. Hyakkimaru is practically a Japanese Hellen Keller! That flaw aside, the show is good. 
I can see a lot of people turning away from this show, because of how it looks and it's age. Personally, I'm not bothered with how the show looks. I'm not that ignorant to the point where I would avoid a show just because of the way it looks. The story is good, the music is catchy, especially ""Dororo no uta,"" and the two main characters are cool. Dororo is a little annoying and gets Hyakkimaru in trouble sometimes, but he has his good moments. I'll give this show a 7.3/10, the last episode is probably the best episode.

Sandy discovers that, after rubbing the koala's nose, he comes alive. His name is Blinky and he is from the magical ""down under"" Koalawalla Land. They are soon joined by his little sister, Pinky. Adventures ensue in both Sandy's world and Koalawalla land. Among the characters met are 2 men after the ""magical talking bear"", a lizard that bounces back and forth from the magical realm and the real realm, and kangaroo police officers. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Kids', 'Fantasy']","One day, 12-year-old Sandy Brown receives a package from her long-lost grandfather containing a stuffed Koala named Blinky that was lost in a shipwreck 38 years ago. Sandy gives the koala a Noozle (another term for an Eskimo Kiss) and it revives him from ""magic sleepytime"". His first word is ""Blinky!!"" in response to Sandy thinking out loud what she should name the bear right before she awakens him. They are soon joined by Blinky's sister Pinky, who appears out of thin air soon after Blinky is awakened, and demands immediately that Blinky returns with her to KoalaWalla Land. Blinky refuses however, and the trio go on to have many adventures together. Blinky is able to sustain himself while living on Earth with Sandy because of the Eucalyptus trees that Sandy's grandmother had planted 38 years ago when Sandy's grandfather, an archaeologist who had mysteriously disappeared while on an expedition to Ayers Rock, just before the ship was lost, told her that he was sending a Koala as a gift, as Sandy's grandmother had expressed that she had always wanted one as a pet.
It takes Sandy some time to determine that the ""noozle"" is the action that revives Blinky from magic sleepytime. She does this several times without thinking about it, and gets frustrated over the fact that Blinky falls asleep repeatedly (during which time his appearance is similar to that of an ordinary stuffed animal) and stubbornly refuses to awaken until she realizes what she must do to revive him. Early in the series, Sandy decides to introduce Blinky and Pinky to her grandmother, but decides to keep them a secret to everyone else.
About halfway through the series, Blinky and Pinky bring Sandy to their homeworld of KoalaWalla Land. KoalaWalla Land is a parallel dimension inhabited by anthropomorphic koalas, kangaroos, platypuses, cassowaries, kiwi, and frill-necked lizards. It is ruled by a wise old koala known as the High Dingy Doo. Humans aren't allowed in KoalaWalla Land (and in fact a human will be arrested and jailed on sight just for being in KoalaWalla Land), so Sandy has to wear a koala mask during each visit (though some are able to see through her poor disguise). A portal to KoalaWalla Land can be found at Ayers Rock. Pinkie also has the ability to create instant portals to KoalaWalla Land at any point, as well as portals back and forth through time, by utilizing the red lipstick in her magic cosmetic kit to draw an interdimensional hole in the time-space continuum.
Meanwhile, Sandy's father Alex, who is also an archaeologist like his father before him, is exploring Ayers Rock and trying to solve the mystery of what happened to his father 38 years ago. While there, he discovers a cave, and on the wall of the cave is a message that his father wrote 38 years ago, saying ""I must leave on a mission of great importance. The little koala will know where I'll be.""  Alex stumbles into the portal to KoalaWalla Land at the end of the tunnel, where he is chased by the KoalaWalla Land police. Sandy, Blinky, and Pinky travel to KoalaWalla Land to rescue him. Alex stumbles upon a crystal planetoid in KoalaWalla Land, where he sees a shadowy figure resembling his father in one of the crystals. There, the KoalaWalla Land police find him and place him under a sleeping spell, but Sandy and Blinky and Pinky arrive to rescue him. They bring him back to Ayers Rock. Alex wakes up, convinced that the entire experience was a dream.
When Sandy hears that her father saw her grandfather, she and Blinky and Pinky decide to go back to KoalaWalla Land to look for him. They decide to look in The Crystal Place, which is connected to the crystal planetoid where Alex saw his father. The Crystal Place, which lies at the very core of KoalaWalla Land and helps hold the universe together, is a giant crystalline sphere filled with brightly colored orbs, which when touched by bare hands immediately entrap that person's essence forever with no escape. Sandy, protected by Pinky's magic bubble, enters The Crystal Place, and finds the spirit of her grandfather imprisoned in one of the orbs, trapped in a limbo-like state. He tells her to learn from the creatures of KoalaWalla Land and to understand how their community has come to survive in a world of love and companionship. Finally, he delivers the cryptic message ""as the world of KoalaWalla Land goes, so goes the world of mankind."" Sandy wants to know what he means, but that's all he can tell her, and he tells her that more will be revealed in due time.
Some time later, Alex is exploring Africa. He is scheduled to return home, but when he hears the story of a magic stone called the ""wiseman stone"", he decides to stay in Africa to search for it. Sandy and her mother are disappointed when they hear that Alex is staying in Africa, so Blinky and Pinky travel there to try to find a way to convince him to come home. They attempt to scare him back home by making ghost noises, and even create illusionary dinosaurs in an attempt to scare him away from the dig site, but nothing seems to work. Finally, Sandy's grandmother appears. She has traveled to Africa to scold her son for running off to look for the wiseman stone when his wife and daughter are waiting for him to come home. Alex decides to come back home with his mother. Shortly after arriving back home, Alex receives a phone call from his assistant Lionel who says that his team has found what they believe to be the Wiseman Stone, but they need Alex to check if it's the real deal since he's the expert on the subject. Later, during a visit to Sandy's grandmothers house, Blinky uses his magic powers to teleport an unknowing Alex to Africa. Confused as to how he got there, Alex checks the stone and confirms that it's authentic. Alex still has the stone with him when Blinky transports him back. Alex is still confused about the whole thing. When he shows the stone to his mother, she tells him that he must have found the stone in her attic, and that it is a stone that his father had found many years ago. After Sandy and her Parents have gone home, her grandmother brings the stone up to her attic, and it is revealed that there are two wiseman stones, one that Alex found in Africa, and another that his father had found years before.
One day, during another trip to Sandy's grandmother's house, Alex finds the two Wiseman stones in her attic. Alex is confused as to why there is now a second wiseman stone. His mother tells him that his father found one, and that he put the other one there when he came back from Africa. It is then that Sandy decides to tell her parents the truth about Blinky and Pinky. Shortly afterward, they receive a surprise visit from the High Dingy Doo, who has come to ask Alex a very important favor. The High Dingy explains that KoallaWalla Land and the Earth are destined to one day separate from each other naturally. However, because of Seismic Testing in the Australian Outback, the trans-dimensional axis that binds the two worlds together has become severely shaken, speeding up the process so much that both worlds could be destroyed in the separation. The High Dingy Doo also explains that Sandy's grandfather knew that this would happen someday due to his research of ancient Australian folklore. He entered The Crystal Place and became trapped there while trying to unravel the secrets of KoalaWalla Land. The High Dingy Doo says that Sandy's grandfather likely knows how to save the worlds from destruction, but that his spirit can only communicate with someone who is related to him by blood. The High Dingy Doo asks Alex to come to The Crystal Place so he can speak to his father's Spirit. Alex, protected by a magic bubble created by the High Dingy Doo, enters The Crystal Place and tells his father's spirit of the impending disaster. His father tells him that the only way to restore the balance between the two worlds so they can separate safely is to give the wiseman stones to Blinky, who will know what to do from there. After returning to earth, Alex gives the wiseman stones to Blinky, who now remembers what it is that he must do. Blinky teleports himself, Pinky, Sandy, her parents, and her grandmother to Ayers Rock, where the separation has already begun. Blinky and Pinky bring the stones to the top of Ayers Rock and place them in a predisposed altar, where Blinky manipulates them in a joystick-like fashion to keep the two worlds from destroying each other. Blinky and Pinky return to KoalaWalla Land in the process. Because the two worlds now exist as completely separate dimensions, Pinky's magic is no longer able to bridge the ties that formerly bound them meaning Blinky and Pinky must now forever remain in their home separate from Earth.
","Fushigi na Koala Blinky, or Noozles, as it was know in the U.S. Is an old anime that aired on Nickelodeon in the 1990's. If you're cynical in anyway, an serious adult, or a heartless, unimaginative fool, you won't like this anime. Noozles is a kids show and if you grew up watching it like I did, you could probably watch it again several times because there's no way any kid out there wouldn't like this. Seriously, it was that frickin entertaining. The story itself is utterly ridiculous which is probably the best thing about the series. The art is good for a kids show, certainly better than children's programming these days. The theme song will be stuck in your head for DAYS. The characters are actually well thought out and interesting, too. If you're looking to get your kids into anime, this is great. It certainly isn't asflashy as some other children's anime these days but smaller children will enjoy it.

0,1746,139,3.9356738430007585,"An adventure of revenge, brotherhood",Zoids Fuzors,"R.D. is a delivery boy who works for a company called Mach Storm in order to earn money to search for the legendary Alpha Zoid.

After this happens R.D.'s adventure to discover the truth about the Alpha Zoid begins. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']",none,"Zoids fuzors, just like Zoids new century, have teams who uses Zoids to battle each other for entertainment purposes in my opinion. It has been a good series especially when their Zoids combine with each other.  
 
Unfortunately, the story is a bit cliche. Teams battling each other for no explained reason(I might have missed it in the series though). I have only watched the English dub so far and the voice actors are good. Animation is a bit different from previous Zoids series but then impressive when they combine. All in all, it was a good series. 

          
 
       Helpful Ok, I'm a big Zoids fan, and as such, this review focuses on the differences between the styles of this and the preceding series, rather than an more general overview (I won't use Genesis as an example since that is of a vastly different style). Unfortunately, it is very negative. 
 
Firstly, let me start with the Story: 
Fuzors basically has no story whatsoever for the vast majority of the series. In the final few episodes, a backstory gets fleshed out and some continuity established, but as this only happens very late-on, it feels more like a justification for why the series occurred in the way it did, rather than an actual plot that naturally developed. Furthermore, the story it does eventually manage to establish is rushed, this, along with the generally poor translations, makes it difficult to draw any praise from the story. 
 
Now, this brings me to draw parallels with Zoids Zero, which also had a very skimpy plot at best. However, the biggest difference with the two series is that Zero is built around battles and comedy, and as such tries to give the viewer fluid fights and funny lines rather than a deep plot. Fuzors does not, and as such has no excuse for the lack of story. 
 
To continue with the story theme, I'll next discuss the Characters: 
 
While Zoids shows are not renowned for their characters, the development of the cast is not handled well in Fuzors at all. For instance, in the first episode, the character ""Amy"" walks in to Mach Storm's headquarters and appears to anger some of the main characters. What the show doesn't tell you is that Amy is actually a member of Mach Storm herself. This fact makes it very confusing (to say the least) when she shows up unannounced in later episodes. This is probably the best way of describing the problem with the characters in Fuzors, it simply assumes you know who/what everyone/thing is -rather than actually take the time introduce them.  
 
This is especially true for the Zoids themselves. Many of the Zoids, such as Arosaurers and Gorhecks are totally new Zoids that fans of the previous series would not know anything about -and yet they appear on screen without any kind of introduction at all. To make matters worse, old Zoids that fans would be familiar with from other series are changed abruptly and without reason. For example, the Blade Liger is depicted in the other series as a very rare (if not unique) Zoid. In the first episode of Fuzors, three of them are shown. Another prominent example is the Fuzors variant of Gunsniper, which are all customised to be the same as Leena's heavily modified (and thus unique) Zoid featured in Zero. No explanation for either of these is ever given. 
 
This kind of ""thrust the viewer into the show"" serves to confuse new watchers and disenfranchise fans, and is a great detriment to the series. Toward the end of the series, some of the cast's backstory is explained, however this is done in a very rushed manner and fails to justify the terrible job done in the first three-quarters of the series. 
 
Next up is the artwork. 
 
Well, the most important aspect of a Zoids show is the Zoids themselves, so I'll start with them. The models are all done in 3D, but the style is different to the previous series. The models themselves are very detailed, and try to stick closely to the real toy range, with small things like feathers and antennae being included. While such attention to detail may sound good, this is actually a detriment, as it severs to clutter the screen with needless ""wriggly bits"" that only serve to distract the viewer. Furthermore, the models are all done in a very bland color scheme, with everything appearing ""cloudy""  and dull when compared to the crisp, bright, colors of the previous series.  
 
Compounding this is the fact that most of these included features are simply never used. For example, the Liger Zero Phoenix never fires the bomb or guns that it has on it's back, instead RD usually uses his claws to attack from a distance, which is a big departure from the realism the highly detailed models try to emulate.  
 
While this might be excusable if everything in the series were done in the same style of graphics, this is simply not the case. Bullets and explosions are done in conventional anime style and as such stick out like a sore thumb. They just do not blend at all with the Zoids they are fired from or hit. 
 
But the most noticeable feature of the animation is the movement of the Zoids. The Zoids move in a very awkward and robotic fashion. All of the Zoids featured are extremely rigid and inflexible, thus their movements seem entirely unnatural and unrealistic. This is especially prevalent when the Zoids ""fall over"", wherein they appear to do a backflip on the spot rather than actually collapse or stagger. This is easily the biggest complaint I have with the series, especially when comparing with the extraordinarily fluid animations of Zero. 
 
The backgrounds are bland and uninteresting, with very little stand-out features, and as such, the only positive thing I have to say about Fuzor's artwork is the character's design. However, considering that the characters are very unimportant (as they are usually obscured from view inside Zoids) this is largely a moot point. 
 
Finally, is the sound. 
 
Almost all weapons have high-pitched sounds, regardless of what they are actually shooting. As any mech fan could well appreciate, it sounds a bit ridiculous when super-heavy artillery makes a ""pew"" sound. Furthermore, RD's voice actor has a very high-pitched voice, as do most of the supporting cast (such as Sigma and Sweet). As the viewer's ears are bombarded constantly by all these high-pitched sounds, it honestly gets annoying.  
 
Other: 
Well, there is no section for this, but the quality of translation is very poor. The names of Zoids are often mispronounced or downright wrong.  
 
Overall: 
Quite simply Fuzors is a very poorly made anime when taken from the viewpoint of a Zoids fan. The animation is awkward, robotic and dull, the sound effects are annoying and inappropriate, the translations are poor and the story only picks up toward the end of the series, but this simply come along far too late to salvage the series. 

          
 
       Helpful This might sound like a harsh thing to say, but this is one of the worst series I've ever seen. The plot is terrible, and the voice actors are outstandingly bad. The fights are poorly strung together and are terrible to look at. This series was cancelled from US airways for good reason. Although it does get better in the latter half, it's not enough to recover from the terrible first half.

","Simple, humuorous &amp; sugary sweet!!  I was hooked after watching the 1st few eps. One gd thing abt this series is that some eps can really stand on its own unlike some shows that adopt a cliffhanger approach at the end of each eps...   so it keeps the anticipation level low.  However, you do feel anxious to know what is going to happen to Himeko, Daichi &amp; those ard them.  Its comforting to watch Himeko&rsquo;s enthusiasm in all the things that she did even at crucial moments. The series does set a good moral outcome. You need to watch this if you wanna know more. What I really loves abt this show is Himeko&rsquo;s relationship towards people ard her.  Also her spontateous act/attitude never fails to create problems  but that&rsquo;s where fun comes in!!

          
 
       Helpful Ah, what can I say? Himeko's adventures and mischiefs throughout the series can sometimes bring headache-- But it DOES help her through a lot of things! Daichi's not one to lose either in personality. He's quite clever and tricky. Very helpful in tricky situations. I love most of the characters! (Except maybe, Hibino. You'll see why when you've watched the anime). 
 
Story: 10 
Well, it's the usual magical girl with her loyal companion(s). Every episode is like events that happens in a day. Ah! But don't get me wrong, each story keeps you interested about what may happen next. They're all connected somehow. Not many fillers in the middle of the series so it's all good. For me, I really liked the story of how she can change forms and stuff. I've always thought what it was like to do that and now I can imagine it through this anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Well, it's not the best but it's not as bad. Seeing as how it's from around 1990 (I wasn't born yet at that year) or so, the art is quite nice and not bad on the eyes.  
 
Sound: 10 
 
Well, I don't really notice a lot of sound missing and there aren't any sound overused so I think they did pretty well. 
 
Character: 9 
 
Haha. The character developments are quite fine. Daichi may come off as rude and brash, but after seeing the whole series and how they grow, I don't think he was that bad at all. Hime's always a tomboy but we do see some changes in her attitude towards a few things. Some of the characters don't have many personality change but I think it suits the story and characters just fine. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
I really enjoyed all episodes. No matter how angry or sad I get from them, they also bring me joy. I wished it lasted longer.  
 
Overall: 10 
I cried at the end thinking I won't be able to see more, but I'm sure if I don't forget about it then the anime and my memories of it won't end and it'll last long!

(Source: RightStuf)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","In Slayers, it was mentioned that the main characters of that series live on a world that is one of the four created by the mother of all creation, called the Lord of Nightmares. This world was known as the Red World. Lost Universe, however, takes place in a different world, known as the Black World. Whereas the demi gods of the various worlds, such as Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo and Dark Star Dugradigdo had physical presence in that world, they appear in the Black World as ""Lost Ships"", intelligent space ships of unknown origin that have powerful or somewhat divine powers with more advanced technology than any other device in the universe. 
Their rarity and superiority has sparked suggestions that they have been made by an advanced ancient alien civilization or by coming from the beginning of the universe itself. Being a central part to the plot the ""Lost Ships"" are intelligent beings with different loyalties and even their own agenda. Kane Blueriver, a ""trouble contractor,"" inherits a ""Lost Ship"" from his grandmother and from there, he and his sidekick Milly, together with Canal, the ship's computer, journey to find a source of the evil that threatens the universe.
","Lost Universe is an OK anime. Only OK. It's tries to be funny but comes off more annoying that funny. There are times when it's actually funny but the overdose of sarcasm and cheesy tongue-in-cheek dialog mixed in with the [deliberately] bad acting makes it all seem like the writers and/or voice actors didn't take the show too seriously. Lost Universe is along the same lines as Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop [but nowhere near as cool or bad-ass!] It's about a small group of bounty hunters aka “trouble shooters” who fly around deep space doing odd jobs in order to get paid. 
 
~ Art/Animation 
Average 90s style art. All the people had pointy cheeks, pointy chins and large geometric, pointy eyes with crazy hair of varying colors and shapes. There is some nice CG work in this series but it may be before CG became really popular and common for everyday TV series, so overall the show just kind of had that very flat old-school look. 
 
~ Sound 
Um, it's not the most splendid music in the world, This anime made me realize something....that at some point anime music has become a stand-alone product. Modern anime music is now good enough to market itself as a viable product which you can buy as a CD or MP3 and listen to on the [INTERNET] radio. The music on Lost Universe is not this type of music, it's strictly on that cartoony level and it doesn't ever go beyond that. The English voice actors were a trip [or maybe just tripping!] I don't know if they were being that bad on purpose or not! If the show was a bit older I'd say they were genuinely bad...if it were a newer series then they were definitely being cynical. This show seems to be a bit of both, CRIKEY!!! 
 
~ Story 
I believe this is the first anime I've ever watched that seems to fall into the “parody” category because it's clearly poking fun at the Space Adventure / Sci-fi genre [shall I count how many Star Wars inferences there were?] Like I said earlier, Lost Universe is about a small group of wannabe bounty hunters who go sailing though outer space taking all of these low-paying, high-risk jobs they can manage just so that they can put food on the table and buy ridiculous weapons. There does seem to be a bigger plot wherein there is some sinister organization with evil spaceships and such lurking in the shadows trying to foul up everything for Kain and his ditsy crew-members. But alas, with all the campy voice acting going on, the show quickly becomes oh-so-very annoying as it progresses with it eventually losing focus [along with the viwer's attention] and finally ending with the central plot falling off to the wayside. They say ""too much of a good thing can harm ya..."" well in this case, it's the cheesy-ass humor. 
 
~ Cast/Characters 
And the best character award goes to: Kali, the creepy Faux “English” woman walking around smashing up stuff with her whip. She has got to be the looniest assassin in all of anime-world. First of all she's got this wacky and somewhat slurred British accent, WTF dude, like seriously lay off the brandy and peppermint schnapps BEFORE you go to work, hon. And if that didn't make her already deranged enough then there's the fact that she walks around town with that whip trying to kill people, like really....just use a gun, lady!  Then there's wannabe that Luke Skywalker, Kain Blueriver, complete with fake light-saber and dorky cape. He's not bad to look at but he's no hunk either...he gets a 5 on the Bishounen Hunter scale. Rail on the other hand gets a 7 because he's dark, a brunette and suave...except when gets a face full of coffee because of his clumsy-ass, lovesick assistant. The two main dingbats that make up Kain's crew are an even mix of funny and annoying, most of the time they sound like Edith Bunker's younger sisters...what total airheads! Even though the green-haired one is supposed to be a computer she's still an airhead! 
 
~ Is it worth it? 
No, not really. it's not that it's a bad story, but the voice actors went a little overboard with the ad-libbing and cheesy lines....this may have worked with Ghost Stories [which is like, some underground anime cult hit now or something.] But that type of humor overwhelms this show and before long you stop rolling on the floor with laughter and start rolling your eyes. This is only You-Tube or CrunchRoll worthy.

          
 
       Helpful I picked this up after seeing the original Japanese intro several years ago and gave this a shot.  Like most people, I saw this after seeing Slayers, Next, and Try. 
 
This actually does take place in a similar (if not the same) universe as Slayers, with most of the voice cast also being the same.  Not surprisingly, a lot of the humor style was the same but there was a lot more emphasis on an underlying story which is emphasized more later.  It reminded me a bit of a Slayers Next style where bits and pieces are planted here and there while hijicks run awry...at least until near the end.  One thing Lost Universe does better than Slayers though is it shows more sides to the characters. 
 
The main characters are pretty well rounded out, except Millie but most of what you need to know happens later anyway.  You start feeling for some of the characters though, and by the end of the series I starting getting kind of attached to some of the characters.  The antagonists on the other hand range from dull to pretty messed up. 
 
One big determining factor of how much a series impacts me is the ending.  Lost Universe does a great job cleaning up all the loose ends and making the story and characters make sense.  The ending is very bittersweet, while leaves questions, they're not ones that you need answers to.  It's nice to see series that doesn't make you wonder if there might be a sequel or not. 
 
What bugs me if anything is the art.  The art is pretty rough, similar to Slayers but sometimes felt inconsistent.  Sometimes I can't tell if there's more Yashigani than just ep. 4.  I might just be bothered by the way the eyes are drawn.  Of course, the CG sequences are dated, but can't be helped. 
 
Another annoying factor is the voice acting, particularly for Kain.  He sounds like a choked chicken and at times it gets grating to the ears, especially how many times he yells throughout the series. 
 
Little nitpicks aside, I very much enjoyed the series.  Check it out especially if you've seen and enjoyed Slayers Next and Try.

          
 
       Helpful If you're expecting this series to be on par with The Slayers... it's not. 
 
This anime is a revenge story with Kane Blueriver a swordsman who wishes to kill his enemies. However like The Slayers it tends to shift between serious & comical scenes, yet the comedy in Lost Universe was a personal flop to me. Most of this is due to the lack of likeable characters & the smaller roster compared to Slayers. In this series we only have 3 protagonists who aren't that interesting. Kane passes of as the would be son of Lina & Gourry but for the most has this running gag of being obsessed with his cape.  Milly Nocturne has the egotistical nature of Lina but none of the charm. Lastly there's Canal Vorfeed who just comes off as supportive & energetic but doesn't offer much. 
 
Lost Universe is simply too long to tell its story with events being delivered slowly with cheap gags, poor action & boring characters. As a fan of The Slayers, I expected too much from this series. The anime does deliver some interesting sci-fi but could explored better in other animes. There are also some references to Slayers Try but isn't really noticeable (its the lost ships names).  
 
Overall the anime is a very poorly made version of The Slayers. I'm a fan of English, Spanish & Japanese dubs but the English version took A LOT of liberties with its dialogue giving itself a dub that's so bad that it might be good. I would recommend watching The Slayers, Cromartie High School, Binbogami Ga & Gintama for great comedy anime.

","I've heard that the manga is different, I don't know how its different so this will  be my critique on the anime alone. 
 
Radiant had the potential to be something far greater, it even displayed that for a portion of the show, don't simply look at the score I or anyone else have given it and pass it off as bad.  
 
Radiant is your basic shonen anime with your pointy haired snot-nosed brat protagonist who wants to save everyone and stop the bad guys. Nothing really unique there. A good chunk of the show is spent dabbling in miscellaneous adventures that don't add anything to the story, this is where most people dropped the show and why Radiant is rated so lowly. I would say Radiant doesn't actually get to be pretty good until the second arc and the climax of the second arc (which is basically a quarter of the show.) If Radiant had pushed out content as heart-racing and emotionally moving as the second arc did but for the entire show instead of wasting screen-time, then the show would have easily been an 8 or a 9. Radiant very much makes me think of Black Clover in this way, an extremely mediocre and unoriginal start of the show, the setting, and an unneeded time waster of an opening explaining the show to us every episode LOL. But with patience and time you'll see that there is something more to this show.  
 
Unfortunately I can really only commend Radiant on a job well done for about 5 episodes but I still enjoyed this show and am looking forward to the season 2 since it was announced at the end of the last episode. I hope season 2 will continue with the level of content that the second arc ended with.

[story] 
Classic shonen. Slow paced, generic plot points, overall over half of the series is slice of life. Its strong sides lie within the light comedy and world building. Those who are looking for a meaningful story or epic writing stuff won't find any from here. However, those who have wished for a series that is somewhat like ""cute girls doing cute things"" from its style/approach but wanted to see this being implemented inside fighting tournament shonen story line, will see how their prayers are answered here and now, and without a doubt there will never be a series quite like this one as an alternative. 
 
[characters] 
I can't help but to be reminded of Sketch Dance when seeing this cast. Melie is so quality she end up being my main reason for enjoying this series so much. Split personality girl with ridiculously well-planned character design, and characteristics and behavior that serves her cuteness. Seth is more generic shonen lead except he doesn't yell all that much and his morals aren't there to ruin the fun. The side casting contains no annoying archetypes or contrarian buttholes which is all for the better. The light comedic approach also can be seen to effect the cast which ultimately serves the idea of the show. The good part being that the characters still feel genuine and are practically never used as comedic devices or fanservice figures in the series, excluding some animation scenes that use some commonly seen goofs, but these are not really executed with character behavior, just movement. Most of the cast members are super happy and positive which again, further adds to the CGDCT-like style. Smart decisions. 
 
[sounds] 
Utopia is a 9/10 opening song. BGM is chill and well-though. They play goddamn jazz during coffee drinking scenes. //argument. Melie's seiyuu work is amazing be she making a weird, untranslatable anime sound or going nuts with her other personality, it all delivers. Some bigger names are here along less-known seiyuus, but they all do good job, meaning if they stand out they only do so because their work is so pleasant to listen. 
 
[art, animation] 
Bright color pallet. Soft, fluffy and cute are things that were prioritized in design. The simplicity of the animation is a pleasure to watch. Not too much and not too little. Balance exist among this work. Naturally, Melie's hair takes 90% of the screen whenever she is there, but it can be forgiven for it is the fluffiest piece of hair seen in anime.  
 
[enjoyment] 
Never expected to like this series so much. I am not familiar with the source material so I can't speak on the behalf of those who wanted a loyal adaptation, but as an anime only watcher, this type of light series with its fresh approach was exactly what I needed. Those who thought ""I could enjoy a show like this"" when reading this review most likely will. 

          
 
       Helpful I have to be honest, MyAL is getting a lot more negative over the past few years that I have been using it. This anime is definitely above a 7 and less than an 8, which is why I gave it an 8 (because the reviews were just so negative). 
 
There is a lot to like about the series. It introduces you to a world that is quite different from what you'd typically see in a shounen anime. Furthermore, there are a lot of themes that this anime explores that are never explored in other anime; the content of its first season is surprisingly relevant to modern political problems. 
 
The story starts off as showing the the world divided between Magicians and the ""Inquisition"". The theme is very reminiscent of One Piece, in the sense that you are rooting for the Magicians who are _against_ the law in a certain sense. 
 
We are introduced to ""Seth"" a burgeoning young magician who has a mysterious past, and uses is power in a different way to most magicians. Seth sets off on a journey to find a way to defeat the ""monsters"" that attack people once and for all. Little does he know that his resolve is going to be altered significantly; everything is not what it seems. 
 
Radiant is an anime that reminds me a lot of how Naruto, Fairy Tail and other greats started off - small and with a growing cost of characters. 
 
The only problem with this particular season is that it has a lot of filler episodes that make things a little annoying. I think that this will be remedied in the next season, so I hope you can bear with this season for the next one. 
 
I enjoyed this season, and I strongly look forward to the next season that the anime has in store. So please, don't give into the haters, and give this anime a chance. Its interesting, funny, slightly insightful and something that you can definitely relax to.

I am a yaoi fan, love bishounen, and also like lighter shounen-ai anime and manga as well. As a gay guy, even some of the ones that are suppose to be light-hearted or comedy too often have characters that are too little like real guys, gay, bi or otherwise, from my perspective and experience. So it's hard for me to find them really enjoyable, especially when they are trying to represent supposedly real gays, bis and others. They try too hard, and still don't get it right. Then you have a series like this that is kinda making fun of the gay/bi stereotypes anyway, and it comes off really hilarious. It's fun for pure fun's sake. 
 
Art Style: 
 
The art style is in the classic mode though it aired in 2005. It won't appeal to everyone, especially those usually to the razor-edge cut looking stuff, but since I started watching anime in the 90s, I love it! I love the classic look, and it's done well in this.  
 
Characters & Sound: 
 
The characters were fun, if stereotypical: bishounen vunerable beauty, a cat-quick mysterious warrior who appears and disappears (and sometimes seduces the bishounen) and the fool. You may recognize some references from the DragonballZ series, super saiyens, Goku, etc. but it's not distracting. I wasn't a fan of DBZ, but I didn't mind the tie-ins because they worked well. I'm deaf, so I can't give you indication about sound, sorry! 
 
Enjoyment & Overall: 
 
I completely enjoyed the series, it was fun and laugh out loud often. The story wasn't overly complex though a little average: guy on a quest with lots of trouble along the way, and I like the sexy little yaoi bits throughout. Overall, I gave it an 8. Each episode was just under 10mins, so I would have liked them longer, but for the dramatic comedy style it was effective.

The original Patalliro! dates way back to the early 80's and did something no other anime did before: it depicted Boy's Love on television. Not in the way it's done nowadays, Patalliro! was more like a big parody of the genre, but still gay relationships were an essential part.    
 
So no one should be surprised that its spin-off, Patalliro Sayuki!, deals with the topic in a similar fashion. Don't like two guys kissing each other? Then you might want to turn back and watch something else instead. Shounen-Ai may not be the main topic here, but there is still plenty of it along the way. 
 
Patalliro Sayuki!, like DragonBall, is loosely based on Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West, so the story might feel familiar.  
 
The monk Sanzō ventures on a journey from China to India in order to obtain several Buddhist scrolls. On his way he is accompanied by three companions to protect him on his quest: the monkey king Son Gokū, Cho Hakkai who is part pig, part human and Sa Gojo, a former general of Heaven. And of course there is danger lurking along the way. 
 
Since this is a comedy you shouldn't expect too much accuracy when it comes to its source material; some essential parts are there, but  don't be surprised if the characters possess advanced technology or encounter an alien. Sadly the story is far from finished in the end. Then again, every episode is only about 10 minutes long (opening and ending included), so there is hardly enough time to go into detail. Due to the lack of time, conflicts are resolved rather simply and quickly, mainly through comic relief. However I would lie if I said it isn't entertaining to watch. Sure most jokes aren't exactly deep, still it had me laughing out loud a couple of times.  
 
Animation wise Patalliro Sayuki! isn't breathtaking, but it does its job. Honestly, I didn't expect too much from a gag-anime, and for that it looks nice.  
 
Most of the characters have an equivalent in the original Patalliro!, but you don't need to watch it in order to understand it. (though I think it might be a little more enjoyable, if you roughly know the original, since there are quite a few Easter Eggs) Everybody is exactly what they seem to be and they don't really have any significant development. Then again, since they are mostly there to deliver the jokes, it doesn't really matter. 
 
Some of the cast are incredibly pretty and could easily pass as female if the anime didn't tell you otherwise. There were a few where I was honestly puzzled if I was looking at a guy or a girl.   
 
As for the BL, as mentioned it is there, but it is neither too explicit nor is it the shows main focus. It may strike some people as odd, since some of the main characters are monks/ Buddhist disciples. However sexual relationships between monks and their disciples (as mentioned here) weren't actually uncommon in Japan and China. What do you know, historically it isn't even completely inaccurate. 
 
All in all Patalliro Sayuki! is not the most incredible thing you'll ever lie your eyes upon, but as a light-hearted comedy-show it does a good job. If the BL doesn't put you off and you like Journey to the West you might want to take a look. Just don't take it too seriously.

","While this show put the elemental motif's usage to its full potential, that's where everything that's good about this show stopped for me. 
 
I've never disliked an action anime before that accurately satisfies all the criteria and things I loved about anime until I watched this show. 
 
There's nothing interesting or likeable going on in this show at all.  
 
Everything in this show is just standard generic drivel. 
 
You have a generic male lead, who's still in K-12 school, meets a girl, discovers his inner abilities, female lead gets captured, guy goes to save him. 
 
But what makes that dislikeable is that the male lead saving the female lead is all that goes on FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW. 
 
And it's just...idk. There's too much to say and I don't care enough to go on. 
 
So yeah, if you're looking for an anime to rival the Big Three, protip: don't watch this one. You will be sorely disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful Tokyo Underground feels like a lot of other shonen action series from around this point in time. You have a guy with short hair, average height, decent fighter, spirited, and a good heart. You also have the sweet maiden character who is completely useless or the tough but not really tomboyish girl. This one has both. 
 
Tokyo underground has all these things in common and more but it falls short in a few things making it actually lesser than a lot of the others. First of all in our main character. Even though he is supposed to be such a good fighter he never uses any of those skills after he gets his power. In fact the only thing he EVER does is an air slash. It's the only attack he knows or uses and besides the rare occasion that he uses the wind to cushion a fall or guard it's the only time he ever uses his wind. They act like he gets stronger by the end but because it's still the same attack you can't see this besides the fact that his wind can now apparently blow back stronger opponents. But at no point during the series does he show any growth or change in the slightest. The rest of the cast isn't much better. Chelsea has more variety in her attacks but she never changes or gets stronger either. The nerdy kid gets a gun but uses it maybe 4 or 5 times throughout the entire series. I could go on but we'd be here all day. 
 
This leads to the second problem which is all the fights are fairly boring. Rumina just dodges attacks until he can launch his wind slash, Chealsea is a little cooler since she punches things but they aren't very impressive either, and the Nerd is just dead weight. Also none of the enemies put up a really impressive fight. The fights are done poorly and the enemies are almost all defeated with the heroes half trying. No one ever really seems to truly push them to their limit and thus there is no fear of them losing or excitement in watching it. 
 
The third problem with this series is the pacing. The plot has a habit of slowing down at points for the sake of establishing characters, plot points, etc and that's good but then it seems to speed through to the next slow point making things feel rushed especially near the end. Leading up to the last few episodes is a talk of the Obligatory fight tournament arc of shonen. Well they spend a few episodes gathering members and preparing for the tournament....which we never really see. All but one or two matches are just glanced over and then the tournament doesn't even finish in the end for spoiler reasons. I swear they spent more time talking about and preparing for this thing than they spent actually doing it. Because of this the pacing just feels choppy and unfocused a lot. 
 
Overall it's not a bad series exactly but it's only average at best and there are so many other shonen that at least do a better job with the characters, fighting, and pacing.

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed this series but lets face the reality this has already done before, and better  so don't expect much, this is an average story about the adventure of a more or less average boy pushed forward by his feelings (I'm talking about love) to fight against all the obstacles. 
 
Actually the story isn't so bad but I get the feeling I've saw the same things happend to a boy inside the cockpit of a huge robot, welding a sword or following a dangerous path seeking revenge. 
 
Sound effects didn't grab my attention, and some parts of the plot aren't very convincing. May be the worst part are the supporting caracters because they are  too swallow with many cliches.  
 
So go ahead and spend good time; there is a small dose of humor, cuteness, courage, despair as the main character grows stronger, and defeats overconfident and too talkative enemies (yeah monologues really heat up fighting scenes).

","The anime is one of adventure and traveling with friends to gain strength. Throughout the anime, a sort of comforting feel is developed due to the characters that act and appear like little kids. The feel is also advanced a bit more through the use of comedy most of the time and haveing a positive outlook on all situations. I personally do not like the kid like atmosphere much, but it will for sure appeal to younger audiences. the anime is also one great to pass the time and just enjoy a fantasy adventure show, like other animes that have similar feels to them. The show is subbed and the has a good “complete” ending; however, if your like me then the ending will leave you wanting more since it combines a bit of sad emotions with excitement and fun. It is a video game based anime so if you like shows like dragons and puzzles then you will like this (basically the same feel).

The Angel digimon, Cherubimon, one of The three angels sent to save the World from the power-hungry Lucemon, has turned to the dark side and the entire Digital World is in peril. To fight this great battle, the five CHOSEN ONES must find the Densetsu no Spirit (Legendary Spirit).","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","
In the events prior to the series, ten Digimon creatures from the ""Digital World"", a parallel universe originated from Earth's various communication networks, sacrificed themselves to seal Lucemon. These Digimon, collectively known as ""Legendary Warriors"", created artifacts from their data: the twenty ""Spirits"" (ten Human and Beast Spirits for the elements of fire, light, wind, ice, thunder, earth, wood, water, metal and darkness), before leaving the Digital World in the care of three Celestial Digimon, Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon. When Cherubimon betrays them, Ophanimon summons six children from the human world into the Digital World to become the ""DigiDestined"".
Takuya, Koji, Zoe, J.P., and Tommy are among several children who receive a text message inviting them board a train at Shibuya Station. The train brings them to the Digital World. While exploring, the five gain the ability of Spirit Evolution, where they are able to transform into ancient Digimon warriors. In addition, their cell phones have turned into a type of Digivice (digital device) known as a D-Tector, which they can also purify defeated Digimon by scanning them.
While exploring, the Legendary Warriors learn from Seraphimon that he, Ophanimon, and Cherubimon once maintained order among the human and beast-type Digimon, until Cherubimon became corrupted and urged the rest of the beast-type Digimon to engage with the human-type Digimon in a war. During this time, the Legendary Warriors are forced to fight five other ancient Digimon warriors, one of which Koji learns is his estranged twin brother, Koichi. Koji manages to purify Koichi, allowing him to join them. They rescue Ophanimon. However, she sacrifices herself to save them. Ophanimon upgrades Takuya and Koji's D-Tectors, with the last of her strength to allow them to Unity Spirit Evolve. After defeating Cherubimon, the DigiDestined learn that Lucemon is sealed within the Digital World's core. Two Royal Knights, Dynasmon and Crusadermon, steal all of the world's data to awaken Lucemon. Takuya and Koji defeat the knights, just as they scan the Digital World. When Lucemon frees himself, he opens a portal to the real world. When Koichi sacrifices his power, Lucemon leaves the Digital World. While all spirits combine to form into the ultimate Legendary Warrior Digimon Susanoomon, Lucemon arrives at the real world. After reviving Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon, Susanoomon destroys Lucemon, restoring the data and the Digital World. The children return to the real world and realize that an hour did not pass. They save Koichi by using the power of D-Tectors, before they revert into cell phones. Takuya and his friends embrace their future.
","Digimon Frontiers is really different from all the other digimon series , the story is somewhat similar/different from other digimon series , you'll notice it when you watch it. Characters make progress through the story as they get stronger and closer to each other . Some of the let down for me is the relationship in the series though , makes me have high hopes but instantly shuts me down afterwards. But overall the action is good on every episode and the mysteries will make you look forward for the new episode . Every episode interesting to watch and worth my time watching.

          
 
       Helpful I feel that this season of Digimon really pales in comparison to every other season that I've watched. The entire point of the original season was camaraderie, the two seasons to follow did the same thing but refreshing it. Season four tosses that out the window and just has the digidestined turn into digimon spirits. It's like DNA-Digivolution but without the partner, which in my eyes, doesn't make any sense.  
 
You may wonder how I could give the story and art a good grade and give everything else either fair or lesser. For starters there's nothing wrong with the story, I think that it does very well in presenting itself. And the artwork is fantastic, while I don't agree that the characters serve the purpose that they should, they do however look really cool, as digimon mostly have. To be honest because of how the the characters are, it might as well be called Power Rangers: Digital World. You have Kids or teens that say a few special words hold out their cell phone like thing and magically put on armor that often has to do with a positive trait or animal.  
 
Now really, be honest with yourself if this was made with the title power rangers and live action you wouldn't think that it had any relation with Digimon. Why? because compared to the other four existing seasons of Digimon, this is remotely different. 
 
Please note that this is how the anime came across to me and just because you don't like the review I gave it doesn't give you the right to shoot it down in a review of your own, if some people like it fine, but there are people who don't like it and have their reasons, l feel that it's not the way digimon should have been but that's my opinion and everyone is entitled to one. 
 
(Edit) I've recently come to the conclusion that Digimon Frontier is worse off than I initially thought. Do I think it's bad to begin with? Yes. My opinion will likely never change on that. But I've gotten enough direct messages so some of the fanbase for Frontier just comes across as petty and even sanctimonious, further putting me off from this series. Why would I want to be remotely associated with that?  
 
Do I respect that it's been made and the effort taken to make it? Yes, of course. But if you're going to once again try to convince me otherwise, note that I don't care what you think. You're more than welcome to enjoy this series. I quite simply don't.

          
 
       Helpful I'll be the first to admit, I'm not at all a Digimon fan. I've watched the first 4 shows and some of the 5th, but none of it ever stuck to me as much as other shows from my childhood. I'm not saying that Digimon as a whole is bad, matter of fact I think the majority of the shows are fine. Some better then others. Digimon overall is not a bad series. 
 
When it comes to Frontier I've often heard mixed feelings about the show, some believe it to be the dark horse of the franchise, by changing the repetitive nature of the Digimon sequels, turning the kids into Digimon, and by focusing more on the kids themselves. On the other hand, I've heard some think that because of this change, it loses its Digimon vibe. I understand both sides of the argument. I get that it's hard to like a new show in a franchise that changes the original concept, I also understand that it's hard to enjoy new sequels that seem repetitive. I think Frontier keeps a nice balance between the two.  
 
I probably will get a little flack for this, but I personally believe that Digimon Frontier is the best show of the franchise. I'm not saying that Frontier should represent the franchise as a whole, that title still goes to the original first season. I believe that Frontier did what the other sequels did little of, and that was not copying a majority of its material from the original source. I'm not saying that Frontier isn't guilty of this, and that other sequels took all of their material from the first season. What I am saying is that Frontier takes the right amount of source material to still give it the feeling of being part of the Digimon series, while not being too repetitive. 
 
I will admit, I am one of those who thinks one of the strongest strengths of Frontier is that it's not as repetitive as the other Digimon sequels, I like that it focuses more on the kids then it does the Digimon, giving more character development instead of just moving from one battle to the next. The original season did have character development don't get me wrong, but I feel as though a lot of that development was spread out too thin, mainly due to the amount of main protagonists (including their Digimon) in the show. Whereas Frontier focuses manly on the 5 characters (6 if you include Koichi), each getting more then one episode to focus on that particular character. Another thing that I loved about Frontier is that it turned the kids into Digimon. This is what I believe to be the strongest strength about Frontier, not only do you get to battle with Digimon, but now you get to be one as well. I feel this trait gives the show a more of a Power Rangers feel to it, and that it gives the protagonists something to do besides cheer on the sidelines.  
 
Frontier on the other hand does have its flaws. As I said before Frontier doesn't have the feeling as though you are moving from one battle to next, but instead suffers from having filler. I will give credit to other Digimon seasons for not having a lot of this problem, but I feel as though Frontier suffers from this the most. This is what I believe to be Frontiers biggest flaw. There seems to be huge gaps between plot points that are filled with unnecessary story. Sometimes if you're lucky a filler episode will give huge character development or backstory, but usually results with some life lesson. I understand that this show is intended for kids, but I feel as though life lessons can be integrated within the main plot, rather than having whole episodes dedicated to them entirely. 
 
Overall season four of Digimon is a very good addition to the franchise. It changes the concept of Digimon enough to keep the show interesting and not so repetitive, while keeping enough originality to be considered a Digimon show. 
 
Now if you want to get into Digimon and have never seen any of the franchise, don't begin with Frontier. If you were to start with this season, you would get an entirely different picture of what Digimon is as a whole. I recommend starting with the original first season.  
 
P.S. The Frontier dub opening is also the best opening in the series.

Nevertheless, Zorori has the wits, intelligence, and dexterity to always find a solution out of the most hopeless of situations.  Travelling with a pair of twin boar bandits, Ishishi and Noshishi, he continues on his journey to make his deceased mother proud.","['Adventure', 'Comedy']","Set in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji (かいけつゾロリのドラゴンたいじ, ""The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer"") and has published about two issues per year, totaling 70 issues as of December 2021. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on Cartoon Network Philippines on January 4, 2010.
Zorori was originally a villain for the series Hōrensō Man (ほうれんそうマン, ""Spinach Man"") written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when Hōrensō Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō (ほうれんそうマンのゆうれいじょう, ""Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle"") (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, ""Zorori Castle Part 2"" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Yōkai Gakkō no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the Hōrensō Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.
Using clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult kanji or any furigana, instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school ""children's book"", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the PTA demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).
At the time of publication, The Zorori League (ゾロリーグ, Zororiigu) and Stupid Monster (ボケーットモンスター, Bokeetto Monsutaa) (a play on Pokémon) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.
Furthermore, the Spanish word for fox is ""zorro"", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble Zorro.
","Kaiketsu Zorori, based off the children's book series by Yutaka Hara had a very fun anime, even for an older viewer like myself.   
Story:  
The story is fairly simple: A anthropomorphic fox named Zorori wants to become an evil king and own a castle and marry a beautiful bride to succeed the goals he said to his deceased mother.  Although two boars, Zorori, and Noshishi, tag along as his servants.   
It's a silly little story, but I rather liked it for the execution of it made it fun to watch in 52 episodes despite it's simplicity.   
Art:  
The art is actually good, nothing much to be said about it but it has a kiddy feel to it and is well-drawn for the most part.  It's use of vivid colors and simple background art just fits all in very well.   
Sound:  
The sound effects were funny and good to say the most.  Although the music, such as ""Zorori March"", was rather fun to sing-along to.  So it was pretty fun overall.  
Character: 
The characters Noshishi and Ishishi may lack character development, but they do serve a purpose to get into Zorori's character depth.  It wasn't the deepest, but it was fairly interesting to figure out Zorori and see some of him grow and somewhat develop 3-dimension-ally throughout the series.   
The large cast of characters appear at certain times too, such as his rival Gaon, but not much to say there besides a good set-up. 
Enjoyment: 
I really did enjoy watching each episodes.  For all the reasons listed, it just fell in place to my personal interests and had made it worth the watch . All the silliness and some good comedy made me laugh, the somewhat suspenseful parts really got me into it as well.  
Overall: 
Kaiketsu Zorori is a hit-or-miss thing, but most likely great for children as that's what it was aimed for.  For me, it was an anime for just enjoyment and relaxation for it's silly-fun story and characters.  I felt it was worth my watch!

Golden Kamuy takes place in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, primarily in Hokkaido and the surrounding regions, detailing the many real-life political, technological and cultural developments of the era; several key parts of the series, such as the character Hijikata Toshizō, are fictionalized versions of real-life people and events. Specific focus is given to the indigenous Ainu people and their culture, such as exploring their language and the way they respectfully use all parts of nature to thank the Kamuy that they believe provide them. Later parts of the story also explore the different subcultures within the Ainu, and the hardships they suffered by being caught in Japanese-Russian territorial conflicts. The plot also explores the severe struggles of soldiers and war veterans, with moral ambiguity, survivor's guilt, honour, penance and virtue ethics being common themes.
The central MacGuffin comes from an in-universe tall tale of a gold discovery by a group of Ainu miners, said to have yielded 20 kan of gold that ended with one man murdering the others. Hiding the gold and racing to tell his comrades, the survivor was discovered and captured by Japanese authorities who falsely claimed his execution and hid him in Abashiri Prison, hoping to torture the location out of him. Hobbled and watched closely to stop him escaping or communicating with the outside world, the survivor tattooed many parts of a ciphered map onto his fellow prisoners, offering them a cut of the gold for sharing it with his comrades outside.

Story: 6/10 
The story begins with a unique setting of the early 1900s after the Russo-Japanese War.  It has a conflict that is already set up with a Japanese soldier, Sugimoto, and an Ainu hunter, Asirpa, who search for prisoners tattoos which connect to make a map leading to a treasure of Ainu gold.  The conflict is set up and the viewers know what the end goal is so we sit back and enjoy the journey.  Unfortunately, the execution is what corrupts the experience of those who enjoy adventure and action.  I would blame this on Gene Studio, a new upcoming animation group, who just took on a project that was too great to be handled amateurishly and while they did the best they could, it led to a disappointing struggle.  The story also does follow the cliche pattern of centering the focus on one villain every 2 episodes which made the experience monotonous and irritating.  Their lack of experience made the story feel uninvesting, the atmosphere wasn't as movinig as the synopsis is read to be, and viewers are just left with the feeling like their could be something more. 
I will give it props that it was able to maintain itself in the 1st half where it focused on Asirpa teaching Sugimoto about Ainu culture, which in my opinion was the most interesting part.  The 2nd half was where it tried to get back on track with its plot but it was not exciting for me to feel connected to what was going on.  And if anything the action was pretty gritty at a basic level, which gets a pass if you don't mind CGI bears and wolves.

The characters have their own unique personality with Sugimoto being a ruthless killer in action or a laid-back man when he's just chilling.  He has a believable goal and he is a fitting main character for this series.  Asirpa is the heart of this series as her personality is strong, determined, cute, sarcastic, and expressive with the meme faces that she makes throughout the series.  She also is introduced with a compelling reason to be a part of the story and immediately has you routing for her.  They both share a good chemistry as fighting partners and their relationship feels very real and well-developed as they teach each other about their own cultures and fighting strategies. 
The villains on the other hand are either too strange and took up more screen time than they deserved or they were menacing as hell but the series did not last long enough for them to fulfill their highest potential.  We can fault the unfinished manga for that but the number of villains and how memorable they were are at a disappointing level and could not carry this anime the way Sugimoto and Asirpa were able to. 
 
Art/Animation: 5/10 
I'm someone who doesn't try to let art/animation derive my overall experience because I prefer to judge more on story and characters.  The art is pretty average since some character facials become inconsisten every now and then and the animation can either be breathtaking to look at, very below average, or a CG bear or wolf.  In this case, the animation was a major factor as to why this series had a lesser chance of standing out to shows that premiered during the same season or share the same genre as other anime before it. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
The soundtrack isn't anything worth mentioning but I have to admit the opening is unskippable.  It is very badass and provides the atmosphere of a struggling adventure that this show needed more of. 
 
Enjoyment: 4/10 
I just could not find it in me to care after the 2nd half.  And I was very disappointed considering that reviews for the manga of Golden Kamuy are stellar.  If a studio such as Bones, Madhouse, or White Fox could take this on, this could have been bigger and would have appealed to me better personally.  But it relied on the fanbase of its original source material to get the viewership it received.  Let's hope that Gene Studio will improve with time. 
 
Well, I've said enough.  I've got a manga to catch up on.

          
 
       Helpful At the time of this review, the series has been greenlit for Season 2 this Fall, and I could not be more than happy for a continuation of the series! But what all the hoopla, what is this series actually about? 
 
Golden Kamuy (in Ainu language: Golden Gods) is more than just the typical action-adventure anime like so many others out there. It's fun, great and enjoyable for many reasons, to the point where it’s proof that we want at least a 2nd (to 3rd if possible) season to continue the series (if possible). 
 
The story goes of the 20th century Russo-Japanese war, centered in the city of harsh-northern-filled-wilderness Hokkaido, where we got to know and learn the most fearsome yet determinant of the series: the male MC Saichi “Immortal” Sugimoto, a veteran soldier who has fought in the war and miraculously survived after the deadly ordeal. It was there that he is promised to upkeep with his now-dead comrade (Toraji) from a dubious story of a large chunk of hidden Ainu gold (that’s worth about 800 mil yen), and the main goal to steal it and finance his widow (Umeko) for years to come. 
 
The problem? It was stolen by a man called Nopperabo during transportation, and knowing his near-arrival death, so once captured and imprisoned, he carved out a map on 24 of the fellow imprisoned inmates on the location of the gold. And now, with that info, Immortal Sugimoto is set on the journey to find the gold. 
 
Alas, not everything is well as there are other groups and individuals who are eyeing on the same gold as Sugimoto does: The Imperial Japanese Army’s 7th Division, led by Lieutenant Tsurumi for use on military dictatorship to run an independent Hokkaido that’s separated from Japan; a group formed by former samurai Toshizou Hijikata, who escaped alongside the tattooed 24 inmates to steal the gold to fund Hokkaido and its loss from the Russo-Japanese war, and some others who are just stealing for themselves. 
 
In the wilderness, Sugimoto comes across the wild bears of the wilderness, and seeing that survival is in the eyes of the beholder, it looks as if he will be taken down by the bear. And so, enter Asirpa, an Ainu girl who knows the way of the Hokkaido wilderness, and her ulterior motive: to avenge her father’s death, because of his involvement of the transportation of Ainu gold that Nopperabo had successfully stolen in the first place (but not the main culprit who murdered her father). With that, with the intentions of Sugimoto and Asirpa, both set their journeys into a common place with different goals in mind. 
 
Fun fact: Lo and behold, as much as a native Ainu she is, she does have a Japanese name (Asuko Kochoube) that reveals the plot even further, and one step closer to knowing the real murderer and her roots. Will this be explained, let's hope for Season 2 to explain what's left! 
 
As much as the story setting and its storytelling is pretty much a perfect 1-to-1 adaptation from the manga source, I personally think that everything here is consistent, matches what the manga sprinkles on its historical context, and the icing on the cake is the native Ainu dialect (that’s exclusive to Hokkaido), supervised by the same guy who did the manga translation (Hiroshi Nakagawa), and it’s a great job learning and watching the show in its entirety. 
 
The characters here are also what made the series more enjoyable to tackle and journey with. On the good side, we have Immortal Sugimoto, the courageous yet unstoppable man of valor, Asirpa the lone Ainu girl, but is just as fearless and is able to interpret her surroundings well, the Escape King Yoshitake Shiraishi, who's able to escape from just about any level of danger, which forms the good team to get the gold for justice. 
However, the enemies are just as brutal, from the relentless Lieutenant Tsurumi, whom by his half-android-like face shows no qualms of authority, and his motto is to snatch the opportunity in whatever ways possible. Hijikata Toshizou is no brute either, whilst looking for the Ainu gold, he is manipulating behind the scenes in some forms and ways that like Tsurumi, is firm and no questions asked. 
 
The art and animation by Geno Studio is once again, great, inspirational and a visual treat. Their previous work (Kokkoku) is a testament to this anime, and the once-founded studio to take over the defunct Manglobe is now becoming a reality to look out for quality content. With that said, it wouldn't be true if the series was all good. The elephant in the series is with the CGI-laden wild bears, and it's quite apparent that it didn’t mesh well with the background visuals, not to mention that it's outrageously visible. Everything else on the side is truly well done, a big shout out to the people handling the facial expressions of the characters (during the characters’ meal times, shouting “hinna hinna!”), it's just so uncanny and comical, it always gives off much laughter each and every time. 
 
The music is phenomenal, and one of the best OSTs you could have this season. All reputable music artists in play with their new songs (MWAM’s “Winding Road” for the OP and THE SIXTH LIE’s “Hibana” for the ED), I still stand by my testimony from my prelim and say that in terms of musicality, it's one that’s worthy of listening to on it's own and evokes the emotions of the characters, and is the best representation of the series as a whole. 
 
In the end, you might be wondering, is the anime better or as well adapted as its acclaimed manga counterpart? From an overall standpoint, the anime adaptation replicates as much from the manga as possible, but due to it being a 1-cour, the historical context is downplayed significantly, and not to mention that the anime adaptation sometimes doesn’t give off the same vibes as how well the manga did. Had this been a 2-cour (24-26 episodes), we would have appreciated much more, but I'll give props for what was presented here generally, and I would say that both are even as much as manga adaptation goes.  
 
With that said, Golden Kamuy is definitely one of the better and premier shows of this season and it's comes recommended if you want a slice of history that’s not too heavy, and more so on the diversity of the culture behind it all.

       Helpful Story : 9 
 
And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag. 
 
Animation: 
Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...
