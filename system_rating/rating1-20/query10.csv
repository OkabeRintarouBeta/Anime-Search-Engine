(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"This is one of the worst Ova(s) I've ever seen. It focuses on a group of high-school girls (ncluding a ten-year-old child prodigy Chiyo-chan) who have her bring her videocamera to school one day. Then the overreacting Tomo-chan comes and messes everything up (which is funny as the usual, but not here). 
 
Story: It still focuses on the group of high-school girls, but the story just wasn't my taste. It has the anime switching to video-game likeness and then realism, like it's flash-animated. And the story's really short like it should be a 27-minute special. 
 
Art: The art was amazing as it always was, but this one is even more dreadful. The characters look sloppy and unoriginal and it just seems like a bad flash on Newgrounds.com. 
 
Sound: The Japanese dub was really annoying and irritating and where is the bouncy music they always play? it's like everything wound down and you're in the show. 
 
Character: I disliked Chiyo-chan, but there's not much of her in this. Characters are taking the videocamera all around the school and meet friends and it just seems like everything went too quick. 
 
Enjoyment: I never enjoyed this special. I was watching Lupin III while I was wondering why this pilot (or whatever) deserved so much hatred and I had to watch it and what a big disappointment it was. I was bored throughout the whole thing even the opening was too short and uninteresting. 
 
Overall: I don't think this is very violent or profane, it just seems like it should be rated G - for all ages. Well, everything was all messed up and all, but please do not watch this crap. It's as horrible as Winx Club.

          
 
       Helpful While this really was cute and all, it really needed to be longer because I really did want more. The storyline was cute in that it was about a video time capsule and introduced almost all the main characters from the anime show. It was a great bit to see the different personalities of the characters in their more basic form. Some you really didn’t get everything that made them who they were but it was interesting enough that you may want to see the anime after this. 
 
The art style is very basic compared to its anime counterpart and yet since it was mostly in ‘first person filmed’ mode, it didn’t feel to lacking. The jarring of the camera and the strange art styles they used once in a while was explained based on the camera settings and how the person holding it moved.  
 
The voices were cute, and though it was not dubbed like I would normally like to watch, the voices were not making my ears bleed. They were cute and fit the personalities of the characters pretty well. I’m not sure if the voice actors were the ones that did the Japanese dub of the anime but I really did like them. 


          
 
       Helpful Before the TV anime ever came out, two short films were released online by JC Staff to see if the series would be worth a full investment.  It was due to their overwhelmingly positive reception that the show was greenlit, and the first one was Web Daioh.  This first film features a plot that’s entirely unique to the series and manga, as well as a much more high-budget animation style compared to what was officially released.   
 
After a catchy opening that features the cast on their way to school, this short features Chiyo-chan, the child prodigy, bringing a video camera into class to film her friends and leave the tape...  A VHS tape, ask your parents what that is if you’re too young to know...  and Tomo, the class clown, is immediately taken with the opportunity to goof around with it.  She steals it from Chiyo, pans around the classroom(getting a hilarious shot of class space cadet Osaka in the meantime) and plays with the zoom settings, leading to some shockingly good visual effects for it’s time.  She puts the athlete Kagura on the spot, and gets roundhouse-kicked for her efforts.  She then runs away and films the two teachers of the series(thankfully leaving Kimura out of it), including her own teacher Miss Yukari, who’s asleep on her desk.  Her response to being woken up is the third big laugh of the episode. 
 
Finally, the episode leaves off on a fourth big laugh that I’m not going to spoil here, and that’s Web Daioh, the pilot episode of the series.  I fucking love it.  The animation is creative and way ahead of it’s time, the shaky cam has an actual purpose(and it disappears in the final moments, which was a nice touch) and despite it’s short length, it’s really funny.  It manages to feature the entire main cast in some way or another, and while two or three of them might not have featured heavily, they still feel like they were acting naturally and playing their roles.   
 
There’s no music, as the scenario calls for realism more than for a BGM, but you do hear the camera’s noises throughout, and the voice acting is on point.  With a pilot like this, showing off the full potential of the material, it’s no wonder the show got picked up. 
 
Short review, I know, but it's a short episode.  I give Azumanga Web Daioh an 8/10.

When Kaihei arrives however, it seems a student has gone missing. Kaihei, along with his closest friends, are now determined to solve this mystery (without getting the local police involved) before graduation.

But he arrives to find that one of the students has gone missing. As he investigates Melina's disappearance more students vanish, strange events occur and his position is placed under increasing pressure from teachers and parents.
","It's been over a year since I watched Saint Luminous Jogakuin and while I thought it was fine the first time around, I still can't stop thinking about it for some absurd reason. Saint Luminous Jogakuin sits in a strange place for me. On the one hand, the show contains an utterly weak and forgettable mystery that barely get resolved in the last episode. The story is mediocre at best, and the art isn't pleasant to look at from time to time. Yet, even with its numerous flaws, I find it difficult to dismiss this as a bad show. 
 
Saint Luminous Jogakuin revolves around the disappearance of a student attending an all-girl high school, Saint Luminous. Our main character, Kaihei Kajimi gets the news that he is going to inherit the school from his late grandfather. As a result of this inheritance, Kajimi has to act as the school chairman unless he wants the school to shut down. He accepts the role and thus begins the fun harem/slice of life anime that this show was destined to be. 
 
It's not that fun, actually. 
 
Soon after, Kajimi finds himself playing detective, attempting to find the missing student only to discover that more girls are disappearing by the minute. Along the way, he meets with the girls that reside in the school, whether that be an artist or a radio jockey, he makes sure that they find comfort in these dire times. What makes Saint Luminous Jogakuin so special to me is that, while the show's premise is set up to be some kind of harem anime, it manages to be mature in its tone and atmosphere. There's a hidden sadness that lies within this show. The fact that Kajimi continually fails to find answers to the mystery is frustrating to watch, but maybe that's the point. The lack of progression that lies in the mystery adds to the burden of the main character. As the show progresses and the school's morale starts to diminish, I feel more sympathetic to Kajimi as he is unable to resolve the case. Watching his relationships with the students becomes more and more distant as weeks go by is unbearable, and the mind-boggling mystery that barely moves isn't much help.   
 
The plot moves at a standstill, yet the situation worsens each passing week. Kajimi is completely incapable of solving this mystery. Not because he's an inept detective, but because the disappearances are caused by an unexplained force that he doesn't have the power to comprehend. This leads me to believe that the mystery isn't the main focal point of the anime. It plays a considerable role, don't get me wrong, but I think the strongest parts of the anime lies in the interactions between Kajimi and the girls that he interacts with. As the show progresses, we are introduced to a motley crew of schoolgirls. Each of the girls tend to have a distinct personality and some with a personal arc that gets resolved thanks to Kajimi's help. The girls don't act like characters from a haram, but they act more realistically and have their desires separate from the male lead.  
 
With all of that said, is Saint Luminous Jogakuin a good show? Maybe. If you're looking for a good mystery, stay away from this show. If you want a ""character study"" (which is a term I use very loosely) then perhaps give this show a shot. Just don't expect the resolution to be more satisfying than the buildup.

       Helpful &ldquo;Saint Luminous Mission High School&rdquo; is an original TV anime from 1998 that was produced by Genco/AIC/Triangle Staff and was originally broadcast in a last night TV Tokyo time slot. High school student Kaihei Kijimi is surprised when he finds out that he has inherited his grandfather&rsquo;s prestigious private all-girls international high school, and he is even more surprised when he finds out that he must accept the role of school chairman or else the school will close. 
 
Against the objections of some of the teaching staff and of many of the students Kaihei enrols himself in the school so that he can continue his education while he tries to decide what to do with his new responsibility. But things only turn to the worse as some of the girls start to disappear in mysterious ways while outside forces attempt to discredit the school and take it over. Kaihei finds himself embroiled in an ever deepening mystery while he attempts to establish his credibility with the students, staff and parents.  
 
Just what is going on at the non-standard school where students have an unusual amount of freedom in their studies? Are there evil spirits or aliens involved in the disappearances, as some students claim? Are Kaihei&rsquo;s actions helping the situation or making things worse? Kaihei will eventually have to make a decision about a commitment that will affect everyone and everything at Saint Luminous Mission High School.  
 
This short and enigmatic series is first and foremost a very good mystery story. Although the setting and situation appear to be tailor-made for a harem comedy, comedy is very secondary to the mystery in this series, and Kaihei is not a harem anime lead character, nor are the girls harem anime heroines. The animation is quite good for the time, with character designs reminiscent of many of the classic AIC anime of the 90s. As well, the voice acting cast are for the most part seasoned pros from many of those same AIC classics. In addition, the ending theme song is a very early and quite memorable piece from Ali Project.  
 
Saint Luminous Mission High School remains a unique and intriguing example of late 1990&rsquo;s anime series that were based upon original stories. It was originally released on Japanese Laser Disc, and then on R2 DVD, but has never been licensed in North America. The official web sites are now rather sparse and contain little of the original information.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Shounen']","Tsukune Aono is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last-ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising them as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named Moka Akashiya, who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the rosario around Moka's neck and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.
Because of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including succubus Kurumu Kurono and child prodigy witch Yukari Sendo. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, Ruby Tojo, who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet Mizore Shirayuki, a snow fairy student who becomes Tsukune's ""stalker"". A group of ""Monstrels"" harass the club. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the Anti-Schoolers threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporarily closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.
In Rosario+Vampire: Season II, Moka's younger half-sister Koko Shuzen enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called Fairy Tale, which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet San Otonashi, a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student Fangfang Huang tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her Rosario fixed.
In Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother Akasha Bloodriver, who sacrificed herself to protect them from Alucard, the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest half-sister Aqua infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by Tohofuhai to handle the upcoming challenges.
Tsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family Gyokuro Shuzen, who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her half-sisters Aqua and Kalua. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the Masked King reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.
Moka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve; however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it.
","You would probably like this anime if you like comedy and real quick fighting scenes that last about 80 seconds long (most of the time) as long as you get over the fan service scenes. 
I gave the story a 10 because its original and its very interesting how Tsukune Aono and Moka Akashiya trys to hide the fact that Tsukune is a human from Tsukune's other friends who have a crush on him.The plot is very well also. 
I gave art/animation a 5 because the series have too much fan service in most of the episodes. But luckily, a few of the episodes don't have much of it (most of the fan service scenes are at the beginning of the series). Also the anime have some good fight scenes that you can see in almost every episode and the fighting scenes are really short unlike other shows. 
I gave sound a 9, because the sound was well and there was no pitch problems. 
I gave the characters an 8 because the characters are original, but you either have to like or hate the characters. Plus I really love the character Nazo Koumori who's a bat that provides useless information most of the time. 
Overall, I've really enjoyed the series so I gave both a 10. I really liked this anime because of the comedy, fight scenes, and the romance in it. This is one of my favorites anime and I really hope they make a second season. I didn't really focused on the fanservice scenes and if you are going to watch this anime, don't focus on the fanservice or you might hate the series and give up on it before you have a chance to like it. So, if you are going to watch this anime, watch it to the very end. 


          
 
       Helpful Wimpy guy. 
Annoying ""heroine"". 
Lousy monsters. 
And a lot o ecchi. 
 
What do you think when you read ""a school atended by monsters""? It gives you a certain thrill? Well, you possibly think that it will give you a scare? Well then, forget it. The ""monsters"" here are nothing but a joke.  
 
There's this Tsukune guy. He just entered the school, unaware of the fact that the student body is composed of nothing more, nothing less than monsters. And hot chicks that are monsters. 
 
There he meets four hot chicks: Moka; the main one, Kurumu; the main responsible for the ecchiness in the show, Yukari; cute and annyoing, and Mizore; who I thought it would save the anime in my eyes.  
 
Tsukune himself doesn't help. He is such a bloody wimp. Don't get me wrong here. I'm all for female heroines especially in anime/manga since the japanese culture isn't flattering of favorable to women in general. But come on, did he need to be SUCH a WUSS?  
 
That's not all. If the poor characterization wasn't enough, then you are prone to be disappointed over the story line. 
   
In the end, the best thing you can get (and possibly enjoy, depending on your preferences) is the Ecchi factor.  
 
Now, I'm only rating the anime here. I haven't read the manga, so I can't judge it. All I can say is that after giving the anime a try, I wouldn't be able to find a place in my ""plan to read"" list for the manga. 
 
 
My ratings: 
 
Story: 01 - Pathetic 
Art: 06 - Fair 
Character: 02 - Dreadful * 
Enjoyment: 01 - Pathetic 
Overall: 03 - Poor 
Sound: I don't remember and won't play it again to verify it. 
 
(*) I only gave 2 points to the Character factor because of Mizore and the tiny hope I had for her. Even though this hope was unfulfilled. 

          
 
       Helpful Story: Rosario + Vampire is average and very boring. The plot is basically like all of those Sailor Moon episodes where they have really no meaning. There's a ridiculous amount of fanservice with the main Protagonist receiving a nosebleed every two minutes.  
 
Art: I thought the art was fine. I guess there wasn't really anything wrong with it much.  
 
Character: I thought the characters were made poorly. You see many types of these characters in these sorts of love comedy's. One single useless weak guy surrounded by amazing gorgeous girls. It's almost like Ichigo 100% except for the fact that it contains supernatural beings.  
 
Enjoyment: I really didn't enjoy this anime very much. The pervertness and fanserive just totally grossed me out. =C I'm sorry.

Both of them and their friends have grown up gradually in someway, physically or mentally, but one of their best friends is missing: the lifelike android Multi. To their surprise, Multi is brought to their campus again without notice, yet she is no longer the same Multi they have known.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']",none,"WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S HOLY HAPPENED TO THIS SERIES!!! 
 
The original To Heart is rather enjoyable. It's a nice slice of life show that gets misnomered as a harem romance. This extension on the other hand, should never have been made. 
 
The story in Remember My Memories is set around a year after the end of To Heart. Multi has left, Hiroyuki, Akari, and the rest of the cast are still pretty much the same. Hiroyuki is pining for Multi though when she suddenly comes back to school, only for everyone to be told she has the robot form of amnesia!?!? 
 
Okay, I'm not going to harp on about the rest of the story, which in itself is pretty much standard fare. The creators decided to turn what was an enjoyabl slice of life show into a true harem romance/drama. The only problem is they failed abysmally. 
 
The art and animation are sorely lacking in Remember My Memories. Gone is the naturalistic character design and the nice watercolour stillframes. In their place the animators saw fit to make the faces more angular (pointy chins abound in this show). The animation is decidely jerky, and the colour palette has been changed to make the show more &quot;cheery&quot; (failing miserably at this as well).  
 
The sound is another area where a lot of corners have been cut. There's no mellow BGMs in this show, and the effects are sometimes random. The voice acting in this show has also dropped in quality (even though the same actors were used - how the hell did they manage that?). Ichijou Kazuya (the voice of Fujita Hiroyuki), must have been up all night smoking and drinking before recording this series. In the original To Heart his was quite smooth and well defined. In Remember My Memories he sounds like he's desperate and screaming all the time. The other voice actors are no better, which makes me think that these changes were intentionally added to &quot;heighten&quot; the drama (when all it did was make me want to kill the characters or kill myself). 
 
The characters are the main reason why the show is a huge let down. As I pointed out, the voice acting was a major disaster, but the character flaws don't just end there. The creators have tried to make Remember My Memories more &quot;dramatic&quot;, and with this in mind they have turned the characters into an abomination of what they originally were. In the original To Heart Hiroyuki was a kind, sensitive (if somewhat absent-minded) guy. In Remember My Memories his character comes across as annoying, whiny, selfish, angry (in other words, he's a brat). Akari was originally a gentle, caring girl, and although they tried to keep those traits for her character, they spoiled it by making the show &quot;dramatic&quot;. Akari's character flaws are highlighted in many of the &quot;dramatic&quot; moments of the show, especially towards the end of the series. The supporting characters also suffer from this &quot;drama&quot;, as many of their characteristics and personalities are just plain annoying now. 
 
I'm not going to recommend this show to anyone except a complete masochist.  
 
If you're a fan of the original To Heart, or even To Heart 2 (which, even though I didn't enjoy it as much as To Heart, is still miles better than Remember My Memories), then do not watch this show- ever! If you like a good story, romance, drama, great characters, great animation and sound, etc, then avoid this at all costs, and go watch Kanon or Clannad, or even Da Capo. 
 
I'm not going to say anything good about this show (so those of you who liked it, don't hold your breath). It's bad - end of story. This series is to To Heart what The Phantom Menace is to Star Wars.  
 
I'm not going to insult anyone who liked Remember My Memories, but I will say this - compare it to any other show of it's type and Remember My Memories loses in every department.  
 
If I could sue the creators for making this pile of ...., then I would happily do so.  
 
Oh, and for those of you who wonder why I didn't drop the show, I should point out that the show has to rate as a 1 or 0 for me to drop it. Remember My Memories may be bad, but it's not the worst I've seen (which is it's only saving grace).

          
 
       Helpful Overall	 
Ok, so by itself the original ""To Heart"" was awful, but it actually makes a lot of sense as a prequel to ""Remember my memories"". Where the first season was shallow, episodic harem nonsense, this season expands in every dimension and is actually really good. 
 
Animation	 
Nothing spectacular when it comes to graphics, but decent character design. Boy, am I getting repetitive or what? 
 
Actually, it's too bad they didn't stick with the original art style. The graphics were far better in the first season. 
 
Sound	 
Good voice acting (except for the obviously fake Amewrican Remmy/Lemmy. 
 
The intro tune is likeable, but background music and ending theme are pretty bland. 
 
Story	 
RMM is a direct continuation of the first season, and considering that was just an introduction of all the characters, the actual story begins here. And it's a good one. Both backstory and depth is developing, and it turns out to be something as unusual as a plausible and catching drama.  
 
Remember my memories might not be very original (reminding of stuff like Chobits, Kimi ga nozomou Eien etc), but it fuses clichés together in a brilliant way. 
 
Character	 
Since all of the characters got introduced in the first season, RMM can focus on developing them instead. And it is an impressive amount of character development going on. None of that boring episodic ""girl of the week"" nonsense, instead everyone get screen time when it fits the story.  
 
Most of the characters are very likeable (Remmy's irritatingly bad english and the witchcraft girl are notable exceptions) and act pretty much like real people. 
 
Value	 
The Anime keep translation was good, no complaints there.  
 
I love it when a second season makes the first one make sense.l Makes me want to watch them both again some time.

The military develops and trains Pandoras (パンドラ), girls who are able to use special genetic tissue called Stigmata (聖痕, Seikon) to manifest superhuman fighting skills and weapons. Supporting the Pandoras are male partners called Limiters (リミッター, Rimittā), who use special ""freezing"" powers to limit their opponent's mobility.
One of these limiters is Kazuya Aoi, whose late sister was a Pandora. While attending West Genetics Academy in Japan, Kazuya meets Satellizer el Bridget, a powerful Pandora, nicknamed the Untouchable Queen, for her ruthless personality and her intense aphephobia. Despite warnings from his schoolmates to keep away from Satellizer, Kazuya befriends her, and asks to be her Limiter. After helping her through several fights against school rivals of varying ranks and classes, Satellizer agrees to partner with him, although she soon encounters a rival in romance named Rana Linchen, who thinks Kazuya is her soulmate. Their rivalry is put aside when the Novas attack their school using Pandoras under their control to access the school's underground lab.
Satellizer and Kazuya join a handful of West Genetics students to a research lab in Alaska, where they are to help with the Evolution Pandora (E-Pandora) project. The E-Pandora project allows ordinary girls to undergo Stigmata transplants and become Pandoras. When one of the E-Pandoras goes berserk, the others question whether the drugs in the experiment are safe, but are forced to comply with the director and the corporation's wishes. Upon discovering that they are to be used until they are expendable, the E-Pandora Amelia Evans leads a rebellion which escalates into a full-on Nova Clash.
Kazuya learns more about his family's connections to the Pandora and the Nova. Kazuya's grandfather Gengo Aoi launches a similar project, which puts Satellizer and Rana into a special team with girls called Valkyries. However, during the demonstration exercise with custom-designed dummy Nova, the Pandoras experience illusions, and the dummy Novas become a legion of hundreds of Nova that decimate Genetics. Gengo counters this by unleashing the Legendary Pandoras who are Kazuya's aunts. The Chevalier attempt to assassinate Gengo using a group of convicts called the Busters, but the mission falls apart when some of the Legendary Pandoras turn into deadly Novas due to the anti-freezing of the busters, but they are defeated by the power of Kazuya's special freezing, and Arcadia 01, Daughter of Cassandra conceived from Kazuha's father which awakens from stasis in response to her brother's awakened power.
Before Chevalier launches another attack, Gengo moves on with his main plan, which involves sending Kazuya to Elca, the world from which the Novas come from to learn the truth about them. During his time there, he discovers that there might be a direct link between the two worlds with relation to Novas, Pandoras, and Limiters. There also appear to be several alternate versions of people he knows on Elca.
","The Freezing Specials :). The six, three minute, specials for the popular anime Freezing were merely made for the enjoyment of ecchi and seemingly hentai lover :S. I am not sure why they chose to make the specials so ecchi heavy but if you are very fond of the female characters then i recommend it to you. The specials reveal a much...hornier side of the female chareacters. The ecchi also gives way too hilarious moments. I got a good laugh out of all of the episode

          
 
       Helpful Now as two of my other reviewers pointed out there is no plot, other than the guessed after the first season daily life bs. It really is fan service that that is what escapes the other two reviewers. What did you expect from a show that had exposed breasts to being with. 
 
Pros: Same characters and animation. 
 
Cons: Super fan service, sometimes still frames for movement, Nova titties(Maybe that's a pro). 
 
~SPOILERS~ 
 
I didn't think they were bad just not as interesting as the the show and yes the nudity is abound but what do you want from a 3 min special, plot and action. Grow up, you don't like nudity, then don't watch a show you know has nudity. If you watched the show or just like nudity, then watch the specials it's 18 mins nothing ventured nothing gained.

          
 
       Helpful It's my typical ""self-imposed rule"" to avoid spin-offs, extras, and specials like the plagues they are; since the Wapanese animu industry's only goal with their works is to impose their bias and ignorant, pro-otaku, anti-casual ideas. 
 
I saw images of poor Kazuya beaten up nearly avoided this as well. And, as always, the ""Let's Keep Everybody Virgins Forever (Just Like Us Slobbering Otaku)"" didn't help matters much for me either. 
 
But it's not too bad. The specials managed to introduce some punchline that atleast TRIES to be funny. Let us all not forget that the main show basically featured women nearly killing each other in cold blood to get their points across. AND they're doing it in order to prepare for fights against aliens which are even deadlier. 
 
So yeah. I have to admit that the one episode where said alien was wearing a bathing suit and having ""I Love The Ocean"" scribbled on [her] belly was a HOOT. (Don't take my word for it, though. You have to see and experience it to let the full effects of the joke get to you.)

Story: There really is no story its really just a gag anime full of randomness but to best sum it up it Follows the daily lives and details the eccentricities of Date Masamune, Uesugi Kenshin, other famous territorial lords, and their followers during Japan's Warring States period. You don't really need to learn about Japanese history or any of the historical figures. Honestly if you know alot about Japanese history then you'll probably get more enjoyment. 
 
Art/Animation: the Anime of the artwork is pretty good While the animation its acceptable but, the problem is the movement of the animation seems to look a bit choppy and it also looks more like a flash animation as well but that really isn't a bad thing in my opinion. 
 
Sound: I really can't say much about this department but lets just say its overall in the Anime the sound is okay nothing special 
 
Characters: Oh I just love the characters a lot! Espically Masamune, Date in the old days he is called the one eyed dragon due to losing the eye. In this little gag Anime he is known to lose his eye in a very way and has a crazy eye patch fetish Nobunaga Oda is his evil self and Mitsuhide According to Japanese history he was suppose to betray Nobunaga but instead gets caught trying to betray him. Unfortunately I do not know any of the other historical figures but all of them are so funny they all have such funny personality's you can't help believe they were important people that established japan! 
 
Enjoyment: When you probably see the thumbnail of the anime you'll probably think ""wtf? this Anime looks like a crappy OVA"" don't think that just give this OVA a try don't judge until you see. Even, if you don't know any Japanese history you'll still get a few laughs out of it. I enjoyed quite a bit that it actually makes me want more of this little gag series. It was originally a 4-koma manga that is still running I think. Its too bad that there is not Manga scanalation team to translate the Manga I enjoy it that much that it makes me want to read the original manga. 
 
Overall: I enjoyed it a lot With no knowledge of any of the historical figures it might be hard to get some of the jokes at times but that doesn't mean its not watchable. Some people will most likely dislike this OVA but just give it a try you'll definitely get a few chuckles then and there.

Led, sometimes pushed, by Torako, the girls and their classmates work through problems of school, home and adolescence.","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Hyakko takes place in the high school division of Kamizono Academy (上園学園, Kamizono Gakuen), a fictional gigantic private institution located in Kyūshū, Japan, in which the motto is ""to bring up talents of students in all departments and fields"". Its storyline focuses on the comedic school life of the four main heroines, Torako Kageyama, Ayumi Nonomura, Tatsuki Iizuka, and Suzume Saotome. As the plot progresses, Torako and her friends gradually begin to learn and interact with their classmates in Class 1–6, in which each student has a unique and extraordinary personality.
","Let me get this straight, i find it one of the most enjoyable anime i've ever watched in a long long time. 
Hyakko first seems like a typical school life anime and of course i cant deny it but this anime has so much more to offer, not in the story line but in the characters and the comedy it has to offer. 
Hyakko has a large range of character including the 4 seemingly main characters and their classmates. And every characters have their own personalities and it's great to see such a simple show can do that. And it's very rare that i love all the characters, dont hate anyone. 
The art is beautiful, the music is touching at some point, the ed is great. I think this is a must watch for any anime fan.

          
 
       Helpful Well you may think is is just a cheap version of azumanga but this anime is is actually even cheaper. 
 
Very lame jokes that just kids without much experience in anime would enjoy. Its is your usual comedy stereotype anime, i feel like i have seen so many such clones. 
 
Cheap drawing, cheap story, characters are okey but jokes are cheap and cringy, and as usual some cheap drama as reward. 
 
So basicaly i checked it becuase i wanted to see cheap les serious azumanga ver. but its not even good enough to be called a cheap ver. So no, i would not recommend it even to unexperienced viewers.

          
 
       Helpful Actually, the start of Hyakko is very strong. Usually, slice of life comedies have a difficult time introducing the main characters very well, but honestly, Hyakko does a pretty good job of introducing them. Granted, it's not a masterpiece, but it's something simple and does the job greatly--something many comedies completely fail at doing.  
The followup episodes aren't bad either. You get to know Torako, Ayumi, Suzume, and Iizuka pretty well, and the gags are pretty good. I definitely laughed more than I expected.  
But honestly, that's where the positive feedback ends. The supporting cast is basically trash, and drags the show in the mud. Other than the four main leads, other other characters are so archetypal and redundant that you wonder why they are in the show in the first place. Their introductory episodes make you cringe, and they provide nothing to the story. Anything episode that has only side characters is sure to make you want to skip it.  
Perhaps these side characters were alright for the anime was made, an entire eleven years ago, let alone the manga, which is even more ancient. However, they really didn't age well, and it shows.  
Lastly, the serious episodes in this show are also quite bad. While some light hearted anime can have a good serious arc or flashback, Hyakko does not execute them nearly as well as expected. It feels very empty, and you wonder why they were there in the first place. It's just forced. You don't quite feel much of a deeper understanding, and I just wished that it was done in a more natural way. 
This show might have been good when it debuted over a decade ago, but there may be a reason why it's not mentioned anymore.

Determined to avoid them both, Kazuya leaves home to live in the student dorm called Greenwood. There, he hopes to find peace of mind. Unfortunately for Kazuya, stability and peace are the last things one might find at Greenwood - home of the weirdest characters on campus. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","After suffering from a series of mishaps, Kazuya Hasekawa has finally entered Ryokuto Academy. He is there to get away from his brother and his sister-in-law (whom Kazuya had a crush on). Unfortunately, he is assigned to live in the dorm known as Greenwood, a former insane asylum, where the weird students live. His roommate Shun Kisaragi looks just like a girl, and Kazuya initially thought he was until he saw Shun in the boys' bathroom. Also there are his next-door roommates, the dorm president Mitsuru Ikeda and his best friend, Shinobu Tezuka. The manga follows the everyday events and antics of Greenwood.
","I really don’t get why all the boys seem to tease Kazuya right away, including telling him that his roommate, Shun Kisaragi, was a girl. It does play a lot into the yaoi feeling of this show. All the characters from his brother to anyone else in the school are really out of control. All of them seems a bit too stereotypical, Kazuya is pathetic, Mitsuru is cruel, Shun to cutesy, and yet, we sympathize with the characters when they tell us their sad stories. The worse characters for that craziness seems to be Mitsuru Ikeda and Shinobu Tezuka. All four of them seem to have a love hate relationship the whole time. My little fan girl was squealing the whole time for the little hints of Yaoi.  
 
The episodes feel really rushed, making things confusing. It’s like we are reading Kazuya’s journal and he’s not too good at writing it. A lot of the time, they seem to be saying ‘go read the manga’ which of course is something I hate about these animes. I really don’t get the episode that they have a ghost in it. It just seems like a bit of a stretch to do that.  
 
Other then the episodes and the odd characters, one thing it has is pretty much a lot of is understanding of feelings. All the characters have problems with something in their lives. The way they show off these issues helps make them understandable. Sadly, we don’t get the whole story as again, this is only 6 episodes and they skip so much that’s in the manga.  
 
The animation is pretty much on the low side, I think partly because of being vintage and partly because of the low budget. It’s pretty boring animation and nothing really stands out.  
 
The English voices are really off for the women and the men feel a little un-emotional most of the time. I can’t stand Sumire’s voice. It’s really high pitched and annoying. I also don’t understand why she keeps saying Ya as well. Is she supposed to be Chinese or something? There really was no music that stood out to me at all. Normally its way to quiet to get any music or it’s just so standard that there was no change in it. 
 
The show is basically just bland and doesn’t stand out but it is still worth a watch. 


          
 
       Helpful I was super excited to watch Here Is Greenwood after reading about it. The general concept sounded like fun, and I had heard good things about it. I even purchased the old DVD of it to watch it properly. The DVD version has a different english dub than the original english dub on VHS and LaserDisc, though. I've heard mixed opinions on both, so I wasn't sure which one to watch. I settled on the DVD version, anyway. The other night I put it in and watched all six episodes in one sitting. Yes, there's only six episodes. They're relatively short and easy to sit through. By the time I was done with the series, I felt extremely disappointed. It definitely wasn't for me. Each episode involves the cast going through a random situation. The situations don't have the most entertaining plot lines in the world, either. I found a lot of the material to be quite boring. It certainly lacked clever writing and humor. The last two episodes do go together, however. They were also a bit of a letdown for me, though. The series didn't feel like it got a true ending like it deserved. It's all over the place, and anything but captivating. As for the positives, I did like the main character, Kazuya. A lot of the characters didn't do much for me, though. The animation also looks really nice. I'm a fan of the old-school look, so I liked it. It's nothing too crazy, but it did embody the standard look of the time period. Overall, I found this anime to be lacking in almost all fields. The story did nothing for me, and I don't think I laughed once. I wasn't moved by it in any way. Maybe I'll have to give this one another try someday. If you want to watch something that's lighthearted and sort of fun, then give Here Is Greenwood a try. It's short, and it's watchable. It's the kind of show that I can imagine some people loving for its simplicity and nostalgic features. Sadly, as much as I wanted to feel that way about it, it just didn't affect me like it does with others. 

          
 
       Helpful I felt inclined to write this review after reading another user's review.  This is not to dismiss their review but to give another perspective.  I actually agree with a lot of the points they made.   
 
I fell in love with this show when I was a teenager.  It holds a dear place in my heart.  So my review is incredibly biased but then again aren't all reviews? 
 
The best thing about Greenwood to me with how fun it was to watch.  Even though there are only six episodes I felt they did a great job with theme selection per episode.  Each episode minus 5 and 6 have their own unique story.  Because the characters are likable, they work very well regardless of theme or story.  I know my review is a bit vague but I don't believe delving into the details matter.  This is a comedic, light hearted, slice of life Anime.  It's not for everyone but if that's your thing then I would suggest giving it a go.

(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Magic', 'Seinen']",none,"A story about a witch going around and rescuing people is not overall a bad idea, but most of the time stories like that end in disaster. They really need something else in them to keep viewers entertained. Majokko Tsukune-chan has that.  
 
Story 
Simple enough to keep up with. Really it's not the overall story that's any good. It's how the anime goes about the story that I found really enjoyable. Rather than helping people Tsukune manages to make things worse for most. She means well, but doesn't seem to realize that her magic actually causes disaster for most people. This actually turns out to be very enjoyable, and kept me laughing from start to finish. Not to mention some of the things in this anime were pretty demented.  
 
Art/Sound 
I really liked the art. I liked how cartoon-ish it looked. Though, if chibi-ness isn't your thing stay away . . . far away. Sound was fine, nothing else I can think of to say about it.  
 
Character 
The main character, Tsukune, is a delight from start to finish. She uses her magic in a very random way, that would make anyone laugh. Not to mention the things she says and does. To me she was just plain great. Not to mention her sister who would blow things up every time she sneezed. And, the childish mayor was also a delight.  
 
Enjoyment 
This anime was very enjoyable. The story may not be the greatest, and the character may not be the best. However I found the anime to be a delight. It kept me smiling throughout the whole thing. The constant randomness was just plain great. 
 
Like I said, I loved this show. It was not the greatest, but it was still enjoyable. If you have an hour to kill I would recommend it. Though, if you are looking for something more serious then stay far away. 

          
 
       Helpful Tsukune-Chan is a kind-hearted witch who goes around trying to assist people in trouble. To put it nicely, she does not do a very good job of it, and often leaves the situation worse than when she arrived, usually with multiple fatalities. This is played for laughs. 
 
The art style is highly reminiscent of 2x2 Shinobuden, except without the fanservice, so that's a plus. Often, the art would switch into a purposely low-budget appearance to add to the surreality of it. Trading out Rie Kugimiya for Haruko Momoi is a wash. Both have the kind of voice that just makes me want to throttle something. I've never heard of any of the other seiyuu. 
 
As for the comedy, well, I had to invent the ""Crack is a hell of a drug"" tag for this one (and promptly tagged six other shows with it). It's nuts. Half of the jokes have nothing to do with anything, and the other half of the jokes are gallows humor. Women are stalked. People are implied to be pedophiles. People are killed by grenades, getting sniped, explosive sneezes, falling off buildings, drowning in oil, other massive explosions, and getting eaten by sharks and dinosaurs. All played for laughs. I appreciated it. The author had to be on crack cocaine when he/she was coming up with this thing. 
 
The Christmas story was by far the most awesome part of the show. Words cannot express how preposterous it was.  
 
All in all, I'm sure I would have found it funnier if I wasn't in such a poor mood to begin with, but a grade just under a 7 will suffice.  Can I recommend this to people? If you like absurdist humor (if you liked Bobobo for example) and can put up with the voice of Anise Tatlin, then sure. If you prefer shows like Kanon, then you should probably stay away.

          
 
       Helpful Majokko Tsukune-chan is a 6-episode (technically three as each episode is half-length) comedy directed by Sakurai Hiroaki who did Daa! Daa! Daa!, Kaichou wa Maid-sama, and Kodocha. It also has a storyboard by the famed comedy director Daichi Akitarou, the guy behind Fruits Basket, Kamisama Hajimemashita, Kodocha (again), and Now and Then, Here and There (which isn't a comedy, but hey, it's still famed). It is a comedy that tells the misadventures of a witch called Tsukune-chan and her daily life with all of her friends. 
 
Due to the fact that Majokko Tsukune-Chan is a comedy, fans of action and plot would call it boring, as besides comedy there isn't much to offer. There is no story to speak of, and little continuity between the skits in each episodes. Stuff blows up, but then, a minute later, everything is fine! (expect Tsukune's little mascot thing, which dies in the first skit and remains dead throughout the whole show) However, as a comedy, Tsukune-chan does what it wants to do and it does it well. Tsukune-chan constantly gets herself into absurd situations, like in one skit she becomes Santa's reindeer. Then Devil Santa kills regular Santa, and a scientist makes Mecha Santa to deliver the presents. Okay, maybe that sounds really dumb on paper, but it works, trust me. The humor of this show is rather dark typically, and is very snarky. Our main character, Tsukune-chan, is typically always happy and optimistic and seems to be oblivious to the ways everything is messed up in this show, but she is snarky too when she wants to and is the best character of the show. There's also several side-characters, like the goofy Mr. Mayor, the “rival” witch character, and several other members of the cast. The show manages to be goofy enough to be funny, but doesn't fully rely on random comedy and rarely repeats jokes. It rarely gets boring, with perhaps one skit as an expectation.  
 
Animation and sound... The show skimps a bit. The animation is very poor, with really simple character designs and not much movement. Backgrounds are typically very cartoonish. Now, Tsukune-chan is a comedy so it doesn't need to have good animation, but still. What music there is is very relaxing, though it reuses tracks too often and has a full-length opening and ending theme despite its shorter episode length. 
 
Majokko Tsukune-chan Final Consensus 
Story: Entertaining comedy- 8. 
Characters: Really good bunch of unique, wacky characters-8. 
Art: Poor- 5. 
Sound- Reuses tracks too much-7. 
Overall I give Majokko Tsukune-chan a rating of 7, and a recommendation to watch it. It is only an hour and a half long, so why not give it a try, huh?

in fact, all of that boisterous linework, rapid editing that would make anno jealous, a grandiose and whimsical score that harkens back to ghibli and even disney, and art decisions that morph into pure surrealism at points merely EMPHASIZES the heavy and real questions of this series; as someone who is in his third year of college, chasing after my own rosy-colored fantasy that i have simultaneously given up on completely, i felt like this show understood me like no other show ever has.  
 
of course, the perfection of this show goes beyond the flawless stylized art; on top of being a cathartic look into the soul-mucking reality of what it's like to be an aimless, thirsty/girl-hungry college student, the show is a goddamn great time travel story.  
 
the groundhog day premise of looping back into alternate timelines surprisingly never got old, and the writing (infamous for having machine-gun fire dialogue that flashes by with five or so paragraphs a goddamn minute) just keeps everything unexpected and fresh no matter how many days are looped, and how many timelines are explored.  
 
tatami galaxy will reach out and grab you by the neck and hurl you through its 11 episodes faster than its main character can spit out words at you. it's an auteuristic masterwork, a testament to the unique vision of masaaki yuasa, an anime that stands heads and shoulders above the rest when it comes to dealing with real life issues of love, self-doubt, and the search for meaning during the turbelent fickleness of youth.  
 
this is a perfect show, and if you're like me, someone who's drifting through college wondering where the hell it all went wrong, then it will be the perfect show for you. 

          
 
       Helpful J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film ""Submarine"". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug. 
 
The never named main character's story of university level loneliness, as it happens, is told with abnormally badly drawn characters, weird color use and bits of live action. Which might have been interesting under some circumstances, but only comes across as obnoxious combined with the vapid story carrying it all. Already from the first episode it's quite clear how Tatami Galaxy is going to end. The main character yearns for some imagined, idealized version of his university days while ignoring the attractive, very cool girl who is obviously into him, and depreciating the friends he does have. In other words, not something unhappy people can actually relate to, but an excuse for pretty much 10 episodes of the main character trying out different social environments, before he finally realizes his own stupidity. Of course, perhaps I'm wrong in taking it seriously, and all this might instead be an excuse for fun, but the humor is very repetitive. Not only because it's mostly the main character's constant, manic narration which really stops being amusing after an episode, never being particularly funny in the first place, but also because most of the silly situations and their two-dimensional characters are repeated in different ways, often leaving little room in each short episode for new things. Perhaps this is the reason it takes the main character so long to see the truth of his situation. 
 
There is a single word, I believe, which describes this anime perfectly, and sufficiently, though I'm a bit reluctant to use it because a lot of people tend to bring it up whenever something is ambitious at all. This is fairly ungood, because I love animes, or pieces of any kind of media that try to do something out of the ordinary. Tatami Galaxy on the other hand, truly is ""pretentious"". With its fancy animation, aimless literary references, crazy symbolism, purposeful yet irritating repetitions, and what have you, it certainly presumes a lot about itself, wants to be seen as different and smart, only to end the banal way it was obvious it would from the beginning, having done nothing sensible in the meantime. Tatami Galaxy is truly a case of much style and no substance.

          
 
       Helpful I don't think any other anime had the same instantaneous impact on me as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei did upon finishing the final episode. I also can't recall any other anime becoming one of my favourites so quickly.  
 
One of my absolute favourite aspects of the show is how the show is how the plot slowly unravels over the course of the show. One might say that this should be a basic storytelling requirement, but rarely is a piece of art able to accomplish this with the perfect pacing that Tatami Galaxy has. The way in which uses the plot device as a means of world-building is masterful; small, seemingly insignificant details pop-up in multiple timelines, and often transform into much bigger, considerably less insignificant details, which allows the world and the characters within it feel genuinely real. I found myself becoming more attached to these people than in any anime I've ever watched, aside from perhaps Hunter x Hunter, and the experience of realising this during the last episode made me tear up slightly. 
 
However, what's most interesting about this is how the creators were able to meticulously piece together this puzzle before the viewers eyes over the course of 11 episodes, while simultaneously moving the story along at breakneck speed. One possible flaw would be that reading the subtitles while taking in the events on screen is incredibly difficult, although I will say that my speed-reading skills improved significantly by the end. 
But this wasn't done without reason, as it accurately conveys the mentality of the protagonist, who drastically overthinks every decision he has to make; a flaw I assume most people can relate to (as the writers most likely realise).  
 
This anime's greatest achievement, though, would be the insane visuals. Never before have I seen a piece of animation with the level of visual storytelling of Tatami Galaxy. Most of the animation is used to represent the inner workings of the protagonists mind - visual metaphors are in abundance here. I don't think this show would be anywhere near as good without the the level of detail and love put into every second of the animation. I believe that for something to have god-tier animation, I should be able to understand the ideas and concepts without the sound turned on, and the show goes above and beyond this requirement. I'm sure I would be able to understand the ideas, concepts, plot and characters arcs with no sound or subtitles to guide me, simply through the genius-level direction of  Masaaki Yuata.  
 
As you can see, I have refrained from stating any of the aformentioned ideas and concepts, simply because (as someone who myself went in completely blind) I would say that part of my enjoyment of the series was discovering all of it myself as the show went on, and watching the mural unfold before my eyes without any knowledge of where it would go or which direction it would take. Never has a piece of art taught me so much about myself and many of the toxic mentality's that have held me back from enjoying the simpler joys of life, and given me the motivation to go out and do exactly that. Without a doubt, The Tatami Galaxy earns its place as one of the greatest anime of all time, and one of my own personal favourites ever.

The protagonist is a seventeen year old boy who transfers into the school and meets various major players on campus, such as the outlaw teacher, the soccer captain, and a childhood friend whom the protagonist has not seen for seven years. The school presents opportunities for friendship, love and conflict, and changes are now bound to happen in the main character's life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"Parodies are always a pleasure to watch, because we know that the authors themselves aren't serious at all. ""Gakuen Handsome"" wonderfully parodies the vast world of Boy's Love (BL or yaoi), exaggerating everything and taking the parody to a whole new level - from the art to the non-existing plot with ridiculous situations, and even adding references to poop. 
 
I first learned about BL parody when playing the BL parody game ""Kusoge"", featuring the same parody type (and ridiculously long chins) than ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
It was so funny that I searched for more BL parodies of this type, and I stumbled upon a walkthough of one of the ""Gakuen Handsome"" games by a Japanese YouTuber, and it was so good that I watched the entire thing, along with the two MVs of the official character songs that were as funny as the rest. 
 
I was so charmed by this unique and strange... thing, that I was overjoyed when an OVA was announced. 
So here is my review, though I don't really know if it can be called a review because the ""Gakuen Handsome"" franchise is so out of this world that it... it honestly can't be reviewed. But I'll try my best :> 
 
[Story & Characters] 
The plot of ""Gakuen Handsome"" parodies the undying scenario of the average naive young transfer student, entering a new school to be almost immediately surrounded by a harem of bishounen ready to die for him (thumbs up for the headmaster and his little sister pairing up to encourage him in his love life). 
All the situations were very funny, and ended up with such enormous nonsense that I laughed a lot. 
The characters, that remained just the way they were in the original games, are such enormous cliches that it's hilarious. The kind childhood friend, the dangerous young teacher, the serious class representative and the cold classmate, among others, were perfect in their respective roles. 
 
[Art] 
""Gakuen Handsome"" being... well, ""Gakuen Handsome"", you obviously can't expect much from this wonderful parody, and The Animation kept this same crappy Flash animation used in the previous games and MVs. The poor animation serving the non-existent plot is fully part of the enjoyment, along with the ridiculously pointy bishounen chins and the strange moves and dances that pop up for no reason at all. 
 
[Sound] 
Unfortunately, and at my despair, the production staff entirely recasted the voice actors, leaving behind the hilarious voice acting of the games (bye bye, Sakuya's voice that made me cry of laughter). Instead were, among others, the well-known voices of Hanae Natsuki (Kaneki Ken@Tokyo Ghoul, Arima Kousei@Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and Kahikara Tetsuya (Natsu Dragneel@Fairy Tail). 
The new seiyuu, being pros, did an excellent job with voice acting, but I feel that they made me laughed way less than in the games, because even there the voice acting sounded so unprofessional that it was used as a parody feature. 
In a way, I felt that the new cast was too professional for an unique license such as ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
About the rest of the sound - honestly, I was so focused on wondering what I was doing with my life that I didn't pay much attention to it. 
 
[Overall] 
I can safely say that I laughed way more with the original games than with ""Gakuen Handsome: The Animation"", especially because of the cast change for the anime. But it was still great to watch, and I recommend to every anime viewer who wants to have some fun and gently make fun of the BL genre. 
If you're interested in more things like this, I recommend the visual novel ""Kusoge"" (lit. ""shitty game) <3

(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"“At almost no point in that story did I feel any sympathy for you.” 
 
What I expected - Aggretsuko, male version. What I got - an unholy abomination made out of the body parts of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Bojack Horseman, and Happy Tree Friends. 
 
The eclectic nature of this show is most visible in its animation - one third traditional drawings, one third ugly-cute motion capture (the PV of the voice actors in facepaint posing for reference photos is what made me watch this in the first place), and one third surreal animation disasters reminiscent of the early 00s Newgrounds flash animations. 
 
“Surreal” is also the most suitable word to describe the comedy of this show. For example, many jokes rely on the contrast between the modern society veneer and the animal nature of the characters, but the exact degree of anthropomorphism is absurd and ill-defined. You’ve got your walking, talking, suit-wearing animals who go to work to have their watercooler conversations, and you’ve got non-talking animals kept as pets… but those also walk on two feet and wear clothes, and others can’t tell “pets” and “humans” apart. Those jokes didn’t really make me burst into laughter, but I was constantly kept in a state of anticipation, having no clue wtf would happen next. That’s not to imply the jokes are just “lol, random” - they are inherent to a story, have a structure and a point. Some of the better ones are elaborately set up over multiple scenes during an episode. 
 
7/10 for an anime that consciously tries to be “different”. 


          
 
       Helpful I came into Africa no Salaryman with almost no expectations, except maybe thinking it would be similar to Gaikotsu Shouten'in Honda-san, i.e. a down-to-earth slice of life work comedy. What I got out of it was quite possibly the wackiest and funniest comedy of the season, maybe even year that almost never fails to surprise me at how absurd it can be. While not every episode is balls to the wall madness, (the final episode for instance was surprisingly down to earth and normal), the majority of the series effortlessly juxtaposes relatable work life with nonsensical, almost non-sequitur comedy to the point of perfection. I always have a dumb grin on my face as I watch this, at times even pausing the video just to hold onto my laughter.  
 
It's great, saying more or spoiling any of the jokes kills the fun. Go watch it already. 
 
7/10 

          
 
       Helpful I expected this anime to be boring at first, but beginning with a beautiful landscape scene and sound like lion king in anime version were enough to make me want to watch this anime. 
If you are finding a slice of life/comedy anime, not too heavy plot that can make you cry but enough to make you laugh, then this is the right choice. 
Just don’t focus too much on art, it’s perfect with their jokes. 
 
There is no plot actually. It’s crazy enough to make animal to be a main character, but it’s more crazy when these three main characters do several kind of crazy things. Even side characters can make you laugh. 
 
In my opinion, sometimes it feels like they are trying so hard to make jokes tho. 
It gives you a Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou feeling in adult/salary man version with three male animal protagonists. (But Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is far more hilarious). 
 
Oh and there is also a perfect soothing/relaxing ending song ;D

Taka no Tsume, AKA Eagle Talon is something of a hit in Japan. It has numerous advertising tie-ins, and even as recent as this post, a theatrical movie starring the Justice League with a budget of 1,000,000(or maybe it was less than that) USD funded by a Yahoo Auction charity.  
 
The plot of this is as simple as a team of super-evil masterminds want to take over the world from their apartment complex. Unfortunately, that does not go well for them as their efforts are thwarted by the middle-aged super hero, Deluxe Bomber.  
The cast consists of Hitler, an AGP, the nutty professor, a child prodigy, and Phillip. Everything is done by the animator, Frogman, who voices the characters, does the music, all the animating, etc. I think in total, the series had a budget of about 1 USD. That's changed as Eagle Talon became more of a hit, as the voices are slightly different and the animation has gotten...better?  
 
If you like such classics such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, this anime is for you. It's pretty much the Japanese equivalent.

Ranze has yet to manifest her supernatural powers, and her parents are beginning to get worried she might be normal. So begins the fantasy romantic comedy story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Vampire']","15-year-old Ranze Eto lives in an isolated castle in Japan with her werewolf mother, vampire father, and younger brother, Rinze.  Despite her lineage, she has yet to demonstrate any special powers of her own, and her parents are worried she might be a normal girl.  One day, Ranze's innate power finally manifests itself when she, quite by accident, discovers that she can change herself into a carbon copy of any object she bites, whether it be a person or an inanimate object like a piece of bread, and can return to her normal self only by sneezing.  Her parents are overjoyed, but Ranze's new powers make it difficult to continue living life as a normal teenage girl.
On Ranze's first day at her new school in junior high, she meets and falls in love with the brash yet handsome young athlete, Shun Makabe. The chief problem with this is that Ranze's parents will not allow her to date a human - although there may be much more to Shun than meets the eye. On top of this, she also has a bitter rival in the pretty but spiteful Yoko Kamiya (the daughter of a yakuza boss) who also likes Shun and doesn't take kindly to Ranze's intruding on her turf.
","Tokimeki Tonight is not a well-known anime (which is why there are no reviews for it). It's fallen to the wayside since it finished airing 35 years ago. Is it fair or is there more to this series than what's on the surface? 
 
Story: 
If you ever wanted an anime version of the Addams Family with your typical shoujo clichés thrown in, this is the closest you're going to get.  
 
Due to the episodic nature of the series, don't expect any significant progress. Yes, even after the dramatic events of episodes 25 and 26, everything turns back to normal when the credits roll. Also, don't be surprised if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground. 
 
The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze's love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers. (More on that later!) 
 
Music: 
I was rather taken aback by the score on Tokimeki Tonight. The score was quite infectious, to the point that some of it played in my mind while I was trying to fall asleep. A special shout-out goes to the fighting music with the saxophone in it. 
 
Of course, the main draws are the OP and ED. I must admit, this is one of the few series where I liked the ED music more than the OP. However, both are quite catchy and memorable (in accordance with the law of 80s themes). 
 
Characters: 
While there's no character I like 100% of the time (outside of the shark in episode 32, which, trust me, makes sense in context), the main cast tends to be likable more often than not. 
 
However, there were some I couldn't bring myself to like, no matter how hard I tried. The rigidness of Ranze's mother made any scene she was in tough to digest. She wants Ranze to fall in love with a fellow monster and repeatedly tries to sabotage her romantic efforts with Makabe-kun. In fact, her rabid traditionalism even puts Ranze in danger in episode 13. 
 
Yoko, Ranze's rival in love, is a brat at best and downright treacherous at worst. However, I believe she was intentionally written to be unlikable. 
 
Recurring characters Sand and Prince Aaron are borderline predators and that ruined any enjoyment I could have had of them. 
 
Art: 
One of the most unusual aspects of Tokimeki Tonight is the background art. While the series presumably takes place in Japan, most of the signs are in English and the architecture has an old European flair to it. 
 
As for the rest of the art, it's par for the course for an anime made in the early 80s. There was obviously a limited budget, which explains why the coloring is often basic and there's a lack of detail in the character's faces (you'll notice several times throughout the show, characters are drawn without noses). I'm willing to let this fly, as the art isn't vomit-inducing and anime wasn't the most fruitful industry at the time. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Tokimeki Tonight is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's good. Some stories are entertaining, while others can be borderline snooze fests. Like most everything else with this series, my enjoyment was about abverage. 
 
Final thoughts: 
While not the worst anime I've seen (*cough* Blue Flames), it's understandable as to why this series fell to the wayside. It's a 7 at its best and it's a 3 at its worst. I honestly thought I would have more to see for this, but it's just-so average. It's an obvious 5. 
 
So, all in all, I give this series five glasses of tomato juice out of ten.

1.Havent watched the original series yet? : The ova feels exactly like the anime and lives up to the hopes of the fans. Therefore this high rating.

3. Liked season 1, love season 2 even more : The wait is over, you can probably rewatct it till they publish another few volumes and bring about a season 3. 
 
I've met people who liked the good old Oregairu part one and are put off by Zoku since things turned from being light hearted to intense. But then there are people who liked the show even more after Zoku. I obviously fall in the latter category.  
For those of you who liked season one over Zoku, this OVA won't be that memorable since it re-enact the feels from Zoku. Also, if you haven't watched the series and somehow stumbled upon this page and are wondering why everyone's giving it a 10 or so, the answer probably lies in the fact that people either absolutely love this anime or hate it. And since the release happened only yesterday probably the ones who disliked the show didn't bother to check out the OVA. 
Oregairu has always been a special anime for me. Also, since I just finished the OVA chances are that my opinions will be biased. But I don't even care about them being biased anymore since the mighty 8man and gang are back after almost an year.  
The story wasn't any deep, for those of you who aren't aware the 1st part of the OVA is a Canon and the second one isn't. The artwork was awesome as usual. The OVA completely retained the original style of the anime as mentioned by some other reviewers.

          
 
       Helpful 	As the release of Oregairu’s Volume 12 light novel is nowhere in sight, fans of this amazing series by Watari Wataru continue to thirst for any anime adaptation of what source material remains.  Luckily, for us, there’s volume 10.5 and this OVA covers this part of the light novels.  The wait has been gruelling, but as I burned through these 22 minutes, time passed awfully fast.  Does this short piece deliver on the heavy expectations of long-time fans? 
 
	Story (8/10): The events in Oregairu Zoku OVA happen in the midst of the second season.  As a summary, our amazing protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya, goes on a date with his kouhai, Isshiki Iroha, as she has requested weeks before, long forgotten in the main character’s memories.  The entire date is very enjoyable and is well adapted from the source material.  This enigmatic pairing has perhaps the best chemistry between Hachiman and a girl in the series because of the difference in behaviour that Iroha displays to him in contrast to her regular public image.  Their intriguing conversations have so many jabs and so much snarky wit embedded within them.  Hachiman and Iroha’s interactions carry the plotline for this OVA and make time pass incredibly quickly, a sign of an entertaining anime.   
 
         A portion of this episode is also taken by a hangout segment with the other two main girls, Yukino and Yui, and the cynical male.  This part lacks focus, as the evident lack of time can be seen by not adapting a different arc in volume 10.5.  They have replaced that slightly unnecessary section with an albeit filler 6 to 7 minutes, which brings down the story points marginally.  The ending photo is very satisfying however. 
 
	Art (8/10): Studio Feel does an amazing job with the art.  The visual quality in this OVA is comparable with the TV series or even better.  The style is very bright and polished.  Iroha looks amazing in this art style because of how bright her brown hair appears.  The backgrounds mainly comprise of standard urban scenes.  The main standouts are how beautiful the characters look.   
 
	Sound (8/10): The opening of this anime is my favourite of all time.  Yanagi Nagi is an amazing singer and the instrumentals are both uplifting and dramatic.  The chorus is incredibly catchy and the beginning hooks the viewer easily.  The buildup is effective in hyping up the viewer to the main portion with a fun drum roll.  Every part of the song is nearly perfect and even the lyrics relate very well to the anime’s overall message and theme (that of chasing one’s paths and ideals, pursuit of genuine relationships).  The soundtrack is the same as the TV anime, where some tracks may go unnoticed.  It has a few tracks that may stick out like the piano version of the opening, but the soundtrack itself is not spectacular.   
 
	Characters (10/10): The main character is my favourite character of any medium of all time.  Hachiman Hikigaya portrays the loner in such a way that it doesn’t alienate the viewer from his extreme viewpoint, yet easily relates his situations to the viewer.  Through the past two seasons, his deep character development and backstory along with the other main characters, Yui and Yukino, provide profound reasoning for how they act in the OVA.  Each character’s way of living makes sense through context, which makes each of these characters very likeable.  They all have individual, human flaws that make them endearing and a breath of fresh air from the standard anime cast.  
 
       From a superficial view, these characters look like cardboard cut-outs (Hachiman is an edgy self-insert harem lead, Yui is hot airhead, Yukino is generic kuudere jk), but they are given complex personalities that put them above the rest.  Iroha is also very interesting as a character.  She provides an interesting contrast between Komachi and her, where Hachiman’s little sister has a very cute and genuine personality and this other kouhai replicates the same personality type in a fake way.  The characters are all great. 
 
	Enjoyment (9/10): The date is remarkably enjoyable because of the shenanigans provided by it and the exceptional character interactions.  The OVA is mainly comedic or just slice of life because that is mainly the purpose of OVA type anime.  As explained by the story, this OVA episode definitely supplies any Oregairu fan with plenty of entertainment because anything of this amazing series is to be enjoyed.  When is volume 12? 
 
	Overall (8/10):  The Oregairu Zoku OVA is everything that the Oregairu fan wanted and possibly more.  After an unsatisfactory to the second season of the TV anime, anything decent involving more of Hachiman and co. is greatly appreciated.  Having a bit of source material left gives this OVA a good story and backbone for additional content and it delivers.  Although no OVA is spectacular or ground breaking, this one is still very enjoyable. 


          
 
       Helpful Somewhat of a mediocre OVA... which is strange because the first season's OVA was fantastic. 
 
This OVA does not continue the story of the second season but is rather a one-shot side story. It does not really advance the relationship of the characters  and does not reveal any important information, it's a bit more like the first season in that regard , given that it's mostly light hearted and flows pretty smoothly. 
 
However, the big flaw is that almost the entire run-time is dedicated to Hachiman and Iroha rather than Hachiman / Yuigahama / Yukinoshita. This is a massive downside to the OVA since Isshiki Iroha, love her or hate her, is not a main character, she became a strong supporting character in the second season but not strong enough to usurp most of the runtime of an OVA from the main cast. 
 
So I found myself struggling to complete this OVA. Not good, not recommended, can be easily skipped.

Art: The main focus of this series in terms of art is the female body. In this matter, this anime is great. The fluffiness of their bodies makes you believe that 2d girls are real. It makes you wish that every anime had cute teachers like these.  
Sound: The soundtrack is remarkable. When I remember a moment of the anime when a student is surprised by finding his teacher in a unusual situation, the soundtrack automatically starts playing in my mind. It is so well done and matches perfectly to the situations.  
Character: Each male protagonist has personality, not being too indecisive or naive. When the time arrives, they act as true males. As for the females, they all are perfect in their own way. The one I most liked is the teacher of the first arc, but I also liked the third one, even though i didn't like the 3rd arc itself, since I'm not a fan os shotacon. But in general they are all lovely and unique. 
Enjoyment: As I've said before, I applauded every episode, and laughed a lot. The comic situations constantly overcomes your expectations.  
Overall: This one of the best short ecchi animes ever produced. It is a must watch for any appreciator of ecchi anime.   

          
 
       Helpful SPOILER FREE. Not that it matters. 
You jerked off to this. A full-screen censored anime about a boy groping his teacher. I don't normally watch ecchi, but was in the mood to watch seasonal anime and figured ""ah screw it, no one's home anyways."" Big mistake. The art is good, save for some weird facial expressions and character designs (namely the mother of Satou. Oh my GOD she's ugly.) Sure, the love between the two was ""cute"" towards the end, if you're even generous enough to give it THAT, but need I remind you that the ""love"" they feel is from accidentally ending up in scandalous situations out of nowhere? Not to mention I had NO clue who the hell these people were until, well, their episodes were done. By the time I even felt REMOTELY invested, a new teacher and student were groping it up together somewhere else entirely. I don't know if the first couple will reappear at any point in time, because I haven't read the source material (and will not be doing so at any point in time, ever.) No, I don't care about some ugly dude and a teacher that sounds like a 12 year old. No, I don't want to know why these adult women are trying to bang high school boys. No, I did not want to watch a teacher take her medicine. No, I can't recommend Nande Koko ni Sensei ga!? There's simply too much wrong with it for me to even attempt to dig in any further into this hellhole of a show. If you need some *weird* show to get off to, I don't know, go for it I guess, but I wouldn't recommend this show for anyone who actually cares about character development and a decent love story.

          
 
       Helpful This show is basically unwatchable in it's censored state. As such I'd rate it a solid 3 to a light 4 carried solely by the promise of fully uncensored goodness to come.  
 
The characters, though they are all either students or teachers, have a nice variety of personalities, which makes it easy for the viewer to find one or more pairs that they like. Unfortunately they aren't all developed equally, but it is enough to enjoy the sexy times.  
 
The art is passable for an ecchi, borderline hentai, show; It's decent during the sexy scenes and bearable everywhere else. I'd highly recommend anyone who was disappointed by the censoring or somewhat lackluster art to read the manga as it is fully uncensored and beautifully drawn. 
 
Overall I had a fairly enjoyable experience watching this show, though that was in part due to discovering the manga while watching it, and not the anime adaptation itself. To anyone interested in watching this show I'd recommend waiting for the uncensored Blu-Rays and just reading the manga in the meantime. 
 
EDIT: Uncensored Blu-Rays are out and they are great. Highly recommend watching this show now in its uncensored form.

Instead of moving up in the world, the girls are more interested in getting closer to the guys in the gang! 
 
Of course, some of the boys are totally oblivious to the romantic intentions of their female friends. That's to be expected in a group of dim-wits and misfits. Nonetheless, the femmes of Class F aren't giving up anytime soon. Because when love is on the line, even the biggest underachievers can find motivation – even if they can't spell it! 
 
(Source: Rightstuf)","['Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Romance', 'School']","
Baka and Test takes place at a fictitious preparatory school called Fumizuki Academy in Japan, said to implement ""the finest and most unique systems."" Its students are rigidly divided into classes based on their results in an entrance exam. Class A contains the highest scoring students, while Class F contains the lowest scoring students. In addition to this, the classes are given different perks and equipment based on this division. The higher the class, the better the benefits; Class A is filled with prestigious items like air conditioners, fancy seats, laptops, a free snack bar, etc. Meanwhile, Class F is forced to work in a dusty, broken classroom with mats and low wooden tables.
Additionally, Fumizuki Academy has a special system whereby all students are able to call forth Summoned Beings (Shōkanjū, or ""Avatars"" in the official English translation.) These Beings are able to fight when a teacher gives their approval - their strength depends on their most recent test scores in the approving teacher's subject (i.e. Math, History, etc.) The Being will lose points when struck by an opponent, and should their score reach zero, they are disqualified and must take remedial classes with the strict Soichi Nishimura, (nicknamed ""Iron Man"") which the students dread. If a student is able to leave the battle without their points reaching zero, they can take a supplemental exam to replenish their score, and return to battle. The primary function of these battles is the ""Summoner Test War,"" where two classes fight with their Beings. The war ends when one class's Representative, the highest scoring student in the class, is defeated in a battle. If a lower ranked class is able to defeat a higher ranked class, they have the option to switch classroom facilities, giving the lower ranked classes a chance to prove themselves and earn better equipment.
On the day of the placement test, Mizuki Himeji suffers from a fever and cannot complete it, and is thus given a score of zero, despite her intelligence. She is put into Class F, alongside the rest of the main characters - Akihisa Yoshii (the titular baka), Yuuji Sakamoto (the class representative), Hideyoshi Kinoshita (the bishōnen actor), Kouta Tsuchiya (the perverted photographer, sometimes known as Silent Ninja Pervert, Muttsurīni) and Minami Shimada (a transfer student from Germany who cannot read kanji.)
Akihisa is frustrated by the school's decision to place Himeji in Class F, believing she should've been given another chance at the placement test. He speaks to Yuuji, who also feels unfairly treated by the school's rigid system. They vow to prove to everyone that there's more to life than just test scores by taking down Class A and taking their classroom for themselves. This results in several Summoner Test Wars against higher-ranked classes. The show also loosely follows the love triangle consisting of Minami, Himeji and Akihisa, their crush. Meanwhile, Yuuji is targeted by Shouko Kirishima, a Yandere Class A student who fell in love with Yuuji when they were children.
","I'm going to go ahead and say it. Baka and Test is DEFINITELY my favorite anime. Tons of colorful characters, comedy, and story.  
 
Season 2 was mostly about character development rather than keeping up with the story, but that's not a bad thing. Some shows don't do character development without terrible terrible filler. Some don't at all! 
 
Story: 10  
Season 2 focused more on developing the characters through individual stories than one full story throughout the season, BUT they did it right. Baka and Test Shokanjuu Ni incorporates excellent use of story arcs within it's episodes to keep the audience from that ""filler"" feeling. From crazy beach days, to Minami's backstory, to peeking into girls' bathing rooms, this season took it around and back. 
 
Art: 10 
Once again the animation is amazing. It retains that manga feel to it with it's ""pop-art"" look. The movement of the characters is smooth, and the detailed and whacky expressions of the characters in ""extreme"" times for them really show us what the animators can do.  
 
Sound: 10 
The voice acting in this season (I'm referring to the Japanese voice acting) is greatly improved from the first. It's much more believable and adds a whole lot to the humor. As for the English Dub, it's not set to release until early 2013, but fingers crossed for it to be just as good or better than the fantastic first season. To go along with great voice acting, season 2 adds a whole new soundtrack of music to play through the series, ranging from epic battle themes to soft romantic jingles. 
 
Character: 10 
You gotta love it when writers dedicate time to letting the audience know about a show's characters, without giving you a filler feeling. In the first season you got a feel of who the characters were and a general understanding. In this season you get a full on background check on several characters, and their motives to do what they do. As always we have a wonderful variety of characters in personality and looks, always a pleasure to watch. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
YES. If I wasn't entitled to write more for the sake of potential viewers that's all I'd write. Simply yes, I enjoyed it. Take time to understand the systems in the show and what's going on and who the characters are, I admit it can be random, but once you get a feel for who is who and what is what, you'll love the show to no end. (To be honest its really not that hard, but I've known people who don't even try). There's also so many characters in this show, you're bound to relate to one of them and say ""Hey that's me!"" and put yourself in their world if only for a minute.  
 
Overall 10: 
WATCH IT. Watch it, enjoy it, and don't read online reviews from critics that don't enjoy a show for what it is, and instead pick it apart by flaws that don't matter in the long run. (Just look at Pokemon -__-)  
 
I don't recommend it if you don't like to laugh. (Ha) 
 
It's a nice blend of action, highschool life, just the right amount of fan-service (nothing over the top), comedy, and more all in its own unique way! 
 
Here's hoping for a 3rd season and more, just get it marketed damn it! :D 
 


          
 
       Helpful This anime is pretty average (or below average) in all aspects, but it manages to somehow be charming enough that it no longer matters whether the technicalities are good or not. Somehow, it's refreshing and funny in a way that's difficult for shows nowadays.  
 
To begin with, this season has even less of a story than season one. At least in season one, there was somewhat of a point to what was happening and some sort of build up and climax. In this season, it's become short story arcs, each one spanning over a couple of episodes. Somehow, the lack of an overarching plot (other than the overly cliche romance) didn't make it boring. It was still fun and engaging without occupying my mind for the whole day. It was laid back, to say the least.  
 
The art was nothing special. I really liked the popart shadows, but other than that, everything was pretty average and simple. Nevertheless, it was appealing to the eye because it was bright and fun to look at.  
 
The sound was also nothing special, though the special effects noises and the gag background music were a special treat.  
 
The characters were pretty cliche, but there are some things I appreciated. I loved the character development between Shouko and Yugi. Even if Aki wasn't as developed, he was still a fun main character mainly because he's unfathomably dumb. Also makes him pretty relatable. ;D I liked the character development with Minami as well, but all the other characters remained as flat stereotypes for the most part, even if that was a little fun to watch still.  
 
I think the main selling point of this series was the interactions of the characters. Their dynamic and the way the plot is constructed around them really made the monumental difference in this being a success or failure. 
 
In the end, I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would. I'm not sure what made me want to pick this up (it really isn't my type of show) but I'm really glad I did!  
 
I would recommend this if you: would like to see a stupid version of Assassination Classroom, like dumb characters, like the idea of harems, don't mind repetitive jokes, like running gag jokes, think oblivious characters are funny 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: require variety in your comedy, prefer intellectual jokes, don't like running gags/repetitive humor, prefer satire 
 
Have a great day everyone!

","As a rare duck around here, a soon to be 50 year old male who enjoys slice of life anime, I found Maria-sama ga Miteru to have been absolutely charming and delightful, and easily the best series I've watched in all of 2008. The calm, serene, languid pace of the series and its setting at an all-girl's Catholic school made it easy to relax with, but it's the wealth of the show's characters, each with their own distinct and unique personality increased my overall enjoyment and is the highlight of the show. As you watch the show, you can't help becoming involved in the lives of Yumi, Sachiko and all the rest of the girls at Lillian as they develop those very special bonds of friendship, and how those friendships stand tall and strong through good times and bad. MariMite is just the sort of show that anime fans of any and every stripe can enjoy.

          
 
       Helpful This review covers the entire series, which consists of four seasons.  The style and quality are reasonably consistent throughout the series, so separate reviews for each season would be largely redundant. 
 
""Maria-sama ga Miteru"" is unique and fascinating in many ways.  It has many layers of meaning, and it lends itself well to critical analysis and repeated viewings.  This series is not likely to appeal to everybody.  It is slow-moving, emotional, and highly melodramatic at times.  It is also designed for a female demographic, so although I am sure men can enjoy it, it lacks the fan service and overt sexuality that appeal to a certain subset of the male demographic.  However, anyone who enjoys coming of age stories, deep and detailed characterization, and compelling cultural commentary should consider watching this series. 
 
The multiple themes and layers of meaning appeal to me, for they encourage my analytical tendencies.  Given the nature of this series and my tendency to analyze everything, this review will devolve into lengthy critical analysis, so be warned.  However, those who read through it might find the first few episodes a little easier to follow. 
 
From the very first episode, ""Maria-sama ga Miteru"" is a study of hierarchical societies.  Japanese society is well known for being hierarchical, and standard forms of hierarchy are inevitably present in school-based anime series.  The girls' school here, however, has its own unique system of hierarchy, evident both in language and character behavior, so it is likely to cause its viewers, even Japanese viewers, to notice and ponder the nature of hierarchy.  In language, the most noticeable difference between this series and others is in the use of honorifics; students use the honorific -sama instead of -senpai when referring to upperclassmen.  The usage of this rather formal honorific in Japan is somewhat problematic, and it can be considered rude or patronizing when used inappropriately.  It would not ordinarily be used as the characters use it in this series.  Even the standard greeting the students use, Gokigenyou, is archaic and formal.  The student council members have grandiose titles as the Lady Roses, and most students refer to them by their titles - Rosa Chinensis, Rosa Gigantea, and Rosa Foetida - rather than their names; this usage places them in an exalted and unapproachable position.  The use of polite honorifics, archaic language, and grandiose titles serves to highlight and exaggerate the system of hierarchy.  However, not every character perfectly follows the rules, and whether or not a character or a pair of friends follows the language rules is an important point in characterization and can be a source of conflict.  Noriko, a character introduced in the second season, is quite interesting in this regard. 
 
The development of deep friendships is another major theme in this series, and it is the central driving force behind the story arcs.  These friendships are encouraged by the sœur system, a system in which an upperclassman and an underclassman declare a relationship as sisters.  (Sœur is French for sister.)  This is fundamentally a hierarchical relationship, for the older sister, the onee-sama, is expected to provide guidance to her younger sister.  The sœur relationships involving the student council are particularly important, for the younger sisters of the Lady Roses, the boutons, also have a strong role on the council.  These relationships become extremely close, and in fact can come so close to actual romance that it is easy to read a lesbian subtext into the relationships despite the fact that only one main character is overtly lesbian.  Since such close relationships cross the hierarchical boundary between underclassmen and upperclassmen, they effectively destabilize the hierarchy, creating a fascinating conflict within the narrative.  The sœur relationships also occur across class lines.  This is an elite Catholic school, so all of the students are likely to be affluent, but some are merely well off, while others are filthy rich.  The relationship between Yumi and Sachiko effectively explores such class differences, and their friendship allows each to explore the other's world in ways that would ordinarily be impossible. 
 
The march of time is another important theme, and the constant progress of time allows the characters and their relationships to develop and grow.  High school is a time of transition; people aren't there forever, and unlike some school series, ""Maria-sama ga Miteru"" does not sweep time under the rug.  The episodes are mostly (but not always) in chronological order, and there are some flashbacks.  The first season sets the groundwork for a major transition to come in the second, and the fourth season similarly prepares the viewer for changes to come afterwards.  (A fifth season has so far not been produced, but the light novels continue the story beyond the fourth season.)  Yumi's growth as a character is handled well throughout the series; she starts as a wide-eyed innocent girl who lacks confidence in herself, and by the end of the fourth season, she has gone through many changes.  (To prevent spoilers, I will leave out the details.)  Even melodramatic story arcs, such as the coincidence-filled story ending the second season, help to develop the characters and to aid the passage of time.  This is one series that can get away with melodrama, for the characters are strong enough to make it through exaggerated plot lines unscathed. 
 
Though the story and characterization are the greatest strengths of this series, the art and music deserve a few words, for they contribute greatly to its unique and exotic style.  The character designs are more detailed than is typical for school anime series, and they are beautifully executed.  The backgrounds are soft and perhaps a little stylized, but also highly detailed, and they set up a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  As is usually the case in this era of limited budgets, animation is sometimes rough, and designs and quality are a little inconsistent from episode to episode, but these flaws are minor compared to the strengths of the series.  The music deviates from the usual pop conventions of anime; it is classical in style, and it perfectly fits the elegant atmosphere and culture of this elite school.  The closing theme of the third season and the opening and closing themes of the fourth season deviate from this style and instead conform to pop conventions.  While these themes aren't bad in and of themselves, they don't quite fit the atmosphere of the series.  The voice actresses are all excellent, and the voices fit the characters well. 
 
One could probably guess that, since I have taken the time to write such an extensive review and analysis, I love this series.  I certainly do, and I rank it as a strong favorite among the anime series I have seen so far, and it is a favorite even within the broad category of serialized programming - anime, TV series, radio series, and film serials.  The attention to detail, the strong characters, the beautiful setting, and the relaxed atmosphere all contribute to my enjoyment of this series.  Again, it may not appeal to everybody, but people looking for the qualities that have attracted me to it may also enjoy it, and perhaps a few will rank it among their favorites. 
 
Now, I'm hoping for an eventual fifth season or group of OVAs to finish the story, but it has been a few years since the last installment, so my wish might never come true. 


          
 
       Helpful Story: 
The story was interesting and intriguing especially the first episodes. It's interesting to see how the relationships between the girls in Lillian develop and their bonds become stronger. Also their innocent and platonic relationships are interesting as well as mysterious or even confusing. The most interesting part was the main story which was about Yumi and Sachiko and their relationship. Actually the first season it mostly about how Yumi feels really insecure as Sachiko's petit soeur and about how Sachiko feels confused with Yumi's behavior. Generally, after the first part and some few other short stories, the series revolve around the event of St.Valentine's day. It can get a bit more dramatic than what it actually would in most cases in real life, but that's what makes interesting, at least in my opinion, because I have always enjoyed drama. 
Art: 
The art was really elegant yet it followed the stereotypes of shoujo ai manga, the protagonist has big eyes, looks kind of childish on the contrary to the co-protagonist who is mature looking, tall and slightly cold. Other than that, since this anime so new, the background art is not really outstanding as we can see in most anime since 2010 or so.  
Sound:  
Well, what I liked mostly about the sound was the opening. I also have to mention the seiyuus, I think every voice suited the characters. The music is elegant and calm according to the atmosphere of the series. 
Character: 
The best part of the series, I believe, was the characters, especially Yumi and Sachiko, their personality is well developed. As I mentioned earlier, Yumi is a very insecure character, Sachiko is gets easily irritated and is kind of bossy. Her personalities are just so contradictory so lots of misunderstandings take place and both girls usually make them seem a lot worse than they actually are, which kind of proves how much they care about each other. It's their opposite personalities what causes so many problems in their ""romantic friendship"" however that fact is also what makes them like each other as they do, and they are really admirable. 
Enjoyment:  
I really enjoyed this show, it was really deep, it was sentimental and dramatic, it showed really intense feelings, so much that when thinking about them I could slightly understand how the characters felt.

I think it is nice to see how far we have come when it comes to anime though, and I have no reason to rate it bad it's more like watching something interesting because its from 1905. The main problem I had which is probably because it is so old is how the colors were changing from yellow and blue. It would be really awesome if a company, or a fan picked this old historical short film up and created a remastered version it'd probably be really cool for historical otaku such as myself.

          
 
       Helpful Considering this was made in 1917 before television existed and in the very early days of film, eleven years before Steam Boat Willy came out and is considered by many to be the very first anime ever created, I feel that it deserves at least an average score of 7.  
 
The animator literally drew every single frame by himself and put them together. It has elements of comedy and action and that is why I am giving this anime a 10/10.  
 
I found the comedy to be particularly delightful. In the anime we see the 'hero' go to a swordsmith called ""The Dull Sword"" and it is implied that both the sword and it's owner are very dull.

          
 
       Helpful I am baffled at the score this animation has received. 
 
Yes, it may not have the most grabbing story. But this is practically the first ever anime- and one of the first ever animations in general! The amount of effort this must have taken is incredible, and not a single frame is lacking in movement. Not to mention that there was literally nothing that came before it of its kind, you cannot judge something like that on the standards of today. It is like saying that cave paintings all suck because they aren't as good as something like the Renaissance artists. Without cave paintings and other forms of art in that age, it is doubtful that the renaissance artwork would have developed, as it is back then where art began to emerge! It is a similar situation here. 
 
This was an animation that helped spur on this beautiful era of cartoons and anime. 
 
This is a piece of history.

Each subsequent chapter follows Lucius facing some sort of a problem, just to be swept to Japan once again. He visits modern bath houses, personal baths, waterparks, fertility festivals, and even zoos. There, he always happens to find the inspiration to solve the exact problem he has been tasked with.
","I am not sure where to start my review for this one. The storyline compares and contrasts Japan and ancient Rome in regards to their bath culture. I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did.

I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me. 
 
Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time. 
 
I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. 

          
 
       Helpful _Thermae Romae_ is very much a one-note gimmick anime, from its basic plot style to its animation-style and Lucius's hilarious reactions to everything (I'd call the series a bit like _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ or _Yakitate! Japan_), but it suits me at the moment, and the historical accuracy is sufficient to not bother me. Really, where else are you going to get any thing like this sort of historical fantasy but anime? The diversity and weird gems like TR is one of the reasons I love anime.

Ok, enough of that before I get accuse of trolling, what we have here is the 2nd season of the parent anime ""Utapri,' so far only a few things have change but the anime as a whole still focuses on the musical genre, so how did I rate every category of this anime? Here's how: 
 
 
Story: Fair 6, I need you....S.... 
 
I would have given it a 5, but due to some minor yet nice changes this part should be fair enough. 
 
 
Art: Good 7, I feel you....T.... 
 
Let's face it, in this anime the art is on the character's sense of fashion, though it good, it was to elaborate and elegant for a commoner like me to comprehend. 
 
Sound: Very Good 8, I kiss you ...R... 
 
Like I said, this anime is more on the musical genre so therefore the plot is only an added bonus, and I mast say I like all the songs in this anime and so as the seiyuu's who sung it. I also like Nanami's seiyuu as well and Shinning Saotome's over exaggerated tone. 
 
Character: Good 7 , I believe you....I.. 
 
Ok, Nanami maybe the driving force of STARISH, but it was the guys who has the most contribution with this anime's feature, though I could have given this  part a 5, it was the introduction of Cecil Aijima that has added to the flair of the group. There is also the Sempais; Ranmaru Kurosaki,Ai Mikaze ,Reiji Kotobuki and Camus as well as the ""Heavens"", Ēichi Ōtori , Nagi Mikado and Kira Sumeragi who seem to be just a bunch of pretty face that were added for additional antagonist of the protagonist, We're Heaven,  Yes We're Heavens. 
 
Enjoyment: Very Good 8 ,  I hold you... S... 
 
Not bad for an otome game to have a 2nd season, though the plot is lackluster, it was the songs that carry this anime's enjoyment. 
 
Overall: Great 9,   I want you... H...  
 
Though there are some predictability in this anime, studio A1 did a good job on this anime's songs and episode theme, the end.

       Helpful UtaPri2 leaves UtaPri1 in its DUST. 
 
I remember UtaPri1 being a little hard to follow - you were immediately launched into the story, there were colourful bishies everywhere (making things a little harder to concentrate) and characters were difficult to keep up with (I always got Masato and Tokiya mixed up). But as UtaPri1 came to an end, I kind of wanted to watch more. 
 
I found UtaPri2 to be mindblowingly brilliant. From the first to last episode, I really enjoyed it. There's at least one episode dedicated to each member of STARISH; the storyline is a lot more gripping; character development is much improved; the animation is bright, cheery and colourful; and most of the songs are plain awesome. Especially the OP. (In my opinion, best OP EVER. It's fabulous. OHMYDAYS I LOVE IT. If you haven't watched the anime yet, go watch this OP.) I also found a lot of it to be very, very funny (and it takes a lot for me to laugh at an anime). 
 
A little more on character development - the talented, bright-eyed, slightly emotional, slightly ditzy, majorly airheaded heroine doesn't change all that much - one thing I've noticed with this season is that she becomes a lot more confident, and is no longer afraid to put her foot down and stand up for herself. As for the bishies in this reverse-harem, we all see a load more of character development from them all, but I don't want to spoil anything. 
 
All in all, it's a very happy anime. It has its cheesy moments, but what's a good anime without them? If you don't like bishies, bright colours, musicals, reverse-harem, or otome-to-anime-adaptions, this anime is not for you. 
 
But even if it's not - you should know that the battle of the bands arc at the end is AMAZING. I still have the chills. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
OVERALL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
STORY: 9/10: I liked the storyline a lot! Much improved from season one. 
 
ART: 9/10: The art is very colourful and well-thought-out, and many of the character's outfits have a lot of interesting details. 
 
SOUND: 10/10: The OP. I never skipped it. Not even once. As for the rest of the songs, we see a variety of genres spanning the series, and I'm sure at least one of them will appeal to your tastes. 
 
CHARACTER: 8/10: Again, the character development was very well done; however, nearly all personalities are a little cliché to that of your typical reverse-harem, otome-to-anime-adaption, shoujo anime. But for an otome-to-anime adaption, character development was really good. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 8/10: What can I say? I love bishies, bishies being kawaii, bishies being hilarious, bishies singing beautifully, bishies being passionate and bishies wearing colourful pretty things. 
I Am Sane. 
Seriously though. I really love this season. The funny moments, the music, the characters all made it explode into a happy pulse (you'll get that last bit when/if you watch all 13 episodes.) 
 
OVERALL: 10/10: TEN! (Are you ready?) NINE! (Are you ready?) EIGHT! (Are you ready?) SEVEN! SIX! FIVE! (Are you ready?) FOUR! (Are you ready?) THREE! (Are you ready?) TWO! ONE! 
 
... ... ... Yeah, I kinda liked it.

          
 
       Helpful ""The award for cheesiest anime ever goes to Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love 2000%."" 
 
STORY: 
The story of the first season was pretty straight-forward, while this season has a bit more going on at a time. I felt that this season was a lot more exciting and had more to offer story-wise. It definitely helps that they give you a better look into the guys' lives by having them deal with their various jobs based on their specialties(acting, modeling, etc), and having them overcome their problems. I felt it focuses a bit more on the guys than Haruka, than season 1 did, but maybe that's just me. 
If you love the cheesiness of the anime...  you will absolutely LOVE the ending. It's the cheesiest thing ever to be thought of by humankind. 
 
ART: 
The art of UtaPri is always beautiful and colorful. Not only the colors, but even just the shapes are beautiful. I really quite love how they draw the males in particular, because they aren't too girly or too manly. Their eyes aren't too big or too small. Their faces are nice and shapely, without being too detailed/manly. They're just perfect to me. 
The one thing that bothers me(and probably many others), is Haruka's eyes. They are boringly generic and too big/wide in shape compared to the guys, but the colors... I wonder what made them think that neon puke-green and laser-lemon yellow would look ok on someone's iris... Well, at least it's... unique? I quite like how her hair is not quite pink, and not quite orange... More like a neon salmon color? 
I do find the blond hair colors in this anime to be too yellow, well, unless they are supposed to be yellow rather than blond. 
I'm quite fond of Tokiya's hair. That subtle indigo color is really one of my favorites for hair. 
Also note, there are a LOT of sparkles and ""glitter"" effects in this anime. That either makes a scene look beautiful, or makes it look corny, or a mix of both. 
 
SOUND: 
Of all of the music-oriented anime I have watched, UtaPri has the most songs on my playlist. They are genuinely catchy and well-made. Naturally, the lyrics are cheesy, but hey, it sounds GOOD, and that's all that matters to me. The opening to both season 1 and 2 are both wonderful, with vocals done by Tokiya's sexy and incredibly-talented voice actor, Mamoru Miyano.  
All of the characters' voices are beautiful in song and have their own unique sound to them so none of them sound the same and you can tell who's singing what line. I definitely prefer Shou's voice when he sings in softer tone, than the usual cheerful tone, though. 
I personally quite like how Tokiya's and Masato's voice sound together in the ending theme. 
If you love vocal music, you will probably LOVE the music in this. The singing skills of the voice actors are incredible. 
 
CHARACTER: 
The only reason I did not rate this 10, was because of Haruka's boringness and passiveness. I'm also not fond of her high-pitched falsetto voice.  
Of course, that isn't enough to keep me from enjoying this anime. The personalities of all the male characters more than balances it out. 
One thing I like about the males, is that they aren't 100% stereotypical tropes from every anime. They are mixes of different tropes and might have subtle bits of this or that personality, and best of all, they compliment each other. One thing I like about Utapri that most other otome genre anime lacks, is that the guys actually interact with each other... they get along with each other and become close friends, or they compete and have rivalries. At the same time, there are some that do have their conflicts with each other, such as Ren and Masato, and that gives them a pretty deep character development, or as deep as Otome candidates can get. 
The heroine is not stealing all of their attention 100% of the time, and she's more like a supporting character or friend to the guys, but also not cast aside as she has very important roles. I think that's one of the things that makes a typically boring heroine enjoyable/bearable in an otome anime, so you can't completely hate her. 
The addition of a new band member also adds excitement as we learn about him and what he must face, along with how he will interact with others(he was in the first season, but had never met the guys until now). 
Along with the new band member, there are also the 4 new characters who act as the bands' mentors. I couldn't really get a taste for the two taller ones as they felt too similar personality-wise to each other, but I really loved the shorter two, especially Mikaze(though they do not reveal his uhh secret in the anime, but you may have guessed it if you notice how he talks). 
Also, just like in season 1, the headmaster voiced by Norio Wakamoto is in this series. He is as flamboyant as he was in season 1, so that keeps the series as fabulous, if not more, than season 1. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I gave this a 10 because, well, it was enjoyable. I loved every minute of every episode, and there were some times where I could not stop laughing due to the pure cheesiness of it all. Even when there wasn't anything particularly funny or cheesy going on, it was always exciting and had something happening. I enjoyed it all, both the serious and funny moments. The music is really exciting to watch in the anime as well. 
I actually liked this a lot more than the first season. The character development goes on and beyond, and the guys even get jobs and struggle with their past or whatever. 
 
OVERALL: 
I definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a light-hearted and fun anime, even guys may find they enjoy it at least for the character development, music, or even just to make fun of the cheesy humor.

10,32648,22,7.344785559974851,Campus romatic comedy,Handa-kun,"Hated by everyone around him, Sei Handa goes about his high school life regarded as an outcast—or at least that's what he believes. In reality, Sei is the most popular student on campus, revered by all for his incomparable calligraphy skills, good looks, and cool personality. However, due an endless series of misunderstandings, Handa perceives the worship he receives from his legions of fans as bullying, leading the school's idol to shut himself off from the rest of his classmates. 
 
But distancing himself from his peers doesn't deter them from adoring him; in fact, his attempts at drawing attention away from himself often end up unintentionally converting even the most skeptical of students into believers. Fashion models, shut-in delinquents, obsessive fangirls, and more—none can stand against the brilliance that is Sei Handa. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']","Seishu Handa is a professional calligrapher, despite his young age. When the elderly curator of an exhibition criticizes his calligraphy for being too unoriginal (""like a textbook""), Seishu gets angry and punches him. Because of this, his father sends him off for a retreat on Goto Island, near Kyushu. There, he meets the colorful villagers, interacts with them, and begins to find his own style.
The title of the series means ""energetic/cheerful one"" in the local provincial Goto Islands' dialect. The first episode is also called ""Barakakodon/ばらかこどん"" which means ""energetic/cheerful kid"", which refers to Naru Kotoishi, a very hyperactive kid that comes into Handa's life.
The story of prequel spin-off Handa-kun is about the hilarious high school days of the calligraphy genius, Seishu Handa, who was also protagonist of Barakamon.
","Handa-kun has a problem...and no, not just Sei Handa's problem of misunderstandings of his classmates...as in the anime has a problem AS well as Sei Handa's problem of misunderstandings of his classmates. Here's LA's beef with Handa-kun... 
 
For what a good-meta first episode of the Handa Force gave LA, Handa-kun quickly turned into a repetitive comedy anime without a reason to watch Handa-kun other than seeing the same thing happen to Handa-kun and the Handa Force and EVERY OTHER CAST MEMBER getting misunderstood sans Yuki Kondou and really the first episode essentially told LA further down the line what kind of anime this was gonna be, Handa Force having almost 80% screentime with Handa himself having 20% from the anime itself...ohhh boy...this is gonna be a sit...let's get to one of LA's grips about Handa-kun. 
 
So who's the Handa Force?...they are Reo Nikaidou voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara a classmate of Handa and the fashionista and model, Akane Tsutsui voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya a delinquent and another classmate of Handa, Junichi Aizawa voiced by Yuuya Hirose the smart guy and another classmate of Handa and finally Yukio Kondou voiced by Daiki Yamashita, the only genre savvy guy who doesn't say much besides the obvious in his head (but that doesn't help much due to the paranoid misunderstandings of Handa-kun and the obliviousness of Handa Force in general even when Yukio speaks up), an audience surrogate of sorts. At first their introductory episodes of each of these characters were fine, until they finally formed Handa Force and continuously misunderstood Handa (though even in their intro episodes, ALL OF THEM sans Yukio misunderstands to get them to love Handa and eventually stalk him). Why are they grating on LA?...because they are one of the major causes to the ""misunderstanding"" to the entirety of Handa-kun's comedy. Yes LA knows that Takao Kawafuji voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu is the one who initiated this onto Handa but the Handa Force are the ones who misinterpret Handa's actions or words EVERY SINGLE TIME.  
 
Sure Handa himself misunderstands ALOT but the Handa Force are the ones that reinforce the repetitive misunderstandings that get out of control of Handa's hands. Here's the thing, this is Handa's prequel anime to Barakamon as to how he became like he did in Barakamon and although we quickly see how Handa became how he is...Handa-kun doesn't feel like Handa's prequel backstory...it's nothing but a repetitive comedy anime of misunderstanding situations where Handa is the reactant to most of the things that occurs and Handa is not in the forefront of the anime...the Handa Force is...IT'S EVEN SHOWN IN THE ANIME POSTER!!!. For a prequel comedy anime, Handa-kun could have been another good Sakamoto desu ga?, what with the central character being the ""centre of attention"" and causes most of the comedy, but Handa-kun is huge miss in that kind of direction because as much as Handa Force likes to think that Handa is the centre of attention, it's easily overshadowed by the Handa Force themselves and them doing the same repetitive misunderstanding comedic skits EVERY SINGLE EPISODE...it becomes annoying and it got to the point LA started HATING on the Handa Force much like Handa did. If there was ANY character LA liked...it was the librarian character voiced by Rie Kugimiya but she quickly got replaced by the genre savvy Yukio Kondou from the Handa Force by default.  
 
Handa-kun could have jumped the chasm of repetitive comedic skits that got old fast, but IT could have, with either ACTUALLY went into a bit more detail on Handa's backstory or went batshit crazy non-repetitive formula anime like Sakamoto desu ga? did...LA continued to watch it just for something new and that came rarely. 
 
Really Handa-kun's biggest sin it did even for the fact it's suppose to be a COMEDY was becoming boring to watch with it's repetitive running gags and nearly every single character misunderstanding things INCLUDING Handa himself. Sakamoto desu ga? works as he works as he is the catalyst of his batshit crazy antics and methods for the other characters to bounce off of and be reactants to Sakamoto's antics, Handa-kun is the exact opposite, the supporting cast are the catalyst and THEY do the crazy misunderstanding skits and Handa is the one who reacts to himself and then the supporting cast have to bounce off THEMSELVES and be the reactants once again, the flow of comedy ends with Handa all due the misunderstanding and his shyness and doing this routine over and over and over and over again is what makes the comedy stale VERY quickly. The second biggest sin is that as LA watched Handa-kun, it made LA question as to whether Sei Handa from Barakamon was ever a genuine and investable character to begin with if his backstory almost literally has him at the whims to his own misunderstandings, his shyness and little backstory shown in his highschool days to get him to who he was in Barakamon. Handa-kun had the material from Barakamon to make a good comedy based on Sei Handa's life, instead we got a wasted potential that has little to do with the main character the anime's title is named after, if your SUPPORTNG CHARACTERS (Namely Handa Force and any other character that gravitates to this group) have more screentime than the MAIN character the anime's title is named after, your kinda missing the point of a prequel of pre-established character, hell the anime might as well be called ""Handa Force and Thier Misunderstandings the Anime"" than ""Handa-kun"". 
 
In terms of animation, the animation was ""decent"" overall using pastel colors and a vibrant character cast to go with it. The animation does have some good bits such as Handa's Wall for instance as well as the comedic ""moments"" of over-exaggeration at times does make the scene transition well. On speaking of which the transitions used in Handa-kun (the calligraphy brush wipes) were also a nice detail. The animation done by Diomedea is overall decent to say the least but the animation CAN'T be the only thing good about it if the comedy can't stand up to it. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well as a good of voice cast as this was, LA had a few annoyances, mainly from the Handa Force especially Junichi Aizawa voiced by Yuuya Hirose as his misunderstood eccentricities were annoying and LOUd to say the least and the rest of the Handa Force weren't much different, at least the majority of the voice cast did some well done reaction grunts/remarks or fanboy/girling that was ok enough. Sei Handa's voice actor Nobunaga Shimazaki, as much as it was ""in character"" for him to be shy and paranoid, it just felt that was ALL he was doing. The voice cast for LA is slightly mixed but LA's favourite voice actor goes to Miyoko Kinjou voiced by Kaede Hondo for her schizophrenic fangirling over Handa at a flip of a switch...she was really unexpected...seriously. 
 
The ending FINALLY deals with Handa and his misunderstood paranoia and LA really LA just has to say ""IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH"", the ending pretty much was what LA wanted to see...SOMETHING NEW...slight though but with Handa's revelation, it helped at bit, but not enough for LA to redeem Handa-kun for his comedic sins it placed on the anime and Sei Handa as a character...the ending was good, but the payoff was well enough not worth it. 
 
Really aside from the very good-meta first episode, the  intro episodes of the Handa Force members and the finale to it's decent animation and voice acting, these strengths can't outweigh the immense amount of character and comedic flaws LA just kept seeing on repeat and yes LA knows that comedy is subjective but that was just what LA saw watching Handa-kun. 
 
Handa-kun isn't the best comedy anime this Summer 2016 and failed to be funny as it thought that it's ""one joke wonder of misunderstandings"" could make the anime and nothing else, hell even Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! this season knew to shake things up from time to time!. Now Sei Handa...please DON'T MISUNDERSTAND this review...LA WANTED to like this anime...LA doesn't hate Handa-kun...just disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful Barakamon was a series that gave the calligrapher  Handa Sei a journey through self discovery on an island village where he was able to create a form of calligraphy that he felt comfortable and happy with.  It was a show that garnered a decent following and had a relatively lasting popularity during 2014.  And so, to remind us that that series existed, we have Handa-kun, a look into his earlier days in a comedy gag series that...should've never been made. 
 
Story: As previously said before, Handa-kun is a series about Handa Sei in his school days, where he was still as awkward and uncomfortable as he was in Barakamon (probably even more so), thinking that literally everyone in his school hated him when in reality...he's considered as a god walking among them and that anything he says or does is law.  As a result, there's a misconception between Handa and the rest of the school (except Kawafuji and maybe Yukio) and thus, 'hilarity ensues'.   
 
Alright, right out of the gate here, I'll tell you the thing about Handa-kun.  It's.  One.  Long.  Running.  Joke.  The entire runtime of the series is dedicated to some member of the cast (usually new members) coming into contact with the 'divine entity' known as Handa-kun, only to be swayed by his words (as well as taking them in the COMPLETELY wrong way) and changing their entire perspective of life before becoming indoctrinated into the Cult of Handa.  That's it.   
 
At first, this seems kinda amusing.  For the first few episodes, the awkwardness and overall comedy of the series is pretty funny because of how utterly ridiculous it is.  Then it doesn't become funny.  Then it REALLY doesn't become funny.  Then it becomes eye-twitchingly bad.  Good things come in small doses, and when you don't do that and instead use the exact same material over and over again, it becomes unbearable to watch.  Handa-kun is exactly that.  As the episodes run by, you'll come to expect the same things episode after episode but with increasing ridiculous cringeworthy scenes and even stranger characters, ultimately creating a show that's sad and difficult to watch.  (Devoting the entire school festival to ONE student?  Changing the curriculum to adhere to what he says accidentally?  Making something based on someone without their consent?  How can ANY of these situations be considered comedy?!) 
 
By the end of the series, everything does get resolved...in some way, but not enough to salvage this series.  Admittedly, there are people who do enjoy this kind of comedy, but just using one joke for what equates to about six hours worth of material is not the way to write a comedy series, especially when the only gag you have is to torture some poor misunderstood individual with daily occurrences that he doesn't understand and is terrified about.   
 
Overview: 
-  The entire series is one long-running joke 
-  Concept gets tired FAST 
-  Episode writing gets worse and worse with every passing episode 
 
Characters: Oh boy, where do I start with this one?  Characters, or should I say mentally challenged individuals are probably the number one reason why I despise this series and think that it's absolutely terrible. 
 
First it's Handa Sei.  Now, first off, we don't actually get much of Handa.  Yes, the title character of the series probably gets the least amount of screentime out of any of the main characters in this series.  In any case, Handa Sei is the same awkward and nervous individual that you saw in Barakamon, just de-aged about 5-7 years.  The main reason for Handa's existence is just to be a figurehead of reasoning for every other character's delusions and obsessions.  The dynamic of 'I'm hated but in reality, everyone loves me' gets old really fast, and Handa really doesn't do much in the series aside from cower away and wall himself off from the rest of the school because he feels alone and unwanted when in reality, that's not really the case. 
 
Then there're the nutjobs.  I'm not even going to separate and talk about them individually; the other characters are all nutjobs.  You have the Handa Force consisting of a delinquent, a bishonen, and the stereotypical glasses character who say they're Handa's friends when in reality, they all have barely any understanding of who Handa Sei is as a person, you have the girl who sits next to him who becomes a stalker with a pension for 'erasing people who threaten handa' after she was given Handa's eraser because she lost hers, the handa-kun copycat, the student president who for some reason makes her vice-president who is a burly man dress in the girl's uniform, and other various characters strewn about the series who're just as weird and strange as them.  On paper, they sound interesting and hilarious enough to be entertaining and fill the series with life, right?  Well...no.  The only character trait that have is the oddly stalkerish way of worshipping Handa.  Every new one that the series introduces begs to ask the question ""WHY?!"" because of how strange and borderline sad they all are and/or become. 
 
And for the characters I handpicked out, we have Yukio and Kawafuji, the two characters in the series who actually have some decent sense.  Sure, Yukio plays the 'I'm average, and everything about me is average, and I like it' card, but at the very least, he plays the straight man in this mess and tries to bring some kind of sense to all of the other characters in the series despite how fruitless it is.  Kawafuji's the same way, but he's more akin to a real person and also has common sense on the situation.  They help me bring back some sanity from this sh*tshow. 
 
Overview: 
+ Some straight man characters to point out the sheer ridiculousness of this series 
-  Handa is more of an idea than an actual character 
-  EVERYONE ELSE IS A F*CKING BASKET CASE 
 
Art: Made by Diomedea, Handa-kun is...average looking at best.  The show has the animation that you would consider as standard fare for this day and age of animation, and there really isn't much I can say about this series.  I mean, the most they do is add your classic comedic facial expressions in order to accurately express the characters' emotions, but any more than that, and you're asking for a bit much.   
 
Sound:  The soundtrack...isn't all that interesting to be honest.  I mean, the opening has a rock song akin what Barakamon did for its OP, but it's leaning more towards heavy metal to relate to the sheer ridiculousness of the series.  (Which I think is what they were going for.)  But in all honesty, the OST isn't really anything to look forward to, and the voice acting is standard at best.  Hell, everyone in the series save for Handa sounds so damn happy that Handa is around that I can only say that that's the ONLY expression sound that they can make.   
 
Personal Enjoyment:  :)  So...what do I think of Handa-kun?  Ok, at first, I thought it was funny.  Like the overall ridiculousness of the series gave me a few laughs because of how dumb everything seemed and how the overall plotline was about these comedic misunderstandings.  Then it got old fast.  The show's inherent problems lie with the fact that it was just the SAME DAMN THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Think I'm being repetitive in this review?  You try listening to characters shout the phrase ""Handa-kun!""  ""Handa-san!"" ""Handa!""  ""Handa!""  God, that name is like nails on a chalkboard.   
 
Did I like this series? 
 
It's start was ok because the show wasn't so heavy on the misunderstandings or the stupidity of the situation, so it wasn't so heavy and more enjoyable than what came later.  Also, Yukio.  I really like the straight man in any comedy situation.   
 
What didn't I like about this series?   
 
Ok, take what I said above and subtract that from the series.  What do you have left?  Everything I hate.  Cringe is about the only way I can even begin to describe this series.  As mentioned many times before, the series just went on and on with how Handa-kun was great and how Handa's the goddamn messiah to all of our problems while introducing more and more characters that belong to this nutjob high school where I can only shudder to think what they were all worshipping before this poor calligrapher's son.  They even have an episode where Handa thinks that he has a stalker, when in reality it's EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CAST STALKING HIM, and they go and assume that they need to protect him from someone who doesn't actually exist!  That's not funny!  That's not funny at all!  It's sad!  It's really, really sad! 
 
Would I recommend this series? 
 
No, don't hurt yourself.  If you want to watch a series about Handa Sei and all of his glory...just...just go watch Barakamon.  This spin-off from hell was a mistake that should never rear its ugly head ever again.  It's a much better series and I would honestly say to avoid this dreadful cour birthed from the devil that honestly...wasn't even THAT funny to begin with.

          
 
       Helpful Handa-kun gets a lot of reasonable hate when you think about it because Handa-kun is a prequel to probably one of the best slice of life anime ever made which is Barakamon so of course people would want to compare them and see the same type of comedy and humor. 
  
Now this anime is written under the comedy slice of life shounen genres but to me I think this falls under the Drama genre a lot more, I'm not sure if the mangaka intended for that to happen or not but this anime felt sad more than comedy, I couldn't help but feel sad for Handa almost every episode, there was one episode in particular where he finally had the courage to talk to someone and he was extremely happy then he told his mother that and she replied ""oh that's good"" and then he realized how all that hard work he did was almost nothing special compared to normal people so he just sad there doing nothing, man that was heart breaking. 
 
Anyway now moving on to The characters: there were good characters in this anime and almost all of them had unique personalities like Eraser, Junichi, Reo and all the others but there were 2 characters that stood out in this anime other than Handa of course and those 2 are Yukio and Kawafuji. 
Yukio was the normal character but he knew how bad Handa felt and tried to help him out as much as possible which I think was nice to see but Kawafuji on the other hand was probably the worst one in the anime, he was the reason handa's life was miserable just because he was rejected and yet he never really tried to help him get back to his normal good life that he had even after seeing him suffer. 
 
The comedy in handa was good but sometimes gets way too repetitive which I think was the reason many people hated this show, I almost dropped it myself but I wanted to how it would all end at so I continued watching. 
 
Overall I did enjoy this anime but would I recommend it? probably but I would tell anyone to watch this before Barakamon because Barakamon sets the bar way too high for an anime like handa to be able to catch up to it.

10,17849,23,7.31137327218525,Campus romatic comedy,Sparrow's Hotel,"The comedy revolves around Sayuri Satou, the new front desk worker at the Sparrow's Hotel—""the closest hotel to Heaven"". Her special features are her large breasts and her skills of assassination. She takes down people who cause trouble in the business hotel with those skills, but she is in fact very unskilled when talking to the male hotel manager, and often bites her tongue. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Comedy'],"Sparrow's Hotel follows the daily activities of Sayuri Satō, Tamaki Shiokawa and Misono as they manage the Sparrow's Hotel along with the many different types of people and misadventures they encounter along the way.
","Sparrow's Hotel is about a woman who works in a hotel on the rowdy side of town. She is talented, beautiful, and just happens to be the hotel's bouncer.   
 
Starting this anime I had very low expectations for it. People on MAL gave it a pretty lousy review and frankly, the cover image for the anime looks like crap. Surprisingly enough, the low budget production actually wasn't too bad in the first episode, or the second, or the third. I found myself laughing and really enjoying the show. The poor art quality actually worked for the show and its level of humor. It wasn't until the 7th episode that things started getting weird. 
 
Have you seen an anime in which the MCs are anime creators themselves and the project they are working on goes through a massive change in the middle of production? Well, Sparrow's Hotel is a RL representation of that. 
 
All of a sudden on the 7th episode it looks like the whole production moved to a different company with new artists and possibly new voice actors. It was very unsettling since I watched all the episodes back to back. The art style actually got better after the change, however, since it was such a big difference, it was very distracting. I couldn't get over the change in time to truly enjoy the rest of this anime. 
 
All in all, give this anime a try expecting it to be what be what it is: a poor soul that seemed to want to do better but couldn't.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Having this be my first review you probably shouldn't take anything I say to strongly due to my lack of experience. However, I didn't think this anime was that bad compared to what others say. 
 
I gave the story a 1 because this anime really doesn't have a story. But I would exempt this anime from this category merely because It is one of those anime that focus on trying to push in comedy. 
 
I gave the art a 5 due to the fact that it isn't the best art that I've seen, but it also isn't the worst. I admit that the art is pretty bad for what could be done at the time, but it's art kind of make it unique in some regard. 
 
I gave the sound a 5 because it didn't really stand out from my perspective but it also didn't not fit the anime. 
 
I gave the character a 1 because the characters had no development whatsoever. However I think this anime should be exempt from this category as well due to the fact that it is not the type of anime that would focus on developing characters. and if it were the episodes would have been a bit longer and some of the comedy would have been cut. 
 
I gave the enjoyment factor a 7 just because it doesn't take a lot to impress me. The anime wasn't the best thing ever but it was still enjoyable which is a category which some anime fail to achieve. 
 
Overall I gave the anime a 5 due to it being an good yet not outstanding anime with average scores all around for me. However I feel that this anime is a hit for some or a miss for many more. I wouldn't stay away from this like some reviews say, but this anime isn't outstanding. Please don't take this review to seriously though because I have no experience reviewing anime whatsoever. Thanks for reading.

          
 
       Helpful A simple litmus test for how much merit one might find in Sparrow's Hotel can be done by the brief uttering of one of its jokes: ""Cute girl with large breasts is good at fighting"". Now, if you are presently convulsing in laughter with tears in your eyes and a pain in your sides at the mere thought of that ""joke"", boy are you in luck, Sparrow's Hotel uses that joke repeatedly! Hell, it's the only joke it has! None of that pesky ""variety"" garbage to encroach on your love affair with that perfect, solitary joke. As such, Sparrow's Hotel's doubtlessly masterful sense of humor will remain laudable for as long as one finds this lonesome joke funny. For most of us, however, that moment will arrive mere seconds into the first episode. 
 
Sayuri Satou, a busty and overly capable bouncer for a successful hotel, is somewhat renowned for her eccentricity and her overzealousness. She tends to go overboard and treat the simple task of calming the guests as that of an assassination or something of comparable severity. That is the entire premise. The meat of Sparrow's Hotel rarely strays from this barebones scenario. Various quirky characters occasionally enter the fray, but they are similarly marred by being one-note affairs. For instance, the sis-con is characterized entirely by his unhealthy affinity for his sister, and the grizzled biker character never diverges from his trite archetype. This isn't necessarily an inherent flaw - better comedies such as Cromartie High School have thrived on this sort of characterization - but the jokes associated with these characters are just as banal as their cardboard cutout personalities would suggest. It'd be a stretch to even consider incessant reoccurrences like Satou fervidly beating up gangsters a joke, but Sparrow's Hotel sure tries its darndest to frame it as one. And as one might expect, the results are invariably poor. 
 
In terms of presentation, Sparrow's Hotel started out as something unique. The show had an art direction straight out of the early 90s, but even by those standards, it would've been hopelessly deficient. The animation was choppy and innumerable corners were cut, resulting in a product that the director even had to apologize for on account of how shameful it was. While this would have looked bad in the 90s, it feels entirely alien in 2013. Being remarkably bad is hardly commendable, but it made the show almost worth watching just to marvel at the fact that this was a show that existed in today's modern anime climate. ""Almost"" being the operative word there. ""Was"" being the other, because Sparrow's Hotel abruptly changes its art direction to a rounder style that is more in line with modern sensibilities halfway through the series. While it might sound like a positive turn of events, it takes away the only thing that made the show noteworthy: all we're left with is the comedy, and we already know how that turned out. 
 
And that's the long and short of it. Sparrow's Hotel is an abject failure of a show in every respect. Avoid like the plague.

But growing up is never easy, and sometimes it doesn't help when you're from outer space. Join our spunky heroine as she faces androids, alien invaders, and her first date with the boy next door. It's the sci-fi comedy that's a direct hit to your heart! 
 
(Source: Central Park Media)","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Kazuto Izuka is an average 14-year-old boy who one day encounters an abandoned puppy that turns into a space alien creature but is saved by schoolmate named Narue Nanase. When he goes to thank her, he discovers she too is a space alien whose father was part of a galactic exploration team. With the encouragement of his friend, Masaki Maruo, Izuka asks Narue out on a date. Narue is reluctant at first, but after Kazuto confesses his love to her, and assures her that he is not bothered by her alien heritage, Narue agrees and they start dating. They must deal with classmates who do not look favorably upon aliens, including Hajime Yagi, Narue's classmate and ufologist, who does not believe Narue is really an alien and thinks that she is lying to get attention. Narue's half-sister Kanaka moves to Earth along with Kanaka's caretaker Bathyscaphe who is an android spaceship. They also interact with other assorted characters, some of whom are aliens.
","This one's a bit of a mixed bag for me. World of Narue seemingly mixes around sci-fi, romantic comedy and slice-of-life in its focus on our female alien lead Narue who gets a human boyfriend named Kazuto as they try maintaining a normal relationship despite Narue's alien origins leading to sometimes hostile, sometimes bizarre situations. There are some aspects of its storytelling that aren't executed well such as its implementation of action with the two incidents with alien ninjas and the sudden developments that lead Narue and Kazuto into becoming a couple. 
 
On the plus side though, the series does offer a decent amount of depth and development with its characters and premise as we do get a sense of how complicated Narue's life is with her alien origins and how her father decided to wind up living on Earth. Additional characters are introduced among both humans and aliens who also get some fleshing out in regards to their life on Earth and connection to Narue. 
 
The comedy to the series mostly comes from the chemistry in Narue and Kazuto's relationship, as well as some of the bizarre predicaments they sometimes get into thanks to alien technology that is employed. For the most part though, I was indifferent towards this. There are also some otaku bits shown at points in the series such as Kazuto's interest in a magical girl anime and some fan service with Narue, but these don't detract too much from the series at all for the most part. 
 
The visuals for the series are rather standard for an early 2000s anime. Characters are drawn with conventional designs and scenic shots are nicely drawn with a decent amount of detail, though are nothing out of the ordinary. Animation shortcuts are milked at points in the series with still shots and jump cuts, though CG animation is employed at points whenever alien spaceships or gadgets are used. The average presentation doesn't detract from the series too much given its premise, but it doesn't stick out too much either. 
 
Overall, the series is a decent time-killer with what it offers up with its light romantic content as it is charming and offers decent focus on its cast without overdoing things with its sci-fi approach. It's a pretty cheap addition you can make for your anime collection as well as I got my copy of the complete series for only $10. 

          
 
       Helpful :)Hi, This Story, There's a lot of random story in this ep of Narue no Seka. This isn’t to say that the characters don’t develop. 
 
There’s a chapter with Narue’s sister Kanaka making friends with Hajime, a bizarre story where Kazuto turns into a cat (and travels in time), and a cosplay episode. They even manage to fit two beach episodes in! Well, a beach and a pool episode, It had little  comedy, romance, this anime more about  sci-fi. 
 
The last Ep was yes bad.  


          
 
       Helpful I watched the fansubs from AnimeJunkies and ANBU, here's thanks to them b4 I start my review. 
 
Synopsis: This is a story of Narue, a half-alien living in human society. She finds a boyfriend and have various encounters with both human culture and alien elements. 
 
Story:8 
A very unique story. This series concentrates on mainly trans-species/planetary love and slice of life and school life. This is in contrast to DearS and Chobits, where the non-human knows nothing and act blur, needing a human guy to teach em stuff while they act cute. Narue and her companions from space seem to have blended well into human culture (a little too well in fact). 
 
The story is quite focused on romance, and have about 3 pairs of couples included, instead of the usual 1. All 3 are not human-human relationships and therefore there are obstacles that occurred. However, romance was formed a bit too easily, more emphasis was placed on how the guy and gal cherish each other. Therefore, if you are looking for a build-up to romance story (eg. ToraDora, Lovely Complex) this series may not be for you. 
 
Slice of life was quite unique, given the supernatural equipment that the characters had. Somehow I felt the slice of life elements to be similar to Wagaya no Oinari-sama. School life was portrayed in quite an interesting manner, but in the later episodes school was not focused much upon. 
 
There were hardly much action scenes, and I felt that the producers made the right decision. The action scenes featured were somewhat of a lower quality compared to slower scenes. 
 
The ending was kinda un-conclusive (according to MangaUpdates this anime is until vol.4 of the manga) which can be understood. However, there isn't much of a closure (which B Gata H Kei managed well) as well, which is a bit disappointing. 
 
Animation:6 
The colours were a bit dull, even though this show was produced in 2003. Also, the action scenes were a bit... in slow motion and doesn't look very realistic. But the art was consistent. 
 
Sound:8 
Not a great variety of sound effects (eg. bgm) featured. However, the bgm was used well, and helped to create the mood for the scenes. 
 
A highlight of this show is the OP AND ED.  
 
The OP ""Shooting Star"" by CooRie was done amazingly, and is definitely one of my fav OPs ever (It tells of the determination of a person to treasure and maintain a relationship despite difficulties)... one that can match the level of ""Shooting Star"" by Kotoko in the series Onegai Teacher. 
 
The ED ""Ice Cream"" by Saeko Chiba is a sweet song about romance, about how the person accidentally fell in love without being mentally prepared first. 
 
Both were so great that I watched all the 12 eps' OP and ED without skipping, which is seriously rare. 
 
Character:6 
Characters were slightly less spectacular in this series. Some character development and character interaction were done, and done well, but I felt that too little emphasis was given to Narue and Kazuto (her bf).  
 
The content was spaced out quite evenly among the main characters and some extra characters, but Narue is supposed to be the most important character in this series. Yet, there wasn't that much content about her. Narue's sister had some unfinished development as well. 
 
The characters' personalities were done well. Unique traits were emphasised over and over again. Eg. Narue being very very thrifty (money-pincher?) Most importantly, the personalities they had were put to good use 
 
Enjoyment:9 
After the first few eps, which were kinda slow, I began to be addicted to the series. There were tons of emotional and touching moments. But, some problems were resolved a bit too easily... The romance in this series is really unique and great as well, similar to Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, although this series has more couples being focused on. 
 
Overall:7 
Take note that this anime is NOT MEANT TO BE CONCLUSIVE as it only ends at vol 4 of manga. While I'm writing this review, I believe the manga is still ongoing at vol 7. This anime is sweet and light, but at times a bit tear-jerking. 
I recommend it for people who enjoyed romance series like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, where there is little build-up to romance but more emphasis after the boy-girl relationship is formed.

One day, Gintoki and his comrades are out viewing the spring flowers when suddenly the Shinsengumi appear, arguing that Gintoki has taken their flower-viewing spot. Gintoki's team and the Shinsengumi must then battle for the right to sit in that spot by using a violent version of rock paper scissors. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Parody', 'Samurai', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","The story is set in an alternate-history late-Edo period, where humanity is attacked by aliens called ""Amanto"" (天人, ""Sky People""). Edo Japan's samurai fight to defend Earth, but the shōgun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing the invaders to enter the country. The samurai's swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate) becomes a puppet government.
The series focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their freelancing business and the three become known as ""Yorozuya"" (万事屋, ""We do everything"" or literally ""The Anything Store"").
While working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government.
Although the story is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop. For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'état. After the true antagonist—the immortal Utsuro—is introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth.
","This may seem like any other special you see for other Anime but for Gintama this was a whole new deal. This was a trial episode of the popular manga Gintama and to see if a viable anime adaptation could be possible or not, and obviously 12 years later we know it did do it's job perfectly. Thanks to many reasons you could consider this the first ever episode of Gintama as well since this was released in 2005, a year before the green-lit superhit Gintama TV show entered it's first season in 2006. 
 
Story: 7/10 
 
The story was divided into two unequal parts, the first just being a small introduction of the characters (sadly our China Girl didn't get much of one, blame Patsuan), and the second main part, which was basically the Gintama gang at the annual 'flower viewing' event in Japan. It was classic Gintama, tongue-in-cheek jokes and jabs at the studios not to mention pure Gintama comedy for the masses. It didn't feel like a trial at all because usually in trials you expect a serious representation of the manga, but then this is Gintama and that's what made it a joy to watch. Another very important thing was you didn't need to watch this in a specific order. This could be watched whenever regardless of where you are in the Gintama series. 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
To my knowledge, Gintoki didn't have his signature hairstyle (read messed up hair with two strands at the sides) and just showed his hair in a messed up manner. The other characters as well felt washed out a bit along with the backgrounds as well. On the bright side, the color palette was as usual well chosen and perfectly suited it's time, 2005. The characters looked great regardless of the slightly washed out feeling and felt like a full on Gintama episode at best. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
Since this was a trial a full fledged soundtrack wasn't made for the episode and some characters like Baka Ouji didn't sound at all like their later voice but the bottom line was Gintama used everything in it's grasp to appeal to the audience in terms of sound as well, also noticed by the ""Your Mom is a XX!"" song made for the anime. One of the downfalls of the episode was that due to the absence of a sound track you couldn't listen to the familiar Gintama background music that plays during the TV show episodes but still felt like classic Gintama thanks to the excellent work done by the VAs. 
 
Character: 7/10 
 
In just one trial/special they showed most of the cast and introduced them perfectly as well, it totally felt I was back to the world of Gintama and it was a lot of fun looking at the characters in their usual daily shenanigans moving about. They showed the Yorozuya, Shinsengumi and the Gintama women as well (Otae, Catherine, Otose). Although you can't expect character development in a special the characters were decently shown and their interactions were like I said pure fun. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
 
I've said this many times and I will again, this episode felt so much like the actual Gintama episodes and I loved every bit of it. It totally didn't fail to leave a smile on my face after watching and it was interesting to note how Sunrise didn't deviate from this formula at all in Gintama 2006 and then Gintama 2011 as well. It was a brilliant job in my opinion and it made you think of the (not so) humble beginnings of the super-hit series. 
 
Overall: 7.8 
 
Overall this episode can be described in a phrase I used many times in this review, ""Classic Gintama"". Hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, shameless and an absolute joy to watch. I totally recommend this to anyone wanting to get into the Gintama series but who are a bit taken aback by the huge episode number. If this appeals to you, then definitely the main series will too because it's quite tough to find out the difference between the core of this and the main show as well and retains it's quirky charm throughout. I hope you, like me give it a try and hopefully enter the Gintama series as well.

       Helpful The first inception of the Gintama anime was this very special, produced by Sunrise for Jump Festa '05. At that point, the Gintama manga had been running for almost two years and the author was understandably over the moon about the news. The special was received very favourably, with Sunrise later adapting the manga into a mainstay series in 2006. 
 
There appears to have been much deliberation over which chapter of the manga to adapt to the screen; the result is one of the few stand-alone chapters that is able to utilise the vast supporting cast - so big it's often hard to portray in a single chapter alone - as well as the main characters. It's a carefully chosen, carefully adapted plot, with the anime staff thinking very meticulously how to best demonstrate Gintama's appeal in only thirty minutes. The outcome is an episode that could easily slot somewhere into the middle of the anime series, but just as easily serve as an introduction to the characters and the universe of Gintama. It's a fun, exciting, enthralling plot with hordes of characters fans of the series have long since fallen in love with. 
 
The animation is fluid and consistent, with the character designs complementing Sorachi's early Gintama artwork, thus differing slightly from the anime series. The art itself is appealing, vibrant and ever so colourful, flawlessly capturing the allure of flower viewing. The music - on the other hand - isn't especially outstanding, but simply does its job, complementing Gintama's hyper characters are ridiculously entertaining plot. 
 
In this special, the characters - a lively, humorous and exciting bunch - are introduced en masse. The amount of personalities on display may prove too much for some viewers unfamiliar with Gintama, who would rather have a more solid, linear establishment of the cast, but for those wanting to skip formalities, it's a lively, full-throttled introduction.  
 
The characters are a witty ensemble there to entertain, to make you laugh; maybe even brighten up your day. The very first anime adaptation of Gintama is an inviting little romp in alternate-Edo, Gintama's crazed, imaginative setting, which is perhaps the only important element of the series not on prime display, but everything else is nailed to a tee. It's Gintama at its best and a lovely introduction to what the series has on offer.

Funded entirely out of its own deep pockets, it was hoped that the school would be a haven for young men and women on whose shoulders our future would rest. 
 
The School is open to any talented individual, irrespective of his or her lineage or financial standing and is known to count scores of singularly talented pupils. It is furthermore also famous for its harboring of a remarkable percentage of party animals. Not even the bright and talented minds of CLAMP School can keep the campus free of crimes and mysteries. Or can they? Join Nokoru, Suoh and Akira, our case-cracking kid detectives, as they save the day and even the odd damsel in distress! 
 
(Source: Bandai Entertainment)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Shoujo']","The Clamp School Detectives is a series of episodic cases.
","The kingdom of Clamp has been extremely well known in Japan. I originally came upon this show because i am a huge fan of clamp and i really enjoyed alot of their other works such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles one of my favorite clamp manga's. Other works include X/1999, Chobits, Card captor sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, XXXholic. Initially i was very excited to watch this show seeing as how i loved all of clamps creations how ever i was a bit let down. 
 
The setting for this series revolves around this large school comprised of bout 10,000 students with many different divisions and many activities, academics, athletics, and just bout anything you can think of.  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira are the 3 main protagonists of the series and are also the lead council members of the elementary division. These three kids must solve many cases around the school of certain mysterious happenings, usually involving a damsel in distress. 
 
Later on as you get a little further into the show, some of the main players of the series start to develop relationships with these elementary kindergarten females which is a nice touch, and the romance is not shown as true love which it shouldn't be given the fact that these characters are pretty underage. But i do appreciate how each relationship with these two female casts grow as you get further in the show and they start to be a part of the clamp school detectives. 
 
I think the strongest aspect of this show is the characters. The nice thing about the trio of protagonists is that they each bring something different to the show. Nokoru is the youngest son of the founders of the Clamp School and is essentially a prodigy in every sense of the word. Suoh is nearly as sharp as Nokoru, but where he lacks in the powers of observation he makes up for with his physical attributes. Akira is the youngest of the three. He's a little more naïve, a better cook, and sees things more optimistically than his friends. They play off each other quite nicely and right from the very first episode they have a chemistry that easily carries the weight of 26 episodes. 
 
At first glance i thought this would be a series that focuses more on like mysterious happenings and murder cases, because the first episode kind of gives you that impression, but really most of the cases they solve are trying to help some lady that is in trouble, because of the episodic nature of the show, each case involves a different scenario.  
 
Although their is one particular plot in the show that takes place towards the end, the last 6 episodes with a more straightforward story and the introduction of a rather intriguing character. This story really caught my attention. It was much different then former episodic nature of the plot and a little more on a serous level, though the idea behind it was rather predictable, it still held my attention.  Which i thought was really the only thing that redeemed this anime series as far as the simplistic progression of the story. Which is why i rated it a 6 and not lower. 
 
If your a fan of clamp though, this series may be enjoyable, but if you have not seen other clamp works, i highly recommend you pass on this one and watch other great works from clamp. Other wise if you have nothing else to watch and are a clamp fanatic and want to watch every clamp in existence then give this one a shot as a last resort, then you may enjoy this series to an extent depending upon your tastes. 
 


          
 
       Helpful CLAMP School Detectives is a 90s anime based on a CLAMP manga. And it is, in my opinion, a very entertaining show. I just finished this series and decided to write a review about it - my first review, actually. Here we go. 
 
• Story - 9/10 
 
In the first 20 episodes there isn't a story. We follow the lives of three elementary school boys that happen to be in the Elementary School Council and are also (self-proclaimed) detectives. They - well, mostly their ""leader"", Nokoru, wants to help all the ladies he sees in trouble. He doesn't want to see any girl crying and is willing to do anything to help her. So the boys get in a lot of situations, some funny ones, some troublesome ones, and some actually dangerous ones. To achieve their goals they do things that real children aren't able to do - that most people aren't able to do, actually. In some episodes they actually have to solve cases, follow clues to find things, and they have the help of other characters, especially two girls from the school's kindergarten. Those two girls are also supposed to be the romantic interests of two of the main boys, but of course, they are all children, so the ""love"" in this show is represented as the most pure thing in the world, and nothing is sexualized, in case there was someone worried about it.  
Later in the series, the ""villain"" makes his appearance, so we have a more serious atmosphere and an actual plot. 
 
• Art/Animation - 9/10 
 
CLAMP 90s artstyle, it's simply gorgeous. I don't have much to talk about it, I just have a soft spot for oldschool art. 
 
• Sound - 8/10 
 
The soundtrack, all composed by Ali Project, isn't very memorable, but it wasn't bad at all; it did its job perfectly, fitting the show pretty well. The opening song is very catchy, and the endings were both good, especially the second one, but also not very memorable. 
The voice actors were great at their roles, I have nothing to complain about them. 
 
• Characters - 10/10 
 
All of them have different personalities and are very likeable. Our protagonists are all children. Three boys at age 11~12; Nokoru Imonoyama, who is the president of the ESC, is a bit irresponsible, but very kind, and really cares for the people he loves, and for the whole CLAMP Academy; Suoh Takamura is the serious type, he really respects Nokoru but also gets really mad at the his lack of responsibility; and Akira Ijyuin, who is also the main character of the manga 20 Mensou ni Onegai!!, is the youngest one, he enjoys cooking and is probably the most childish of the three boys. 
The two girls, Nagisa Azuya and Utako Ohkawa, are members of the Kindergarten School Council, they often help or are helped by the main boys.  
Some characters from other CLAMP manga series make some appearances, like Kentaro, Takeshi, Eri and Sukiyabashi, from School Defenders Duklyon and Miyuki from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland. 
Other characters usually show up in only one or two episodes. 
 
• Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
I loved it. I thought the manga was a good series to pass time, but nothing actually special, but I had a lot of fun watching the anime. It was really cute and amusing. Even though it's mostly episodic, the cases never get boring. 
 
• Overall - 9/10 
 
If you are into light-hearted stories, isn't worried about realism, and enjoy episodic series, I'd suggest you to give CLAMP School Detectives a shot! 

          
 
       Helpful Let me start of by saying this anime was created by the one and only CLAMP.  
 
Now that you know let me start my review. 
 
 
CLAMP Gakuen Tanteidan, or CLAMP School Detectives, is the story of three little investigators  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira, who are also members of the three-person elementary student council of their school.  
I guess this has a good story but I didn't see any goal in it. What do they want to happen? What are they trying to find? The only thing I see happening in this anime are there life and times inside the school. They beat bad guys up and discovers themselves after some time.  
It has, fortunately, some exciting action. Kids beating up bad guys looks cool. 
 
Storylines' a bit(just a bit) lame but I give the art some praise. The drawings are very detailed and pretty advanced for its time. The hair-blowing is also pretty good. 
Though I'm a guy I cannot resist saying... the characters are so cute and adorable. 
 
The music is nice. The pretty sound of the singers' voices are very likable. The opening and ending theme, however, is a letdown for me because it had nothing to do with the anime's plot. Little boys and girls pausing beautifully for the audience. 
Once fangirls see them screaming is unavoidable. 
 
The characters are fair enough. Nokoru for me is the blonde eminence of Shuichi Minamino. Suoh is an all around serious character with a pure heart which kind of reminds me of CLAMP's very own Li Shaoran who I like very much. Akira is adorable enough. I felt the girls never contributed anything except blow their pheromone all over Nokoru's staff. 
&quot;I'll give my life to this kindergartener.&quot; One of them said.  
 
Enjoyment... I can't explain much. I found the action very cool and the character design great. I did not like the storyline and romance though.  
 
My overall score is 7 out of 10. This might not appeal much to hardcore fans but it's perfect for kids or beginners.

10,35330,27,6.904141369469915,Campus romatic comedy,Poputepipikku,"Poputepipikku  turns absurdist comedy up to eleven with its pop culture references and surreal hilarity. With two bonafide high school girl protagonists—the short and exceptionally quick to anger Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi—they throw genres against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching goal—to become a real anime. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Dementia']",none,"Pop Team Epic is the name. Offering jokes that make no sense its game. Like it or not, it's all the same. Your sense of humor is to blame.  
 
Philosophers, fools and shitposters all around the globe have been asking this question recently, but also since the dawn of tragicomedy: What makes a joke funny? Is there a single factor that answers to this question? Everything can be funny as long as it is presented in the preferred way. Much like with anime series, it is all about the execution. But this is still all about personal preferences, perspective and knowledge. How can a popculture reference deliver if one does not know what is is referring to? The original question has been answered already hundreds of times: The funny was inside you all along. #deep  #derp 
 
Pop Team Epic is a series thats target audience is the whole internet culture. Its jokes varie greatly from parodies to live action interviews. From original content to ridiculously bad coaxed into a snafu-tier memes. It's even familiar with taiwanese puppet shows, obscurities of all sort, and awkward elevator music. The series has a bit of everything, and for this reason its writing is full of quality differences. It's nearly impossible for every joke appeal to all viewers. Almost every joke in it can be understood in different ways and found to be funny/not funny for different reasons. This is quite original for comedy series and part of the reason why I found the series to be worth of my time so much that I watched it twice. There has been quite a few obscure comedies in the past, such as Masuda Kousuke Gekijou, Gag Manga Biyori and Tensai Senshi, but none of them successful.  
 
The actual idea behind the series production is fairly interesting. It shows us how much voice actors can change the tone of the series and the aspects of jokes. Every episode is approximately 24 minutes long, but in practice it is just 12 minutes of either identical or highly similar content. The main difference are the voice actors. Other half is presented with male seiyuus and the another with female seiyuus. The male version typically also comes with extras such as quest analysis, voice-over live action reaction to the joke, and whatever else.  
 
I enjoyed this series for its uniqueness, different approach, and scenes such as flip-cover live action music show presented by 2 members of the production team. There is simply no other anime in existence that would even try to do content like this. It alone is worth of something: worth of giving Pop Team Epic a go. 

          
 
       Helpful First of all, right after watching episode 1, I thought of dropping the series because I didn't find it funny. I only had small giggles here and there, and I had a lot of questions in mind about the series when I started watching it (i.e, ""Why is it Hoshiiro Girldrop? I thought it was Pop Team Epic"", ""I don't think any kinda anime would work without a solid story"", ""Do these 4-panel comedy manga's even work as a successful anime?"", etc. etc.) 
 
Luckily, I caught up with this series up until the release of episode 2. I wanted to give the series a chance (actually, because of curiosity), and LOVED it. The reasons were mainly because of the memes, parodies, and over-all randomness. Because of that, I waited in hope for the future episodes with high expectations to only sink in despair. It wasn't what I thought it'd be like. 
 
Despite my hype for the series dying down, it's still a pretty great anime. Would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who likes memes, Western pop culture, and just for the overall randomness. 
 
(I'll probably write a more critical review once the series is finished, kinda depends if it's a negative or a positive one, though)

          
 
       Helpful This was definitely an interesting one. In a way, it reminds me of an anime version of Robot Chicken, in the manner that it's a surreal animated sketch comedy block full of pop culture references and parodies. It's one of those series that's you'll either love or hate, and let me tell you, I loved it! Every episode had me laughing to the point of crying from start to finish, with my favorite segment of them all easily being the one with the Skyline GT-R. With the assortment of different art styles and over-the-top humor, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I also found it really interesting that the block repeated with two different voice actors, and that there were minute differences in dialogue in them that one might not catch upon first viewing unless you're really paying attention. That being said, this one's unique style puts it leaps and bounds in front of everything else in terms of uniqueness. And let me tell you, the experience definitely pairs well with a bottle of Absolut at the ready. ^w^

It has some funny moments but nothing hilarious. The pacing is often pretty awkward and could really benefit from some better timing. 
 
The visuals don't look professional and the animation is pretty poor. The way the characters are drawn make me think of the kind of art you see on DeviantArt when you sort by Newest. The visual-quality is pretty consistent though. Overall it looks very amateurish but still a little endearing. 
 
The voice acting is totally fine, and the main theme-song is good and catchy. 
 
Overall, it's awkward, amateur-looking, and a bit funny. It's not bad. If you're looking for a weird obscure anime then maybe check this one out otherwise I don't recommend it.

But as the girls age, so do their opinions of her—now just the mention of Chariot would get a witch labeled a child. However, undeterred in her blind admiration for Chariot, ordinary girl Atsuko Kagari enrolls into Luna Nova Magical Academy, hoping to someday become just as mesmerizing as her idol. 
 
However, the witch academy isn't all the fun and games Atsuko thought it would be: boring lectures, strict teachers, and students who mock Chariot plague the campus. Coupled with her own ineptness in magic, she's seen as little more than a rebel student. But when a chance finally presents itself to prove herself to her peers and teachers, she takes it, and now it's up to her to stop a rampaging dragon before it flattens the entire academy.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'School']","Little Witch Academia takes place at Luna Nova Magical Academy (ルーナノヴァ魔法学校, Rūna Nova Mahō Gakkō), a prestigious school for young girls training to become witches. Having been inspired by a witch named Shiny Chariot, a girl named Atsuko ""Akko"" Kagari enrolls at Luna Nova Magical Academy to become a witch, but struggles due to her non-magical background. This all changes when she discovers the Shiny Rod, a powerful magic relic left behind by Chariot.
One of the main themes in the franchise is Akko trying to live up to Shiny Chariot's ideals by showing the world that magic is still a wonderful thing, while Luna Nova struggles for its continual existence because the general public regards wizardry as outdated. In the TV series, this background element is expanded into a plotline in which magic is waning across the world. The secret to restoring the flow of magic lies within the forbidden Arcturus Forest, sealed inside a magical locale named the Grand Triskellion erected by the Nine Olde Witches, the legendary founders of the academy.
The key to undoing the seal lies in a sequence of seven magical words and the Shiny Rod, an artifact which reacts only to the wielder's genuine desire to spread joy and happiness. When Akko gains possession of the Rod, Chariot (secretly one of her Luna Nova teachers and the Rod's previous wielder) tries to guide her on the path to restoring the power of magic to the world. However, Croix, Chariot's former best friend, had also coveted – and was denied – the power sealed within the Grand Triskellion due to her selfish ambitions. As a result, she schemes to unlock the Grand Triskellion by force with use of artifacts powered by negative emotions she developed with her technomagical abilities and try to deter both Akko and her rival along the way.
","Warning possible Spoilers  
 
For something that was only 26 minutes long I was actually pretty impressed with Trigger and considering I'm a Harry Potter this felt like a very nice parody of it. 
 
The story is about 3 witches called Akko, Sucy and Lotte who always end up in trouble with the magic they cause at Luna Nova Magical Academy and this time is no exception. 
Now for 26 minutes this one episode was able to show me that you can make a Magical School that isn't Hogwarts and make it fun, the characters despite how dysfunctional they are were really funny and pretty much has a message that with teamwork and determination you can conquer any problems like what happened here where a giant monster was unleashed and it took the 3 Witches brains and teamwork to beat it. 
 
The characters were actually very likeable and funny plus with the antics that Akko, Sucy and Lotte cause it can make any day with them feel like an adventure. 
Akko the Main girl doesn't do very well at magic and whenever she does cast a spell it usually causes more harm than good, but her determination always brings her on top in the end because of her sheer devotion to finding a solution to a problem. 
Sucy is the more cynical witch who loves to brew potions with weird and dangerous ingredients and uses Akko as a test subject for these potions, despite being very gloomy she is actually funny and will sometimes make an evil smerk when she can do something mischievous. 
Lotte is calmer and is usually very worried about Akko's well being because of her incidents, she likes magic that can communicate and summon spirits or fairies. 
 
The artstyle was done really well and I liked the look of the characters and the Academy looked really cool too like a parody version of Hogwarts with it's Georgian type architecture, the uniforms looked very cool too very befitting of the term witch, the monsters and spells looked very elaborate too. 
 
I enjoyed what the episode gave in terms of comedy and adventure like when Akko and the others went into a dungeon to find treasure which brought about a dragon to terrorise the Academy, also the conversations between the 3 girls was really funny as Akko loved to point out how everything goes bad for her while the others correct her or point out something that causes them even more trouble was really entertaining. 
 
Overall this was a nice 1 episode type show and and hopefully since a series has been made from it that will be as good if not better than this.

          
 
       Helpful This is an underappreciated masterpiece that not many talk about. Yoshinari You is a genius and is one of the people actively saving the anime industry. Believe me when I say this, this anime ACTUALLY ENTERTAINS YOU, A LOT. There so much anime out there which are just so bland and boring to sit through, every second of this anime, brings joy. 
 
Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if an anime is worth watching you usually don't want to read all that much. 
 
Positives 
 
- A short story which leaves room for expansion yet ties up the major loose ends and sticks to a three act structure incredibly well. 
- The characters are all very different from each other, none are stereotypical archetypes and each are likeable in their own way. 
- The soundtrack is not something I noticed too much, but it was enough to create the correct atmosphere for the scenario's. 
- The animation, I feel like this really needs to be stressed, by god the animation is amazing, everything is so smooth I think this might be the smoothest and most consistent animation i've ever seen. 
 
Negatives 
- Hard to think of many. 
-People don't appreciate as much?? 
 
 
Like I said, it's very difficult for me personally to find faults in Little Witch Academia, I would recommend this to almost anyone and am certainly looking forward to the future of this project. 

          
 
       Helpful Really, what's not to love in this one episode ? 
 
Trigger, the masterminds behind Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, are at it again and they didn't disappoint.  And as my rating shows, this show has no weakness.  
 
-Unique chara-design that is also adorable and engaging. Pixar-level stuff, dare I say.  
 
-Character developpment for everybody  
 
-Epic fight scenes with speed, showmanship and suspense 
 
-Fun all around. I'm not a fan of shojô, harem or college-girls anime but what can I say ? It gets the job done. I had fun and I want more.

","Seccond movie made from the Dragon nest game environment realy hit the sweat spot of mine. In contrast to the first movie, this story is centered around less characters, which given them more screen time and room to interact and develop. 
Even tho, Story-vise it isnt anything outstanding and it uses all the old movie/anime clishes, it realy doesnt loose its momentum, and throw you into the seat and wont let go, until the post credit scene, which leaves you with the funny smirk on the face. This kind of storyteling realy makes it kid-friendly, even taking in consideration it gets somehow scarry at some point of the movie. 
As far as the animation goes, when i first saw the characters in the first movie, I cannot help but to think of the new ""Thinkerbell"" movies. Which means that for me, getting used to the animation style wasnt realy all that hard. Visuals were overall great and the action scenes were breath taking. 
 
I realy hope, there will be more movies in this franchise. It has potential, and delivers some nice DnD action, that isnt full of the ""fanservise"" in the way it is in almost all new anime...

(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Basically Nukoduke, but gayer (+1) and not really about the cats themselves/the interactions between owner and pet; rather, it's more about the human characters.  
 
At 2 minutes long, the episodes are unfulfilling and relatively uneventful.

I'm really hoping this changes, but at the time I'm writing this, it's just a shy girl and her popular, near-perfect girlfriend, with not much else defining them other than their mutual love for cats. 
 
I do recommend this anime. With that said, don't expect much other than sheer cuteness going in, because that's all it really has going for it at the moment.

       Helpful When I was 5 years old, I went to my aunt's house. She had a cat there, a type of domesticated animal that I hadn't seen before. As I went up to greet it, the feline lifted it's tail in my direction. You see, when cats's are scared, they perform an action called ""spraying"" where they expel urine in a certain direction. The direction, in this case, was toward my soft young face. Now, remember that cat urine contains 0.05% ammonia (about 1% of the concentration that might be found in household cleaners), among other caustic substances. This resulted in a horrible burning sensation on my paper-thin facial flesh. I tilted my head backwards and unleashed a pained, terrified scream. 
 
Ever since then I've hated cats; even despised them.  However, the cats in Nyanko Days are quite different. They lack all of the unappealing aspects of the domesticated feline, while retaining their cute and playful nature. The severely limited intellect of the cat is replaced with that of a precocious child, and their sharp claws and disease-ridden fangs are nowhere to be seen (Note: cats harbor a large amount of bacteria in their mouths, and bites from them can lead to severe conditions like sepsis or worse). 
 
Their dander-riddled fur is also completely absent, with the Nyanko Days cats bearing soft, warm human flesh. I remember staying the night at my aunts house when she had her cat there. In the middle of the night my throat swelled up, restricting the intake of air to my lungs. Had my reaction been a bit worse, I could have died. It was all due to that cat. That evil, evil cat. 
 
Thankfully, the cats in Nyanko Days wouldn't do that to me. They're sweet little girls that just want to love you and have fun. This show transports me to a world where cats aren't malicious creatures of chaos, but adorable soft little bundles of joy. 
 
I'm rating the ""sound"" score very high mainly because of the opening song, which is very cute and catchy, despite it's short run-time of 30 seconds. Cat's in real life don't make pleasant sounds like this. I remember when my roommate got a cat a year ago. At night it would sit outside my bedroom door for hours on end, screaming like it was in the throes of death. It was absolutely horrid. One day after work, I returned to my bedroom to find my figure of my dear waifu Hestia on the floor broken, with a dreadful pile of cat feces on it. Outside, in the hallway, I spotted a pair of feline eyes glaring at me, glowing a sinister gold and full of primal malice. I cried myself to sleep that night... 
 
Anyway, back to my discussion of Nyanko Days. It's a fun, saccharine 1-minute long dose of cutesy moe that's worth a watch whenever you're feeling blue. When I see those cute little moe-blobs, I can't help but smile and feel calm, even with memories of my feline-related trauma wriggling through my subconscious, threatening to break through to the surface at any given moment. 
 
I have to admit, sometimes I lay in bed and weep from the fact that I'm trapped in this corporeal 3D body, unable to ascend to the eternal paradise known as the 2D world. What did we all do to deserve this foul, dreadful curse? 
 
But I digress. Nyanko Days is a great show and you should give it a watch. 
 
Final verdict: 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful Honestly, this thing is just kinda disturbing. 
Most other reviews seem to be entirely sarcastic (and pretty funny) but I can't even be bothered to do that much. 
There is zero substance to this ""show"". Actually I'd go as far as to say there is negative substance to this show, in the sense that I'm pretty sure you'll actively lose braincells while watching it. 
The episodes are about two minutes, consist of absolutely nothing, and I personally just find it disturbing to watch toddler-age (physically and mentally) catgirls run around in just barely strategically long enough t-shirts as a regular highschooler's pets. 
If you get your rocks off to this, I'm not gonna shame you, but... yeah. It is what it is, and what it is is in my opinion a bit of an unhealthy trend in the anime landscape.

10,3946,33,6.63997282519189,Campus romatic comedy,Jarinko Chie,"Jarinko Chie is a movie directed by Takahata in 1981. Based on the very popular manga by Etsumi HARUKI, it is about ten year old Chie, ""the most unfortunate girl in Japan"", who manages her family diner while her unemployed yakuza father and her mother are separated. This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy.  
 
The story is set in Osaka, which has a totally different culture from Tokyo. After the success of the movie, a TV series was made, and Takahata worked as the chief director. 
 
(Source: nausicaa.net)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Seinen']",none,"There are very few words needed to describe this movie. Let's say, it is a classic Takahata.  
 
Do not go in there expecting an emotionally heavy movie like 'Grave of the Fireflies' or even something fantastical like 'Tales of Princess Kaguya'. These movies were magnificent but you cannot compare them to Jarinko Chie because they aren't of the same genre and they aren't trying to achieve the same thing.  
 
'Chie' belongs to the same category as 'My Neighbours The Yamadas', meaning, for this genre, it is one of the best you can get out there. This movie is mature, it is deep but it is very well directed so that it is light and funny with just a pinch of drama. The story is simple and it is just as poignant as any other because that's a story which you believe, which you know can happen, which you know has happened. It is your average dysfunctional family, trying to get back together. This movie has characters who are real and believable and likable. They all have flaws and they all have their distinguished idiosyncrasies and they all come out as fully developed human beings which you can never get enough of.  
 
Sure, technical wise, it is nothing like 'Fireflies' but the style of the animation suits the mood of the story and the quality is actually pretty high. For the dub, the Japanese did a wonderful job but, and I'm gonna say this knowing that many might disagree or even be completely unaware of it, I believe the French dub is really good as well. Trust me, I'm a very demanding person when it comes to dubs and I must give credit where credit is due. The French dub was amazing. 
 
At the end of the day, 'Jarinko Chie' is just a pleasant story that you can watch over and over again because the characters are so true to themselves and you can easily relate to them. This was a movie of my childhood and shall forever remain my favourite from the master Takahata.

Having to transfer to a school without girls has been bad enough, but adding to his list of frustrations are boys staring at him all day long. However, he hopes that there may be girls around, since he ran into a lovely pink-haired girl on campus earlier that day. 
 
After being escorted to his dorm by his classmate, Yuujirou Shihoudani, he meets a student named Mikoto Yutaka, who looks eerily similar to the girl he saw previously. To his shock, he realizes Mikoto is the girl and confronts him about this revelation. Yuujirou divulges that he and Mikoto crossdress as part of their job: a school tradition in which attractive first years are chosen as idols called ""Princesses"" in order to boost the morale of the students—and because of his looks, Tooru has been chosen by the student council as their third Princess! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo']","Princess Princess is a story revolving around the lives of three boys chosen to dress up as girls at the all-boy school they attend, which also just happens to be the most elite school in the area. The main protagonist, Toru Kouno, has just transferred to a new all-boys school, Fujimori, after living with his uncle for a time. He is one such boy chosen to be one of the Hime (姫) or ""Princesses"", which is a tradition at the school in order to break up the monotony of life surrounded by nothing but males. Students (based on certain qualifications) are selected to be Princesses and are made to dress up as girls and attend school functions like this.
At the beginning of the story, there are already two such Princesses, Yuujirou Shihodani and Mikoto Yutaka, known as the Western Princess and Eastern Princess respectively, due to their room location. Toru is convinced into becoming a Princess soon after entering the school though once he accepted the job, he found it to be much more enjoyable than he thought.
","oh boy this is a special treat right here. 
 
the world is a fucked up and wonderful place. the lines are blurred and the freedom to disregard common sense is beautiful. i love this anime to death and everything it stands for.  
 
for this review i guess it might be nessecary to point out that i am a straight male (ok not 100% but i swear anime made me slightly bisexual). 
 
this anime is largely a yaoi fanservice anime, focusing mainly on genderbending. kinda like harem/ecchi but for girls, or just anyone who is a bit curious and confused. i don't know what i am so i  guess i'm confused. 
genderbending was a concept that i barely even knew existed until maybe a year ago, now i love that shit and i don't know why. i love traps, i love reverse traps too. and at this point i don't know if i'm a virgin because i like this shit, or if i like this shit because i'm a virgin. but somewhere in my brain it feels inherently logical to equate sexual desperation to an increase in sexual perversions. 
 
anyway lets get down to it. our protagonist tooru kouno transfers to an all boys high school, where there's been a secret and several decades long tradition to take the most attractive male students and dress them up as girls to become the rest of the schools mascots/eyecandy. this is sort of an inevitable perversion in an environment where there are no females around and just a bunch of pubertal teens going rampage. which is actually quite similar to my own life situation, except i'm not pubertal and it's just me alone in my college dorm room where only other guys live, and i very rarely go outside. 
 
but enough of my self deprecation. so this school has also found that making these attractive people crossdress impacts the school as a whole in a very positive way, due to the ""princesses"" cheering etc their sports teams are doing better than they ever would have if not for the school's princesses cheering. they also resolve conflicts with their effeminate mannerisms so everything is peaceful. in return these princesses also get cash money from the student council. 
 
the characters themselves have an exceptional amount of depth for being a yaoi fanservice, seeing shihoudani and tooru on their summer vacation gives you a taste of what their ""non-professional"" personalities are like, and their family problems etc.  
 
so much praise from my side but here is some criticism. i feel like they could have made this anime into something much more profound by for instance involving parts where the main characters go through identity crisis. due to all their acting, they start to forget who they really are/were, become confused and/or uncomfortable with their gender roles and have no idea what to identify as anymore. something like that, you get the picture. 
 
the concept of vanity is also a large part of this show, quite rarely seen in anime due to most characters being way more attractive than the average 3D person. but in this show the contrasts are vast. the regular people look unappealing and the princesses+sakamoto have big kind looking eyes and shit. and generally are better looking and more effeminate than most 3D women out there (jesus christ since when did i start comparing people in anime to real life people, i have become a monster). 
 
that is enough. just go watch it right now and become a more fucked up person than you were before.

          
 
       Helpful To watch Princess Princess you have to keep in mind, it's a bit weird. 
 
First off, the story. If we're really being honest here, it's kind of something out of a fangirl's mind. A prestigious all-boys school where a 'lucky few' are picked to dress up as princesses. Yes, you did hear that right, boys dressing up as princesses is the basic idea of this anime. And is there any more story than that? Not really. There's a bit of character development, one actual relationship involving one of the main characters and a teeny bit of shounen-ai to make the fangirls, who are undoubtedly watching, happy. So the story gets a 6 from me, it's not terrible but it kind of makes you go '...really?' to accepting the fact that, not only would this happen, but that anyone would agree to it (thought the perks the princesses get are nice). 
 
Don't be fooled by the anime's picture. The art is decent enough, but it's nothing special. I do have to give props to whoever designed the princesses outfits, at times they were really cute. Character design was alright, but it's all something you could find in any other anime, nothing is particularly unique. It's simply good and nothing more. 
 
As for sound, I'm a big fan of Romi Paku who does Yuujirou's voice and the other voice actors are good enough. The music was so-so. Usually I love or hate OPs and EDs, Princess Princess didn't give me much feeling either way. Sometimes I half-listened to them, other times I skipped them. I don't actively seek the songs out to listen to them, but they weren't bad, just not anything that stuck with me. 
 
The main characters are nothing special, but it's unlikely that you'll dislike them. They all have their own quirks and backgrounds which, for a series of only 12 episodes, were explored adequately enough to leave you hoping for, but not needing, more. So, the characters were handled well, but there honestly wasn't much to work with. They were pretty much average. 
 
But when it comes to enjoyment? Well, that's a 10. Despite all its flaws and drawbacks Princess Princess is a fun watch. If you're looking for a blatantly yaoi/shonen-ai series, that's not what it is. And if you're looking for something mind-blowing and new, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something that's short, sweet, and simple, then you're in the right place. 


          
 
       Helpful Princess Princess, 
 
Story: 
     The story is interesting... Makes me wonder if an all boys school actually does that... It's an interesting storyline but I really can't complain. Humor, humor, humor is basically what this anime tries to get you with. It does a good job, and it compensates for the man on man atmosphere. If your looking for some shoujo-ai you will be sadly disappointed.  
 
Art: 
    Art is good, no repeat scenes... thank god. 
 
Sound: 
    Sound is good, no problems. Character voices are perfect. 
 
Character: 
     Character's were great, all with individual problems, while caught up in a mess of school activities. Development was great, and you'll come to like maybe even love the characters :D 
 
Why did I like this anime? 
     It was funny, and a good breather between serious anime's (if you like more of the drama/sad type animes). However I was GREATLY disappointed there was no shoujo-ai between a ""certain"" two characters (once you see it you'll understand). The manga creator was ""advised"" not to make it into a shoujo-ai manga.

This anime is based on the manga with the same title; it begins as a comical parody of Tarzan. The first several episodes are comedies, but the rest of the series consists of (rather) serious episodes.

As the series progresses, the simple episodic gag premise is switched to a fighting premise. Although long battles and emotional development began to unfold, after the end of these battles, the series would return to its gag style, switching back to the fighting style with each new battle.
Although the story is called Jungle King Tar-chan, Tar-chan and his friends actually live on a savanna, and a jungle setting is never actually used.
","*First review and mild spoilers please bear with me*  
 
So Jungle no Ouja Taa-chan or Jungle King Tar-chan for the English title is an anime that aired in the 90s though the original source material, the manga started publishing in the 80s and got lots of more volumes than the anime only covered with it's 50 episodes length which to me is a good thing anyways given how awful this anime is but I'm sure my rating for this spoiled it already, yes I did end up hating it and let me explain my reasons as to why.  
 
Plot: 
 
Basically there is none but I didn't go into this expecting it anyways, true it starts out very episodic and heavily focused on the comedy aspect of it which they fail miserably at or maybe succeed at if you are 12 years old and like piss/poop jokes with the occasional boner jokes because those are just too funny or maybe it's just me having no humor these days. Then we got the serious arcs which are basically just tournament arcs which not many anime can pull off even making interesting and again I know this is an older anime but it still failed to even make me remotely interested in them when all that happens are repeat things like Tarzan and his friends always beating up the bad guys and the characters from that arc gets their happy endings and you never see them again as they are quickly forgotten and back to Africa again. Only the first arc was a bit different in the sense that another character from that arc now joined Tarzan's gang and became a regular but that's it. Otherwise it's Africa>new tournament arc>Africa>new tournament arc etc and it's never anything else so overall there really is no plot to this anime, no overarching nemesis or anything of the like only the tournament arc villains that are just there and they are never a real threat and once their arc is done so are they. I like my plot being good or even there be some at all but there is something I prioritize more than plot and that is what we come to next.  
 
Characters:  
 
Oh boy... where to even start when there was literally no character I liked in this anime, lets get the annoying ones out of the way before the bland like Jane...and in particular fat Jane because there is a difference as clearly showed in the past when NOT living in Africa she was kind, sexy and a total fit for Tarzan (cover really fooled me, false advertising yo!) but then somehow she got lazy and fat out in Africa in the present? I thought it would be the opposite that living without technology and society would make you work out more for stuff like food, building huts, just trying to survive in general but apparently not in this case. She constantly treats Tarzan like shit and gets jealous on every female introduced with their ALWAYS great bodies too she wishes she still have but never once do the fat joke go away as I thought it would do so if you read this review and that thought cross your mind then yeah, it never goes away and not her irredeemable behavior either. Atleast she got less annoying in the tournament arcs but not by much. And then we got our bland MC Tarzan that just take all this stuff, acts like an idiot all the time and being a pervert that always gets boners whenever he see the newly introduced female in each episodes and again the cover giving me the wrong impression because here I thought he would be sort of stoic badass that protects the jungle but I guess I've watched too much Fist of the North Star so maybe that's my fault for thinking that but still doesn't make his character any less bland, or maybe he's annoying too.  
 
When it comes to the supporting cast then they are all over the place like Helen, the first girl introduced that had a crush on Tarzan quickly got forgotten even though technically she was still there at their place in Africa but I guess no one cared anymore once they ditched her always when they took off to the country tournaments took place in never taking her with them, oh well. Ryou and Pedro are just fine, not too much personality to even distinguish between them tbh, both are fighters that just want to learn more and get stronger, nothing wrong with that but not too interesting either and shame you never get much background info on these characters for me to give a shit about them, given how little I did it could have a impact. There is a character I genuinely liked though (is this my first thing I mention I actually liked?!) and that's Anabebe and his antics, his jokes and rivalry with Tarzan was pretty funny I have to say and there is a point he gets rich and that makes him like an entirely different characters and you just never knew with that guy what he would do next, sadly he got underused a lot more later on as it became more about Tarzan in general but still for me he was my favorite character in this whole mess.  
 
Artstyle & Sound: 
 
What were they even thinking when making these character designs? alright the bodies are fine both for the male & female, they are all respectively either buff or busty and they are all sexy with the exception of Jane which somehow got shorter when she became fat because that's an anime trope thing I guess... but what is up with those derpy faces? their mouth to nose ratio are so close to each other to it just looks weird with most of them having a huge chin, especially noticeable on all the females, so click on Jane's character profile pic here on MAL and you'll notice immediately, every female and some males are like that in this and it really bothered me at the start but then I got used to it later on but still that's not a very good design and it being old or based on the original source is no excuse, the mouths could be just a little more closer to the chin like come on now. It's also weird when so many of them just looks the same but with different hairstyle/hair-colors, it's like they are all the same design with just added accessory on their head. Most of them do look different but there were just some minor characters that looked too much like some of the main cast so it made me confused sometimes but that was fine since it was only the minor characters that showed up in the tournament arcs.  
 
As for sound I'm sure they only really got the composer to make 2-3 different OSTs that gets used throughout the whole anime, also the first theme song gets used a lot in hype moments where Tarzan punch out someone and even though they always repeat I have to say I am a fan of that song and it did actually make those moments more hype even for me that disliked this anime those were still one of the better moments to those dragged out tournament arcs.  
 
So those are my thoughts, wouldn't really recommend it to anyone and it was 50 episodes long too and the manga cover much more than that and hey maybe that is better paced etc than this garbage but after this I wouldn't even want to give it a try and it's barely even translated anyways. Even to people that want their ""manly men"" fix from the 80/90s like Fist of the North Star, JoJo, Be A Man! Samurai School etc they won't get it here, trust me. 

          
 
       Helpful I'm surprised there's not a review for this already, given how despite how obscure it is, this series is still within the top 2000 on this site.  
 
Tar-chan is an obscure battle Shonen that barely receives any notice within not just the anime community, but even in Japan, with it's sole appearance outside of it's own anime/manga being it's titular protagonist being playable in two Jump crossover games. This lack of popularity would have you thinking this series isn't that good at all, wouldn't it? Well, you'd be wrong. 
 
Tar-chan's plot, like many Jump series, is one that transitions from a comedic series into a battle series with constantly stronger foes. Whilst this would make many shout ""Yet another Battle Shonen"", this contains a lot more than the previous sentence would give at face value. 
 
The plot of Tar-chan changes with each arc, though as an entirety, it follows the story of a Tarzan parody known as Tar-chan, a man raised in the African Savannah by a chimp named Eikichi and a Gorilla named Gori-san, as he protects his homeland from Poachers along with his friends the African Tribal warrior Anabebe, the French Karate expert Pedro and the Chinese martial arts Ki master Ryo Shihan. This isn't the only struggle he faces, with him also maintaining his rocky relationship with his overweight wife Jane, with him constantly pushing the line by looking at other women. 
 
The early episodes have an episodic setup and are used to introduce and flesh out the cast. When the China Arc starts, the series then shifts into an action series focused on 1 on 1 Tournament battles, with Tar-chan and his friends facing Ki using Kung-Fu experts, Cyborgs, Vampires and finally, a clone of Tar-chan. The previous sentence alone shows how much the series constantly changes, with this ability to keep it's plot fresh being what should keep you wanting to watch it. 
The set up of each arc itself is that of a standard Shonen, with the direction each series of battles in the arc shall go through being very straightforward. The series also relied on a lot of resolve power ups for Tar-chan, something unfortunately rampant in most Shonen series. What allows this plot to be good, however, is the drama found in the series. Whilst seeming like a silly series at first glance, it's in fact one with quite good settings and twists for each arc, with it's character writing for them being a point I'll elaborate on now. 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
This is one of the major pros to this series, as whilst many of the characters seem single-minded in their goals, they at least present enough emphasis on this to allow their personality to be fully established. The protagonist, Tar-chan, is in fact one of the most interesting Jump protagonists of the 90s due to him being a manly pacifist. His unique mix of honour, power and kindness is on a level comparable to such revered characters as Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin. The side characters of the series such as Tar-chan's brothers or the 5 strongest Vampires aren't too interesting, though they at least have the pro of presenting a good deal of manliness in their actions. Tar-chan's clone in the final arc, Iron Mask, presents perhaps the best use of character writing in this entire series, with him being a man with the psychology of a child, who's innocence and morals are twisted by his corrupt ""mother"". Many of the other enemies are tragic villains as well, though he was without a doubt the best written. 
 
Characters - 7/10 
 
The sound for the series is OK. Tar-chan's seiyuu is unfortunately, not a good choice, since he was a DJ with no experience in voice acting, which was critical in ruining some of the more emotional scenes. The other voices are fine, however. As for the soundtrack, it isn't too outstanding, though many of the tracks, particularly the instrumental renditions of the openings, are diamonds in the ruff. The openings and endings are pretty good too, with the 2nd opening being, in my opinion, one of the most catchy openings of the 90s, on par with any of the heavily praised openings of that decade. 
 
Sound - 7/10 
 
As for the art, this is one of the series flaws. Whilst it does an excellent job in the body proportions of both male and female characters, with great attention to showing muscular physiques, the facial designs are quite poor by comparison. 
 
Art - 5/10 
 
For the reasons I mentioned, ranging from it's creativity in changing the plot's settings, the character writing and it being a manly series, I found it to be a fairly enjoyable watch, though it would be a lot better if there were more reliable subs for it. Hopefully, it will get licenced by Discotek or another good official subber of non-mainstream anime.  
 
Enjoyment - 7/10 
 
Overall, Tar-chan is an obscure, yet creative series that deserves far more attention. If you enjoy battle Shonen, high variation in settings or simply series of the MANLY genre, this is one to give consideration to.

","Anime is not always what it appears to be.  Truthfully this shows that any anime that is created with passion can be a joy to watch. The hook for this anime for me was the unique comedy and wanting to find out what situations the characters manage to get themselves into.  
 
Story: The story follows some clich&eacute;s but is extremely original at times in episodes that are stand-alone. I liked that there&rsquo;s a healthy portion of the series that didn't use cliffhangers to keep you hooked which allowed me not to feel guilty by stopping and picking up later. I&rsquo;m impressed that they turned some clich&eacute;s upside down and actually had references to other anime within the show. 
 
Art: The art is rather good in most respects; I like the style they use quite well for the characters and battle effects. There are some rather weird designs for some characters though, for example, they may wear very odd clothes since some of them have weird fetishes or even no clothes with a trademark elephant animation covering up the guy&rsquo;s private area. 
 
Sound: I loved the opening and ending that this series used. They had a great upbeat feeling and they never made me feel like skipping them. I enjoyed the music played in the backgrounds, the voice actors&rsquo; performances, and effects used for the sounds. The music was used in a nice way to enhance the tension or comedy of the dramatically different situations. 
 
Character: I found a large amount of the characters to be interesting and likeable mainly Youko and Keita. Youko has a quick temper and Keita gives into his male fantasies in ways that are rather humorous.  
 
Enjoyment: It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable anime particularly when it doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously and the ecchi is a nice bonus for it. The yaoi-ish humor my turn some people off from enjoying it fully though. For others it&rsquo;s a bonus since it&rsquo;s definitely a large part of the comedy that I enjoyed. 
 
Overall: There is much fun to be had with this anime and it&rsquo;s highly recommended for people who want to watch an anime with a large amount of original comedy and enjoyable characters. This is one of the few anime that I would recommend anyone to who wants to see something not mainstream.  


          
 
       Helpful The best way to describe it is a romantic comedy. And for everyone that hoped for an ending were Urusei Yatsura characters Lum and Ataru finally admit their feelings and start acknowledging each other then this is the anime for you. Although it has a lot of fillers there is a pretty solid (and funny) main story and a sort of resolution at the end. There are plenty of questions left unanswered (that is why it gets just 9) probably because they hoped for a second season or because they did not know in what direction to go with the manga still unfinished. Regardless of this it is very funny and the ending is acceptable.  As graphic I would say it does not try to be the most realistic but it is still acceptable (unlike Naruto) . Where the anime really shines though is at character development. Although the first few episodes it will seem it is none there is plenty of it. Some may believe this is harem type but it is not, it is just a romantic comedy.

          
 
       Helpful Inukami are dog spirits, and Keita comes from a family that uses these spirits along with their own spiritual powers to rid the world of evil. Youko is Keita`s Inukami, but she`s not like the others. Not obedient nor respectful, she is a big burden on Keita financially. Youko does, at the very least, love him. She is prone to jealousy though, and extremely possessive, not to mention starved for attention, but Keita is a free, perverted soul who does his best to escape her grasp and hit on all the women he comes across. It`s too bad for him that Youko can teleport and control fire. 
 
A vast majority of Inukami is episodic. Youko and Keita get caught in situations while extinguishing evil at the request of others. Very slowly, a central story line involving Youko`s father and a perverted wizard develops, but it works within the episodic Inukami framework. The smaller subplots all involve Youko and Keita abusing each other. Keita takes advantage of his Inukami`s naivete to hide his unfaithful intentions while Youko, ever the sadist, will often tease Keita into situations where he`s the most vulnerable, only to suddenly humiliate him. She`s not beyond outright delivering simple and straightforward vengeance when she feels wronged either. Youko, unlike most tsundere`s, makes it clear to all that she wants Keita, or rather, she already sees him as her property. Her innocent notions of romance, cuddling, going on dates, receiving courting gifts, gives her sadistic nature a playfulness that makes it easy to laugh at. Her favorite form of torture is teleporting Keita out of his clothing, buck naked in the middle of the street. It may sound harsh, but Keita`s closet exhibitionism keeps him from being traumatized. Youko`s violence doesn`t stem from misunderstandings ala Love Hina. Keita`s punishments are his just deserts. His humorous ambivalence, or even outright aversion to Youko`s tenderness alone warrants a smack. Add to that his shameless sex drive and a pompous chauvinism, and it feels good to see the bastard hurt a little. 
 
For a harem girl, Youko is quite a joy to watch. She`s innocent at heart, mischievous with her lover, but at the same time easy to anger, and frighteningly belligerent. Her abusiveness with Keita is a slap on the wrist compared to the hell she`d unleash if prompted by her jealousy and possessiveness. The gloves are off for people who stand between her and her cozy relationship with Keita. It might sound biploar, a murderous violence with innocent affection behind it, but it all makes sense under her territorial nature; almost like a nurturing beast protecting its offspring. 
 
Inukami is splashed with harem drama, but its sense of humor is its boon. At least half of the scenes that are built like a corny attempt at a tear jerker are, at the last moment, twisted into one of its ridiculous jokes. Aside from the lovers` spats of Youko and Keita, the humor in Inukami is totally inappropriate, and i mean that in a good way. The Inukami world is full of freaks with all kinds of sexual ""hobbies"". The villain in the first episode is a restless soul who shoots people with a beam from his genitals, stripping them of their clothing, and he`s one of the tamer ones. 
 
The minor characters; the freaks, perverts, Youko`s ridiculous father and the exhibitionist wizard display their rather nasty perversions so openly and proudly, so earnestly that it`s hard not to laugh at how harmless yet disgusting they are. One of them is a salary man, complete with a suit, who spends all his screen time tied up in bondage fashion with ropes, screaming to be punished. He doesn`t even untie himself to walk. Most of the real cast was quite a drag though. Keita`s cousin`s 10 Inukami, which he encounters quite often, are a gang of shamelessly unoriginal harem characters. Keita himself is something of a cliche harem anime lead: perverted most of the time, but unnaturally caring at others. Keita is a functional, if simple character when he is a skirt chaser, but his sex driven mind is so extreme that it`s hard to see him in any other role, much a considerate prince charming that the girls swoon over. The kindness is such a sudden and contradictory shift that it feels unnatural. 
 
As fun as it is to watch Inukami`s twisted humor, it is just as unbearable when it doesn`t have the good sense to stay away from drama. Towards the end, a story that actually takes itself seriously develops, which peaks at a long and melodramatic battle between the heroes, and a real villain. Not some exhibitionist or pervert, but maybe the embodiment of evil itself. Putting aside its unbearable cheesiness, it just feels completely out of place in the established Inukami world. It begs the question why a harem comedy based on perversion of all sorts suddenly wants a Sailor Moon-esque ending. 
 
Inukami is quite long, and eventually Youko`s violence becomes more and more simple. It is too often devoid of the trickery by both parties that made the abuse fun earlier in the series. Keita doesn`t even attempt to escape Youko before setting his lecherous sights on some other girl. In fact, he`ll holler at girls when she`s right next to him, evidently, asking to be burned to a crisp. 
 
-- 
 
It`s easy to recommend the first 2 episodes to anyone who`s okay having a little male nudity with their fan service, but the humor becomes more and more tainted with standard harem fare as the series moves on, and the ending takes an epic turn for the terrible.

Kazuya forcefully hires Mai in order to pay for the camera and replace his injured assistant. From that point on, Mai begins to learn about the paranormal world and the profession of ghost hunting. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Shoujo']","Ghost Hunt follows the ghost hunting adventures of Mai Taniyama, a first-year high school student who becomes involved with Shibuya Psychic Research (SPR) and its young manager, Kazuya Shibuya.

","Main   
This is a great anime. The word “underdog” doesn't even seem to justify the level of neglect or oversight this series has received or is it better said, the degree of attention this series has NOT received from the anime mass media outlets....and partly this is understandable because there ARE bigger and better animes out there, BUT STILL! I mean, I subscribe to a lot of the anime magazines, not to mention, I visit many of the anime news sites and I don't remember this show getting too much coverage.....if any at all. Which is a shame because this a very cool show that's not only funny and intriguing but has a very cute cast of characters and puts considerably unique spin on it's take on both the Horror and Mystery genres.  
 
 Art-Style  
Standard....which is fine. I don't expect to be 'WOW'ed by every anime I watch, nor to I want to be 'WOW'ed visually by an anime only to find out later that the story lacked any depth, substance and/or integrity....or it was just completely and totally benign intellectually.  
 
 Sound  
I really don't remember the various music throughout the series.... I just liked the fact that both the OP and ED were not your standard run-of-the-mill J-POP/ballads and kind of reminded me of The X-Files. This series was watched in Japanese, and the Japanese Voice cast did a great job.  
 
 Story  
Ghost Hunt is told in a unique way by having each case [story] broken down into chapters, some of the chapters are long [3-4 episodes] and others are short [1 episode]....for some reason I'm impressed by this. Who knows why. Ghost Hunt falls into three main anime categories: School, Mystery and Horror. I am really liking this Mystery and Horror aspect of the show, It is a welcome sight to see a relatively clean[non-sexually tinged] yet still entertaining anime that's able to hold the viewer's attention with it's solid narration and intriguing mysteries. I think the last really really REALLY good anime mystery I saw were Monster and then Gantz! ....And well, about the scary part, it's not scary as in the Western [US/UK] sense of the word where it's all about how gory a show can get, but in the Japanese sense....just like how The Ring or The Grudge [the originals Japanese versions] were scary, in that creepy, goosebumps kind of way.........and I'm not the type to get scared or unnerved very easily. So that says A LOT!!!  
 
 Cast/Characters  
There are a lot of interesting and very likable characters introduced throughout the series. All the main characters are very attractive and have very nice personalities which kept the show light-hearted, despite it being a Horror/Mystery. I especially like the two main characters of the show: Mai—with her spunky can-do attitude she reminds me of Sakura from Card Captors, I also like her haircut which is very cute. I also liked Naru, frankly because I thought he looked AMAZINGLY HOT!! I love the Black hair/Blue eyes combo He is the epitome of bishounen. I liked his cool demeanor and even the way he was drawn. But the chemistry between all the main characters were nice.  
 
 Worth it or NOT?  
This a very admirable show. It has a lot of creepy moments but it was also very entertaining and fun to watch. I was never bored with it nor did I roll my eyes in disgust at it's “sheer predictability”—like I do with so many shows—nope, no eye-rolling because there was never a predictable moment with this series. This is worth buying and re-watching, especially around Halloween Season....or if you are an insomniac like me, then late at night [around 2 AM] in your very dark bedroom. 

          
 
       Helpful Hence the ""old"" 4chan saying about how ""Nobody Talks About GOOD Anime.""  (Because, you know.  What gets the attention nowadays is what's bad, controversial, done by ""attention whores,"" and ultimately empty and disposable.) 
 
Ghost Hunt did its job well for something that tries to be ""old school"" scary as opposed to ""monsters at every turn"" scary.  The people behind it actually try to play up the actual SUSPENSE.  And it's done using characters that actually come off as PEOPLE rather than ""humanized cliches"" I've been sick of seeing. 
 
The story arcs within Ghost Hunt are actually humane and touching when they want to.  If you ""have a heart,"" you'd be able to feel for the main characters (as the story progresses) and find out why they act how they act. 
 
I might as well tell you this story about how I was living in my studio apartment back in Sacramento before I moved to Sparks (NV) last year.  The door to the bathroom made a ""knock"" sound whenever I was using the shower; and I wasn't ruling out ""poltergeistal activity"" as one of the reasons. 
 
(That story won me a Ghost Hunt DVD boxset, and a book about a spooky Texas house, from FUNimation.)

          
 
       Helpful The story i give it 8/10 there was some really good and amazing cases but that todays the end the suspension stopped and that was kind of disappointing. But overall it was quite amazing not too scary. 
The sound was good i give it a 9/10. Sound is important in a horror anime so the producers did this part very well. 
The art was alright not too shabby, nothing special in particular. 
The characters was ok, kind of cliche shows the guy who's cold hearted and anti social. The girl expresses her feelings and this can get annoying. She also gets saved quite a lot and she's reckless. 
I enjoyed this anime a lot because it was the first time i watched a horror anime and it was really good. 
Overall it's enjoyable and i give it a 9/10.

","Anime was pretty good at the start, it had a dark feel and there was a fair bit of action. After that it wasn't as good, the dark feel at the start of the series wasn't there anymore and there was less action as well.  Honestly, the action isn't too important to me, but it was pretty good at the start. Although the fact that there was less of a dark atmosphere later on in the series kinda made it less enjoyable, as that was what I came for.

       Helpful CUBED X CURSED X CURIOUS REVIEW: 
 
MINDSET: 
You should already know what's coming Your way once You see, “Light Novel Adaptation” popping up the back of Your hand, its either from the Cows Buttocks, or average stones. 
 
SYNOPSIS: 
C3 starts out in regular modern day Japan with our generic protagonist Haruaki, at one day he soon finds a  mythically giant black cube posted by Your local mail man, soon he notices that the giant cube can transform into female loli known as “Fear”. It was then found out that her cube can not only resize into the palm of her hand for plot convenience, but it can also be used as a tool of 100 torture devices. (BDSM style! Yay, kids!) 
 
 
REVIEW: 
We all know that light novel adaptations are always aiming for “Mass Appeal” since that is the one thing that always tend to sell! (AKA: The casual audience) Consequently, C3   slightly “Differs” from this case as it is surprisingly good on paper. However, for me to summarise such issues, the show is also trying to also be ecchi, which has the tendency to break a show if it has a more mature, interesting and serious nature. This is no exception. 
 
Don't expect deep and complex villains. They are all completely lacking in depth, and are often just one liner character. Like is it ever in any way, shape or form that the first villain is just this random axe wielding  psychopath who keeps crying out “Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” Every 5 seconds when she's fighting a woman will equal character depth and complexity? No! 
 
Tropes are a thousand times more overused, and replicated. So (obvious fact) the light novel adaptation tends to carry: One dimensional villains? Check! Character Archetypes? Check! Tsunderes? Check! Fan Service? Check! Endings that leave one or more plot holes? Damn hell & Check! And  this is the biggest issue to be summarised with this show here, it feels far too much like a light novel adaptation, yet it has an interesting premise and a fairly good amount of potential to be a “Good Light Novel, with the Adaptation” Buuuut Your run of the mil light novel is bound to fail. 
 
Speaking of fanservice, there is a bit too much fanservice to take this show onto more serious and mature levels. The fact that Kirka wears permanent bondage under her clothes will not mean as a symbolic reference of her sexual suffering and how she is trapped in pain unless if the show shuts up the fanservice, takes a serious look on the audience, and respects it like an actual man! 
 
These kinds of concepts may look very nice on both paper, and in action if done in properly mature manner. However, its is simply lazy to take the risk, and create a potentially good and interesting show! For goodness sakes! The show is not even trying to make these concepts as interesting and thought provoking as it is meant to be, leaving it into Ecchi abyss... 
 
Silver Link doesn’t have many renowned or popular works, but its safe to say that the budget will remain very consistent for these 12 episode series, and C3 tends to have pretty above average Animation, the action scenes and cool powers they use create some pretty energetic looking battles. The colours they use all have a nice shiny finish to them so everything is all nice and colourful. The character designs aren’t anything to be especially proud of, since there quite generic and only the female designs only stand out. 
 
Though I think Silver Link is trying to copy SHAFT STYLE at certain points, but I don't really think its ever overused as much as Shafts own work. Though I don't think it really ever gives out extra points for that since those moments are kind of sparse, but not elusive.  
 
OST is again is just as above average as the Animation, with only one note worthy song that seems to stick around Your mind, and the rest fitting in with the mood, with Your usual pianos, trumpets, drums etc. Though it seems to be quite a large OST for 12 good songs that seem fairly on par with the Animation. OP is above average and fairly catchy, while its rather advisable to skip the ED. 
 
LEGACY: 
Such an Underrated show that never really managed to be seen upon masses. Season two is bound to never be released because Silver Link can't profit enough milk from it, but I suppose I'll remember this Light Novel Adaptation though failing and hitting its face on a wall, for having a bit more ambition than something like Mahouka which aims too much for MASS APPEAL. 
 
SCORES: 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL CHARACTERS SUCK. (cool ideas though) 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL PLOTS SUCK. (though some decent foreshadowing at times BTW) 
6.5/10- Well made and brightly coloured pieces of imagery but note bing too Shafty, but good Animation is good Animation. 
7/10- Mainly for 12 good songs on par with the Animation. 
3/10- Lacking enjoyability because it does'nt take good advantage of its potential, and fanservice. 
 
FINALE: 4.5/10 it has cool ideas and the budget to go with it, but fails in the long run. Because of fan service and the attempt of MASS APPEAL.

          
 
       Helpful I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character's hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. ** 
 
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the 'cube'. Kubrick being 'Cube' and 'Brick'.. get it? Get it?! :D 
 
'Yachi Haruaki', the main male protagonist in the story. ""Yachi"" in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I'd have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever. 
 
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing 'torture' machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical 'Swordfight' anime or 'Trigger-happy' anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations. 
 
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, 'Muramasa' until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) 'big-breasted' friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from 'Shakugan no Shana', and Siesta from 'Zero no Tsukaima'). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is 'Muramasa'. 
 
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear's dance really cute and charming. 
 
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10 
 
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear's hair shines rainbow. It's very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion. 
 
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier. 
 
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

","Ask yourself, why do you watch a fan-service anime? 
Is it primarily to enjoy an interesting and thought provoking plot, or is it primarily for the cute anime girls, the fan-service atmosphere, and the eyecandy? 
 
If you watch a fan-service anime for the latter reason, like me, i think you will enjoy this anime a great deal. 
 
I admit, i don't really care about the plot. But it doesn't put me off the anime either, and since it's so light it makes plenty of room for cute events and plenty of fanservice, so i don't consider it's non-impactfulness to nessecarily be a bad thing. Sometimes sacrifices must be made. 
 


          
 
       Helpful See before watching MakenKi one must ask his or herself “am I a pervert?” if you are and you’re not ashamed to admit it MakenKi is the show for you. MakenKi is one with Ikki Tousen and Sekrei and if you’ve seen those shows you know what to expect from here. You get plenty of panty shots plus all the bewbie jiggle you can handle but frankly that’s all you’re going to get out of this show. 
On the visual front MakenKi, like almost all anime made this century looks good. It’s bright with vibrant colors. The animation and fight scenes are pretty average some of them I didn’t know what the hell was going on but all the fights had cool neon lights and shit like that that took the attention away from actual animations in the fight scenes. Audio wise the show is average, there wasn’t a track that really stood out to me while watching the show and the opening just felt like a generic anime theme song, although the ending song was pretty good. I watched the show in sub so I can’t really comment on how good the Japanese voice actors were. 
Honestly there really isn’t a plot here. No tournament arc, no evil villain trying to take over the country. The story just revolves around the daily lives of our characters and the experiences that they have in the security committee. Now this would fine for most anime, plenty of shows plots only consist of the misadventures that the main characters go through, and the show is carried by the chemistry that the cast has with each other. The problem with MakenKi is the lack of interesting characters. Every girl you meet in MakenKi you’ve meet ten times before in better anime the male protagonist has no noticeable traits that separate him from any other guy in the harem genre. This is the problem, when you focus on putting so many butts and boobs in the show and not focusing why they are there in the first place you just leave the audience feeling unaffected and unmoved that anything that happens in the show because we can’t identify with the characters. 
 Look Makenki is only for a specific audience, those who love fan service. However even if you’re a part of that audience it’s still an average show overall and if you don’t like fan service like me then MakenKi will hold no value for you and is just be a waste of time.

The first episodes of this first season follow the story, but when you go on the plot is left for fanservice! The critic is generally bad but for me is excessive, it's true that isn't a serious anime, but for relaxing is nice.

Enjoyment - 10 
 
To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself! 
Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women? 
 
Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you!

          
 
       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.  
 
Art: 7 
I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.  
 
Sound: 8 
I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, Chōnōryokusha). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, Genseki). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, Majutsushi), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.

One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Well this show has been a waste of my time. A broken promise of a clash between science and magic, a protagonist that fights more with his mouth than his supposedly almighty hand, unnecessary side stories and fanservicing. The only saving grace were a few certain arcs concerning the science side. I would go on but I'm too lazy to continue.  
 
Jk I'm gonna continue. 
 
The second season continues off where the season one ended and it goes even more downhill from there. To start off, the protagonist gets all even more whiny. I'm fine with him punching women in the face. What I'm not fine with is him constantly berating anyone before punching them. If they wanted to hear you whine so much they would have gone to a counselor, a teacher, to anyone but you. And his ability. For someone whose ability is actually limited to his physical range, he sure wins a lot of obviously disadvantageous battles. Oh he can stop my single ranged attack with his hand? Well I guess I  have to resort to attacking head-on instead of attacking with multiple projectiles or balls or whatever that one hand only couldn't possibly block since that will spoil the story. 
 
Next comes a shitload of characters. Yea sure the story is about a city and its inhabitants and its enemies and allies blah blah. Characters keep popping up from nowhere just to add tension and surprise to the plot and then they disappear. Even my imaginary coffee maker has more development than them. Did I mention the harem? Every lady/girl the dull protagonist comes across is mesmerised by his mouth that won't stop yapping. Honestly I don't see the appeal in this character and why the females in this story are so attracted to him. Oh he saved you with his speech and promptly ignores you after that so you should be attracted to him. K can. Back to the characters. Index is a broken recorder, and the rest are insignificant. Except for the Mikasa people. They are slightly more interesting. 
 
Then comes the plot with more holes than a swiss cheese. So much jargon is unexplained or explained poorly, leaving me confused at times. Wait scratch that. Make it all the time. The arcs are incoherent and the transition is lacking. Jumping from science to magic does not equate to science meets magic, contrary to what this anime believes. Jumping from relevant but boring story arc to standalone and equally boring arc is also stupid. The plot is never here, nor there or anywhere for the matter. And so much story telling. Let's stop fight halfway to reveal a sad backstory. Or some mumbo-jumbo about how some claptrap works. Yea sure all that exposition is needed for the story to progress but isn't there a better way to present it than in the middle of a fight?  
 
And the fights. Any fight involving the counselor-wannabe is sure to leave him pretty much unharmed. No signs of a broken limb or bone or any injury too serious. Only bruises and coughing up blood even after being thrown around like a ragdoll. No problemo I understand your body can dispel injuries. Then when it comes to Accelerator it goes all grim and bloody and dead like wow finally something realistic. Thumbs up for that. If only the protagonist's fights were more like Accelerator's. But please dump the unnecessary internal melodrama. 
 
The sound was horrible too. Constant droning of toma touma toommaaa, that sound effect when protagonist punches some mishmash etc. I could make better effects in the toilet. But the art though. That was decent. 
 
So, in conclusion, um, not to be mean, but the story was splattered everywhere and the technical stuff was pretty bad, except for the art. The only decent parts were arcs relating to Accelerator. So yea, this may be seen as a rant. Maybe it is.

10,24,42,5.997439931435305,Campus romatic comedy,School Rumble,"Just the words ""I love you,"" and everything changes—such is the nature of the bittersweet trials of high school romance. Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to confess her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight. 
 
 School Rumble  is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","School Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.
Although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.
School Rumble Z, the ""parallel comedy"", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from Max or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.
","I have loved OURAN HOST CLUB and upon looking for another High School anime, I stumbled upon School Rumble. Well, at first look, it really did look like a nice enjoyable anime... 
 
... but I was dead wrong. I'm sorry but it was really dreadful, and the fact that there was really no particular character development at the least. The story was in shambles. Yes, it did follow this sort of story outline, but did anybody notice that the main story-- whatever happened to Karasuma-kun in the middle of the story? he seemed totally forgotten..what the heck? After all those what happened, the conclusion was very weak and really didn't offer much. I checked out the 2nd season, and it was the same thing. 
 
This anime really has the potential to be a good one. It should have been a good given such a nice material to work on.

          
 
       Helpful There are only two kinds who watched School rumble one are the people who loved the series and others who hated the whole series. From my rating you can see I'm the latter. 
 
I fell for the ratings of 10 and the ranking 298 and started watching but had worst experience. There are plenty of other mediocre series way far better than this.  
 
There is no plot, I hated the heroin most annoying lead, hero is more like one of the background images popped as a character once in while and the delinquent comic relief. 
 
I completed whole 1st, 2nd and 3rd terms still I hate the whole series. I like watching empty series without any plot just for laughs but this anime made me hate myself for picking it up to watch. 
 
Character designs are bad, most of the characters are annoying or not much presence.  
 
This is a warning for those who want to watch the series for better or worse DON'T WATCH IT.

          
 
       Helpful “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.” 
-Tony Robbins 
 
Miscommunication happens often in our everyday lives. When we miscommunicate with each other there are several outcomes that can happen. People may laugh, they may cry, or they may become angry and unhappy. Now what do you get when those miscommunications mixed with high school crushes? Well you end up with the insanity that is School Rumble. This comedy anime is one built around the two main characters, Harima and Tenma, as they attempt to confess to the ones that they love. Unfortunately, the entire cast, including themselves, are as dense as stone. 
 
Story 
Now the story of School Rumble is interesting in how it’s told. It’s an episodic comedy in the sense of Seitokai Yakuindomo, but also has an overarching story of a love triangle mixed in with subplots galore. Each episode has three scenarios which are conjoined at times in a continuous story, yet at the same time it feels like several different comedy skits. At the beginning, the show is all over the place with only one setting in mind, but quickly progresses to an intertwined story that builds on each part. We see Harima's journey to find himself along with trying to win the love of Tenma, while Tenma tries to the win the love of Karasuma, while Karasuma...is just Karasuma. That's the basics of the main story in a nutshell. Sadly, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and we hope the producers were planning on a second season when they made it. The show left off on one of the best episodes of the series with a cliff-hanger that ultimately could change the story's main purpose completely... But rather than produce a satisfactory conclusion, the episode zooms out giving a sales pitch for another season. This ending left us, as viewers, unsatisfied and slightly perturbed. 
 
Characters 
The characters, with the exception of a few, were quite interesting. Harima evolves as a character through all of his crazy antics, yet at the same time, he manages to retain his usual thick-headedness. He grows from the people he interacts with and shows himself to not be a delinquent, but rather who treats those he values with care. Characters like this are common and well-developed throughout the story. Though in every great cast there will always be a few characters that feel like they don’t fit for people.  Tenma and Karasuma are the two we agreed upon as those outliers for School Rumble. Tenma is thick-headed to the point where it isn't funny anymore. Karasuma, though, is the main offender. His character was made to be a bland stereotype, however, the producers went too far, or rather, left too much lacking. He was, to put it mildly, just a weird focus for Tenma’s affection. The writers even realized this and stated that they will have to bring him back at some point since they've had him in the background him for too long. Despite these flaws with two characters, they do go well with the overall group dynamic, and help to produce a few extremely funny scenes at times.  
 
Animation 
School Rumble had a generic animation, with rough lines at times. However, all the while the anime never takes itself too seriously, which does show When they want to show an important or touching scene, everything gets brighter and the scene seems to have more work put into the drawings of the background. This animation style branches out into other types like a comedy does at times—going from realistic, to simple, to rough lines, to smooth lines. With these constantly changes, it will keep your attention fixed on the show. 
 
Music 
All in all, excluding the music during important scenes and opening and ending, there is nothing memorable about the background music. The more sappy music has an enjoyable soft pop feel to it that is emotional yet uplifting at the same time. This results in not a somber atmosphere, but allows the listener to be happy with a tear in their eye. The opening is a quite catchy song, and easily brings you into the anime as a whole. The opening allows you to see both the serious and comedic nature behind the show. The ending is merely fan service with a surprisingly realistic song. If you pay attention to the lyrics, it talks about what happens throughout the entire show, ""Boys will not understand girls."" which is how an ending should tie in. 
 
Enjoyment 
The comedy was fun and did a lot to give to the overall impression of the anime. The number of Japanese jokes was large, which was both simplistic and funny ranging from cultural to stereotyping; as well as school humour and various religious references. We enjoyed it thoroughly as we followed this tale of growth for a young man.  
 
School Rumble was an enjoyable romp of miscommunication. It was able to entrance you through the characters crazy antics coupled with their relationships with one another and their struggles with said relationships. This cast didn’t need the most well detailed story to bring themselves to life. Despite being well planned with a basic overarching story, we felt that it needed more impact in order to bring out the show’s full potential. The comedy was refreshing and executed, with very little characters giving hiccups in execution along the way. The songs are quite catchy as well, but are certainly nothing remarkable. School Rumble is an exceptional comedy, but if the producers had made some tweaks here and there, it could have been one of the best comedies currently made.  
 
Value 
“It takes time to understand people.” And in this show, the cast all seem to have a pre-conceived notions of the ones they love. This anime shows the negative side of crushes—for even if you are attracted to someone, you should never assume you know them entirely. As this series shows, making that mistake will lead to pain in the future, which is a message that everyone can relate to.

Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","If I hadn't known Crayon Shin-chan from the TV Series, I'd probably not enjoyed this. 
This movie is really primary for kids, but evenso it was very enjoyable, because of the funny and quirky characters and the unpredictable plot (and the catchy songs). A nice movie to enjoy if you don't want to think about...well anything at all.  
 
The only thing I didn't like was the kind of forced ""drama"", but oh well, Shin-chan IS for kids after all.

Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei  is a satirical slice-of-life comedy set in the modern day, covering various aspects of Japanese life and culture through Nozomu and his interactions with his students: Kiri Komori, a recluse who refuses to leave the school; Abiru Kobushi, an enigma who frequently arrives to class with severe and mysterious injuries; the hyper-optimistic Kafuuka Fuura, Nozomu's polar opposite; and several other unusual girls, all of whom are just as eccentric as their teacher. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen']","Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a sakura tree. He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees. She decides to nickname Nozomu ""Pink Supervisor"" (桃色係長, Momoiro Kakarichō), and offers to pay him fifty yen to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his homeroom class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.
Each chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of amakudari, the practice of ""descending"" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu ""descending"" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, omiai, normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the negative aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a non-sequitur gag or piece of fan service.
While ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the Taishō period, the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the Shōwa period. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taishō liberalism, Taishō Romanticism (see Japanese literature) and Taishō arts (see Hanshinkan Modernism). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a kimono and hakama (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the anachronistic appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taishō period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the modern girl trend, which is a break from the Meiji period and signifies the style of the Taishō period.
Chapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble karuta cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted kiri-e style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of katakana (rather than hiragana) as okurigana. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though Emperor Hirohito were still alive, such that Heisei 20 (the twentieth year of Emperor Akihito's reign, or 2008 by the Gregorian calendar) becomes ""Shōwa 83"".

STORY - Story? What story? This is a slice-of-life series and it is based entirely around hilarious character shenanigans, though if you ever see characters like this in your life, I'd be a little worried. Still, there are a few reoccurring themes revolving around anime and otaku snark and satire of Japanese lifestyle, culture, politics, media, literature, etc. They also frequently make fun of themselves, which is incredibly amusing. It's all amazingly well done and highly entertaining, I assure you. A bit of warning through, if you try and pause to read every single thing written in the background for scenes, you will turn 20 minute episodes into 40 minute episodes. 

          
 
       Helpful Ah, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei! Before I begin, let me state that I watched this anime in two days while at a sleepover with some friends, which means some episodes were watched really late into the night/morning. This may have affected my perception of the anime to some degree due to severe sleepiness. Also, this sleepover happened about 6 weeks before I wrote this review, so I may not remember every little detail about what I am discussing. Forgive me. ^^&rsquo; 
 
Story- Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei&rsquo;s (SZS) story revolves around a group of schoolgirls (OK, there is one moderately important male student, but no one REALLY cares) and their suicidal teacher. Together the class and their teacher engage in everything from normal classroom conversations to stalking each other, to hibernating in their teacher&rsquo;s (Itoshiki-sensei) house for a night. Each student in the class has one dominant character trait and these traits are usually set up so that they make fun of or satirize some aspect of modern culture. For example, we have Kafuka Fuura, an overly optimistic girl who is so bent on looking on the bright side of things that she is completely blind to all the horrible things that may be happening around her. She embodies the popular notion that optimism is the best way to go through life, but this optimism made her so na&iuml;ve that she cannot even begin to comprehend the evils, sadness, or injustices in the world- including her own parents&rsquo; suicide. Another such student is Kiri Komori, a hikikomori (or shut-in) who has stayed inside and skipped school for so long that her skin actually glows white. She embodies the increasing number of young people in Japan who have become hikokomoris themselves and have thus isolated themselves from any form of human contact. Then, of course, we have Itoshiki-sensei himself. He is a man so pessimistic that he attempts to commit suicide on a regular basis. This is most likely not only satirizing middle-aged adults going through mid-life crises and such, but I also interpreted it as satirizing the increasingly popular &ldquo;emo&rdquo; movement in young people today which glorifies and romanticizes depression and angst (a disgusting way of life, if you ask me). As you can see, these characters have quite a bit of depth to them and the various situations they are thrown into are usually hilarious and funny to watch. However, these situations and stories are not always funny, most likely due to the content being lost in translation during the subtitling process. This makes for some fairly boring parts in the anime as well. 
 
Art- SZS is definitely unique and stylized. The artwork used in the anime makes use of more subdued colours that fit well for SZS&rsquo;s dark thematic overtones that serve as a basis for its comedic elements. A fair number of scenes in the anime were done in different styles of art, including scenes that made SZS look like an old silent film or some trippy video from the 80s. This range of artistic styles was both interesting and challenging to watch at the same time. 
 
Sound- It has been too long since I&rsquo;ve seen SZS to properly comment on its sound. Nonetheless, there are two parts of the show that I clearly remember in terms of sound/music- the two opening/ending themes (Ito toshite Jiku ga Bureteiru and Zessei Bijin). I enjoyed both these songs for the way they integrated 1940&rsquo;s swing music with J-pop (Zessei Bijin) and for their fast-paced hardcore melody and instrumental track being juxtaposed against the voices of young Japanese schoolgirls who will take over the melody of the song every now and then. Both songs make for great listens and I will often have them blasting in the car when driving long distances. XD 
 
Characters- I have already went to a good amount of depth with the characters in the &ldquo;Story&rdquo; portion of my review. Thus, in summary, the characters are interesting, diverse, and each play in an important part in representing various negative aspects of modern Japanese culture (even though they are taken to the extreme in the case of SZS). Awesome characters- too bad they don&rsquo;t develop much during the plot (not that it matters much in a comedy-esque anime). 
 
Enjoyment- SZS was a fun and enjoyable anime to watch, especially in a group of friends. It made all the funny scenes all the funnier to watch and then allowed us to take them further as we made up our own jokes based on the anime after watching it. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, I was fighting sleep during the later episodes which made some of them seem too lengthy and stretched out in some cases. That combined with the fact that some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny just didn&rsquo;t strike a chord with me brought down this rating to a 6/10. 
 
Overall, this hilarious anime rooted in satire is definitely worth a watch. However, if you aren&rsquo;t laughing or at least smiling after the first few episodes, chances are that this anime is not for you: many of the later episodes are similar in tone and style.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Im sure there are lots of people who would enjoy an anime such as this and unfortunately I am not one of those people. 
 
There are always people who feel like dying and would go so far as to write a note or go to the top of the building or prepare to hang themselves. These people usually aren't serious, those who are, are first of all cowards and stupid. They believe that it takes courage to die however, they are wrong... It takes courage to live. 
 
Now after sharing that with you let me say that this anime was rather boring for me. I king of forced myself wo watch two episodes a day just to finish it. 
 
From the first episode you can see this anime had a lot of potential but I don't think they used it properly. The whole thing is basically about a teacher trying to repeatedly find an excuse to kill himself and without serious intent. 
 
They only thing that I found remotely funny would be ""IM IN DESPAIR"". This phrase is what got me into this anime in the first place. 
 
There is no story mainly because it is a 'slice of life' anime. 
The art was good but for me it wasn't great. 
The voice actors are again descent but not great. 
Nozomu was the only character I liked. 
I didn't really enjoy this anime all too much. 
 
If you are a fun of comedy try this a recommend it however, if you hate soft, gentle comedy then avoid it. If you are someone who needs something strong to make you laugh then this is a no no. The comedy level here is rather weak. It's nowhere near compared to 'Gintama'. 
 
I hope you found this review helpful :) 
Feedback greatly appreciated

10,3613,45,5.83608486084061,Campus romatic comedy,Toshokan Sensou,"Toshokan Sensou  tells the story of Kasahara Iku, the first woman to join the Library Task Force. In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people. 
 
This anime follows Iku and her fellow soldiers as they protect various special books and artifacts from the oppression of the Media Enhancement Law Commission. A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.","['Action', 'Military', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","The background of the plot is based on the Statement on Intellectual Freedom in Libraries that went into effect in Japan in 1954 (amended in 1979), and the terms are a little different from the Freedom of the Library Law that appears in Toshokan Sensō.
The simplified declaration:

It is the most important responsibility of libraries to offer collected materials and library facilities to the people who have the Right to Know as one of their fundamental human rights. In order to fulfill their mission, libraries shall recognize the following matters as their proper duties, and shall put them into practice.

Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials.
Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials.
Libraries guarantee the privacy of users.
Libraries oppose any type of censorship categorically.When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.

In Library War, the fourth chapter of the Freedom of Library Law states:

 Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials. Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials. Libraries guarantee the privacy of users. Libraries oppose any type of improper censorship categorically. When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.
The details will be amended anytime according to the Media Betterment Act and its enforcement.
The premise of Library War involves the Japanese government passing the Media Betterment Act (MBA) (メディア良化法, Media ryōkahō) as law in 1989 which allows the censorship of any media deemed to be potentially harmful to Japanese society by deploying agents in the Media Betterment Committee (メディア良化委員会, Media ryōka iinkai) (MBC) with the mandate to go after individuals and organizations that are trying to exercise the act of conducting freedom of expression activities in the media.Ep 01 However, local governments opposed to the MBA establishes armed anti-MBA defense force units to protect libraries from being raided by MBC agents under the Freedom of the Libraries Law. The conflict between MBC agents and library soldiers has continued to 2019, when the story begins. In accordance with the Japanese era calendar scheme, 1989 in Library War is rendered the first year of the fictional Seika (正化) era, rendering 2019 as Seika 31.Library War follows the life of Iku Kasahara, a new recruit in the Kantō Library Base who joined in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantō Library Defense Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship.Ep 01 After joining, however, she finds the pace to be very demanding, and that her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo seems to have it in for her and working her harder than the other recruits. On multiple occasions, Kasahara shows herself to be reckless, particularly when she puts Dojo in danger by not securing a criminal in the base's library, and later getting involved with Media Betterment Committee agents despite not being a high enough ranked official; in both instances Dojo has to help her out of trouble. Despite these imperfections, Kasahara is enlisted into the base's Library Task Force, an elite group of soldiers who go through rigorous training in order to respond during difficult operations. This is partially due to Dojo realizing that he did not give Kasahara adequate training, so he gives his recommendation that she join the task force,Ep 02 of which he is a member, in order to correct this mistake on his part. Other recommendations come from the captain of the task force, Ryusuke Genda, and second class task force library officer Mikihisa Komaki who is the same rank as Dojo. Along with Kasahara, another new recruit named Hikaru Tezuka is also enlisted into the task force who is much more capable at the position than Kasahara. Kasahara continues to try her best in the face of difficult challenges while protecting the books she has sworn to protect. As the story progresses, a romance blooms and Iku and Dojo make romantic feelings for each other evident.
","Usually my reviews are a catalog of what I didn’t like in a series but, I don’t think I can love this anime more. First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. I have no complaints to mention here. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is the lack of rewatch factor. It’s short at only 13 episodes, features a strong(?) female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being.

          
 
       Helpful 【 The following is a review of : Toshokan Sensou and Toshokan Sensou: Kakumei no Tsubasa 】 
 
Toshokan Sensou, or Library Wars, it's English name on Crunchyroll, is beautiful monotony. As many of you already know, Production I.G. is known for animating very pretty things.  
	 
	• I.G. collaborated with GAINAX for the End of Evangelion and other very successful projects. You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn't worked on much.  
	 
	• This isn't always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on character building. 
	 
	• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don't get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.  
	 
	• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I'm the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she's a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.  
	 
	• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell's 1989 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults. 
	 
	• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There's no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series. 
	 
	• I mean, c'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn't want genetically enhanced humans.  
	 
	• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don't care about the armed feud between these people and the government? 
	 
	• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I'm okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we're being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL! 
	 
	• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!  
	 
	• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn't help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?  
	 
	• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister. 
	 
	• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it's definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn't know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism. I give Library Wars a 5/10 and hope that Takayuki Hamana does better with the Lyrical Nanoha films.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is quite unique,  but not bad my any stretch.  The storyline is most likely to most unique thing about it, followed by the characters.  The art and sound are pretty typical. 
 
Story:  Something that could definitely happen in America, probably already started happening,  but on a much more technological level.  The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don't know your history,  it's bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop this 
 
Art:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,  not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across. 
 
Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say. 
 
Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn't even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh.. 
 
The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes. 
 
If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book.

","I can say that this was a bit of a surprise, it was better than i expected. Overall i like ecchi anime and stuff like that. You get what u want here, boobs, swimsuits and i did get a good laugh. What i was surprised about was the story. Most of you know that most ecchi anime don't really have a true storyline and all and most of the time the story is in the last episode. This one however is a little different which i liked. The basics of it are that Ninomiya is trying to help Mayu with her androphobia and they do some crazy stuff. At first it may sound like its no different than other ecchi anime. But the story progresses through the all the episodes not just the last one. You see flashbacks and learn new stuff about their past that lead to the ending. The story itself is also unique and interesting for this kind of anime but i don't want to spoil anything. The art/design and sound was really good. The OP/ED was also catchy. If you like ecchi and harem then surely you will like this.

          
 
       Helpful Ninomiya is your typical two girls after one guy plus lots of accidental ecchi moments. It's about a not-so ordinary high school guy and his meetings with two not-so ordinary girls. There is a fair amount of suggestive material, though it has been far eclipsed by the ecchi works of today. 
 
The actual show is pleasantly enjoyable if you can tolerate the overflow of old school fan service and the inconceivable nature of the entire situation. The majority of the show just introduces the characters as they go on mini-adventures before culminating in a substantial climax near the end. 
 
Overall, this is a decent at best watch for those who can live with some fan service. This is a really crowded genre, and this particular work just doesn't stand out much. 
 
Animation: 
The animation was probably crisp for its time but is definitely outdated by 2015 standards. Colors are nicely toned though a bit over-saturated and the characters are well proportioned (and I don't mean that in an ecchi sense), and still quite cute. 
 
There is a fair amount of action in the show though obviously the only reason you'd venture here is for the ecchi. And to be honest, if that's what you're looking for other shows do that better as well too. 
 
Sound: 
The sound of the series is pretty average. The OP isn't bad but not that memorable. The ED is actually better though there is a bit of ecchi-ness in the visuals. The BGM fits the mood nicely but isn't anything outstanding. As for voice actors, Mayu has a very high pitched voice (which some might find cute but others annoying). Overall, the VAs did a very good job, especially Miyuki Sawashiro for giving a pompous, arrogant attitude for Reika. 
 
Story: 
Ninomiya is yet another show about a somewhat timid guy with a girl literally falling onto him. It focuses on the relationship between Ninomiya kun and the two girls Reika and Mayu. As with many other shows, it involves the main character's long lost childhood memories. 
 
For the most part, the series consists of mostly stand-alone episodes where viewers learn a little about Ninomiya and the girls, who end up living in Ninomiya's house. Mayu is afraid of men and so Ninomiya is used as the ""tool"" for her to get used to guys. This often involves unusually ecchi situations that may offend some viewers. Near the end of the series, a great deal is revealed about Ninomiya's past and how the girls play a part in it, culminating in a fairly intensive climax in the last episode. 
 
Overall, the story could have built up to the last few episodes a little better and the ending leaves an inconclusive feeling. 
 
Character: 
First of all, I will note that nearly all of the characters in this series are irregular (including unusual martial arts abilities, succubi powers, or an oddly aggressive personality (sexually) etc.). 
 
Ninomiya is a popular high school boy who lives with his elder sister. Both are apparently highly skilled martial artists and essentially super-soldiers. However, he tends to be weak/timid around girls and the school girls often harass him due to his lack of resistance. He has known Reika and Mayu from his distant past though his memories are foggy at best. 
 
Mayu is a succubus who lives with her brother. Both join the Ninomiya family once it is determined that Ninomiya will help familiarize Mayu with guys. Mayu is a succubus and thus looks extremely attractive. She has a clumsy personality and naive nature. She is often seen in suggestive positions/acts with Ninomiya as part of their ""training"". 
 
Reika comes from a very affluent family (which also happens to be succubi) and, in a weird series of twists, ends up as Ninomiya's maid. She also harbors feelings for Ninomiya though her proud attitude would never allow her to admit it. 
 
The cast in general is fairly diverse and developments are fairly good for the main characters (the secondary characters are static for the most part). 
 
Value: 
The overall show had a lot of humorous occurrences as well as some decent dramatic moments. The show also tries to throw in some action which is well played out as well. As for value in general, the storyline isn't very great and the characters aren't particularly memorable. Though it might be a fair spur of the moment watch, don't expect it to be a standout.

          
 
       Helpful If someone were to take all the most popular elements of a typical harem anime, add nothing new and make a new show out of it, you would end up as something like Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun. Coming from the same studio that produced Girls Bravo, this isn't all too surprising to be fair. 
 
Story 
The story is pedestrian by most standards for the harem genre. The focus is primarily on the daily life of Ninomiya Shungo, and is really only pushed forward by his recalling of long suppressed memories of his childhood. There are a couple moments in which the plot strives to be something greater than is typical, but those are short-lived. 
 
Art 
The artwork is solid if unspectacular. Character designs are fairly average, although at times quality degrades significantly despite this only being a 12 episode series. More money may have been spent on the commercial break fan service than on animation, which while quite good, detracts from the show as a whole. 
 
Sound 
The OP theme is catchy for about the first 45 seconds then falls off at the chorus. The ED theme, not so much, and as a result can be easily skipped without regret after hearing it once. 
 
Character 
The main character, Ninomiya Shungo, is not the everyman typical of the harem genre. He's quite capable in a fight, but then again, so is every other male character with any plot significance. He's also extremely popular with all the girls at school vying for the attention he would rather not give anyone. The two women fighting over him are Tsukimura Mayu, a succubus with androphobia and feeds of the life force of men, and Hojo Reika, in the tsundere role. Most any other character in the series is an archetype that has been seen before. 
 
Enjoyment 
For a harem show, the series does have some good moments. There's a certain absurdity to some of the comedy. The omake segments in some of the episodes are well worth watching. Other times, however, the story dragged on and on for long periods, or worse, forgotten just minutes after watching the episode. 
 
Overall 
If you are looking for a harem anime that in no way challenges the sensibilities of the viewer, this could be well worth a watch. It's fairly good at what it does in that it sticks to genre conventions. Could this series be better? Probably, with a little bit more money for animation, but honestly, it provides plenty for anyone who would possibly be interested in watching this in fan service alone. And really, what more could you possibly ask for from anything in this genre.

Although Yozora Mikazuki faced a certain incident at the end of summer, the daily life of the Neighbor's Club goes on as usual. A strange nun, members of the student council and other new faces make an appearance, causing Kodaka Hasegawa's life to grow even busier. 
 
While they all enjoy going to the amusement park, playing games, celebrating birthdays, and challenging the ""school festival""—a symbol of the school life normal people live—the relations amongst the members slowly begins to change... 
 
Let the next stage begin, on this unfortunate coming-of-age love comedy!! 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Harem', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","Kodaka Hasegawa, a transfer student to St. Chronica's Academy, has found it difficult to make friends because of his mix of brown-blond hair (inherited from his deceased English mother) and fierce-looking eyes that make him look like a delinquent. One day, he accidentally comes across the equally solitary and very abrasive Yozora Mikazuki as she converses with ""Tomo"", her ""air"" (imaginary) friend. Realizing that they lack social lives and skills, they decide that the best way to improve their situation is to form the Neighbors Club (隣人部, Rinjin-bu), ""an after-school club for people with no friends like themselves"". Other students with various backgrounds join the club: Sena Kashiwazaki is an attractive but arrogant idol who has no female friends and treats the boys as her slaves; Yukimura Kusunoki is an effeminate underclassman who idolizes Kodaka and strives to become manly like him; Rika Shiguma is a genius scientist with a perverted mind; Kobato Hasegawa is Kodaka's little sister who generally cosplays as a vampire; and Maria Takayama, a ten-year-old foul-mouthed nun who serves as the club's advisor. The story follows their adventures as the club tries out various school and outside social activities as practice for making friends.
","It seemed like this anime doesn't have many reviews so I thought I might just add one to its number. And so Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT is... Well it's been a while since I finished it. Sometimes I go to my D drive to fish it out just to watch one episode so I still have fond memories of it and here are my personal thoughts. 
 
Story wise, it has practically none. You probably wouldn't be too hurt watching the anime jumping episodes (I never jump episodes. NEVER. Except with Suzumiya. They saw it coming.) There are small little parts of the story that really got me and it makes me super excited for a sequel. But of course, the story doesn't compare to it comedy (or at least I think that's how they planned it to be). Thoroughly funny for me I must say. 
 
Moving on to the art and sound, where there isn't much to say, it was good. Just good I guess. Art was above average but then again it's pretty new and can't compare to stuff like Kimi ni Todoke. Music was unmemorable. I probably skipped through the songs like most other animes but this anime left hardly any recollections of how it's like. I can only remember some slap bass lines and that's it. Tada. 
 
For characters... Well this can be quite a love hate thing. I've read other reviews saying how they hate Maria sensei who say poop every episode but I'm like... WHAT. I LOVED THAT KID. Her irritating voice kept me smiling and laughing always. She's crazy. And then the main characters are... Well the guy is hard to understand to be honest. Like most of them. You've gotta keep this in mind that hey, they got no friends yo! Not till the formation of the club. Do you know what it's like? I don't >.< Some might call Kodaka a spineless idiot, but I think he's really just genuinely scared and scarred. He's just playing dumb mostly... As for the girls... Again you've gotta try to understand where they are coming from... I love Rika. Period. She works hard, she plays hard and she's smart. And perverted. Bonus there. :D 
 
I enjoyed it. Thoroughly. It was good, but then that's me. But anyway, since you've watched (I'm assuming) the prequel, finish it. Especially if you didn't think it was bad. They wrote it well, that the prequel ends with Taka meeting Sora and that you've gotta catch the sequel to find out what's up. So please do!  
 
Thanks for reading my elaborate review. I'm trying to be really to the point and not poetic like some people. It doesn't serve the people man. Write your poems somewhere else >.< 

          
 
       Helpful Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT. Well, I have seen both seasons of bokusuku and after finishing this one I would say I liked it a lot better than the first season. In this season I think we get a much better understanding of the characters and what the story is all about. In the first season I feel the story was lost and the ""we have to prepare ourselves for the world of friends"" aspect was just an excuse for the writers to make up situations that added no real value to the show's overall theme. Bokusuku NEXT however was, I'm glad to say, much more focussed on both characters and story.  
 
What I keep asking myself as I write this review is -""what would I want to know if I was considering watching this show"", well I guess I would have liked to know that this anime really explores its characters, showing us their flaws and struggles as the show progresses. That it focusses alot more on young love and a fear of love than the first season did. I also thought that bokusuku NEXT was alot funnier than the original too and I put this down once again to the familiarity we gain with the characters.  
 
Lastly I would ask, ""would I recommend this anime?"" 
For slice-of-life lovers I would have to say yes. For comedy lovers, also yes. For people who are just in it for the fan service I would say yes again because it rarely isn't present (also something you may want to keep in mind if you're not comfortable with that stuff), but for any other people, people who like romance or drama or harem, I would say no. This anime, in my opinion isn't really main stream. Its not going to please everybody and not everybody is going to enjoy it. For a final statement I would have to advise that apart from the genres I listed before, comedy, slice-of-life and ecchi, this anime has little else to give.

When it comes to anime's getting sequel's it always makes me nervous depending on what it does to expand the story, luckily this is one of those sequels that was well worth it. 
 
The story continues with the Neighbours Club endless crusade to make friends and after the incident from the end of last series things have quickly gone back to normal, but more developments are in store for our dysfunctional club members. 
Now the story pretty much expands upon the first season as the club members continue to do activities that will hopefully make them acquire friends in the future and it obviously leads to more disputes and funny outcomes of those disputes, but the tone of this series is a little bit more serious especially when we get closer to the end this series because now the club members have gotten acquainted with each other and know more about each other which this series shows how much the bond between them has grown, that being said it concentrates more on the relations between Kodaka and the girls as they have gotten to the point where they have some form of attraction for him especially Sena and Yozora. 
 
The characters definitely get more development in this series as their relationship has grown so have their feelings for each other. 
Kodaka continues to be the blandish guy, but you see the reason for why he acts the way he is around the girls and why he continuously knocks down their advances on him because all he wants right now is friendship. 
Yozora and Sena continue to be at each other's throats with the pranks and arguments they pull on each other, the first season mainly picked on Sena during the argument, but in this season the tables have turned and whenever Yozora tries to do something to get closer to Kodaka it always blows back into her face which gave the chance for Sena to make her move, you also see that these two have gotten more used to each other as their relations with the other girls improves too. 
The other girls of the group get their own chances too, Kobato and Maria also improve their own relationship while Yukimura continues her journey of being manly. 
Rika actually has a bigger role this season as her technical skills help to create a movie the club was working on and you really see her true self during the final episodes when Kodaka wa avoiding the club for a certain amount of time. 
There is even new characters introduced like Kate who is Maria's older sister, she is more of a tomboy and acts pretty vulgar around Kodaka although despite acting like this she does care for her younger sister even though she won't admit it. 
Aoi Yusa is mainly a supporting character and isn't shown a lot, but she is Sena's rival when it comes to the test scores and hates how smart she is even to the point where she tries to shut the club down which luckily Sena steps in and stops it. 
 
The artstyle is actually a little different compared to the last season and the differences are apparent from some small details like Kodaka's hair has actually changed a little and everything looks smoother too, we also get to see the girls in more different outfits that continue to make them look good too. 
 
The fanservice in this series is also cut down a little bit compared to the last season which is a little disappointing since there are new longer any cheeky nip slips or exposed breasts and it instead goes for the option of using hair or objects to cover up the girls, but it doesn't impact the show a lot to be honest. 
 
The comedy was just as good this season as it was the last one hell I think the pranks on Sena went to new levels as the first episode literally started with Sena having a monstrous hairstyle just because the others said it would improve her character and the fact they were the ones who made her hair look like that in the first place. 
The Romance increased more in this series since the relations between the girls and Kodaka has obviously grown it mainly focuses on Sena and Yozora particularly Sena since it is revealed that she is an even earlier childhood friend of Kodaka's than Yozora was and because of this we see the development in their characters on how much Kodaka has impacted their lives and how much they care for him. 
 
Overall this was a fun second series and maybe there''ll be a third season to close it off hopefully considering the ending for this season, but from what I've heard in the light novels I think it's best to leave it as it is or maybe a Movie to close the story.

       Helpful You'll know in the first 30 second whether or not you like Teekyuu.  
If so, watch this season, as well as the rest, because they only get better. If you don't like Teekyuu, which most people probably don't, don't waste your time, the jokes only get crazier, and the dialogue only gets faster. 
 
I personally love the type of humor that the anime presents, so I think that this season was great. The only reason I hesitate to give any season of Teekyuu a 10, is purely based off the fact that a large number of the jokes are inaccessible to non-Japanese fans. As a person who's been watching anime for some time, I can catch on to some of the cultural references, but by no means all of them. Granted that they constitute a pretty significant portion of the jokes made, I only am able to understand 70% or so of the humor in the show. Regardless, the delivery and reactions to said jokes is more than enough to cover that area, and the concentration of gags leaves me laughing anyway. 
 
The animation is perfect for the show - derpy, but still good enough to look like effort was put in. 
 
The OP is absolutely amazing - much like the animation, it's ultra derpy and captures the feel of the show. Much akin to the ASDF style of animation, it made me laugh at the start of each episode. 
 
The characters are all funny in their own right, and each get screen time, so no problems there. 
 
If you enjoy the 4-koma style of delivery, typical to anima like Seitoukai Yakuindomo!, or Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken (I Don't Understand What My Husband is Saying), you're sure to like Teekyuu. If not, you've wasted two minutes of your time, sucks.

The first two were released on DVD bundled with two drama CDs, with the third being sold separately. It is unknown if these will ever be released outside of Japan. 
 
The first OVA is a re-enactment of the first chapter, where Negi first learns of his job as a teacher and is introduced to the students of Mahora Academy 2-A. It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka. Asuna is the only girl in the class that doesn't have romantic feelings for Negi. 
 
The second OVA is a re-enactment of the ""love potion"" incident of chapter 2, with profiles at the end of Nodoka, Konoka, the cheerleaders (Misa, Madoka, Sakurako) as well as Kazumi. 
 
The third OVA is a re-enactment of chapter 13: Negi's Mahora tour with the Narutaki twins. The tour shows Negi to several of the students (Yuna, Akira, Chao, Satsuki, Satomi, Chizuru, Natsumi, Zazie) as well as others that he ends up missing (Sayo, Evangeline, Chachamaru, Chisame, Misora, Ako). After being chewed out by Haruna for completely skipping her, a final scene introduces Setsuna and Mana, keeping watch from something on campus. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Ecchi']","While looking for clues about his missing father Nagi, Negi Springfield becomes the English and homeroom teacher for Mahora Academy Class 2A (later 3A). Negi soon becomes acquainted with most of his new students including his roommates Asuna Kagurazaka and Konoka Konoe. Negi faces his first real challenge in his student Evangeline A.K. McDowell who is an immortal vampiress and one of his father's enemies. To help Negi confront Eva, Asuna agrees to become his temporary partner by performing a ""Pactio"", a kind of magical contract sealed with a kiss.
After dealing with Evangeline, Negi takes the class on a trip to Kyoto while searching for more information on his father's whereabouts but is forced to fight against Eastern mages aiming to kidnap Konoka with the help of other students who also become his partners including Nodoka Miyazaki, Konoka's childhood friend Setsuna Sakurazaki, and lastly with Konoka herself. The arc also introduces Fate Averruncus, another mage who looks to be around Negi's age but proves himself to be far stronger than him. Seeing his own weakness after the events in Kyoto, Negi begins to train with several students in order to become stronger while Kotaro Inugami, one of the foes he confronted there unexpectedly reappears and finds himself a family with Negi's students Natsumi and Chizuru. Kotaro also joins Negi against Wilheim, an old evil from the past who like Fate Averruncus, seems to be a pawn of an even stronger enemy.
During Mahora's cultural festival, Negi manages to partake in simultaneous events thanks to his student Chao Lingshen's latest invention, the time machine Casseopeia. One of these events is the ""Mahora Martial Arts Tournament"" where he confronts a series of increasingly stronger enemies including a former member of ""Ala Rubra"" (Crimson Wing), a legendary brigade led by his father. After the tournament, Negi takes part in more activities at the festival until Chao she reveals herself as a time-traveler who claims she must change the present to avert a great catastrophe in the future. Despite that, Negi and his allies confront Chao and stop her. After giving, Chao bids farewell before returning to her own time.
After the festival, Negi decides to go to the Mundus Magicus (Magic World) to look for his father. His partners decide to accompany him and together they form their own brigade, the Ala Alba (White Wing). They are joined by Negi's childhood friend Anya and accidentally by other students who are oblivious to his secret. As they arrive, the team is ambushed by a group of mysterious enemies led by Fate Averruncus, leaving Negi and his group defeated and scattered across Mundus Magicus. After meeting Jack Rakan, another member of Ala Rubra, Negi decides to train in order to become stronger and specializes in Dark Magic, like Evangeline. Meanwhile, Negi's lost companions start to learn the ropes of their new environment and eventually reunite with him.
During another clash with Fate and his companions, Asuna is captured by the enemy and held captive along with Anya, with a body double posing as the real Asuna. Later Negi has an encounter with Kurt Gödel, a former member of Ala Rubra who reveals to him the story of his parents including how his mother was unjustly tried and sentenced to death before being saved by Nagi at the brink of her execution. He also learns that the Magic World is actually a magically created, inhabitable version of Mars, and just like the world itself, the majority of its inhabitants are created by magic. During another clash with Fate, Negi also learns that the main objective of his group ""Cosmo Entelecheia"" is to make use of Asuna's secret powers to erase the magically created inhabitants of Mundus Magicus and transfer the rest of its population to Earth before it eventually collapses.
By joining forces with the various armies of the Magic World, the members of Ala Alba storm Cosmo Entelecheia's stronghold where Asuna and Anya are being held captive, to stop their plans. During the confrontation a magic gate is opened to Earth just above Mahora, having Negi's remaining students who stayed behind along with the academy's faculty members joining the fight. After rescuing Asuna and convincing Fate to accept a plan to save the people of the Magic World without the need of any sacrifices, Negi discovers that the true leader of Cosmo Entelecheia is none other than his father Nagi, possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who vanishes after asking his son to look for him and release him once and for all.
After being celebrated as heroes for stopping Cosmo Entelecheia, Negi and his friends return to the academy, but instead of resuming his duties as a teacher, Negi leaves Fate as his substitute and with the help of some of his students he starts working on his plan to terraform Mars for the people of the decaying Magic World to relocate there. The plan involves sealing Asuna's body for one hundred years, and she bids farewell to Negi and the other students after she graduates from middle school. Waking up 30 years after the estimated time, Asuna finds that Negi's plan was a success and that Negi and all her classmates had happy and bountiful lives, but had long since died, all except for the immortal Evangeline, and Chao who exists in this time and has since invented a device to jump between realities. These two appear before Asuna to take her back to the present so she can live out her days with Negi and the others.

Everything you need to know about this OVAS is right in the title: Introduction Film is a presentation for the 31 females in Mahou Sensei Negima, in preparation for the anime that was about to premiere at that time, back in 2005 (Mahou Sensei Negima, the first animated series). 
 
Introduction Film has three episodes. Each presents a simple situation that serves as a plot, and then the girls are introduced. The presentation is just the names, occupied seat in class, blood type (serious business in Japan), and likes and dislikes. Throughout the montage will see several photos and fragments of the (in that time) future anime (or not... some footage is not used after all), plus some ecchi moments. As a brief summary: 
In the first episode, Negi Springfield, a welsh 10 years old wizard, is assigned to teach english in the 2-A course of Mahora Academy (where all the students are girls). In this chapter are introduced Asuna, Makie, Yue, Kaede and Fu Fei, five girls better known as the Baka Ranger (cause they are terrible students). The class rep, Ayaka, is also introduced in this ep. 
 
In the second episode, Negi makes a love potion and gives it to Asuna, so she can use it to attract the attention of Takahata, her former teacher. Konoka, Nodoka, Sakurako, Misa, Madoka and Asakura are introduced here. 
 
The third and last ep is about Negi and the Narutaki sisters (the loli twins of the class) exploring the Mahora campus (which is insanely big). That's a pretty good excuse to introduce the remaining 19 girls. 
 
Visually, in an amusing (or sad) turn of events, this OVAS are better than the TV series (which is kind of weird, since the former promotes the later). The difference is not that much, since neither of the production are brilliant (actually, the animation and the drawings are pretty average), but here, the character designs is more faithful to the original source (the manga). 
 
The sound is not bad, no opening, nor ending, but the background music is ok, and the seiyus did a nice job. 
 
So, that's it. If you have heard about Mahou Sensei Negima, and don't know if you want to spend your time on it, try this OVAS. If the characters or the premise of this videos interest you, then, rather than the anime, I recommend the manga. The anime is not necessarily bad, but the manga is longer, cooler, and smarter. 
-------- 
Todo lo que se necesite saber sobre estos OVAS esta en el titulo: Introduction Film es, justamente, una introducción para las 31 chicas de Mahou Sensei Negima, a modo de preparación para el anime que estaba a punto de estrenarse por ese entonces (Mahou Sensei Negima, la primera serie animada). 
 
Introducción cuenta con tres capítulos. Cada uno plantea una situación simple que sirve a modo de “trama”, y a lo largo se presenta a las chicas. La presentación es, simplemente, nombre, asiento ocupado en clase, tipo de sangre (cosa muy seria en Japón) y lo que les gusta y no les gusta. A lo largo del montaje se van viendo varias fotos, y fragmentos del futuro anime (O no... porque hay partes que después no aparecen), además de una cantidad de ecchi que por momentos es criminal. A modo de breve resumen:   
En el primero, Negi Springfield, de 10 años (o 9 años... el autor no fue muy claro al respecto) es asignado para dar clases en el curso 2-A de la academia Mahora (donde son todas chicas). En este capítulo, se presenta a Asuna, Makie, Ku Fei, Kaede y a Yue, mejor conocidas como las “Baka Rangers” (por que en la escuela no pegan una). También se introduce a Ayaka, la representante de la clase. 
 
En el segundo capítulo Negi hace una poción de amor y se la da a Asuna, para que pueda atraer la atención de Takahata, su profesor anterior. Se introduce a Konoka, Nodoka, Sakurako, Misa, Madoka y a Asakura. 
 
En el tercer capítulo vemos a Negi recorriendo las instalaciones de Mahora (que es monstruosamente grande), acompañado por las gemelas Narutaki. Es la excusa excelente para presentar a las 19 chicas restantes. 
 
La animación es, de forma insólita, mejor que la serie que promociona. La diferencia no es mucha, dado que en ninguna de las dos producciones es brillante a nivel visual (la verdad, es bastante mediocre), pero en Introduccion el diseño de personajes es más fiel al original. 
 
El sonido no está mal, no hay opening, ni ending, ni música en general, pero las seiyus hacen bien su trabajo. 
 
Bueno, eso es básicamente todo. Así que, si alguna vez escucharon hablar de Mahou Sensei Negima, y no saben si largarse a verlo o no, pueden probar con esto. Si los personajes o la premisa de estos videos les llama la atención, entonces, más que el anime que promociona, recomiendo que lean el manga. El anime no es malo necesariamente, pero el manga abarca mucho más, muestra mucho más, y pasan muchas más cosas.

          
 
       Helpful These introduction films were supposedly made previous to the series, but i'm not sure if it should actually be watched as introductory episodes to the series itself or as a wrap up of the characters once you're done with the series. 
 
It consists, mostly, of the replay of multiple situations that took place in Mahou Sensei Negima! (the real TV series). There is some extra footage and pictures that weren't displayed neither on the OVAs nor on the series, some of them being very ecchi. Some background music is played and the sound effects and character voices are well employed. Art is basically the same as the series itself; just alright, lacking details and shadows. It does expand the viewer's knowledge of each character, individually. 
 
Again, i'm not sure whether this should be seen before or after the series. If you watch these introductory films before, you'll know what will happen in some scenes of the anime, but you'll have better and more expanded knowledge of the characters while watching it; if you watch these introductory films afterwards, it'll serve as a wrap-up to the events that took place in the anime, and it will explain better the way of acting of each character. 
 
One thing I'm certain of is that if you're going to watch the TV series, these should be seen as well, either before or after; you'll enjoy them.

In an alternative timeline, the world is divided into three superpowers (similar to the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell): the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the Europa United (Europe and Africa). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain's North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.
Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.
Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily.

","First of all ignore ""Genres: Comedy, Ecchi, Slice of Life"" part. This and the fact that those are shorts really give wrong impression about what this picture drama is. 
 
So, what it is then? Just as first season's specials, those are short stories focused around R2 story, with some telling about things from past and last episode happening after R2 epilogue. The reason why I'm saying to ignore genres is how meaningful this special is. While there is some fanservice, all episode add to the main story and are on the serious side. Some also hit in the feels. 
 
Just as the title says, it's a picture drama. In other words still frames with voice (and subs) telling story. It's worth mentioning that art is far better than in previous picture drama - here all episodes use same drawing style and move ""panels"" through screen for better effects. It looks less like random collection of leftover frames put together into something and more like actual work of art. 
Personally I really liked the way it looked and didn't have any problems with it not being full animation. 
 
Characters and music are from main series, so there is no reason to comment on that. 
 
I really recommend watching it to anyone who enjoyed both seasons of Code Geass. Even if you generally don't like picture dramas, I encourage you to give it a try - it's worth it. 


          
 
       Helpful It's the same as the first series picture drama but a bit better. 
 
It follows the strory of the R2 series, like little stories between episodes, the sound keeps the same ground as in the first picture drama. 
 
What's best in this picture drama is the art, it has improved a lot and it has a lot more animation in it! 
 
Overall i enjoyed this one very much, the stories are very good and it show us the background and thoughts of the characters very well as in the first picture drama.

          
 
       Helpful For those who’s wondering whether to watch these picture dramas, I have written short summaries for each episode: 
 
1. Sad and edgy Suzaku 
2. Kallen and C.C chat (happens before r2) 
3. Student council “handmade dress party” 
4. Kallen, C.C. and the Chinese Federation 
5. At Clovis’ casino 
6. Pyjama party—with all the cool girls and the white-haired loli  
7. Rolo: the Story (offers insight into his character) 
8. C.C and Cécile discuss ”da future and stuff” 
9. In the present (Bittersweet extension of r2 ending. Must watch.) 
 
Like the first picture drama, stationary images are used, the sequences are fully dubbed (voice acted) and they are around 5 minutes each.

In order to approach closer to her mother, one of history's greatest dealers, she does battle to gather up the legendary cards called ""gates"". Those who gather all 13 gate cards are presented with the title MVCD (Most Valuable Casino Dealer), proof that they are a top dealer. 
 
Set in a vast resort, an exciting battle begins with rival dealers that'll take your breath away! Throw in some ""supreme comedy"" and a story that makes you cry when you least expect it, these cute and sexy girls will explode off your screen! With everyone's cheer of ""Leave it to Rio!"", Lady Luck'll be with you, too!","['Game', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi']","In an island casino called the Howard Resort (ハワードリゾート, Hawādo Rizōto), Rio Rollins is a popular casino dealer with the ability to bring good luck to gamblers just by walking past them, earning her the nickname ""The Goddess of Victory"". Mint Clark, a young child, comes to the Howard Resort with her grandfather and encounters Rio, and the two become the best of friends.
Rio's life soon changes when it is revealed that she is a ""Gate Holder"", a dealer who holds one of the 13 legendary cards called ""Gates"", and  whoever collects them all will be named ""Most Valuable Casino Dealer"" (MVCD). To collect all 13 Gates, Rio must take part in special matches called ""Gate Battles"" with other Gate Holders and gain their Gates to become the most valuable casino dealer in the world.
","One of the things find I generally like about anime is that they almost always have their basis in manga or novels, at least giving it the chance of having a coherent story.  Rio: Rainbow Gate! breaks the norm by being based on a pachinko game, and it shows.  I didn’t have much in the way of expectations for this series but after a somewhat promising start things started to come apart fairly fast. 
 
Rio's story is, as expected, dreadfully terrible.  Our leading character is Rio, a popular dealer and kind of the mascot of the casino she works in, Howard Resort.  Apparently she has some kind of power that gives people luck and causes them to win when she’s around.  You can understand why the casino patrons would enjoy having her around  but I never could for the life of my figure out why the casino owner himself would.  The setting in Rainbow Gate is a whimsical and over the top look into the casino world.  Nothing in this anime is really meant to be taken seriously and everything, at least early on, revolves around putting Rio into embarrassing outfits and playing ridiculous games.  Honestly, if the series had just stuck with this slice of life type formula it might have been tolerable to watch. 
 
Where things start to come apart is when they start implementing the ""story"".  We are introduced to a kind of competition called Gate Battles, were other top dealers from around the world compete in casino games for the ultimate goal of collecting all 13 cards and getting some prize.  Our dear Rio conveniently is a Gate holder so she is periodically challenged over the course of the series until the Gates become the sole plot point.  This is when the series really starts to lose itself too.  For one, the Gate Battles are silly and downright stupid.  They have little if anything to do with any actual casino games and they rarely, if ever, require any kind of skill.  Additionally there is the introduction of an absolutely ridiculous super power called ""Roll Ruler"" that some of the competitors use to control the game or the minds of their opponents so they can win.  Believe me when I say that it is stupider than I can actually make it sound. 
 
The characters are marginally better than the plot.  Like so many of its contemporaries, there is also way to many of them too for the length of this series.  Since it's impossible to ever really get to know them it relies on tried and true stereotypes and cliches.   Rio herself is a nice, sweet, and likable heroine but she lacks any kind of depth beyond her heavy udders.  She is always thinking of others and trying to help people but she’s a silly , one dimensional character.  Any personality she does have is can be solely attributed to the performance of her seiyuu, Marina Inoue.  The rest of  cast, like Rio, is wholly forgettable.  So much so that I am not even going to bother talking about any of them. 
 
Overall the show is pretty to look at.  The settings, backgrounds, and characters themselves are all appealing and well drawn, for the most part.  The art captures the over the top style of the series as well as bringing to life a lot of ridiculous games and making them mildly interesting.  Some of the characters, well most to be honest, have ridiculous chest measurements.  But it’s hard to hold the artists too accountable for this, since pretty much every anime is like that these days.  The ecchi is pretty tame as well and there isn't any real nudity, only implied through convenient foreground obstacles and strategic clothing.  So if you’re looking into this anime because you like that kind of thing, then you’re going to be disappointed.  The vocal performances and music are pretty solid, if unspectacular. 
 
In the end, Rio: Rainbow Gate! is pretty much your average run of the mill forgettable anime.  It’s inoffensive and completely unremarkable and is unlikely to impress anyone nor did it ever really have any chance to be any good.  Fans of ecchi anime will also find little to appeal to them as it is overall quite bland and tame in that area as well.  The ridiculous plot and silly characters drags this show down to well below average and isn't worth your time or consideration. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Okay, first of all, I admit it, I kinda enjoyed the 2-3first episodes, I thought the plot was kinda interesting, it's actually about collecting special cards that a random dude gave to the 13 best casino dealers in the world, the main character being one of them, to collect them, you can challenge other ""gate keepers"" to a ""gate battle"", so far so good. But the way it goes is just stupid, she keeps winning gate in the stupidest way possible in the stupidest battles. that anime is simply sexy girls in a child anime, that's it. 
 
EDIT: I'll have to change my review after watching episode 7, the plot is turning out actually quite good, it's really a shame that the battle system is that stupid, it could've turned good after all. 
 
also, the tentacle rape scene wasn't necessary.

          
 
       Helpful Rio - Rainbow Gate! takes place at the tropical casino paradise called the Howard Resort Casino.  The plot revolves around a tournament where Casino dealers challenge each other to various casino games to win the title of being the Top Dealer.  Basic, simple, but it works for what it is.  The main character Rio is called the Goddess of Victory, as she has uncanny luck and the ability to make anyone win whatever game they're playing just by walking past them. 
 
The writing is, as you would expect, not the focus of the show.  The plot is basic for what it is, and crosses into silly far more often than not.  One must also question why the casino would employee a woman whose abilities actually help the gamblers to win money form the casino, but we see Mr. Howard lecherously uses Rio's sexiness and fame to promote his casino, so one can assume it's an acceptable loss for all the business she brings to his casino.  However, that's probably my own fault of taking this show seriously. 
 
Technically speaking, Rio - Rainbow Gate! is a beautiful show; and I don't just mean Rio herself.  All the backgrounds and visuals are full of vibrant colors that really capture the feeling of a tropical paradise.  The glitter and sheen on the casino floor also do well to captivate the eye and give the show a very energetic and feel-good mood.  Rio herself is also gorgeous, and since this is an ecchi anime, the show does well to remind us of this and give us various camera angles and outfits to admire Rio in.  The poker game in the first episode between Rio and Orlin is told through a mix of dramatized hand and arm movements, dramatic stares and card drawing, and trippy, psychedelic dream sequences of Rio being bathed in light like this was a magical girl anime, and Orlin exploring a gritty forest of poker cards looking for the four queens to add to his hand.  The show is eye-candy in every sense of the word.  The music of the show is composed of jazzy, up-beat tunes which are quite catchy and do well to establish the tropical casino setting.  Rio - Rainbow Gate! is a treat to both the eyes and the ears. 
 
Overall, this show doesn't take itself terribly seriously, and neither should you.  If you want a beautiful, feel-good, sexy anime with some stunning visuals and catchy music, then this anime is worth a look.  The dramatized way Rio and Orlin played poker was enough to make me check out next week's episode; it brought a silly Yu-Gi-Oh! and Death Note vibe with how they dramatized such a mundane game   Perhaps other casino games like blackjack, roulette, and craps will be incorporated into the show in future episodes.

unofficial review 
 
the thing about this anime is the artistry involved in showing so many of the intricacies in the unrequited love relationship 
 
the depression sadness hopelessness.... the confusion and fears... 
doubts 
 
that feeling where you're just fed up 
or that feeling where you're so overjoyed you skip around and sing and everyone can tell you're in a good mood... 
 
this anime really really showed that up to my amazement. 
 
not many people will appreciate those details... but i'm 30 and having fought for going on 5 years 6 weeks and 2 days... i can. 
 
the only thing is the story dragged on only a little. 
 
the art was average for that era 
 
i enjoyed it... cuz i was able to identify with so many of the characters 
 
my advice.... rewatch when you're in your 30s... and see if it doesn't take on a whole nother appearance to you. 
 
yes i will rewatch it... but not now...i want to forget the story so that i enjoy it just as much as i did today.

          
 
       Helpful Lovely Complex has just became on of my favorite romantic comedies.  The scenario in which romance develops on is unique and teaches us the boundlessness of our emotions.  One of my favorite aspects is that this anime is half and half romance and comedy, there's always a sense of comic relief to any seriousness and vice versa, but that still doesn't take away from the captivating emotion inspiring or the hilarious humor (seriously this anime made me laugh so much).  Furthermore, all the characters are great in a variety of ways.  They are unique, entertaining and funny, but also complex which is really seen in how character relations are grown.  The romance in Lovely Complex centers on actual growth and development of the relationship and feelings, and I think that is splendid.  You will actually view the sentiment and connection between the two main characters flourish to feel a sense of progress and growth that you may be able to relate to.  The anime does time well, it really captures the essence of future, past, and character development, and not only captures our emotions but empathy of separation and love.  Anyways, overall I enjoyed Lovely Complex for how it made me cry in laughter, happiness, and sadness.  Watch it.

","I tried to see what the fuss about is with this show and I have never been so disappointed by such an ironically unfunny comedy. I couldn't even get past the five first episodes because of how utterly pathetic the men are in this show. The type of humor that this show tried to present just didn't sit well with me. It's an attempt at humor that only straight, sexist boys will find funny. I understand that this is categorized as seinen, but as I've said, the humor in this is lost to me. The only redeeming factor of this show is the animation. 
 
I highly recommend watching any other comedy show other than this if you're looking for one.

Females character wearing bikini is the only good thing about it so far. I hope Chisa get more screen time in future episodes than that idiotic male MC

Grand Blue is an AMAZING MANGA and I highly recommend you guys to read the manga after you have watched episode 1 of the anime to get the voices in your head. Shifting away from the ""on how to watch"" (which is up to you), the adaptation is so far on point with the manga which makes me very happy! Within 4 episodes in, it looks like the format for each episode is going to cover 2 chapters of manga! This show is basically, If you like comedy such as Gintama, you will definitely love Grand Blue; a show about daily struggles of students during their college life; a setting that is not often explored by anime. 
 
Story[8]; Without spoiling the story, the timeline is quite the same as Gintama's formatting their episodes. Not quite random, but random events that happens in unspecified, yet chronological timeline! That being said, Grand Blue's full of comedy including slapstick humor and exclusive college jokes that only college kids would understand! Perhaps a bit mature, but hell; Watch it! How would you experience anime without watching at least one episode huh? Do not skip on Grand Blue for sure! 
 
Art[8]; I mean with comedy genre of anime, the animation/art is sometimes replaced by how much you laugh, but the art is okay or good enough to an average anime viewer. Unless you are elitist... everyone knows that art does not correlate to quality/enjoyment of the anime such as Ping Pong the animation. The animators are trying their best to adapt art style from manga which it most part it does, yet people just like to nitpick on the smallest pixel. The Animation is NOWHERE NEAR BAD! 
 
Sound[10]; Opening is very catchy and it gives out this ""dive vibe"" and the ending song has this ""closure vibe "" that, in my mind, represents the great laughter, joy, and sadness , waiting for the new episode patiently. Voice actors, in this show, must be mentioned because they have to put so much energy for so many scenes that requires: screaming out of lungs, playing serious in a stupid act, and playing the straight man of course. It's not easy to voice act, but they have some very familiar voice actors that fits very well with each character. 
 
Character[10]; Well, if you know your comedy with Gintama then you have heard the character type, the ""straight man"". Grand Blue basically formulates around a straight man with bunch of casts who are out of his/her ""norms"" that creates a ripple of unexpected events which are mainly comedic and i love it! And when you do such format you have to have some really original/funny/unique characters and ohh boy do they have it. Of course all of these characters are above the legal ages and attending college which makes these character more relatable to young adults such as me. You have the vast cast ranging from an Handsome stereotype who is an otaku, muscular alcoholics, the newcomer stereotypical MC that has high hopes on his new college life that ends up with the muscular alcoholics and starting to migrate to their new culture, and the cousin who hates the MC for being a dumbass for migrating to alcoholism, yet this is the few introducing characters in the anime; there will be much more awesome characters incoming later episodes that gives the show more color. The Characters interactions are the main seller of this show. Don't let other people tell you how the characters act in this show as dumb or stupid because, in my case, college students really do act similarly like the casts in Grand Blue!  
 
Enjoyment[10]; This show is not for the weak or who do not get the college life... So it's not for everyone as the anime and manga's target audience are young adults or people who have experienced college. Of course outliers can enjoy this slapstick humor too. To give an example on how the anime represents the college life; a reference of different types of characters during an exam that have not studied for, showing their struggles within college classes which perfectly relates to students in real life college who failed or struggled with an exam(s) that professor made it absolutely impossible. There will be much more similar silly events around the theme of college life. All of those silly events are just comedic gold; ironically, very much like college! This show is already my most favorite anime of this year so far and deserve much more love.  
 
Overall[10]; Grand Blue is not for everyone, but it does deliver the college type of feel and I kinda skipped the part about diving in this review. Let's be honest.. this anime might look like about diving, but it's mostly focused on character interactions and how you should view your life as student in college. Animation are very nicely done and can be wonky at times, but that shouldn't really stop you from watching it. This show is a must try for this season! If you are a college student or you just love comedy, this show is for you! 
 
Updated Opinion; I have been following the community opinion on the Anime adaptation vs the manga and they are some key notes to be considered: Age of characters have been changed for legal purposes, some of the atmosphere is not the same as in manga and some events got changed due to time constraints. With the release of the 4th episode; this episode has been proven me that the anime has done justice on adapting from the manga chapters 7-8! The characters are consistent just as in the manga. Cannot wait for the new episode! People who like to complain and consider themselves as ""Maestro Of Art Critique"", they are definitely watching the wrong anime because like I said; Grand Blue is not for the weak!

The only way for Jashin-chan to return would be to kill her summoner, but this is easier said than done for the incompetent demon.

Jashin-chan is also often visited by her demon friends: the kindhearted Gorgon Medusa and the energetic minotaur Minosu, who seem much more well-behaved in contrast, and disapprove of her plans to kill Yurine. 
 
 Jashin-chan Dropkick  is a comedy focusing on these two reluctant roommates and their bizarre antics as they get by with their cat-and-mouse relationship. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Supernatural']","A Japanese human witch and also college student named Yurine Hanazono summons the lamia Jashin (""Evil God"") from Hell. Unable to go back to Hell by herself, Jashin spends each day unsuccessfully trying to kill Yurine while simultaneously spending time with her and various acquaintances from Heaven and Hell.
","Flavor text: Quick, and to the pointless. 
 
Jashin-chan Dropkick is about a naked snek-girl who’s trying to kill and adorable goth loli. She fails and gets horrifically brutalized by chainsaws and knives and iron maidens and moe snow creatures and other similarly terrifying weapons. If that doesn’t sound fun to you then turn 360 degrees and moonwalk away, because that’s about half the show. 
 
I’m the type that enjoys ridiculous, over-the-top violence. While No Dropkick on Snek doesn’t contain any real detail with its violence, the implication is good enough to sell it. Particularly because the one inflicting such violence is doing it with an evil grin on her cute face, because Snake-chan is a fucked up individual who actually deserves it, and because the animation is actually quite good for this type of anime. But I feel like enjoying this or not depends on the individual viewer. You either get it or you don’t. I looked at this anime before it started and thought “this sounds fucking hilarious”, watched the first episode, and thought it was fucking hilarious. No deep reasoning behind it, really, I just like the use of violence as a joke. 
 
So now, all I really have to do is clarify a couple of things. First off, there’s no story in this anime; you probably could’ve guessed that, but there’s not even context as to why anything is happening in this anime. The first episode offers no introductions, but I thought this was clever. In a dumb gag series, I’m not expecting particularly detailed characters in the first place, especially in a series like this that uses religious references as jokes. Jashin-chan is a devil, so she acts like a cunt all the time. That is her character. Everyone else could be summed up in equally short statements; a quick glance at how each character acts is enough to determine all that they are. The lone exception is Urine (oh dear, what an unfortunate name indeed), who’s the only human of the series, as far as major characters go. But her enigmatic character acts as a landing pad for many of the series’ jokes, in terms of violence and fourth wall breaks. Urine’s character doesn’t have any particular set of rules, which means that her actions and dialogue have fewer limits, which is why it’s funny for her to get a chainsaw out of thin air. 
 
Moreover, backstories have a tendency to drag out too long and waste time from the real draw of the anime. The point is that Jashin and Urine have to kill each other; the fact that there’s a cowgirl and a stoner chick make little difference to that. Those characters are already distractions. How they got here doesn’t matter, what matters is that they’re here. Like I said, “Quick and to the Pointless”. This anime doesn’t have much of a point to begin with; it’s all shenanigans. A meme anime, if you will. It exists so that you can put it on whenever you feel like distracting yourself from whatever bullshit you’ve got going on in your life, or perhaps after a really dramatic, intense episode of another seasonal on your list, like Asobi Asobase. 
 
Which would bring me into the other thing to defend: repetition. I can’t say that this anime is repetitive, but I also can’t say that it’s not repetitive. Probably because that doesn’t affect me too much when I’m watching anime weekly, and you should also take this in small doses. If you try downing too much of it at once, you’re just gonna hate the taste of it pretty quickly.  
 
Jashin plotting and executing the murder of Urine, only to get dunked on in two seconds is a large part of the anime. Another large part is Jashin being an asshole to someone else, causing Urine to violently execute her. Fortunately, it manages to safely pad itself out with some other characters. They’re one-note, but good enough to pass the time. I would complain that there were a few too many scenes of Pekola, as the joke of her character runs thin pretty quickly. Meanwhile, there’s very, very little exploration with Minos, who I thought was a lot more fun with her quirky, but not super exaggerated personality. She feels like the most normal character of the anime, despite qualifying as a devil. But she’s also so normal that she doesn’t really leave an impression. But, even if all the character are one-note, they have a witty enough chemistry to keep the laughing gas flowing. I wasn’t bored at any point. 
 
To better present itself, Jashin-chan Dropkick has a surprisingly high level of animation. Not only does character movement look good in and of itself, but the character designs are memorable and the anime has a rather colorful, fun look to it. They likely managed to maintain this quality by shifting into lesser-detailed styles where characters look a little more simple; but note that I’m not saying this is lower quality. They manage to toy with the fine details without making it look jarring. Everything is as good as it needs to be, most of it is even better. 
 
But despite all of that, the funniest joke of the whole series is that fucking OST with the shitty recorder. It’s so (intentionally) godawful that I burst out laughing every single time. 
 
Overall, Jashin-chan Dropkick could stand the test of time as a solid slapstick anime--perhaps its ridiculous, bloody violence makes it more of a niche pick than others, but I had a good time with it. The show delivered what I wanted, and coming back to it every week was never a struggle. I don’t have a whole lot to say as its appeal is simple, but I have even less to complain about.

       Helpful In the season of intense comedies, Jashin-chan Dropkick is the no man's road followed, the black sheep of the genre with the comedic supernatural ""violence and gore"" aesthetic. Despite all this, you know it's legitimately bad when straight at Episode 1, the producers don't even care to open to us about the characters and their traits, and just straight dives into the comedy action. 
 
For this reason alone, there are 2 camps: the enjoyment and frustration factors. 
If you enjoy this series (like myself), the jokes are few yet decent, the many parodies it tries to imitate with the slapstick comedy. Other than the misplacements of the jokes and such that I willing to forgive, this is yet a decent move in the right direction. 
If you hate this series (like everyone else who dropped the ball at the very beginning), the violence and gore from Jashin the viper herself will turn heads off, and the comedy will get old really fast. To top it all off, there are barely traces of character development, just their precarious situations towards the harm of another. 
 
With that said, studio Nomad (rise from your grave!) has done a good representation of the anime adaptation. Sure, it looks simple and bad, but for comedy purposes the drawings are meh but OK, and they fit their purpose.  
 
In the season of less stellar OPs, I thought that Jashin-chan Dropkick had one of the most creative and funny OP sequences, and props to the VAs for the OP song, which I like a hell lot now, and watching this with song lyrics subtitles just up the ante for me. 
 
If you feel like you have time on your hands and need a little breather, this series will do, if not go watch others that are much better. And while I enjoy this series from start to end and is underrated, unfortunately it's not a show you will remember in time to come. 
 
Jashin-chan is no mere devil, she'll Dropkick on you heavy! 


          
 
       Helpful This sho is good if you want background noise and the occasional laugh. Most of the show has no real plot just goth girl getting pissed at snake girl. the only thing that is really different is how bad of a personality the snake girl has. Most characters with that bad of personality have a reason like being jealous or lonely, ect. But this girl is just mean I would want to kill her just like goth girl. The other characters are also really basic not real depth to them. 
 
once again this show is good background noise thats it really.

The three dream of raising the money needed to build their own concert hall, where their band—Nerima Daikon Brothers—would perform and hopefully rise to stardom. But their farm and Ichiro's host club job aren't raising money fast enough for their liking, leading them to resort to get-rich-quick schemes. 
 
Their plans usually involve tracking down evil-doers and then stealing their ill-gotten gains. Yet, while they usually do put a stop to the villains, they always end the day no richer than before. However, neither these failures nor interference from the policewoman Yukika Karakuri can come between this trio and their dream! With help from gadgets provided by the rental shop owner Nabeshin, the Nerima Daikon Brothers get themselves into and out of all kinds of ridiculous situations through their boisterous singing and comedy. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Music']","The trio lives on a stage constructed in Hideki's daikon patch in the Nerima ward of Tokyo. They dream of building a concert dome on the site and performing their musical act to sold-out crowds.  They must avoid both an overzealous policewoman who has caught on to their money-making schemes and the desires of powerful people who want to take over the daikon field. The characters are aided in their adventures by the show's director, Shinichi Watanabe, who injects himself (in the form of his Nabeshin character from Excel Saga) into the story as a rental shop owner.
The show parodies many famous people and institutions in Japan including Junichiro Koizumi and his political followers; Michael Jackson; the fortune teller Kazuko Hosoki, Star Wars, Host club entertainers among many others. Until recently, anime television series did not make overt jokes about the current news topics like homosexual love, consumer credit, or the success of Korean artists in Japan such as Bae Yong-joon. Nerima Daikon Brothers features overt sexual gags such as in the first episode where a male casting director fondles Ichiro's crotch as he sits there and moans.
","Ahhh, Nerima Daikon Brothers. When I first watched it, I was like, wait a minute, can you put this on T.V.!? I watched the entire series in the english dub, and let me say, one of the best dubs I've seen, next to Full Metal Alchemist ( Not Brotherhood. The first one. ) I laughed, I cried because I was laughing so hard, and I absolutely adored it. If you're easily offended, then don't watch it, but if you can take a joke or million, watch it. If you don't like musicals, you ought not to watch it either. I honestly thought the series was pretty amazing, and the humor just never stopped. I recommend it if you're looking for some good clean fun, nothing really intense in the story line. Just funny. 

          
 
       Helpful The show is really stupidly silly. But unlike Puni Puni Poemy and Excel Saga, this one has a story that he sticks to. I like the story because its heart wrenching but because of the black comedy, it doesn’t make me want to cry. I wanted to keep watching because of the characters and how they interact with each other, and to see if they ever would make their dream come true. They had me laughing from the start even if some of the jokes were a little gross.  
 
The animation is not really all that wonderful, but it works with the fact that this is a comedy and not a normal show. The characters at times lose all proportion, turn chibi, stretch out strange or have their arms and legs move strange but it all works. 
 
When we get down to the music, It’s wonderful! Sometimes then they have a show that is all about the music, they will either fail or like this one, rock out! I loved ever song even if I won’t look for most of them on a CD. There really wasn’t much background music, it was all in the front and they never really made it feel like it should be put in the back! 
 
All in all, great show and I would like to see more of this then the other style he does. 


          
 
       Helpful Nerima Daikon Brothers is definitely for the comedic anime fan. The story revolves around three relatives, Hideki, Ichiro, and Mako, who are trying to make it big as blues musicians in the city of Nerima. They farm a type of radish called Daikons in order to get by though they still find themselves constantly out of cash. Their dream is to build a dome where they can perform. 
 
The thing about Nerima Daikon Brothers is that the three are always getting into quite random trouble fending off unexpected enemies of all kinds. From the Panchiko Parlor owner to the japanese take of Michael Jackson, you'll be kept laughing at the unexpectedness of it all. 
 
To fight these wrong doers the Nerima Daikon Brothers have help from a mysterious rental man whom you might recognize if you're an Excel Saga fan. 
 
Overall the show is quite the crazy ride, very enjoyable if not a bit pointless. The characters are hilarious and the off the wall bits of comedy put into song make it fun for lack of a better word. 
 
There is a lot of sexual based humor and language here and there but nothing I would consider major. It's definitely worth looking into if you want a good laugh.

The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them.
","On a personal note, I loved Toradora. When a story can develop likable characters and then make me laugh and cry throughout the series, then of course Id be sold.  
 
But to be unbiased, The story was very well put together, a full 25 episodes gave it enough time for each character to be better developed, and it also took away the abrupt ending that comes with most animes that are the usual 12 episodes. But to get into specifics, the characters grow on you through the entire series. at episodes 12 and beyond, it becomes apparent where the love connection is. When Taiga cries for her Ryuuji, you might finding yourself tearing up or going ""Awww"" with the utmost sincerity. And Ryuuji is just as likable. Unfortunately, towards the end you start to disagree with alot of the character actions and will most likely end up a little irritated. The ending wasn't amazing but it was satisfying. It left you with a few questions floating around, but I haven't seen many animes with all the plot holes filled. All in all, Toradora is a great anime and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a slice-of-life, comedy, and romance preference. 

          
 
       Helpful Like all romantic comedies, Toradora is full of flaws. Yet, I still enjoyed all of it. I loved the premise of it. You know right off the bat that the two main characters will end up together, you just don't know how. I love the characters for the most part. Taiga has a more natural and unique feel compared to a typical tsundere. This can be said for the others as well. The characters feel natural and unique. 
 
Here's the problem. Like all romantic comedies, there is no real story. There's only the destination. That's not the actual problem, the problem is the journey. It's just every day problems building into a big problem, then that big problem gets solved. It's usually a problem that can be resolved with any form of communication too. We hit the reset button and start over again. It just seems like we're going around and solving each character's problem one by one until we reach the end. 
 
Now, for my one pet peeve. My one true issue with this entire series. Every time a big confession, big moment, or anything significant would take place, there was always an interruption. Phone calls during conversations, convenient arrivals (inconvenient for us, but convenient for the story), or just some form of milking the audience's attention. 
 
Despite these two flaws, I couldn't help but feel empty after it ended. There wasn't enough. Like Clannad, the ending felt rushed and packed into one or two episdoes. Like Clannad, I didn't get to see enough of what goes down after the fated couple end happily ever after. These flaws, however, are in just about every rom-com. That's the only reason you can forgive it. It's an unwelcome cliche, but it'll always be around. I still enjoyed all of it, nonetheless.

          
 
       Helpful What is it that draws one towards the most unlikely of relationships?  Is it the ""underdog"" qualities, where one desires to see the more ""unfortunate"" character have something wonderful happen to him/her?  Or would it be more along the lines that a ""perfect"" couple is just plain boring and those unlikely pairs are just fantastic to watch, making for an amazing story? 
 
Toradora introduces itself into the romantic comedy genre in a method where the two unlikely characters start off by liking the other's best friend.  However, the progress of each character with their personal love interest proves to be both entertaining and relatable.  The story begins with Ryuuji Takasu accidentally finding the confession letter of Taiga Aisaka, intended to be given to Yuusaku Kitamura (Ryuuji's best friend).  Taiga storms Ryuuji's room with a wooden sword, but Ryuuji reveals that he has a huge crush on Minori Kusheida (Taiga's best friend).  Both decide to help each other in this odd little love square, giving way to hilarity, mischief, drama and of course, romance.  Combine that with the rest of a fantastic cast of characters and the result is a romantic-comedy quite unlike any other I have seen.   
 
When I began watching Toradora (just a month or so after its initial release), I soon caught up with the airing date and was checking daily for the subbed version's release.  That in itself should give away just how much I came to enjoy this wonderful show.  Typically I like to review in a very systematic process; giving individual scores to each category and totaling them up to give an overall score out of 50.  But I feel that if I left it at that, I would be leaving a lot untold about this great show.  So I will give a follow up after my categorical review, for those of you who want a synopsis of my review, or just the ""meat"" and the bottom line. 
 
** STORY 10/10 **     
It takes several things to make a phenomenal story, such as an intriguing plot-line, a believable setting, characters and of course, conflict.  Sometimes, these components come together in such a way as to leave a tale that is worthy of being told and retold.  Toradora presents itself as one of these such tales, having all the workings of becoming one of my favorite stories.  Establishing itself as a school-slice-of-life with romantic, comedic and dramatic elements, the story progresses with quite a satisfying pace (save the last 2 episodes, 24 particularly, but that's another discussion entirely) and leaves the viewer desiring to know what happens next.  Each element of the story seems to be quite well balanced; comedic relief comes into play after a dramatic or tense moment to keep a light-hearted mood, the romance never seems too sappy or unrealistic (I'm sure you've seen those shows where the guy is surrounded by women who SOMEHOW just adore him without even knowing him) and generally speaking, each episode is truly enjoyable from start to finish.  As for the driving factors in the story's progression, the conflicts that show up are mostly internal, character-driven problems; those that you would expect in any typical classroom setting.  Ryuuji's single mom, Taiga's lack of parents even present in her life and the mere fact that their rooms are right next to each other give rise to many of the story's great problems and triumphs alike.  This has been, by far, one of my favorite, realistic story lines I've ever seen.  There were so many times that I felt like I could relate to any number of the characters that it felt as if I was watching a story based loosely on my own personal life.   
 
** ART  9/10 ** 
Now that an incredible story has been etched out and realized, what is the most efficient way to portray the events?  This is where the art comes in, as the medium in which the writers ""show"" how the story unfolds.  Ryuuji, with his ""scary, delinquent eyes"" is drawn really well.  Taiga is so cute throughout, Ami is pretty darn hot, and even the rest of the characters have their own unique appearance that lends to the believability of their personalities.  Each scene looks to be pretty well thought out and plenty of attention was paid to the details.  For the most part, art is one category that is hard to put words to, and instead must be experienced first-hand. 
 
** SOUND 9/10 ** 
Another key component to presenting the story is the sound department, including all the music, ambiance, object noises and voice cast.  Music wise, there's not much to say; the opening/ending themes are interesting, nothing to write home about, but can't really complain either.  During the show there's appropriate use of background melodies, but again, I was never floored by a scene because of some fantastic music.  Ambiance is spot on, many times a busy street sounds like one, the noise of cooking food, the sound of a street all sound pretty darn realistic and blend in smoothly.  Every object noise sounds like a live-sampled sound, in decent quality.  Doors, windows, footsteps even all sound great.  But the thing that pushes my score up to a 9/10 is the amazing voice-cast.  Each character is acted out incredibly well; emotions sound real, personalities even show up in the voices.  Again, sound is something that is hard to describe but must be heard and experienced. 
 
** CHARACTER 10/10 ** 
If there were a category in which I could weight the score heavier, this would be it.  Characters are what sell an anime to me, along with the story.  I have a hard time watching shows in which the characters are hollow or empty, boring, or otherwise lack anything worth mentioning.  That being said, each an every character blew me away.  There doesn't ever seem to be a ""filler"" character; each one lends their part to the overall story and just ""fits.""  I almost guarantee you will find a character in which you relate to in some form.  Each one is well thought out, well planned and scripted extremely well.  Towards the end of the anime, lines from each character seem to fit with the personality they represent.  Several ""Yeah, you would do that"" moments appear, as the main characters are portrayed so well that you feel like you know them personally after a few episodes.   
 
** ENJOYMENT 10/10 ** 
Of all the categories I review, this area should be taken with the biggest grain of salt.  What I find awesome, someone else may find horrible.   
So, with that, I give this category a 10, simply because I liked spending the time watching this show.  I also began waiting (often times very impatiently) for the next episode to be released and subbed, immediately downloading and watching it (even if it was 4 in the morning).  After episode 16 (where I caught up with the airing date) I began to watch each episode twice; once on the release date (usually a Thursday night for me) and again on the following Thursday before the next one aired, just to catch myself up with the story.  I don't regret it one bit, I laughed, then laughed again when I saw it again, knowing it was coming.  I will most likely be watching this again in a few months time, just because it was that good.  Also, the ending is very satisfying.  I have seen many an anime ending that was very cliche or just plain... stupid.  Not so with Toradora.  I felt good after watching it; it really resolved itself and finished off strong.  (Last episode... freaking awesome scene in it... you know which one I'm talking about, or you will know when you see it).   
 
** OVERALL 48/50 ** 
A near flawless score from me, with art and sound being the only non-10 scores.  This is definitely one of my top-10 animes now.  Sure, several things could have made it better, but may have also taken away value from other aspects of the show.   
 
***** BOTTOM LINE *****   
Toradora is a very cute and enjoyable romantic-comedy, slice-of-life anime that is definitely a must see.  With a very satisfying and smooth pacing, there aren't too many dull moments, making this show very good for either a marathon viewing, or a slow, one-episode-a-week pace.  The incredible cast of characters are truly what brings life to this anime, giving a realistic and highly relatable experience.  Don't hesitate to spend the time watching all 25 episodes; you won't be disappointed!

10,966,58,5.113783618544026,Campus romatic comedy,Crayon Shin-chan,"Just because an anime features a young protagonist does not necessarily mean that it is an appropriate series to show your children. Young Shinnosuke, or Shin-chan for short, is a very creative young boy that lives with his eccentric parents, Misae and Hiroshi, as well as his Prima Donna younger sister, Himawari, and has loads of unique friends to boot. 
 
Everyday life for little Shin-chan is full of funny (and shocking) moments, most of which stem from his unnatural and sometimes profane use of language, as well as his constant acts of inappropriate behavior. Shin-chan's famous ""elephant"" gag is one of the most defining moments in  Crayon Shin-chan , simply because it is the epitome of crude comedy, one of the core themes of the series. 
 
 Crayon Shin-chan  is a hilarious show about the day in the life of a young, curious boy, that captures the awkwardness of growing up as well as the beauty of being true to one's self, no matter what others say.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","Hands down, my favorite anime, it's original, extremely funny, you might say the art style is bad, until you realize that it's how the characters are supposed to be drawn. I have seen the anime about 15 times over,i watch it a lot, very re-watchable. For being 5, shin(main character) always gets himself into trouble, mostly for pulling down his pants and doing his famous ass dance, has a very potty mouth, and makes some hilarity with his 4 friends. Georgie being my favorite of the 4. In all this anime deserves awards for awesomeness

          
 
       Helpful Well, that sure does it for me with this show. 
After watching literally 999 episodes and with the 1000th one just around the corner this next Friday, I think it's safe to assume I'm so deep into this show's endless nature that I will likely die before they stop making episodes for it (and movies, and Specials, and OVAs, and...). 
 
I'll take a big On-Hold hiatus from this until it somehow comes to an end (which I doubt), just to say that I'm not actually dropping it, because stupid me here never drops anime for pure OCD at this point. 
 
Such is the longevity of Japanese family fun anime ever since Sazae-san (that one I can't even watch whether I want it or not, since the eps are not preserved and no copies were made for several of the lost ones). Gotta say though, as much as I enjoy watching this to pass time, it's bound to get amazingly repetitive with the quirks, humor, eventual flanderizations and even some of its smartest comedic aspects. 
 
You still get here and there absolutely hilarious episodes, legit tearjerking moments (some of which even directly connects to a bigger picture made into a movie) and overall a lot of fun with the cast's great chemistry with each other. But at this point, you are also bound to find one huge mixed bag of overdone content and unfortunately very toned down comedy edges for a series that actually had a history of being quite the risquè enthusiast with many of its elements (being instead substituted at times with Disney Junior levels of ""for kids"" content, which was quite a shock considering how much this series used to really never stepped down too much from always trying to be very accessible for both parents and children to have their share of giggles). 
 
Other than that, this bit is quite obvious for anyone familiar with the series: 
 
Art and animation were always mediocre at best, although becoming a lot more fluid and well animated over the years in several specific occasions. 
Sound being your usual japanese slice of life comedy generic tunes with some memorable songs thrown in at times and of course, if you account on this category, your usual old-school cliche sound effects and punchline delivery shenenigans. 
 
And for an anime this long to only have had 17 openings and 15 endings is a bit weird and underwhelming as an element to look forward to in several cool plotlines that could have been made into them, if you allow me to do a nitpick, but that's just my opinion as a OP/ED lover myself. 
 
The characters literally make this show by themselves and are the true shine of this whole anime however. You really got to appreciate just how many situations they come up with in which the characters by simply being in there and acting like the audience would expect them to (and sometimes the situation being severally subverted for better or for worse, just to make a side note as to why this show can be unpredictable with part of its character interactions even taking in consideration the issue with flanderization mentioned above), and you have a funny time for solid 7-13 minutes depending on how long the segment sets itself up to be. 
 
Talking about that, something that makes this anime works in the Enjoyment portion is just how much it really tries not to overstay its welcome, always opting to going for 2-3 short different segments per episode (saved for some exceptions), many times being animated and written by different people of the anime staff, which gives a bit of lively variety in its own way. 
 
This anime has, as to be expected for such a long long-running anime, a lot of flaws and a mixed bag of episodes (to the point of several times being a mixed bag as a segmented episode per se). But you can't deny the overall appeal, influence and just how good it is in many regards in its own merits, for a comedy series. 
 
Besides all of its problems, I can't help but to give a solid and well deserved 7/10. 
 
If you are not a crazy person like me that goes completionist mode with every anime they touch, do yourself a favor and give a try at least in the first episodes, I can guarantee that, even if it isn't quite your kind of comedy, you will still have a good time with it. 
 


          
 
       Helpful ***THIS IS A REVIEW SOLELY FOR THE FUNIMATION ADULT SWIM CRAYON SHIN-CHAN*** 
 
When I first acknowledged that Shin-chan is finally going to be dubbed and licensed in NA, I was filled with thrill and excitement, having been a diehard Kureiyon Shin-chan fan since I was born, and could not wait to see it. However, after watching through all of it, and saw that there isn't any review on MyAnimeList on this specific release, I felt like I could give a word of advice or two for those who haven't seen it but will. 
 
Every bit of the English dubbed version of Crayon Shin-chan reminds me of the Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt dub. It is just a blatant and unjustifiable excuse for the voice actors, actresses and script writers to have fun and mess around with everything but without totally screwing up the original intentions and quality, but instead adding on top of it a different, but more suited type of humor for their intended audiences (North America and other English-native cultural based countries). 
 
With that summary said, it is clear now that those who have watched all the three-season 78~ episodes, will surely be shocked, interested, and surprised by what Adult Swim and FUNimation can do to totally turn an everyone-rated show into a purely adult-targeted grotesque and profane Newgrounds type of parody. I will try my best not to go off-topic in this review, but make it easy, cohesive, and be as critical and non-biased/objective as possible. 
 
In the American version of Shin-chan, many episodes that long-time original viewers are familiar with are turned upside down in such a way that each and every dialogue is different, thus resulting a different episodic story that tries to reach its audiences, but fails to leave an heavy impression like any of the originals do. There are of course the famous Apartment (Shin-chan blows up their house) arc, a Star Wars parody, and some related episodes that share the same settings (Happiness bunny's revenge, etc.) which FUNimation did an incredible job of dubbing them, however these still lacked the overall productive and practical sense of enjoyment the original had. 
 
This dilemma is verified through the four or five commentary episodes, where all the voice actors come together to bash the show and explain why they did what they have done as they saw fit. Not only that, but in certain episodes many lines direct to the audience in an attempt to break the fourth wall, however this trend only adds to the audience's confusion often times to the already confusing story in each hardcore edited episodic plot and setting. 
 
The original show's humor primarily focuses on Shin-chan's lingual disabilities, a fetish on butt-dance, lewd and childish acts, and all his friends‘ and families' yelling at him. The FUNimation version takes a huge opposite turn and deviates away from such elements, and create a world of their own. The dubbed show contains violence, insults, every-5-second swearing, characters' misery as laugh points, and just unbearable, incredibly shallow dirty and racial jokes. As expected when trying to convert such a cultural-heavy comedy show. 
 
While both shows tend to involve the exploitation of Shin-chan's private parts, nudity, and his father and his' abnormal perverted interest in hot, young-looking teenage girls and cougars, the US version tends to use this as one of the primary selling points of the show. But this is done incredibly well that it left the viewers not comfortable enough if one episode did not have a scene of Shin-chan's commenting on wanting to grope the breasts of his prey(this generalization is lacking in the original, as it can do with or without the lewd comments). 
 
The characters and their stereotypes have not quite changed. Hiro is still the average working class, Misae still the totalitarian dictator, Shin-chan the clueless, eccentric boy, etc. however certain characters behave differently here and there and have totally different roles to their original versions. Shiro (Whitey) has a British accent and a cunning personality, the teachers are all over sex and don't care about the things they say to the kids, the kindergarten principal is now a Mexican who is made fun of a-lot about for his genital sizes. 
 
Up to this point, I should be able to bring the fundamental difference between the show that made me give this a 7 and the original series and movies a 9. It is lacking many of the morals, emotional connections, and familial love and relationship lessons the latter offers the audience. This version completely disregard any of the said good qualities the original had, and will not satisfy the emotional side of your soul. Sounds cheesy, I know, but it's true. Original Shin-chan was not as shallow as FUNimation version, and had a lot more connotation that the viewers could not watch without. 
 
Shin-chan is old, and is birthed in the 90's. While the current episodes are getting along with the times, in 720p and all that jazz, the center concept and themes still haven't changed. As FUNimation picked episodes that are quite old and still revolves around more mature-but less appealing humor, they do quite a damn well excellent job in adapting for the American audience. By comparing the two versions side by side, one can easily distinguish the comedy values of the two cultures. 
 
The cultural and lingual barriers of the jokes are non-existent as they do in the original subbed version, perhaps due to the fact that FUNimation did not pick the episodes where Shin-chan says something in Japanese similar to another word or phrase, and their parents or friends correct them, and similar type of jokes the average Joe just wouldn't be able to comprehend or find funny, due to aforementioned differences. At times the viewers can even find the voice actors themselves making fun of the show inside the show. Inception! In regards with the voice acting, not enough compliments and respect can be given to FUNimation at how perfectly they can use the same animation, but produce such drastic and incredible results, by only using clever lines, meta, and reference jokes. 
 
To sum it up, I don't want to make this a TL;DR review, so what's most important is this: take this review with a grain of salt, and you will either love-or-hate this version. For those of you who have not watched a single episode of original Shin-chan and have no clue what it is about, watch it as if you were watching a newgrounds parody, because that's what American Crayon Shin-Chan is, but at its best. For those who have seen or are seeing the original, this will be a new start, a totally fresh start that won't bore, but appreciated by the seasoned Shin-chan lovers. Completely enjoyable, though occasionally offensive and confusing, FUNimation and Adult Swim does the job well done. 
 
Scored ratings and punchlines: 
 
Story 6/10 (Quite decent, some are superb innovation and unexpected, some are just repetitive and brainless, thus a fairly balanced mix) 
 
Art 5/10 (The style of Shin-chan is natively deformed and extremely cartoon like, with the occasional short scenes with superb artistic styles only to emphasize the mood and atmosphere. However, the consistency between episodes is what bothers me quite an amount. Thus the low rating) 
 
Sound 8/10 (Every voice acting piece was god-like, no flaws, no awkward moments, just a hell lot of fun and everyone especially Laura Bailey of Shin-chan puts their all into it) 
 
Character 8/10 (Ridiculous, unbelievable, yet understandable and relate-able, the characters seem to be more enjoyable but less respectable than in the original version) 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 (If you liked PSG, FLCL, and all the nonsensical comedy genre animes, you should definitely not skip the FUNimation version of Crayon Shin-chan. 50% trolling, 40% sex-related jokes, and 10% parody. What more could you need to laugh your butts off?) 
 
Overall 7/10 (Don't know any better way to say it: It is definitely, certainly, and undoubtedly a waste of time, but if you had time to waste, you wouldn't feel it was wasted with FUNimation's Shin-chan!)

","I saw this anime at a friends house as such it was a 2-episode OVA that I managed to watch all of it in less than an hour. 
When I came to watching the anime it was alright the story is a little bizzare but still decent, its about a goddess who can turn young men into the women that they dream of and if that is not weird enough it turns into a comedy at a certain point over the goddess's special powers and it also gets a bit irritating for the characters she used them on. 
There are a few mature scenes, more so near the end of the 2nd episode but they do not get too explict. I would definatley give this anime 16s+ or even 15s. 
The characters are alright, not much of the plot involves her man-puppet Pipi he is like the center of the shows humour for certain scenes and the rest deals with Kaguya the goddess who seems very friendly but she can be like a devil when she is manipulating the fabric of reality. 
I would reccomend this anime to anyone who is a fan of mature anime that do not go overboard. Anyone who likes anime such as Elfen Lied, Ai Yori Aohsi and maybe Moonlight Lady might enjoy this.

10,10495,60,5.024939323526952,Campus romatic comedy,Yuru Yuri,"After a year in grade school without her childhood friends, first year student Akari Akaza is finally reunited with second years Yui Funami and Kyouko Toshinou at their all-girls' middle school. During the duo's first year, Yui and Kyouko formed the ""Amusement Club"" which occupies the now nonexistent Tea Club's room. Shortly after Akari joins, one of her fellow classmates, Chinatsu Yoshikawa, pays the trio a visit under the impression that they are the Tea Club; it is only once the three girls explain that the Tea Club has been disbanded that they can convince Chinatsu to join the Amusement Club—a group with no purpose other than to provide entertainment for its members. 
 
Based on the slice-of-life manga by Namori,  Yuru Yuri  is an eccentric comedy about a group of girls who spend their spare time drinking tea and fawning over each other, all while completely failing to even notice the supposed main character Akari amongst them. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo Ai']","Taking place at the fictional Nanamori Middle School in Takaoka, Toyama, the series revolves around the daily lives of the Amusement Club (ごらく部, Goraku-bu), consisting of Akari Akaza, her childhood friends, Kyōko Toshinō and Yui Funami, and her classmate, Chinatsu Yoshikawa; along with the school's Student Council which is made up of its own set of characters.
","Story (8): This is the story summed up: 4 middle schoolers who hang out in a tea room and have fun. If you like Lucky Star, you will also like Yuru Yuri. 
 
Art (9): Although there is no shading, the lineart makes up for it by, like, a lot. The artist draws hands amazingly. 
 
Sound (8): The themes are just as cheerful and fun as the anime itself, and the voices match the characters' personalities perfectly. 
 
Character (10): The characters have cute designs, and none of them are Mary-Sues (a female character who has absolutely NO flaws and everyone love her. You won't find any in Yuru Yuri.). 
 
Enjoyment (10): I like that how each episode is similar yet different. Also, I enjoy the preview that one of the characters gives a preview for the next episode at the end of each episode. 
 
Overall, I give this anime a 9 and I recommend it! :D 
 


          
 
       Helpful To say Yuru Yuri should be taken seriously, is like telling a vegetarian to eat at McDonald's. Yuru Yuri is not just over-the-top, it's completely mad with a side order of bonkers. What I'm getting at, is that Yuru Yuri is insane, and that's exactly what it needs to be in order to stand out. 
 
Yuru Yuri is about four girls who take over the tea club room at an all-girls school because nobody uses it anymore and hi-jinks ensue. Before you write this off a moe Haruhi rip-off, I will remind you that Yuru Yuri doesn't have a story so messy that it makes what a tornado does look like the work of a Cleaning-Nazi, or much of a story at all. The description I gave you is the extent of the plot, and is really more of a set up to the events that happen throughout. The story really works, because it fucks around at any and all given opportunities. The title is the first sign, because anything that has ""Yuri"" in the title, aside it being straight-up hentai, is not going to have any serious cards in its deck. If that doesn't do it for you, then allow me to tell you, the second joke in the series is a Big-Lipped Alligator Moment. Now, when you pull one of those that early in the series, that says you're not fucking around when it comes to fucking around. 
 
This series is all for fucking around, and that's exactly why it's worth watching. It's a series that's trying to make you laugh, and each attempt is so over-the-top, and well-executed, that you can't help but laugh. The best part of it, is most of the jokes are self-aware and self-parody, and it's all so insanely cartoon-ish that you just know to not think about this in a serious  light, because it certainly isn't. It also uses irony to its advantage, the biggest example I'll get to later, and it's not smug about it, rather it's just as loopy as the rest of the humor. The jokes are so unpredictable and immersive that, even though you think it can't get any funnier, it somehow manages to do so, so basically Yuru Yuri is to fucking around what Serial Experiments Lain is to fucking your brain. 
 
The thing about the story is, it's not afraid to evolve itself either. In the midst of its humorous crusade, it looks at itself and decides to mix up the formula a bit. It takes its humor to new heights, even including some dark humor near the end, so the characters aren't the only ones experimenting in this anime, the anime itself experiments with itself as well, which means that you are allowed into the science lab when you're residing in the loony bin, despite not getting access to any of the sharp tools. The best example of this is in the second-to-last episode, where one of the characters is out of character because they hit their head and doesn't sexually harass a character she usually does, and the other character gets upset about it. ""Wow"" I thought. ""Not only is this some seriously funny shit, this is some good characterization."" 
 
The characters themselves are just as crazy as the story, more-so perhaps. They're each a style parody of characters of the genre, and are willing to take whatever joke they have to its new extreme. You could say a lot of the humor comes from character interactions and implications that are blown out of proportion. As established already, there is yuri in the show, if the title didn't tip you off, but it's not perverted, as much as it is both adorable and fucking hilarious. The humor keeps moving to more levels of funny, but it never loses its charm, and that's why it works. However, sexual orientation jokes are not the only ones the characters partake in. There are a lot of jokes about the character's main traits that are funny in more ways than one. Now, the biggest irony in the show deals with the main character, Akari. She is the butt-monkey of the series because the rest of the cast always point out she is not a very memorable character, making her one of the more memorable characters in the show, making each joke all the more funnier. The entire cast is very well-developed, and well-characterized and are willing to make jokes that characterize the series. 
 
So far, I have been saying good things about this show, but what about the bad? Well, for starters, the music and art are seemingly generic. The art especially has this problem, because it has just decent backgrounds and decent character designs. Now, I have said mundane artwork works with series before, but that's not the case here. They worked, because it reflects the nature of the show's normality, and there's nothing normal about Yuru Yuri. It just feels like it could have tried harder in the art department. As for the music, it mostly feels unimportant. Yes, it's very good, but it doesn't feel like it wants to be noticed. That is, aside from the catchiest opening theme this side of Working!!, thanks in part by the studio that made it Dogakobo, who only other previous work I've seen (Myself;Yourself) also had a very catchy opening. The ending is also quite good, though not as catchy as the opening. 
 
The story also has some problems. You see, while it's not afraid to experiment with what it has and reaching new heights with it, it is afraid of expanding to new territory. It feels like it only wants to parody the specific genre it's in and hardly anything else, and I feel an opportunity was missed to  gain more jokes out the whole experience by limiting the material it parodies to what it knows. Though, I suppose if the nice people who help you at the asylum won't let you near the pointy objects, asking for a bulldozer to expand your territory is really pointless. Another thing about the story I don't like is the habit of bringing up plot points and then never mentioning them again, or in layman's terms, having too many Big-Lipped Alligator moments. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Big-Lipped Alligator moment, but this series abuses how many one can have before it starts to get irritating. Still, this doesn't have a very big effect on the rest of the story, and you can still enjoy it all, but it is quite bothersome at some points. 
 
Overall: Yuru Yuri is fun and enjoyable. The amount of self-parody is uncanny and in good proportion. If you're looking for something mindless and funny, than this is it. Yuru Yuri really knows what it is, and what it is, is totally, mouth-breathingly, paste-eatingly, chasing the girls around the playground with a piece of pooingly stupid. And I wouldn't have it any other way. 8/10

          
 
       Helpful Cute comedy!  
 
This was a great sitcom type show about an all girl cast (really I think there might have been one background guy that mad an appearance in season 2) who basically make their own club and have little interactions with other girls in the school. They develop some ""interesting"" relationships. Overall very light and easy to watch, although season 3 does get a bit touchy/feely, recommend watching all of it if you do decide to take this one on.  
 
STORY: 
 
Well like I said this is a sitcom there are lot of random episodes like one where everyone just goes on dates and one where one of the main characters goes back in time... Some things blow up and some girls have a bunch of fantasies that makes her nose bleed. If you watch all the seasons and start to like all the characters then really the little story that is there will be good enough. I felt like the first two seasons were full of great ideas with funny things happening in each episodes plot. Then once they get to season 3 they find a way to conclude it on a really happy note so you won't be wondering what really happened. A very satisfying feeling instead of the ""omg wtf just happened"" feeling... 
 
ART: 
 
Cute. Yeah it was really cute the way they made this anime, the reactions of the characters and different personalities and showcased well by the artists. And I really like the colours!! The colours they choose to use in an anime really sets the overall mood and with Yuri Yuri its all bright, cute, girly colours. Each character has a different coloured hair and when I think about the anime I think pink, yellow, light blue, really appealing. 
 
SOUND: 
 
I really liked the songs they choose, I think I must have watched the opening majority of the time since I liked to hear it again and again. Puts you in a really happy mood and sets you up for the show pretty well. All the voices were unique to each character, nothing seemed out of place. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
This is what the show is really about! It's like watching Friends or Seinfeld but about a group of teenage girls in a club house who drink tea and do random stuff together. I think its pretty cool looking back on it because they really incorporated so many different personalities of girls into the show. They area all so different that you can associate traits from girls you know to each of them. There are four main characters who are basically a confident tom-boy, a creative, a creepy-cute girl, and a cute-normal girl (with not much presence but everyone likes her anyways). They balance each others personalities really well and then the dynamic between them and the other 5-6 girls in school (and some of their weird sisters makes each episode really easy to watch. I personally like to watch shows because of the characters and their relationships so I think this was a great show because of it.

She quickly befriends Chino with the full intention of becoming like her older sister, much to Chino's annoyance. From there she will experience her new life and befriend many others, including the military-influenced, yet feminine Rize Tedeza, the playful Chiya Ujimatsu who goes at her own pace, and the impoverished Syaro Kirima who commands an air of nobility and admiration despite her background. Slowly, through slices of life, often comedic, Cocoa becomes irreplaceable in her new friends' lives, with Chino at the forefront.
","As you would expect, Gochuumon is a slice of life anime about cute girls doing cute things. However, the emphasis on actual humor puts it well above many others in the slice of life category. 
 
Story: N/A 
It's a slice of life show, so there is no real story to speak of. Cocoa moves into the cafe that Chino's family owns during the first episode, and that's about it. Besides very small character development don't expect much more than this. 
 
Art: 9 
With a show like this you have to make cute girls, and yes, they are cute. The colors of the girls pop out and the animation rarely falters.  Everyone is very detailed.  I actually prefer this look in this type of anime rather than the moe blob or ultra deformed types I've seen.  The outfits change often and all look nice. The backgrounds are not bad either, and the scenes change often letting you see more of the town they live in. Not much else I can say about them besides they look nice and they are obviously not in Japan. 
 
Sound: 7 
The music in Gochuumon fits well with the show. While there was nothing extremely memorable a la Clannad or Bakemonogatari, it still felt pretty strongly tied to the show. While I can't think of a song now after finishing the show, I remember often getting songs stuck in my head while it aired.  The voice acting was well done and everyone fit their characters.  I don't remember a time telling myself ""Wow this voice actor is amazing and playing out this role so well!"" but I also never thought anyone was out of place.  The voices fit the characters and there's not much else to say. 
 
Characters: 8 
What's a good slice of life anime without good characters? Or rather, characters that are fun together?  The Gochuumon cast is a tightly knit group with everyone able to play off of others situations.  While Chino is a shy younger girl who has a hard time talking, Cocoa is older and is kind of a siscon. This plays throughout the show as she tries to get Chino to call her her older sister.  Chiya and Sharo/Syaro have been friends for a long time often have a gag with Chiya revealing something Sharo/Syaro doesn't want to be known.  Rize is the military buff of the group, but wants to be just a regular highschool girl.  She is looked up to by Sharo/Syaro which results in many funny moments.  There's many other situations throughout the show but the recurring jokes are nice as well.  There are many situations that work for the group in the show and the characters do well to turn these situations into humor.   I enjoyed the cast a lot and cannot wait to see more of them. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Gochuumon is FUNNY.  I've watched quite a few slice of life shows now to know that many are cute girls doing cute things, but very few are actually funny.  The emphasis is usually placed on being cute and having cute characters.  Gochuumon seems to have it right seeing as they rely more on comedy than cute.  Yes there are still parts there just to make you say ""aw"" and small bits of fan service, but there are also many parts that can make you laugh out loud (surprising to me for a slice of life besides Nichijou and Nichibros).  This is a step in the right direction in my opinion.  I would rather have cute girls doing funny things than cute girls doing cute things.  Many shows recently have been going for cute, like Kiniro Mosaic, but not focusing on being actually funny.  Gochuumon fulfills the comedy genre it's put under. 
 
Overall: 8 
If you want a funny show about cute girls, watch this show.  If you want a show that you can just relax to, watch this show.  If you want a straight up  comedy I would still recommend this show.  I wouldn't recommend this show to people who despise the slice of life genre.  While a comedy, it is still a slice of life show in which there is not much story or anything happening.  Some people who dislike slice of life may enjoy simply for the humor but more cute girls are probably not going to change most people's minds. 
 
I would highly recommend this show to most everyone.  Like I said before, the only person I wouldn't recommend to would be people who dislike slice of life.  Gochuumon is funny, cute and lovable.   
 
Highly Recommended.

          
 
       Helpful I thought this was another moeblob anime and did not start watching until it was finished airing, I WAS GRAVELY MISTAKEN. 
 
So what does this anime have that stand out from all the other cute girls slice of life? 
 
Comedy: IT IS ACTUALLY FUNNY, it doesn't try to force the comedy and let some other aspects like commonly the cuteness of characters to compensate for it.  
 
Characters: They have depth and intelligent! The characters are not just there solely for being cute. As the story progress, you can see the changes in their relationship with each others, their thinking which they don't speak aloud, and their overall growth. They are more ""real"" and don't walk the fine line of cute or ""are they okay in the head?"" as the more cliche cute girl slice of life. 
 
As for the more general side of things: 
 
Story: Slice of life. An everyday look in the lives of the cast after 1 of the main girl move into town, you will see their characters progress through events and scenes which are often comedic in nature. 
 
Art: Cute, warm, soft. I REALLY LIKE THE ART STYLE, CHARACTER DESIGN, the scale of characters size which made them pretty loli-ish. The setting which are inspire by the real location of Colmar France, they capture the beauty and put it in the anime. 
 
Sound: The Op and Ed stay true to the genre, but not really my type of music. 
 
Character: I already wrote it above. A perfect combination of main cast and support characters. 
 
Enjoyment: I REALLY enjoy it, it put a sunshine on any cloudy day and crush any depressive mood. 
 
Overall: MASTERPIECE, never have i seem a cute girls slice of life executed so perfectly, with so much grace. 


          
 
       Helpful Yeah, I'm giving Is The Order a Rabbit (ITOAR) a 10. Allow me to explain. 
 
ITOAR is a 10 to me because it is the perfect embodiment of moe. I describe this show as ""Loli Heaven."" It's got nothing but cute girls. I'll break it down now. 
 
Story: 0/10. The show explores both simple and complex things, from learning a new skill or baking bread with friends, to understanding the complex workings of forming and maintaining relationships. Each episode is a one or two vignettes that don't really follow any over-arching narrative. If you've seen Yuru Camp or Gabriel Dropout, it follows those lines. That sets it apart from say, Blend S, that at least has a general direction. I gave ITOAR a 0/10 here because, basically, there is no story. That's ok though, because you'd come to this show for all of the following things. 
 
Art: 10/10. Holy shit. This show is adorable. All the girls are just so fucking cute and there are so many little things that it does to pull your heartstring. From small blushes on the girls' cheeks to big smiles to the way the VAs do their lines, it's pretty damn perfect. 
 
Sound: 8/10. The OP and ED are both super cute. I put it up there with the Blend S or Dragon Maid OPs in terms of cuteness and memorability. As I said earlier, the VAs deliver each line well. The girls tend to speak somewhat slowly, so it may be a good show if you want to practice your Japanese. I only know what I've picked up from watching anime but I could pick out phrases here and there. I take away 2 points only because the general OST in-scene isn't memorable. I can't say it's bad but it also doesn't stick out. That may not be a bad thing but I can't award points to what I don't notice. 
 
Characters: 10/10. Five girls. All unique. They have a depth not often seen in your run of the mill Moe show. They're not sickly-sweet, a problem I had with Yuru Yuri, and sometimes they go through rough patches.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10. I would sometimes squirm at how cute things are. Chino and Cocoa are adorable together. The rabbits everywhere, and the odd obsession with them, is great. There are a few mysteries that linger throughout the show, but it wouldn't matter to me or most if they are solved or not (to point out, I'm halfway through the show rn so I don't know if they are solved or not).  
 
Overall: 10/10. Hands-down one of the best moe shows out there. I posted on the anime subreddit for moe and this was one of the most recommended shows. I see why now. I understand that the show has ~7.5 at the time of this review, likely because it's not a show that someone who exclusively watches shounens or fantasies will like. But if you want moe, it's here. Chino rivals Kanna for best loli imo, which I think says something.

10,5060,62,4.996006624533604,Campus romatic comedy,Hetalia Axis Powers,"What if nations were people? What traits would they have? What would this mean for historical events? 
 
 Hetalia Axis Powers  takes these questions and runs with them, personifying countries into characters. The show takes a comedic and light approach to politics and historical events while educating the viewer. 
 
Taking place primarily during the events of World War I and World War II, the story focuses on the Axis Powers and occasionally throws the spotlight onto the tumultuous relationship between the Allied Forces. The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests. 
 
Based on Hidekaz Himaruya's widely popular webcomic turned print manga,  Hetalia Axis Powers  is a historical comedy that pokes lightly at culture, examines the relationships between nations and breathes fun into history.

There is pretty much no plot whatsoever but that doesn't mean it's not a good series. It's a great series if you need a break from thinking or if you are incapable of thinking. 
Also, everything I know about History is from Hetalia so it is worth watching. 
But no plot.

I'm giving it an 8 because I enjoyed the art. It's cute. It's funny. But not anything special. (especially from Chibitalia - I WANT AN ITALY!!!!!!!!)

A lot of people hate Italy's voice from FUNimation dub. I personally think it suits him. I REALLY like his Chibitalia voice.  
And the ending theme song fits it so well. ""Draw a circle that's the earth....."" lol

       Helpful When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

          
 
       Helpful First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story – inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio – is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

Whether offering counsel to the Momotarou of Japanese folklore or receiving diplomatic missions from the Judeo-Christian Hell, the demon who runs the show from behind the king's imposing shadow is ready to beat down any challenges coming his way into a bloody pulp. Metaphorically, of course... 
 
The poster boy for micromanagement and armed with negotiation skills worthy of Wall Street,  Hoozuki no Reitetsu  follows the sadistic and level-headed Hoozuki as he spends his days troubleshooting hell. With an abundance of familiar faces from popular Japanese legends and East Asian mythology working middle management positions, this referential and anachronistic dark comedy brings new meaning to the phrase ""employer liability."" Just how hard could it be to manage employees from hell, anyway? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy', 'Seinen']","An ogre-like demon and former human Hozuki (鬼灯, Hōzuki) works as Chief of Staff under King Enma (閻魔大王, Enma-Daiō), the King and Head Judge of Hell, who determines what kind of hell the dead will be sent to. The serious-minded Hozuki attempts to manage and troubleshoot unusual problems that occur in the Japanese hell. Two of Hozuki's most prominent subordinates are Karauri (唐瓜) and Nasubi (茄子). Other characters in the underworld include Okoh (お香, Okō) the chief assistant of Mortal Hell; Mustard (マスタード), the rabbit from Kachi-kachi Yama, who acts cute but snaps when someone says Tanuki/Raccon or acts as one; Peach Maki (ピーチ・マキ, Pīchi Maki), a famous idol in Hell and Hozuki's acquaintance; and Yoshitsune Minamoto (源義経, Minamoto no Yoshitsune), a commander in the Crow-Tengu Police. Hozuki's main rival is Hakutaku (白澤), a Chinese medicine expert who works at Shangri-La. Hakutaku is assisted by Momotarō (桃太郎), who was a famous samurai in life. Momotaro's pets Shiro (シロ) the dog, Kakisuke (柿助) the monkey, and Rurio (ルリオ) the pheasant are also regular characters in the series, working as torturers in the animal cruelty section of hell. In the second season, more characters are introduced such as the original Chief of Staff Izanami-no-Mikoto (伊邪那美命), Miki (ミキ, Miki) an Idol signed in Maki's Idol office  and Hozuki's Twin Zashiki-warashi adopted daughters.
","There aren’t many anime in the comedy genre that does well what Hoozuki no Reitetsu has done. That is delivering an amusing tale that parodies a mythology. And it is made even more interesting as it teaches you the history behind the mythologies portrayed in the show.  
 
The show operates under the premise that the viewer has a basic gist of Japanese Hell, as well as other worlds such as European Hell and Chinese Heaven. It follows the character, Hoozuki, a very sadistic, no-nonsense-but-sometimes-I-want-my-own-fun, advisor to the King of Japanese Hell in a slap-stick and often subtle humor that takes a little thinking of the viewers’ end.  
 
This comedy isn’t just a show where there are simply running gags, well-delivered punchlines, and clichés that you would typically see in a comedy. The jokes in the show evolve. That is because in HnR, the incorporation of different mythologies permits that. You see interactions that you normally wouldn’t see between demons of Euro Hell when meeting their Japanese counterparts. The jokes and gags become even more complex as new characters are introduced, but never does the complexity of a joke require too much information of the actual mythology for one to understand. 
 
 One could almost hear the writers thinking ‘What would happen if Lucifer and Enma meet?’ or ‘How do we make a demon piss his pants?’ Suffice the say, the results of the writers’ and directors’ efforts are successfully pulled off and you’re left with one hell of a hilarious concoction.  
 
One of the most fascinating things about the show is the back stories of each character. They’re minced in with truth and fiction, and most of the time they form a very volatile kind of humor that are brought out by the characters’ interaction with each other. IE Hoozuki and Haku, Hoozuki and Enma, Haku and the various women of each Hell, among many other combinations. However, you begin to see a pattern that different combinations have different dynamics, but none I assure you, are boring. Each have their own personality as dictated by the history they’ve been given by the real world, putting you at the edge of your seat to see how they react to one another’s antics.

       Helpful Boy am I glad I decided to pick up this anime. I’d been looking for something like Saiki K no Psi-Nan, one of my all-time favourites, and found this on the list of recommendations. The two anime are actually totally different in many aspects, but Hoozuki no Reitetsu definitely filled the void left by Saiki K, at least for a little while. 
 
The anime was fun to watch, it was interesting, it had an utterly brilliant and hilarious set of characters, and it even ended up teaching me a lot of Japanese folktales and history. Granted, there were a lot of references that I either needed to look up or only knew from other anime/manga, but that isn’t a bad thing so no negative votes on that. It’s actually a testament to the anime that I enjoyed it so much despite likely missing a lot of the references. 
 
Okay, now to the individual parts of the series. 
 
Art/animation – not fabulous or anything, but appropriate for the type of anime that was being shown. It’s a very specific style, reminiscent of the old paintings and drawings associated with the folktales themselves. 
 
Sound – here I do have to say, I actually couldn’t stand the opening. It was one of the only ones that I’ve ever skipped every time in an anime. That is, until I found out what it meant, and then it just became hilarious. The rest of the sound was great, lots of old style music which again fit in perfectly, and the seiyuus were fantastic. Hozuki’s seiyuu, in particular, managed to capture his character so well. 
 
Story – very episodic, random, and sometimes nonsensical. Many of the stories had a Gintama-like feel to them in the way that events unfolded or the way the characters reacted to them, and especially due to the amount of (well-handled) gag humour. 
 
Characters – absolutely great. The cast was lively, quirky, interesting and hilarious. From the bumbling king of Japanese Hell to the whimsical playboy Hakutaku, the cast of somehow adorable trainee torturers and especially the utterly deadpan ‘coolheaded’ yet brutal general secretary Hozuki, there will always be someone who is enjoyable to watch. The characters don’t really get much in the way of development, it’s more about exploring their lives and the events happening around them than seeing how they grow throughout the series.  
 
I guess you could call it a satire, or parody of the slice-of-life genre, but basically, it’s just a lot of amusing and entertaining insights into the life of an administrator of hell. Exactly what it says. 
 
I’m not entirely sure who to recommend this to, but if you like series with a lot of deadpan humour, episodic stories or general randomness – like Gintama, Saiki K, Arakawa Under the Bridge, One Punch Man, or Nichijou (The daily lives of High School Boys), try checking this out. XD

Takanashi takes particular joy in doting on the older Popura, which only fuels her complex over how young she looks. He also quickly learns he must stay on his toes once he meets the rest of his colleagues, including the katana-wielding floor chief Yachiyo Todoroki, the intimidating head chef Jun Satou, the dangerously well-informed and subtly sadistic sous chef Hiroomi Souma, the adamantly lazy manager Kyouko Shirafuji, and the waitress Mahiru Inami who has a ""painful"" fear of men. 
 
Powered by an eccentric cast,  Working!!  is a unique workplace comedy that follows the never-dull happenings within the walls of Wagnaria as Takanashi and his co-workers' quirky personalities combine to create non-stop antics, shenanigans, and hilarity. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Working!, a popular anime adapted from a 4koma which is riding on the ""moe"" wave was one of the better shows of the Spring 2010 season. 
 
We start off the story with a young man named Souta Takanashi or more commonly known as Shinra or Lelouch. This young man is looking for a job to support his dysfunctional family filled with eccentric women. He is forced to help put food on the table for his underprivileged family and begins working a restaurant called the Wagnaria (Denny's) and meets a large array of hilarious characters. Takanashi needs to support his family because of the troubles at home. His mother works long hours and his father is dead yet due to his mother being an office lady she doesn't make enough to feed the family. Takanashi must take care of his 4 eccentric sisters by working at the restaurant. His oldest sister, Kazue, despite being a lawyer and in her 30's lives at home after going through a divorce and losing custody of her kids because she got home late and beat them. It's a miracle that she still can practice law and beat her kids but that's Japan's problem. Takanashi also needs to support his depressed siste, Izumi, who's liable to kill herself at any given moment and is too depressed to walk. Despite being nearly 30 she still lives at home and complains about the colorful world and keeps to her dark room. (If I could pick a girl from the show to be my wife, I'd take her..she'd fit my dark and brooding vampiric lifestyle perfectly). On top of that he has to take care of his drunken sister, Kozue, who despite somehow holding down a job spends all of her money on liquor and abortions for all the times she has unprotected sex with various men. To top it all off Takanashi's youngest sister Nazuna is manipulative and a dominatrix despite being in elementary school. As you can see Takanashi's family circumstances are very dark and upsetting which is the undertone for this series. I personally found the darkness and depth of this show to be excellent since I am a dark person myself and I like to sit in a dark corner at Starbucks and drink black coffee. 
 
While at work Takanashi's life is just as hard. He has to deal with a group of mentally unstable and eccentric people that are most likely on drugs (it's just like Denny's here in the US, the one by me was shut down because they were cooking meth in the basement). Takanashi is repeatedly beaten and abused by Mahiru Inami, a self proclaimed ""androphobe"" but in reality is just tweaking from her lack of meth at work. He also has to deal with the two strongest men in Ikebukuro, Satou and Souma who happen to the cooks. They do nothing but troll him and make fun of him and offer little consideration for Takanashi's home issues. He also has to work with a mentally challenged yet well endowed short girl named Poplar who can't do anything right yet somehow still has a job and a Zange clone who's also mentally challenged named Yamada. To top it off there's the two lesbian crew leaders named Kyouko and Yachiyo who service each other throughout the day. As you can see Takanashi's working life is not much better than his home life and the eccentric and most likely drugged up people he works with don't help his situation. 
 
The character depth and story of this show is very good and it gives off a very dark and deep theme. I like that in a show and I like to watch Takanashi suffer in his daily struggles that are shown in the show and to watch my 2d wife (waifu) Izumi. I give the story and characters an 8/10 because they were dark and depressing. However, there was too much fun in the series and it could have been better if there was more dramatic moments and if there were some tragedies. 
 
The sound and art was good so I give them a 9/10..they could have been drawn in a much darker setting but every Denny's I've been to is very bright to show off the cockroaches anyways. 
 
Overall I rate this show an 8/10..I really enjoyed the characters and their back stories and I really liked how the show related to a dark and foreboding creature like myself. I would definitely watch this on my windows powered laptop at Starbucks and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a dark and depressing show mixed with some comedy for extra enjoyment. I feel this show is the highlight of the spring season and I like the direction Japan is going with these depressing, vampire orientated shows as of late. However, this show was not without flaws..there could have been some gore added to it like with Satou and Souma in the kitchen having accidents and Poplar accidentally impaling herself on a broken glass shard. A little blood in a dark show like this goes a long way and I feel that it needed some sanguine goodness to be a 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Let's cut to the chase: Working!! was definitely an enjoyable watch. Despite lacking a strong plot, Working!! made up with an interesting cast of characters, and plenty of comedy. 
 
Story: 7 
Set in a family restaurant, Working!! focuses on the relationships and troubles of the staff working there. Although there is almost no plot, it's obvious that Working!! wasn't created with the intention of providing a gripping story for the viewer. Claustrophobics beware though; most of the story takes place inside Wagnaria. 
 
Art: 8 
Colourful and bright, the pallet used gave the anime a warm and happy atmosphere. The character designs complemented the respective personalities and traits of each character, and were skilfully implemented. The restaurant interior was quite detailed, although many locations were recurring, so I'm not surprised if they reused cells. 
 
Sound: 8 
The OP was... fun and cute. You'll probably be humming someone -WAN-WAN after watching this. The soundtrack was good, although not a tear jerking musical masterpiece, it did match the atmosphere and enhance the overall enjoyment. The seiyuu's were all great, and they matched the characters well. Fun fact: the voice actor for Inami is Saki Fujita, which Hatsune Miku was sampled from. 
 
Character: 9 
This is where Working!! really shone. The characters were all highly unique, with no obvious stereotypes (e.g. tsundere), and used each of their individual traits to a comedic effect. Not only are each and every character unique and interesting, they are all shown to a reasonable degree of depth, which made this show much more than just a boring animated sitcom. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
The show was definitely enjoyable. The plethora of characters and their amusing reactions and interactions kept a smile on my face throughout every episode. Certainly a great watch for someone looking for a light hearted anime.

          
 
       Helpful Ok I'll admit it, I was quick to judge. I didn't like the first episode because it felt like it was going to be a super heavy lolicon because of emphasis on Popura's shortness and Takanashi's love of well...children. I meandered through the first couple episodes, all grumbles and eye rolls.  
 
Somewhere around episode 3 or 4 I started enjoying things, as other characters got involved, like Takanashi's family, which is great, and Inami in general, who I think is a great character. By episode 8, I was fully invested and loving it, forgetting all of my initial worries.  
 
All in all I thought it was a good slice of life in the end, not earth-shattering, but fun to pass the time, with enough characters that you'll find at least one to like. A good filler show for chill summers.

       Helpful “	If the heroes run and hide, who will stay and fight?[9]	” 
— Saitama to Genos 
Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[10] The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[3] and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably.[11] The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and ""unimpressive"" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[12] 
 
Saitama has limited patience for long explanations, however, and will often interrupt the speaker.[13][14][15] His ideal word count is 20 or less.[13] 
 
A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgot Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[16] or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger is.[17] Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[18]

The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
 
Saitama has been shown to be very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against the Deep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival.[19] He did the same for the police station, killing a monster while disguised as a police officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was.[20] He also did not mind that King took credit for all of his achievements.[21] Despite his humility and modesty, he still retains some sense of pride, since he wants to beat up Garou after realizing that the latter didn't want to hunt him during his hero hunt, just because he is a low-ranking hero who is not worthy to be hunted. However, Saitama's desire to pummel Garou mostly comes from his desire for an exciting and challenging fight, not for his pride as a powerful hero. 
 
Another surprising thing about Saitama is that he is very tactful and insightful, being well able to discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him fairly easily. He was able to pick up a number of hints to Sonic's own persona upon their first meeting.[22] When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after the meteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discern Fubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[23] 
 
Saitama has been shown to show remorse to his enemies before, particularly ones who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this is Boros, with whom Saitama sympathized, due to suffering from similar circumstances. Though in the end, even Boros still couldn't draw out Saitama's full power.[24] Garou is also one, as he recognized Garou did not want to become a monster, but rather felt that was his spot. 
 
Saitama does not actually care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[25] the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything pertaining to his baldness.[26][27] He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. He also shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent who had undergone a transformation and was beating him around.[28] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one actually knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[29] Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated when Genos listed off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. 
 
Saitama demonstrates impressive restraint with his power, considering that he is easily capable of splitting the sky or jumping from the moon to earth. He manages to beat nearly all of his opponents with a single punch, though occasionally causes more devastation than necessary. While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing another human and only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. 
 
Becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[30] Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society like Hammerhead.[31] 
 
Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos to quiet his revenge wishes and start training to become a good hero, also he's made insecure people like Fubuki and Glasses to stand up against their challenges and become better heroes, he also advices King to train and become strong for real, latter than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles. 
 
As Fubuki notes, he ""attracts the strong"", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a linking to him, and some even looks on him as a model to follow. 
 
Abilities and Powers 
Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. Saitama's only power is that his body is far beyond human limits, allowing him to achieve astounding physical feats. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits - Saitama cannot fly or fire energy blasts - his superhuman abilities more than make up for the lack of variety in his powers. 
 
The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all. According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength. This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out. He apparently continued his training for another year and a half before beginning his hero career. Genos believes that Saitama himself doesn't actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him, while Dr. Genus believes that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed his limiter. It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than would normally be expected.

Genos dominates Saitama in a eating contest. 
 
Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested by Bang in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated by King in video games, mostly in one sided matches. Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest. 
 
Physical Abilities 
Punchingmachine 
Saitama's physical force 
 
Immeasurable Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, nonchalant punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). Saitama's punch is so powerful that many enemies simply explode when struck. He is also shown to be able to effortlessly destroy walls and buildings. An example of this casual, yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a city-sized meteor with a punch, lands safely, and just calmly decides to go home. Another instance is when Sonic tries to slice Saitama's head in half with a steel sword, and Saitama stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw. Also, in the intro, Saitama was seen jumping to and fro at high speeds in the vacuum of outer space with just sheer strength, despite the fact that one would require a solid object to move there at all. When launched from Earth to the moon by a strike from Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and immense tremors on the surface of the moon upon departure, as well as on Boros' ship upon landing. A ""normal"" punch from him is shown to be very fatal to someone as durable as Boros. A single ""serious"" punch from him is able to somehow counter Boros' destructive energy beam attack, and split the sky in half along the whole planet effortlessly, and even then, Boros, who was the fatally injured victim of the said move, said that Saitama had plenty of strength to spare and that he did not even try to give it his best shot. Saitama has shown to be able to control the strength of his attacks but still tends to go overboard, occasionally causing mass destruction in the aftermath. Saitama is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to.[32] 
 
Enhanced Leap: Saitama's inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights and distances at high speeds. This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the ceiling of a gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.[33] He was also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off from its roof.[34] His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth at a specified point, leaving a crater on the moon's surface in the process.[35] He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power. 
5466257-05-10 
The mountain is destroyed by the mere shockwaves from Saitama's punch. 
 
Shockwaves: As shown in his training with Genos, Saitama can control and direct his power in the form of an massive shockwaves that comes from his punches. He uses this to show Genos a bit of his true power, but stops it before actually punching Genos; instead, the attack goes to the mountain behind Genos, which ends up completely destroyed. 
Saitama dodge 
Saitama dodges Genos' attack 
 
Immeasurable Speed and Reflexes: Saitama was able to complete a 1500 meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[36] He has proven able to effortlessly keep up with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who is able to move at above hypersonic speeds.[37] Even Genos' computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[38] Saitama has also shown the ability to run down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[39] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace the likes of Flashy Flash, easily dodging his sword swings, and later dodging Awakened Garou's attacks with ease.[40] When kicked to the Moon by Boros' attack, Saitama returned to Earth in mere moments, which shows that Saitama can even travel at sub-relativistic speeds. Ironically, despite his incredible reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[41] 
 
Afterimages: Saitama is so fast that he leaves afterimages when moving at high speeds. He is agile enough to dodge Beast King's Lion Slash: Meteor Shower while moving in for the kill.[42] After assaulting Saitama with a flurry of punches in his practice fight, Genos realized that he was only fighting his afterimages.[43] It is shown that Saitama can control and decide the number of afterimages he leaves behind him. 
Immeasurable Dexterity: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without even flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when Saitama flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine and destroys it during the Hero Association exam.[44] He is also very proficient with the control and use of his superhuman abilities. 
Immeasurable Agility: Saitama has been shown to be perfect at dodging and able to perform highly acrobatic maneuvers. Saitama's reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.[45][46] Saitama is also able to perform parkour, which he can couple with fighting movements, as shown in his flashbacks. 
Immense Stamina: Saitama has never been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. Even when unleashing a punch more powerful than a planet-destroying attack, Saitama showed no signs of fatigue. The only time in which Saitama was shown to be panting and out of breath, he recovered just seconds later.

Saitama keeps up with Sonic's speed 
 
Immeasurable Senses: Saitama's senses are far beyond the human norm. He does possess impressively sharp hearing, being able to pick up on various chatter from bystanders a good distance away even while fighting monsters and the like.

Invulnerability: Saitama can withstand blows from extremely powerful beings such as Carnage Kabuto without taking a scratch or feeling any pain.[47] When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remains standing right next to him completely unharmed, unperturbed and very dirty (though his clothes were burnt).[48] He also survived being kicked to the moon by Boros in his fully powered state, and going from the Earth to the moon and back with little to no damage from leaving and entering the Earth's atmosphere (only his clothes were burnt). He even survived the harsh conditions of outer space unscathed during his brief time on the Moon.[49] 
 
Saitama also prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. It has been shown that, despite the dangers of holding one's breath in space, Saitama is able to do so with no negative effects on his body. However, it is worth noting that Saitama sees mosquitoes as a potential weakness, preferring to hide from the mosquito swarm heading his way rather than confront it, although he did not know that a monster was responsible for the swarm in the first place. 
 
Psychic Immunity: Fubuki noted that Saitama is immune to any psychic attacks and very resistant to others due to his astonishing willpower.

The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
Enhanced Lung Capacity: Although Saitama cannot breathe in space, he has considerable control over his breath. Even in outer space, Saitama manages to hold his breath effortlessly, and he even made a jump back to the Earth to the Moon in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation or symptoms. It also takes some time for Saitama to realize he is in a vacuum environment, although it seemed to have little to no effect on him.[50] 
 
6c44ee22b0faba1f-938x512 
Saitama holds his breath in the moon with no problem. 
 
Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama's body has been shown to survive the effects of a vacuum unscathed. Several factors like a lack of atmosphere are at play here, although Saitama has been unable to be affected by any of them. 
 
Temperature Immunity: Saitama is immune to all types of temperature-based attacks. In fact, he is immune to the effects of temperature in general. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to him unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes were destroyed).[51] Saitama was unharmed by the intense heat effects caused by atmospheric re-entry after being kicked to the moon by Boros. He has also been shown to be unaffected by Orochi's fire in his ultimate form, which has the ability to crumble or even destroy a city, if not multiple. Saitama was also able to withstand the cold attack of the Dragon-level monster Withered Sprout. 
 
Pain Suppression: Before gaining his overwhelming power, Saitama was still able to suppress pain.[52][53] 
 
Fighting Style 
Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Despite having no formal training, Saitama is a very proficient hand-to-hand combatant, thanks to so many fights with monsters and villains during his training, he's got a lot of fighting experience and developed a good deal of fighting skills. Due to his immeasurable power and boredom, he doesn't usually care about technique and makes use of flawed basic attacks, as Garou notes, most of his usual moves are wasted and lack finesse; however, once serious, Saitama becomes a very skilled and powerful fighter. Saitama mostly uses improvised fighting techniques to take down his enemies, his combat skills allowed him to defeat many criminals and monsters even before gaining his immeasurable power. His fighting styles are (unlike the likes of Garou, Bomb, Suiryu and Bang) quite simple, but solid and backed with his immeasurable power, extremely efficient, he can easily read, counter and strike moves and techniques from fighters with far more experience and training than him. He is also able to skillfully combine his superhuman abilities in order to overwhelm his opponents and even use the environment to his benefit. 
 
He also uses karate chops and grappling moves to takedown villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. 
 
Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed his first monster by deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general, whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes with a solution with one way or another and uses very unique moves that are helped by his immeasurable strength. Such instances are with Serious Headbutt and his Serious Table Flip. 
 
Extremely High Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since anytime he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. In the opening of the first season, he is seen striking multiple enemies at once and hitting all of them at the same time. He is also able to turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He had no trouble landing in the same spot on Boros' ship even though the latter's kick sent him to the moon, and the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving very little room for error. 
 
Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's extreme strength and speed. 
 
Normalpunch 
Consecutive Normal Punches 
 
Consecutive Normal Punches: (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsuu no Panchi) Saitama launches a volley of quick, single-handed punches from his right hand. These blows have been shown to be powerful enough to blow strong or large body types apart into pieces. Depending on the power of the attack, this technique can occur in an instant. 
Normal Punch: Saitama simply punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort in his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent of Saitama, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out. The shock wave from one of these punches was strong enough to tear apart one of the subterranean people (although this only happened in a dream of Saitama).

Serious Series (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama still attacks without putting in much effort. But Saitama's face looks more serious when he performs Serious Series attacks. 
 
SeriousPunch 
Serious Punch 
 
Serious Punch: (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri) Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros' Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.[54] The shockwave alone from the punch was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros then also declared that Saitama's fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[55] 
Serious Side Hops: (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi) Saitama hops from side-to-side rapidly. Doing so creates a multitude of afterimages in the form of a wall. He has been shown to be able to walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it was enough to easily rip through Sonic's Ten Shadows Burial. [56] 
Death Punch: Saitama throws a very fast and very powerful punch at his opponent, that is filled with the intention to kill. While performing the attack, for a moment, Saitama and his fist appears to have become gigantic, his aura becomes visible and Saitama's opponent is forced to experience impending death while watching the punch hurling towards them and being unable to do anything. The full extent of this punch has yet to be seen since Saitama has always stopped his attack before it could connect, but the shock wave caused by the punch was strong enough to blow a gigantic hole into several mountains and clouds.

Water Polo Carbonated Fist: A ""martial art"" utilized by Saitama during the 22nd Super Fight, in reality, is just Saitama avoiding to lose his wig, as he was pretending to be Charanko to participate in the tournament. It also contains a hip strike to counter an enemy's attack and send him flying with the power of his own attack being used against him (although in truth it was just meant to mimic Suiryu's tornado movements). 
 
Martial Arts: While Saitama is nowhere near as skilled as most martial artists, he seems to have some basic level of knowledge of some martial arts movements (a basic karate chop for example). In order to truly understand these fighting styles, he joined the 22nd Super Fight to witness other martial artists; after his fight with Suiryu, the latter asks him if he's truly understood the meaning behind martial arts, at which Saitama replies is about ""cool movements"". It is unclear if Saitama has gotten any skill in martial arts by this point, but he seems more interested in learning it. 
 
Miscellaneous Abilities 
Keen Perception: Saitama is amazingly good at reading people's fears and real motives with just a look, as well the reason they are how they are. He proves this many times reading people like Fubuki, Glasses, and Garou. Notably, he is the first to acknowledge the true thoughts and insecurities of the martial artist, as he realizes Garou doesn't really want to become a monster, but rather a hero. He also quickly finds about King's lie, but decides to keep the secret. However, he is usually good at this only when he is serious. 
 
Strong Teeth: In one of his and Sonic's fights, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the caped baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort. 
 
Intimidation: While he doesn't seem particularly scary, those who know about his abilities show fear of him. Saitama is able to emit a ""demonic aura"", which makes his foes tremble and become pressured, as Sonic and Genos were left amazed and terrified by his aura. Saitama is able to invoke fear on those he dislikes or bothers him by merely threatening them. 
 
Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[57] Through sheer willpower and effort, he removed his natural limiter.

          
 
       Helpful Quick, easy to read reviews from an anime fan that hates anime. 
 
Story - It isn't very in-depth, but that isn't the point of this anime. Everything about the story is one big anime trope. It just constantly makes fun of stuff you see in typical Shounen action anime. The overall point is that the hero can kill anyone with a single hit and it makes him depressed because life is boring. He joins a professional league of superheroes in hopes of going up in the ranks to make life more interesting. Imagine if the Justice League or The Avengers had thousands of members who got paychecks like any regular worker. 
 
Art - Looks great, especially during fight scenes. Regularly gets that hand-drawn scratchy look when things are moving really fast. Did I mention the action scenes look amazing? Very flashy, very fast, very over-the-top. 
 
Sound - Sounds like an anime. Amazing atmosphere for what's happening. 
 
Character - I really like all the characters. The ones that are obvious jokes do a great job at being funny. The ones that are supposed to be cool are cool as shit. 
 
Enjoyment - For me, I was laughing a lot during regular scenes, and excited during fight scenes, even though I knew what was going to happen. Anime NEVER makes me laugh. Anime creators are idiots when it comes to comedy. One Punch Man is genuinely funny to me. 
 
Overall - It's awesome. Watch it, yo.

","I deeply regret that I paused watching this series for some time and ended up re-watching from the beginning. It kinda ruins the fun IMO. If only I weren't that picky in the past while trying to watch an anime without romance tag...   
 
Story; 
 
A pair of NEETs with some serious mental performance was brought by ""god"" from another world just for the sake of watching them owning every game/challenges. From there, they challenged or were challenged by some opponents with variety of games with some serious bet and met a certain character which leads them to more high risk games involving country stuffs. 
 
Its pretty cool though since they show you the game rules, its loopholes and how they managed to overcome it and every time they explained how those pair of NEETs won, it gives you like a feeling of 'wow, these two are f*ckin' genius' and surely it made me wanting to watch more. Kinda addicted. 
 
The story progresses pretty well, it shows those NEETs owning every single crazy challenges until to the level of ""ruling the country"" thingy. Some dirty jokes and fanservice to be expected with an ecchi tag, I don't think there any serious romance but only some little bits of incest lovey-dovey stuff. It doesn't overdone it or ruin the show IMO. 
 
As a dumbass dude, sometimes I just can't understand the game rules or how it works, but for some reason every time they win, It'll just give me a feeling of satisfaction LOL. But don't worry, you'll at least get a rough idea after all while they're playing throughout the game. 
 
Art: 
 
I don't know if this is only me or the anime itself, but it has this overbright effect and personally I kinda disliked it. I watched the HD version of it on my laptop and I can't imagine watching it in lower resolutions. IDK man, probably my laptop screen is crap cause when I watch it on my mobile phone (it has an IPS display) it was way better. 
 
Anyways, it looks colorful, character designs are okay combined with all of the background scenery stuffs. 
 
Sound: 
 
Those reverb kicks effects really gave the game scene show a lot more punch LOL. OP was okay, I liked the ED a lot more personally. I don't find anything wrong with the character voices so far...  
 
Character: 
 
I think these pair of NEETs are way OP. Well I don't really like when the main character is losing so... 
 
But yeah, those two were OP like, its really amazing how they could predict every single outcome and solutions to it and their explanation goes like  'we knew this and that so we did that and this which ends up you reacting to this and you lost, I won'. 
 
As the story goes by, you'll be introduced to some powerful opponents too. The way it presents its opponents are pretty interesting. It shows that those opponents are quite skilled and will left you thinking, 'can those pair of NEETs really win???!!! I NEED TO KNOW!!!'. It isn't just some character where you know he's a bad guy after noticing some of his appearance or attitude. I really liked that presentation style.  
 
Enjoyment: 
 
A 2014 anime. Wow. Really glad that I was finally able to finish this. Loved this series a lot. It managed to keep my ass on the seat and watch every episode till the end and still wanting to continue for more. Looking foward to watch its next sequel! 
 
Overall: 
 
This is a good series. Although I personally disliked the overbright effect, it didn't stop me from dropping this series. Just be sure watch on a proper screen!  
 
What to expect from this anime 
- Bits of fanservice, dirty jokes (not much, tolerable) 
- Pretty good comedy scenes after an intense battle moments  
- OP main characters. No worries till the ending! 
- The way its opponent losing isn't that really depressing (Its a game world, have fun!)

A mediocre isekai anime where the opponents use besides magic, their minds and try to challenge the world itself where they are summoned to.  
 
Well, I'm not really impressed about this anime. I thought it would have something peculiar about it. But somehow is an anime that can be watched. 
 
Art is a little bother. Mediocre and even sub-par. They tried to use colors to give the vibe of a virtual reality or something like that. I found it pretty distasteful.  
 
Sound was good.  Not something really interesting. But it had synth. Synth gives it a 10. That and Unexpected fanservice.  That is what fanservice should be about. You'll know what I mean if you are a fan of Ace Attourney. 
 
Plot device like is similar to Death Note. So if you are a fan of Death Note I guess you should watch this.

          
 
       Helpful Never have I watched such an underwhelming show. No Game No Life was an overly hyped and poorly written show. I don't understand why this show even has an 8.36 rating, it's god awful and people don't even see it for themselves. 
 
---Story--- (3/10) 
The anime hardly has munch of a story to it, although it is a rather unique story. It started out with potential but as the episodes progressed it got worse and completely wasted its potential. The story didn't seem to go anywhere or it was all over the place which made the show somewhat hard to follow as to what was going on. The episodes we also seemingly stretched out to where Sora and Shiro playing one game that lasted about 2 whole episodes and the game didn't even make sense in the end which was frustrating! (Those that have watched the anime probably know exactly what game I'm referring to in particular). Also a lot of the anime seemed is purely for fan service (this is probably the main reason that this anime has such a high rating), which keeps the story from properly progressing. 
 
---Art--- (9/10) 
The art is rather lovely with it's bright, various colors which adds depth to the scenery but sometimes the art is overdone and puts a bit of strain on the eye but otherwise it's great. 
 
---Sound--- (3/10) 
The openings and ending songs of No Game No Life is really good but other than that there isn't much else to say due to their not really being a lot of music paying during the anime itself; therefore, giving a pretty low score. It could have had music during some of the games. 
 
---Characters--- (2/10) 
The characters in No Game No Life are very underdeveloped and have no depth to them and are used mostly for fan sevice. Stephanie doesn't even really serve a purpose within the anime despite her being a main character she is there just to be made fun of by everyone calling her a moron and she is basically used for fan service and nothing more. Jibril is, like Stephanie, a remotely useless character that is also yet again used mostly for fan service and is also underdeveloped character. Shiro is somewhat more developed but still doesn't show any significant character change which is a HUGE part of character development but she was, like almost all of the female characters, was used for fan service and remind you she is only 11! Shiro also seems to have a disturbing and perverse relationship with her brother, Sora. Zell had yet again a somewhat useless role, although she did serve a bigger role and more character development than Stephanie and Jibril, but she did serve the role of competing against Sora and Shiro in one of the games. She did have her thoughts and feelings expressed which was an improvement from Stephanie and Jibril. Sora on the other hand had a bit more character development than all of the characters and is an at least decent character. 
 
---Enjoyment--- (5/10) 
Despite the problems with the anime the show was somewhat enjoyable. The show was somewhat entertaining and funny which was a somewhat redeeming quality. However, it did no fully compensate for the problems within the anime. Due to the fact that the episodes seemed long, stretched out, and sometimes pointless along with it being hard to follow at times as to what was going on, I wasn't able to properly enjoy this anime to its full extent. 
 
---Overall Score--- (4.4/10) 
This show was rather disappointing and quite appalling as to how flawed it was. There seems to be more fan service than actual story which is saddening to say the least, along with underdeveloped and pointless characters. This anime was a waste of time to watch and one I wouldn't recommend to watch. I hope this helps other people see for themselves how bad this anime actually is and that this gets rated lower.

","Story: Throughout the anime there isn’t really much of a story since it's mostly different events happening in each episode. But there are some episodes that are 2-3 episodes of story. Those stories I find are really important to future character development. 
 
Art: As expected of an anime that was made in the early 2000s, the art design was so so. All the characters no matter how old they were or whether they were male or female, they all had large eyes. You really can’t blame the animators because of the lack of technology at the time. Otherwise the art design is that at the point where you can’t stand it. 
 
Sound: The music that is played matched perfectly with each scene. Since Gakuen Alice is pretty much a slice of life, it’s best to play music that isn’t dramatic but at the same time not something that is depressing. The OSTs were just right. The OP is very catchy and with practice you can sing along. The ED is perfect for the the episodes where you can’t stop laughing. It helps you return back to a calm state. 
 
Character: What I like about the characters is that each VA(voice actor/actress) was able to bring out each personality of their character. Like Romi Park who plays Hyuuga Natsume. Natsume is a cold type of person. Romi Park was the perfect person to bring out that cold side of him. It’s very easy to see the very different personalities of all the characters that you meet. 
 
Enjoyment: No matter how many times I rewatch episode 10 I can’t stop laughing. In almost every episode, there is a funny moment that will make you keeping laughing for years to come. The comedy that is involved makes Gakuen Alice fun to watch. Great for the family to watch together. 
 
Overall, Gakuen Alice is a perfect anime for those days where you feel sad. The comedy that it shows you is great to cheer up you and others. This is really an anime that everyone should watch at least once in their lives.

          
 
       Helpful I remember being 11 and being madly in love with Gakuen Alice. Recently reminiscing about that love I decided to re-watch the series.  
 
Oh how the love is lost. Don't get me wrong, it was a charming series. But art is a huge factor  
for me when I watch anime, and GA's art was a big disappointment. It all looked so... lazily done.  
The ending wasn't very enjoyable either. The journey there wasn't too bad of a ride though. 
 
This is definitely one of those cases where, in my opinion, the manga is a lot better than the 
anime. 
A lot.

Abandoned by his parents after accumulating a debt of over one hundred fifty million yen, he is sold off to the yakuza, initiating his swift getaway from a future he does not want. On that fateful night, he runs into Nagi Sanzenin, a young girl whom he decides to try and kidnap to pay for his family's massive debt. 
 
Unfortunately, due to his kind-hearted nature and a string of misunderstandings, Nagi believes Hayate to be confessing his love to her. After saving her from real kidnappers, Hayate is hired as Nagi's personal butler, upon which she is revealed to be a member of one of the wealthiest families in Japan. 
 
Highly skilled but cursed with the world's worst luck, Hayate gets straight to work serving his employer all the while trying to deal with the many misfortunes that befall him. From taking care of a mansion to fending off dangerous foes, and even unintentionally wooing the hearts of the women around him, Hayate is in over his head in the butler comedy  Hayate no Gotoku! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","Hayate Ayasaki is an unlucky 16-year-old boy who has worked since childhood to make ends meet due to his parents' irresponsible behavior. On Christmas Eve, he finds out his parents have run away from home while shouldering him with a massive ¥156,804,000 debt. The Yakuza (from whom the money was borrowed in the first place) plan to settle the debt by selling his organs and various other illegal means such as selling him away as a slave. While running away from the debt collectors, Hayate meets Nagi Sanzenin, a 13-year-old girl and the sole heir of the wealthy Sanzenin estate, and her maid Maria. At first, Hayate plans to kidnap Nagi and acquire a ransom of over ¥150 million but due to a misunderstanding, Nagi thinks Hayate is confessing his love to her. After he rescues Nagi from actual kidnappers, she hires Hayate as her new butler.
Aside from performing his ordinary duties as a butler, Hayate must fight to protect Nagi from harm, a difficult task since her life is always in danger because she is the target of individuals who covet her family's fortune, and sometimes must deal with her extravagant requests, oblivious to Nagi's true feelings for him. Later in the story, Hayate must juggle the feelings of several other girls, Ayumu Nishizawa, his former classmate; and Hinagiku Katsura, the student council president of Hakuō Academy. Hayate had a romantic relationship with a childhood friend, Athena Tennousu, who is chairwoman of the board of Hakuō Academy.
Due to the events of Golden Week, involving Hayate and Athena, Nagi ends up forfeiting her inheritance. With the last of her savings, Nagi and Maria move with Hayate to an old apartment building called ""Violet Mansion"" owned by her late mother Yukariko, and rents its extra rooms for income: having Chiharu Harukaze, the secretary of Hakuō Academy; Hinagiku, Ayumu, Athena (in child-form), Kayura Tsurugino, an ""elite otaku""; and Ruka Suirenji, a pop idol who also develops feelings for Hayate, as its tenants.
After a series of adventures with the tenants, Nagi manages to reclaim her fortune. On an excursion in America, Hayate finally pays off his massive debt, but decides to keep working as Nagi's butler, especially when the battle for the Sanzenin inheritance intensifies. Athena eventually regains full strength and Maria resigns as Nagi's maid. On Christmas Eve, the ""misunderstanding"" of Hayate and Nagi's relationship is exposed, creating a rift that leads to the final battle. Hayate rescues Nagi from the godly Royal Garden, but she decides to relinquish her status as an heir and concedes the rights to her cousin Hisui Hatsushiba, before firing Hayate to set him free. Two years later, a self-sufficient Nagi reunites with Hayate in the place they met for the first time, where he tells her that despite not being her butler anymore, he still wants to be with her, and that there is ""something he needs to tell her"", before locking hands and walking together under the starry night sky.
","Here is an anime that's not like many others. Hayate the Combat Butler is a colaberation of all kinds of Anime thrown into one, in order to make fun of it of course. What I mean is that Hayate is one of those Animes that make fun of Anime in general. I first herd of this series when it came out as a manga and so I got the manga and read a few books. Now even more intrigued, I began my search of the animated version. To my surprise there it was and began to watch it with my good friend from campus, Edge. Both of us fell in love with the series and it's comedic view on Anime. 
 
Like I mentioned before, Hayate is a comedy anime, so it doesn't have a strong storyline. But what it's missing in story line makes up with many vibrant characters. Each character has their own interesting persona which gives a feel and equal balance between characters. It is obvious to say that the little storyline is really nothing to complain about. Another interesting thing to point out is how they transition many aspects of the Manga into the Anime. Though the Anime doesn't follow along the original chapters of the Manga, the characters still have the same aspects and don't astray from their original concept.  
 
The comedy in this Anime is truely halarious, but not many will understand it if they haven't seen many mainstream Animes like; Dragon Ball Z, Mobile Suit Gundam, Saint Seiya and the Knights of the Zodiac, etc.. This Anime heavily uses other anime quotes, actions, and scences as references. They also use alot of Japanese television cullture in this as well. References to famous idols, Soap Opera, and other TV shows. Most of the anime's they bleep out during discusions are purposely done because of how it was like in the Manga. Originally the manga would bleep out certain words so they wouldn't get sued by other companies by using certain names, example; Gundam would be changed to Gu--am or ---dam on the TV show or Manga. But that in itself is halarious. 
 
The art in the anime is pretty good. Though the characters are all flashy with serveral Neon color overtones, they don't look all too bad. There is no serious fan service in this anime so if you are looking for enourmous Boobs, you won't find any here. Many other characters are of proper proportions and aren't really saturated. Though in certain scenes they make tease pictures of certain characters in the end of the episodes for Fan Service, which are really more funny then sexy. Also they have certain episodes where they change the animation stylings as well. In one episode they hire the designers of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to do the episode.  
 
In the end I wrote nothing but good about this anime, that's because I favor humor against many popular animes. Indeed not many of you will enjoy this Anime, it's all about preferences and interests. I, however, will encourage you to watch a few episodes and see what I mean. This Anime is one for my record books. I've got my laughs and can't wait till the next season comes out, oh wait...kinda spoiled it for you guys, lol.

          
 
       Helpful Having recently gone from having an interest in animes to an obsession , I can safely say that this is the funniest product to ever come out of Japan. Hayate the Combat Butler, is the story of unlucky teenager Hayate Ayasaki,who after being sold to the Yakuza(Mafia) and inheriting a debt of 156,804,000 Yen, decides to kidnap a girl named Nagi Sanzenin. Unfortunately, the idiot(Hayate), botches up the plan, and due to poor empathy, makes Nagi believe that Hayate is in love with her. After saving her from another kidnapping plot, Hayate then becomes Nagi’s butler, where he must use all means necessary to protect her, completely unaware that Nagi is in love with him. 
 
It was in 2004 that Kenjiro Hata released this hilarious manga (which eventually turned into an anime) which featured funny characters, outrageous humor, many references to popular culture, parodies of pop-culture, and the craziest situations created. Whether it be walking to the grocery store only to end up getting attacked by thousands of bodyguards with swords, to attempting to sneak into a school, only to be met by a crazy alcoholic history teacher that really wants to kill someone, the situations simply from crazy to ludicrously demented. The reason for most of these “incidents”(If you can call them that.) is due to the fact that Hayate is the unluckiest 16 year old I have ever seen in my life. While he is skilled in combat, martial arts, stealth, weapon use, painting forging, assassinations, cleaning, door to door salesmanship, etc….(How he learns all these skills are beyond me), he just seems to always be at the wrong place at the wrong time. One other factor could also be that his weakness, girls added to what seems to be the poorest empathy I’ve seen from 16 year old, simply makes Hayate’s life a living nightmare. Whether it be that every single girl in Tokyo is insane, or the fact Hayate still hasn’t figured out (After two season and 20 volumes), that most of the girl’s that he meet are in love him, usually results in Hayate being in a lot of mental and physical pain. 
 
The format of the show is basically scenario after scenario, a basic format that really doesn’t distinguish it from other animes/mangas. However, it is not format but the scenarios that it get right, for every scenario usually involves a lot of parodies, breaking of the wall, truly insane action, and lots of freaking misunderstandings. Whether it be misuse of the word “play”, or accidently killing off a character for really no reason what-so-ever, the series revolves around the idea of world where everybody takes everything too seriously, resulting many casualties caused by a war that ends many innocent lives. (Moment of Silence Please) However, all of these scenarios are hilarious, as for they rely on outrageous humor, a ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo, and amusing character abuse scenes. Even the normal scenarios are hilarious, for they range from attempting to get into one of the greatest school in Japan (An obvious parody to Love Hina), to trying to escape a gay person who loves Hayate, instantly turns into a fight to the death situation. 
 
If their one flaw with this series (I don’t find it a flaw, but many people do), it’s the fact it leans VERY closely to Harem. For those of you who don’t know, Harem is usually an anime with the situation in that one guy is involved with two or more girls. This isn’t bad, in my opinion, but it usually leads to girls being made into sex symbols. (Still have no problem with that) Meaning if you are a woman, you may be turned off by this series. however, if you are willingly to overlook this and just laugh at what you on screen, then you will really enjoy this show. 
 
If what I said make’s Hayate the Combat Butler a mindless comedy, then you are wrong, This series can be very touching at times, as for before Hayate became a butler, he was dirt poor kid that had to support two lazy parents that sold him to the mafia, even going to the extent of giving him the . After seeing the first episode, you really feel the problem that Hayate is going through, as for everyone has abandoned him. Heck I’m not afraid to say that I even shed a tear. Hayate the Combat Butler is the story of survival. Hayate, being a butler, has to constantly serve the most spoiled child I have ever seen (Nagi) and no matter how angry she gets at Hayate, Hayate always seems to do everything willingly, even feeling guilty when he isn’t working or taking a day off. Basically it’s the story of Hayate wanting to be accepted, but due to bad luck, has a very hard time doing it. Since the series is still running, I can’t come to any conclusions if Hayate is going to actually end up being happy, so I am hoping that the conclusion is really well done, as for death shall come to Kotoko if they do release a crappy final episode. 
 
Hayate the Combat Butler is simply hilarious and touching. While the slight harem feel may stop girls from reading/watching this, most of the population will simply enjoy this great manga/anime series.

          
 
       Helpful i really like this type of anime where not only the characters themselves aware that they are in an anime but they can sometimes mercilessly break the fourth wall while making references to other anime like conan, gundam ,... and the jokes do fit quite well into the setting of this anime though some jokes can be seem to be a bit forced in but that ain't much of a problem 'cus they don't take away the enjoyment. 
 
 (warning may contain spoilers) 
 
 Now the real reason i can only give this a 7 and not higher is the way they add himegami into the story line, i mean i know the anime timeline and the manga timeline are different but i just can't overlook the fact that in the manga he appears to be somewhat a mysterious person with a dark past involving with the Sanzenin but in the anime he's a wanna-be mysterious monkey like really he likes to eat banana in high places with the occasion of wearing a mask and the reason he isn't nagi's butler here is something that can outrank all of hayate's terrible puns. Another down point for the anime is the whole miss principal arc, this lady is so shallow and boring that i doubt even sakuya can crack a joke everytime meeting her, it's like ""okay we have some main heroes so now let's create a villain and make them fight"" and with that turns the entire finale into a mediocre shinnanigan.

Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate. 
 
Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name,  Haikyuu!!  is an exhilarating and emotional sports comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.

Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's volleyball club – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help him practice.
In the third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored to win the tournament – that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his brutal play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.
Hinata studies and is accepted to Karasuno, the same high school the ""Little Giant"" played for, but is shocked to discover that Kageyama has also chosen to attend Karasuno. Karasuno is revealed to have lost its reputation as a powerhouse school following the era of the Little Giant, often being referred to as 'The Wingless Crows' by other local teams. However, by combining Kageyama's genius setting skills with Hinata's remarkable athleticism, the duo create an explosive new volleyball tactic and develop an unexpected but powerful setter-spiker partnership.
Along the way, Hinata and Kageyama push each other into reaching their full potential, and Hinata develops relationships with his first real team, thus beginning Karasuno's journey of redemption to restore their reputation and make it to the Nationals.
Both Hinata and Kageyama aspire to be professional volleyball players, and make a promise to one another after they graduate from high school that no matter what, they will both play on the same court again. They have a remarkable bond and devote their lives to each other and the sport of volleyball.
","This anime hits the top spot. Not only in sports anime, but in all anime. Overall, it is an immensely enjoyable anime with characters that you can't get enough of, action that drives you to the next episode, and music that fits the bill. 
The story as a whole is well orchestrated, by the second to last episode I was almost in tears and before that I was cheering as though I was in the stands. This story makes you feel for the characters. Gives you an in depth view into even minor characters making you appreciate each character even more. You get a callous and straight forward Kageyama and pair him up with the bubbly, never-give-up Hinata and you get something stinking amazing. I felt pride for Hinata as he soared in the air...pretty high for a shrimp. The other characters are equally amazing in their own respects; hilarious, kind, wise, and about every other good descriptive word under the sun. They are all so driven for their goals that it's hard not to cheer when they succeed and feel for them when they don't. 
The intro and ending songs all fit the story perfectly. Just listen and you'll find yourself listening the whole way through instead of skipping to the beginning of the story or going to the next episode. The music within describes the mood of the story and blends so well that you barely notice it at times. That is a sign of well chosen music that it can become one with the story and make it more supurb.  
Needless to say, I enjoyed every second of the anime (even the little breaks with them hitting the ball). I waited for weeks to pass before starting watching again just so I could watch episode after episode. I can't wait for the second season (there better be one) and can't wait to sit back and enjoy the fun that Haikyuu! brings.  
See you at the Spring Tournament. 

          
 
       Helpful You need to watch this anime, it’s amazing. (I’ll try to make this review as short and straight to the point as possible!) 
 
STORY: 8 
It follows a pretty basic plot, but long story short: his rival, Kageyama, becomes his teammate. It’ll expand from that Hinata and Kageyama to learning about the rest of the team as well, watching them compete in matches against other schools, etc. and it’ll keep you always wanting more.  
 
CHARACTER: 10 
The development of Hinata and Kageyama’s relationship is amazing, I loved every second of it. I loved Hinata’s determinations, Kageyama learning to work with his team, Asahi overcoming his fear of letting his team down, etc. I adored every single member of the team, each of them had their own personality and quirks, and the way they interact with each other feels very real and you’re constantly rooting for them as they work together.  
 
SOUND: 9 
Both openings are super catchy, I found myself humming it even when I was just doing schoolwork haha. The voice actors fit perfectly to the characters they were portraying! I didn’t really notice many problems with the sound, but I’m no expert in this criteria.  
 
ART: 8 
Some people hate the way characters are drawn, but I actually loved the way characters were drawn! But even if you hate it at first, it’ll probably grow on you so it’s not too big of a concern. Each of the characters have an almost more realistic look to them. The animation during games/matches are great. Solid animations!  
 
ENJOYMENT: 10 
I loved every second of this anime, and when i wasn’t watching it, it was all that was on my mind!  
 
Conclusion:  
If you are still hesitant on this anime… don’t be. Go watch it right now, and have a blast. I’m begging you, please give this anime a chance, you won’t regret it!

This series really has the great stories,amazing caracthers. thanks furudate. he has made so real the story,the suffering,the desire to fight, to be the best. we love so much the Aoba Johsai Team. Oikawa looks  a great captain, Iwaizumi a wonderful ace and vice captain. they are the pillars for their team. We are so proud that furudate has created this masterpiece. In generally this is a great anime. All characther are ewesome. everyone struggles to achieve their goal and this is very amazing. This story is so good and looks a perfect representations of volleyball in the real life. there're scene so real and  that is really happened in the world of sport and volleyball. The animation has an high quality, the sounds are absolutely amazing. Even the openings and the edings are great. Only a words for to describe this anime; Absolutely Perfect. Only a thing is very negative in all this. The fandom is very suck. Some of the people in the fandom bothered so much the other fans. Like, ""Oh your ship sucks!"" ""My ship is more canon than yours!""etc..  they don't love the real official series but only fant art or dounjinshi. we don't tell them of don't loving the fan art or doujinshi 'cause we love it too, but they should appreciate more the official stuff or/and don't bother other fans with hatred and resentment. 
Haikyuu!! really feels different for us that we don't even care of that kind of fandom anymore. we wanna really do watch the sport anime for the story and characters development and 'cause we love so much this sport.

The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as ""Cowboys."" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals. 
  
Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. 
 
Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy,  Cowboy Bebop  is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","In 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway which made Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty-hunters (also referred to as ""Cowboys"") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The series' protagonists are bounty-hunters working from the spaceship Bebop. The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward, an eccentric child skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically-engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence. Over the course of the series, the team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting faces and events from their past: these include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP, and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.
While much of the show is episodic in nature, the main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious, an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon Syndicate. Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, but when Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend Julia and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her, Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia goes into hiding to protect herself and Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to complete their plan. Vicious, having staged a coup d'état and taken over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. Spike leaves the Bebop after saying a final goodbye to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to be seriously wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation. The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun before eventually falling to the ground, dead.
","Well first of all the most memorable thing about 'cowboy bebop' was the opening song witch was just epic. Considering that it was released in 1998 it is a really great anime. Interesting characters with various ideas and past. It didn't take too long to watch since the plot is interesting yet simple. Also why it was interesting to watch is because the main characters weren't over power considering other side characters and everything didn't just go their way. It was funny serious and had action and when everything combines it is just a great creation. The music selected for different scenes were selected perfectly in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful Well, yeah, Cowboy Bepop is kind of OK anime, its not like those anime where  you spend a lot of time, 
 
I mean you can watch better Anime then this, Yu Yu Hakusho, Inuyasha are better then Cowboy Bepop, 
 
Well that's what i felt when watching Cowboy Bepop, 
 
Its nothing legendary or anything, i think people like it because it resembles more of the Star Wars/ American thing, 
 
The Characters are kind of Ok, 
 
Presentation was mediocre at best, its not as epic as other Anime like Yu Yu Hakusho, DragonballZ, Inuyasha, Mobile Suit Gundam and many other old anime have, 
 
It was nothing spectacular, it was Ok, that's it 
 
Even Naruto is better then Cowboy Bepop 
 
 just wanted to let the people know why to stay away from Cowboy Bepop 

          
 
       Helpful Going into this series, I was expecting a lot. I was consistently hearing that this was one of the all time greatest animes. I also kept hearing how great its English Dub is, so of course I watched it dubbed. It 's also the first series I've watched to follow a episodic narrative design, where each episode was treated like a miniature movie. This anime was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe who would also later direct other highly praised shows such as Samurai Champloo and Space Dandy. So after finally getting to watch this legendary series here's what I thought of it. 
 
 
Story:9/10 
Brilliantly written and very sophisticated. The series mainly revolves around the main characters' past and it explores that in such a beautiful way. Due to it's narrative design we are given so many memorable episodes with my personal fav being episode 20, ""Pierrot Le Fou,' Each episode contains a different story approach and it gives us different genres. For example there are episodes where we would get 80's action, detective drama, sci fi horror, psychological thrillers, and Chinese martial arts. This gives the series a wide range of variety and mixed tones that helps satisfy many viewers with their own unique tastes and preferences. It's necessary to keep in mind that Watanabe was heavily influenced by American cinema as this has been stated by many of his interviews. And although it doesn't have a strong reliance on action, this series had great and memorable action in particular the shootout scenes. This series also had one of the best conclusions ever, it ended in a bang. As for flaws it's not really a story driven series so there isn't much plot progression. For example the main plot between Spike and the main antagonist are only focused on for a handful of episodes. It also suffered a lil bit from exposition as there were a few things that weren't fully explained. 
 
Art:10/10 
This was the one area that impressed me the most. This series came out in the 1990s yet it looks better than most animes I've watched in the 2000s. The animation never lost consistency and it was fluid as water. The movie quality was great as like I said, each episode felt like a short movie. Visuals were great and very detailed and none of the character designs felt out of place. Every character here was drawn in a very realistic way. What's strange about the show is that at first glance it may seem rather bland or limited since it's not heavily action packed. However what the series excels in is not how much movement is going on but how high the quality of each scene has. For example a lot of characters are given specific gestures and postures that helps explain their feelings or personalities; whether it's Spike walking around with a relaxed slouch to potray his chill personality, Jet's more tense upright posture that shows off his maturity, Faye's curvy posing that supports her sexiness, and Ed's constant quirky movements that matches her eccentric character. The distinct body language was a way to help establish its characters and it did it in such an excellent and realistic way. 
 
Sound:10/10 
This is where Cowboy Bebop stands out from most animes. For one it has SUPERB voice acting. It wasn't over the top at all and everyone's voice fit and Spike sounded so cool. The dub is so great that I honestly believe it to be superior to the Japanese version. And of course the soundtrack, one of the best any person can hear in ANYTHING. The opening song, ending song, to its beautiful jazz flowing in the background, the music perfectly matched the show's atmosphere. If I was blind and had only my ears, this anime will still heavily satisfy me. 
 
Character:9/10 
The development here is incredible but what really stands out is that we really connect wit these characters like their actual people. And really love the relationships between the main characters cuz although they don't always get along their all they have and it leads to some emotional moments. The main antagonist here is great cuz although not overly powerful, the character plays a huge impact on the main character. Whenever these two were together you'll almost cry inside cuz their past is so deep. 
 
 
Final Verdict 
 
 
One word, masterpiece. Simply one of the greatest animated works you can ever find. Cowboy Bebop is just too important to the anime world and its one series that all of us needs to see. This series is all about style, and when it comes to style there's no better anime out there than this. With its beautiful animation, great music, and endearing characters, there's no doubt why Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the landmark title in Anime. 
 
 
Sub or Dub Recommendation: Dub

","Until now, there were 5 romcom anime that i have seen with the words of ""ore"" 
Oreimo 
Oreshura 
Oregairu 
Ore Monogatari 
Ore no nounai blabla (Noucome) 
 
Those five are worth to watching. I don't have any particular problem with those. Then, now i watching this too, Oresuki. Is Oresuki worth to watch? Lets read my review. 
 
Story: 3/10 
What the fuck is going on?! (turn on some sfx meme) 
 
The author seems to mixing this show with drama and comedy but fail to mix that. 
How can those drama easily resolved with only a single minutes? MC lucky? 
How can such a bastard character who against the MC suddenly came to friendly with MC without any awkward feeling? Even the MC falling in love with his enemy so he is turned into gay dude. 
How can this school have a tradition that a guy dancing with 3 girls? any acceptable reason for this? 
And also why all female cast easily falling in love with MC without any some sweet flashback story? 
 
Art: 9/10 
Looks decent for me, just expected for Connect. I always love their pretty art. 
 
Sound: 5/10 
Those sfx doesn't really suit. It's too overly dramatic to me. Also, why the hell Joro's Mother sounded like loli instead her face kinda like your 40's age mother.  But, still i love Tomatsu Haruka doing her role as Sanshokuin Sumireko (Pansy). I love her sadistic sound, very suit to her as Pansy. 
 
Character:1/10 
Pathetic! and bit confusing. 
How can the MC curse his childhood friend as bitch but in a single minutes they wants to befriend again without any awkward moment later? 
How can such a bastard character then suddenly have a good term with MC without any acceptable reason? 
Am I the only one who confuse here? please click ""I found this review helpful"" button if you agree with me. 
 
Enjoyment: (5/10) 
For its 3 first episode i found this really amusing for me. But later, i didn't get any idea how to react this show. Will i laugh? Will i cry? Will i angry? 
FYI, I write this review while doing facepalm. So, am i really enjoy watching this show? 
 
Overall: 4/10 
Hate that score. (7.85 at 2019/11/9) Even this show can't beat those previous ""ore"". Better watching those previous ""ore"" than this one. 


          
 
       Helpful Now, this was a really interesting anime, to say the least. 
 
Oresuki basically takes all the tropes of a rom-com harem anime and mocks them to great success. I love how self-aware this anime is when it's making fun of typical harem tropes and how Joro is constantly addressing the audience with his internal monologues. This series definitely has a unique way of showing comedy and its great because of it. Honestly this is the third review Ive done this season with anime that are super unique, its great. 
 
Speaking of comedy, it's great. Honestly, some of the best I've seen. It plays on the tropes of typical anime so well and since we've all grown accustomed to the normal stuff when Oresuki's first episode starts you're immediately thrown out of the loop and immediately intrigued and engaged. I love the idea of Joro trying to be this typical main harem protagonist only for him to actually be an absolutely scummy guy that the series somehow makes us love just like Konosuba did with Kazuma.  
 
This series has a unique way of doing things when it comes to characters. Basically, DONT TRUST ANYONE!! Anyone and everyone is lying to you every second. By the time I was 3/4s through this series, I became one of the most pessimistic people on earth lol. I doubted every new character and immediately started thinking ""So what scheme have you got for us this time?"". Himawari is probably my favourite female character with Pansy coming in second. I didn't like Pansy at first because of the way she was portrayed but as this series is built on schemes when the conflict is over and everything gets revealed you end up liking the characters by the end of them despite what they've said and done. You'll definitely not find a cast like Oresuki's anywhere else. 
 
Now the music is beautiful. Both the ED and OP and catchy as all hell and I never skipped them once. Both of them are strong contenders for the best of the season with the ED practically winning it immediately. I absolutely love the voice of the main singer in the OP with her unique voice which is different from normal ones. It's hard to describe but she has a certain accent or way of singing that is appealing as hell. 
 
The art style is equally as good with all its bright colours to bring out the best in the girls. I like how it plays with the colour scheme with certain characters to add to their facade and make them seem nice and innocent. The eyes, especially in this series, are really nice and shiny which helps with reactions. It good contrast the main character, Joro, is full of dark colours and wears a normal black uniform to show his side character status which the series promotes really well.  
 
Now one complaint I do have about Oresuki which is that it sadly towards the second half of the series ditches its original concept of ""Are you the only one who loves me?"" which is the reason I got interested in this series in the first place and leans more towards normal harem territory. However it still manages to keep its quality comedy going for a bit longer before it gets to the ""end of slice of life anime serious episodes"" so it wasn't experience ruining. I still loved this anime until the end. 
 
Its a shame it ended on a cliffhanger for it to be settled in an OVA but they executed it well enough that I'm looking forward to seeing what happens. Speaking of that the last episode luckily rekindled the original appeal of the series so in my opinion it overall ended up being a great experience. 
 
9/10 Had some of the best comedy I've seen. I would definitely recommend to those who are sick of harem anime like I am. (It's still a harem anime though just not a typical one.)

even though it was only episode 4 I was very entertained by the romcom story of the two friends of Jorou to win Sun Chan's heart

That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son. 
 
For their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other. 
 
Set in an alternate Edo Period of Japan,  Samurai Champloo  follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.

The outlaw Mugen arrives in town, and Fuu begs him for protection, which he gives in exchange for food.

The two's fight ends up destroying the teahouse. The pair are captured and sentenced to death, but Fuu saves them. The pair attempt to restart their battle, but Fuu tosses a coin, saying if it lands on heads then the pair can continue their battle, but if it lands on tails they postpone their battle to help her find a samurai who smells of sunflowers, whom she has sought for years. She wins the toss, and they embark on a series of adventures alongside Fuu's quest.
During the closing stories, the three finally arrive at the town of Ikitsuki, with each ending up in conflict with a group of assassins sent by the government to kill the ""sunflower samurai"", Fuu's father Seizo Kasumi. Fuu finds Kasumi, having wanted revenge for him abandoning her and her mother, but she relents as he is already dying from an illness. One of the assassins kills Kasumi before he is defeated by Jin. Mugen and Jin then have their duel, their swords shattering, but choose not to kill each other as they now consider each other friends.

","I, being a husband and father, don't have a ton of time to binge watch. So me finishing this in less than a week might tell you how good this series is. I'll try my best to include why I liked it so much, but I could probably talk all day. 
 
First off, the setting. I am a sucker for historical, and this is just that. I loved the way it handled the historical setting, mixing in a little fiction, but not so much that it's ridiculous. I also loved the actual historical facts that Manzou the Saw would sprinkle in. 
 
Secondly, the music. From the first OP on Episode 1 you know that your ears are in for a treat. The music is just incredibly awesome and really helps set the tone. 
 
Third, the characters. They are such extremes but they compliment each other so well. Mugen, full of fire. Jin, as calm as a mountain stream. Fuu, as lovely but airy as spring. It's great to see them all come together. 
 
If I had to pick a weak spot, and it's not much of one, it'd be the art style. I get that it's supposed to be more graffiti like, but sometimes the faces just looked a little out there for me.

          
 
       Helpful For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed. 
 
1.Art - Well the art for this anime was very realistic right of the bat.  It had a down to earth feel but that being said,  it did not fail to be a very beautiful show.  Instead of creating a false sense of beauty the art seemed to try to capture the natural beauty of Japan and I believe it did so flawlessly.  The character models were very well thought out.  The style for each of the characters was reminiscent of their personalities so in that aspect the art was also perfect.  The art was flawless in this anime but that being said it was definitely not the best art I have ever seen so i'll give the art a 9. 
 
2.Sound - I really love what the director did with the soundtrack in this anime.  Somehow they were able to fuse sword fighting in the Edo period with modern day hip-hop.  IT IS GENIUS.  I have no complaints about this soundtrack it was literally perfect in my mind.  It was also a very innovative idea for the time being. I give sound a 10. 
 
3.Character - The characters were probably my favorite part about this anime.  They were all unique and you never had trouble relating to a character.  I don't think I've ever seen a show with characters as relatable as the ones in samurai champloo.  The characters also got a lot of background and the were all very legitimized.  It is very awesome to watch relationships within the characters develop and I absolutely loved it.  It's a definite 10/10. 
 
4.Story - The story was definitely a long tormented journey.  It was not a bad story I'm just saying it was very distracted from it's original storyline.  That being said, it was not a bad distraction.  I really enjoyed all the episodes even though most of them didn't have to do with the story.  This was my second time watching this anime so I was impressed I didn't get bored with the story.  In that aspect it was a great story.  By the way the end of the show was kinda sad because of how much I loved the characters.  I want to give the story a good score but the story got so sidetracked I can't give it an amazing score, so...... 7. 
 
5.Enjoyment - Well....... I really enjoyed this anime, and I know that by my reviews you can tell that I enjoy most anime I watch in some shape or form but the reason I liked this anime was because it felt so mature.  I can't explain why it would feel so mature to me but somehow it did.  It kinda felt like I was watching a badass samurai hip-hop soap opera but the sidetracked story took from my enjoyment so I'll give enjoyment a 8/10. 
 
This anime is an overall 8. 
 
Caution: 
!Keep in mind this anime has nudity. 
!Keep in mind this anime has intense gore. 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful While the art style was great and the fight sequences were eloquent and exemplified each character's personality, Samurai Champloo was a near perfect anime.  
 
I feel most of the appeal is at the beginning of their adventure, but in the remaining few episodes, I began to lose interest. This is definitely an example where the journey rather than the destination was important, which is what most animes should strive for anyway. But with two of the episodes leading up to the climax seeming like filler and the climax itself being mildly unsatisfying, I find the ending a bit lackluster. 
 
Above all of that, I can understand why this is one of the must-watch cult classics of anime and would highly recommend it. The soundtrack is incredible. The personality of the show is addictive. And the characters themselves, although kind of tropey at times, are inspiring in their own right.
