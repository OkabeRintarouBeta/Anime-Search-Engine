12,1812,0,14.67697472,Story between god and human,Hanoka,"This anime is the first full-fledged TV anime made with FLASH. 
 
The story takes place on a planet Tokinea where human beings and Star Races have been fighting. The story revolves around a girl who was made as ""Demon God,"" an ultimate weapon against human beings, and a boy who is a partner of the girl. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)",['Sci-Fi'],"In planet Tokinea, a huge war between the humans and the indigenous alien species, The Star Inhabitant (星の民） was ongoing. Humans were overpowered by The Star Inhabitant's power to control nature and came to the conclusion to produce a bionic human weapon named the Majin (lit.Demon God, Bionic Demigod). The 7th Majin, Majin No.7 was also ordered to rollout to the battlefield. In the battlefield, she meets a male child soldier, Yuuri and teams up with him.
","Hanoka is a series that proudly proclaims that it was the first TV anime series ever made solely using flash animation. And it's a mess! For starters, the animation is incredibly inconsistent and looks really jarring and awkward most of the time with action sequences that lack any kind of flow and having character designs that look off model most of the time. Now, considering the year this show came out in and if it were an independent project produced by one guy I would give it a pass. It was made during the Newgrounds era when many talented animators were beginning to emerge in the case of Egoraptor and the Eddsworld series. Eddsworld, in particular, was around two years into it's run when this show came out and the flash animation there, which was produced by one guy, is still a ton better and more consistent than this piece of aids. You could argue that it was the best the staff were capable of at the time with flash so therefore this holds no water but it still doesn't make the show any less visually unappealing or better. How the hell this got approved for television is way beyond me, even more so when it aired in 2006, a year that is considered to be one of the greatest years in anime as a whole which makes this piece of trash feel even more trite. 
 
Even if the animation were good it still wouldn't have made any difference since the script is bad. While it is MUCH more consistent in its writing than the previous shows I have reviewed thus far and actually does make coherent sense it's still nothing to write home about. The narrative is as cliche as they come revolving around a war between humans and ferocious alien monsters. In order to battle against these creatures, humans have developed super-humans to fight against these aliens and the series focuses on one of these super-humans called Hanako. The rest of the show is a series of different missions and the such involving Hanoka and her partner and that's pretty much it. The plot never develops and explores any deeper themes, the characters don't go through any arcs and the story remains stagnant throughout. It spews out some of the most generic liners too ranging from ""I'll do anything to protect you"" to ""He is my world"". This is something you have seen before on a much better level somewhere else and I always cringe at the delivery of lines of this nature. 
 
Each episode is only about three minutes in length which works terribly against the show's narrative since it is not given nearly enough time to properly flesh out characters and the setting. The aliens are generic in design and are even less memorable than the Gastrea in Black Bullet and the fights feel disjointed and boring leading up to an AWFUL conclusion. They do hint at the theme of discrimination between the people like Hanoka and the regular humans but it comes across as forced and forgettable as there is no time invested in this idea and comes across as victimising just for the sake of victimising. Hanoka herself is such a bland and boring character that I would have forgotten who she even was if the title of the series didn't share her name.  
 
The thing about this show is that it's just so boring. It's nowhere near as bad as Dark Cat mind you but it's also nowhere near the absurd levels of Genocyber. The show is as interesting as watching a guy cut his own fingernails. There is nothing to care for nor get too angry about either. Hanoka is just a 'thing'. It's bad, sure, but doesn't leave you with anything by the time you're done watching it. Should I praise it for being able to end without me wanting to kill myself or critique it for being so lazy and forgettable?  It's hard to pinpoint what the aim of this anime was and just what the hell it was trying to achieve but when you get down to it, it's a pile of trash.

       Helpful Terrible! I tried to find the worst anime I could to see just how bad it could get, and I ""wasn't disappointed"". 
 
I watched the first three episodes and loathed every moment. I was constantly tempted to stop. Eventually I got sick of it and watched the last episode to see how it ended. It took all of 30 seconds to figure out what happened between episode 3 and episode 12 the writing was so predictable. The series skipped over fight scenes frequently, even at the climax (if you can call it that). 
 
The visuals of this series are awful and made me just want to close my eyes. The animation is at best wonky. Even the characters' facial expressions look weird. 
 
The best part of this was its music which was at best an average experience. The voice acting was okay and the sound effects were listenable. Nothing fancy here. 
 
The characters were boring and irritating. Most of them were clichés with nothing that stood out. They all lacked any interest and despite attempts at building some back story I couldn't care less about these characters. 
 
This anime is not enjoyable! It's eye and brain torture... Show it to your most hated enemies and they might just claw their own eyes out. 
 
Overall this show is very difficult to watch and has little reason to exist. If you like challenging games just try and watch it the whole way through.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Honestly? The story isn't terrible. It's very basic, simple, and not even attempting to bring anything new to the table, but there's a vague understanding of general pacing, structure, foreshadowing, and other basic traits of writing. In fact, in the right hands, this narrative has the potential to become something very likable. Patricians will consider it drawl regardless of the form it takes, but that doesn't denounce the fact that this definitely has a ladder it could climb. 
 
That said, in regards to what keeps this from being all that great, the problem is the lifeless leads. There isn't enough time to really spend creating any character for them, and for the most part, things do come together to create believable characters, but it's still not enough to save it. For instance, most short 3-5 minute anime's forsake any form of characterization and just stick to comedy. Others that try and be serious (see: Pupa) fail because there isn't enough time to build anything believable. That said, this story definitely tries, and in some regards, succeeds. 
 
That said, the fact that the time is so short, the characters are borderline middle-school fanfiction tier, and unoriginal premise, the story itself is not all that memorable. 
 
Which leads me to the memorable part of this anime... 
 
 
Art: 
Hot damn, is the animation weak. There are a lot of decent flash animations out there, and this is not one of them. The only reason I don't have this as a 1/10 is because there are some cool sequences. Outside of those 2 scenes, everything is a mess. It's good that it never becomes unfollowable, but it's still not very pretty to look at. 
 
 
Sound: 
I really liked the soundtrack. I somewhat wish this was a longer anime so that we could have some more excellent music tracks to harvest from this mess of a production. Only once did I feel the music was used poorly, but everywhere else sounded pretty excellent. 
 
VA work is pretty good. If the characters were better, I think some of the performances could have moved me, but it's such a barren product that it's a pipe-dream to think anything like that could happen. 
 
 
Character: 
There's an attempt at characterization. That said, there is something to appreciate in Hanoka when it comes to how inept the writing is. It's like someone consumed so much media that they chose to regurgitate all the necessary bullet points when it comes to telling a story. 
 
Nobody is really likable, but I didn't find myself liking anyone. My biggest issue is with how OP Hanoka is. Everything else was fine, but it wasn't ever mind-blowing. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I actually kind of enjoyed this. It was fun. A harmless production that, in the right hands, could be a lot better. The biggest issue here is the animation, but everything else is fairly simple and elementary (save the soundtrack. That was surprisingly impressive.)

12,27631,1,13.181184,Story between god and human,God Eater,"The year is 2071. Humanity has been pushed to the brink of extinction following the emergence of man-eating monsters called ""Aragami"" that boast an immunity to conventional weaponry. They ravaged the land, consuming almost everything in their path and leaving nothing in their wake. To combat them, an organization named Fenrir was formed as a last-ditch effort to save humanity through the use of ""God Eaters""—special humans infused with Oracle cells, allowing them to wield the God Arc, the only known weapon capable of killing an Aragami. One such God Eater is Lenka Utsugi, a New-Type whose God Arc takes the form of both blade and gun. 
 
Now, as one of Fenrir's greatest weapons, Lenka must master his God Arc if he is to fulfill his desire of wiping out the Aragami once and for all. The monsters continue to be born en masse while the remnants of humanity struggle to survive the night. Only God Eaters stand between the Aragami and complete and total annihilation of the human race. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi']","In 2071, an organization known as Fenrir, located in the post-apocalyptic nation of the New Asian Union (NAU), helps humanity protect itself against monsters known as Aragami using divine weapons called ""God Arcs"". Composed of biological material called ""Oracle Cells"", God Arcs are wielded by a group of soldiers called, ""God Eaters"". The original (or ""Old-Type"") Arcs could initially only hold one form, either melee or ranged, but soon a new type of God Arc is developed that could switch between cannon and blade form.
","There is a different impact on every people watching anime, especially if the anime is an adaptation of something else like a manga, a novel, and for this one, a game. I played the game and expected too much on it (Well, the game was really GREAT and I loved it.) and when it aired as an anime, it turned into a ""Clean Mess"". Here is why: 
 
Story - [8] : I gave it a six because all the good things I knew would happen, didn't really happen the way I expected it to be. But, meh, it happens a lot on adaptations. But why 8 you ask? Well....let's see. For example, in episode 12, the game setting was WAY better (Especially since they're talking about god and such, the church setting SHOULD be better) but since it's the anime were discussing here, I gave points to certain changes and improvements like episode 2 and other surprises that I did not expect. I also gave it some point on it being an open end  type where chances of a Season 2 is possible (but just a tiny chance). 
 
Art - [9] : This, I noticed, didn't give much, if any, negative impression on me. But slashed it by a point from perfection due to some frames being repeated (I tend to memorize things and get a feeling of tardiness if I see an anime repeating animation frames unless, of course, it is a 4th wall joke. It's just a tiny problem.) 
 
Sound - [9] : Same as the Art. The soundtrack is great, especially the battle scene BGMs. Some game soundtracks also in there which gives a nostalgic feeling to players of the game. 
 
Character - [5] : Still the sane character design from the game. I did thought of their attires to be out of place, but then I though ""Hey. The world is ending in this anime so fashion doesn't matter."". To be honest, I just gave points because my favorite character, Sakaki Paylor, is still as cool as he was in the game. 
 
Enjoyment - [7] : I like seeing flesh being eaten like in SnK. Just Kidding. The roller coaster of positive and negative in this anime make it seem not great but it's not bad either. Starting from a shambled start, to a rocket mid-tier, to an even speed ending. I also enjoyed Episode: Scattered Petals (My favorite episode all in all). It makes me give a shred of pity on the MC and like him a tiny bit. 
 
Overall, I give it a a total of 7. It wasn't that bad, in fact, it was a good change of pace. The game IS better, but the anime isn't much worse also. If you are watching deep (really deep) anime, this one can pull you back into shallow waters. In other words, keep hoping that there will always be better anime with NO DELAYS! (I'm just joking lol). The delay itself became something that made me hope it's gonna be better, and it........ kinda did.

          
 
       Helpful If God Eater was a person, its face would be pretty but it would be an airhead. It would have a muscular body but not a bit of strength. Its breasts would be big but they couldn't produce any milk. But hey, it looks amazing. 
 
The main reason I'm writing this review is probably because God Eater managed to somewhat sway me. I'll say this in advance: I don't think God Eater is bad. Not as a whole. I know that a clear majority doesn't share my opinion on this show, and I can totally see why: the story, characters, story and characters. And the story. They are outright terrible, and that's a fact. Then, how is it possible that I actually liked it? 
 
When I watched the first 9 episodes weekly in the summer, I didn't like God Eater at all. It was confusing. The story sucked, the flashbacks didn't make sense and the music annoyed me. After the final 4 episodes aired in the spring, I rewatched the series. This time I got a better grip of the story, the flashbacks made sense, and what's more, the final episodes were pretty good. God Eater wasn't as bad as I thought even though its story and characters are pathetic by all odds. 
 
 
>STORY - 3/10 
 
God Eater in a nutshell: Attack on Titan 3.0. It's about people with superpowers (God Eaters) who fight big ass monsters (Aragami) using big ass weapons (God Arcs) that are made from Aragami cells and are basically the only way to kill them. A walled city, a determined protagonist, an organization that is tasked with killing the baddies. There is nothing original in the story of God Eater. I'm not saying it copied AoT (because it didn't) but there are many, many other series with similar premises. The plot of some of the episodes is cliche in too many ways as well, and some developments in the story are absolutely ridiculous. 
 
The flashbacks are boring, yes, but I felt intrigued when I knew the whole story of Johannes, Aisha and Paylor in the final episode. Their actions made sense now, and the plot twist in the final episode was a very surprising one. 
 
 
>ART - 9/10 
 
Visually, this anime is great. It has stunning visuals and cinematics. Some people get orgasms just by hearing the animation studio's name. The art style is original - the characters look like moving oil paintings with lots of details. I'm not sure how they do it but it looks awesome. AND DID YOU SEE THE LANDSCAPES? They're so rugged yet so charming in every situation. I could watch the backdrops all day long whether it's dusk, sunsets, skyscapes or rainy and gloomy. I liked the gore. There was nothing wrong with the direction, either. Almost everything in God Eater is crisp and clear to look at. 
 
However, the CGI aragami look pretty ridiculous, especially that scorpion-like creature. The fighting also looks comedic and slow at some points (especially in ep 2) because it's a mix of animated people waving their sticks at the CGI monsters that are doing, uh, whatever they do. The animated and CGI movements don't match, and it doesn't look pretty. Don't get me wrong: the CGI isn't done badly, but it's still CGI. By the way, if you're going to (re)watch God Eater in the close future, try to spot a rather distinguishable animation mistake in episode 6. 
 
 
>SOUND - 9/10 
 
The sound effects are very good, realistic and modern. The music is beautiful and always fits the mood. There's this band that performs many songs in the OST of God Eater, and even though it took me a while, I realized that hey, this doesn't sound too bad after all. I found another crazy good OST that I could listen to while reading manga or something. The opening song was also very good - it wasn't your typical OP, it was some kind of metalcore, and I couldn't stop listening to it some time ago. The ED was OK. The voice acting was pretty nice as well, it's the characters' lines that were crappy. 
 
 
>CHARACTER - 3/10 
 
There isn't one character I liked. They all ****ing suck, god dammit. What were you thinking, Ufotable? Don't you know how to give the characters a personality? 
 
Some of the main characters are way too easy to compare with the characters of AoT. AoT came out in 2013 and the anime adaptation of God Eater two years later, so animewise, God Eater is a copy of AoT. In a certain way, you know. 
- Lenka (Eren) is the protagonist of the show, and has vowed to exterminate all the Titagami 
- Kota (Armin) is the ""incompetent best friend"" 
- Alisa (Mikasa) is the beautiful, skilled and obstinate girl wonder 
- Soma (Levi) is the crusty and somewhat unsocial bad boy who is secretly warm-hearted 
 
There are also characters that fulfill other ""basic"" archetypes: a boobalicious commander, a badass unit leader whose cigarette never burns out and a cute, caring redhead who tries to be of help. Do I even need to say more? Well no, I don't, but I want to. 
 
Social interactions between the characters. English isn't even my main language, but I still find the dialogue to often be cliche and embarrassing, and it makes me want to roll my eyes. But at least the behavior of the characters is kind of realistic with all their expressionless faces. I guess that's more like a bad thing, though? 
 
Major Amamiya's boobs are too big and too out. Alisa's underboobs. How does that jacket (it's jacket, right?) even cover her boobs when she's jumping around? And Sakuya's wearing only an apron. Do the boobs fit the mood of this anime? No. Do the boobs fit the the mood of God Eater the game? Possibly. What I mean by this, is that it's a little stupid to make an anime adaptation of an action game. You can't play anime, you can only watch it. That's why many parts of the game don't suit the anime adaptation. I just wish Ufotable made an adaptation of some other series. 
 
 
>ENJOYMENT - 7/10 
 
I really enjoyed the fighting scenes, backgrounds and the mood whenever the music was playing and the characters weren't talking anything embarrassing. Episodes 2, 7, 8 and 9 were the worst episodes, with some infuriating dialogue or terribly carried out plot. 
 
 
CONCLUSION (tl;dr) 
God Eater is entertaining when it shows instead of tells. I can totally see why a lot of people don’t like it – I didn’t like it either, at first. The story barely exists, and the characters and their social interactions make me want to cringe too often. However, the strongest points of God Eater are animation and backgrounds that, along with the sound effects and epic music, made the series satisfying for me. A well-written story and enchanting characters aren’t always a necessity for enjoying a show. God Eater succeeded in being enjoyable in its own way, and it left me wanting more. But still, it IS pretty stupid, like, the show assumes its viewers are complete idiots or something? That kind of disrespectful stupid. 
 
 
>OVERALL - 6/10 (fine) 
 
 
By the way, I wanted to know what/who that girl-like figure at the end of the final episode was so I spoiled myself a little, and then I spoiled myself a little more. I think a second season could be very interesting. However, I don’t think God Eater was THAT popular in Japan, and I’m a pessimist so it might be unlikely that they’ll make a second season. But then again, we’re talking about Ufotable here, and they don’t obviously care about money so it’s impossible to say just yet. 
 
Whooooh, so, this was my first review! (this seems to be a common thing to say?)... Feedback is much appreciated. Have a fantastic day! And if you just skipped to the end of my review, screw you.

          
 
       Helpful Based by the game for PSP, God Eater. This is one of the few anime adaptions from the game that I find attachment to it.  
 
* Story (9) - The series start with a slow pace, focusing on how the main character, Lenka will face his own struggles on defeating the Aragami. Later on the anime is starting to pick up a reasonable pace where we are greeted by more fighting.  
 
What I like about this anime is that they actually try and give the main character a background story which is not available on the game. The ending will give you the feeling of having a season 02 but I seriously doubt it.  
 
* Art (10) - The first time I saw this anime, it has the 3D feel to it, but it surprisingly fit in. This will seriously stay in your mind for awhile because of its unusual art style and the way it is animated.  
 
Characters looked entirely different and you can easily remember their names as well. Background, there's nothing much we can do about it because the humans are technically on the brink of destruction thanks to the Aragami, 
 
* Sound (10) - VAs of this anime did a job well done. It feels like their voices suited the characters. The acting is also believable like they pour their emotions as if they were the characters themselves. They didn't overreact. They reacted like the way we should have acted.  
 
* Character (10) - There are some major and minor character developments, but none is left behind. Every character has faced some hardships with life and they have to deal with it of course.  
 
Some characters you may find it annoying or cringeworthy to watch but sometimes we have to understand that they faced some hardships and they do often overreact because they are tired or traumatized.  
 
* Enjoyment (10) - Even though I give it a perfect score, it is not exactly the anime I would rewatcha fter a month or so, because the anime can give a big impact or little impact that you may forgot what the anime is all about.  
 
The reason behind the perfect score, it is because until now, I still remember how the protagonists react to one another or to a battle and such. It has taken a place of my mind and that is like   6 - 7 months ago.  
 
Overall rating is 10 - They did a good job on trying their best to make the anime realistically enough for us viewers. If you know the game, then you should also know that they changed some things from the anime to make it more logical for us. I think you will know what I mean if you did some research of the game itself.

12,2994,2,12.67338682,Story between god and human,Death Note: Rewrite,"1. Genshisuru Kami (Visions of a God) 
A two hour episode of Death Note, mainly a compilation of the confrontations between Light and L, re-edited from Ryuk's perspective with new dialogue and soundtrack along with additional animation that could not be included in the original series.  An Unnamed Shinigami comes to Ryuk to question him about his new story in the human world. 
 
2. L o Tsugu Mono (L's Successors) 
This story continues where the previous left off, continuing the story of Light. As the previous special told Light and L's battles, this story does the same with the conflicts between Light, Mello, and Near.   
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the ""Death Note"", a mysterious black notebook that can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""shinigami"" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him ""Kira"" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word ""killer""). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that ""Kira"" could have family ties with members of the ""Kira"" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.
Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture.
Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as ""boring"" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.
","Those two movie long ""episodes"", the anime Death Note is shown us once again. Death Note is one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. 
 
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind. This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. 
10/10 
 
Characters: Light and L are two of the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development sometimes lacks. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, Light changes barely from the beginning of the series. This bit change can be seen in various other characters as well, although a bit more notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting. 
8/10 
 
Sound: Yet another amazing aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. Sometimes overused, it still is on a very good level. 
8/10  
 
Art/Animation: Again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the scenery are all done amazingly well. Seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well.

Overall: I was watching the series as one of the first anime, and those weeks are still great and heavy in my memories. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would think and do in the world. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
 
----------- 
 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
 
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
 
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
 
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
 
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
 
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
 
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
 
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.  
 
Rating: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful okay.. death note rewrite. 
part 1: Visions of a God 
from what i gathered from its title, i thought it'd be something different but it was not (see synopsis) but nonetheless, it was nice. i kind of regarded it as an overview of DN. i was kind of interested only because of the new character but there wasn't any development either. the story stops right after L and Watari died. 
 
it's pretty much the same DN, only compressed. which leaves us now to just one question: should you watch it? uhmm... let's just say you wanted to rewatch DN.. then i'd rather watch the rewrite. other than for that reason, i think you'd find yourself disappointed like i was. 
 
oh, but wait! i think there is a part there that you souldn't dare miss! hahahaha. yeah. another face-writhing reaction from Kira. other than that..no more :) 
 
part 2: L's successors: 
the second part is definitely better than the first..or so say. haha. i have a personal bias for L. if you like L, you'll like the second part.. or not; he does the narration for the first ten minutes. i watched it english dubbed, and it still is good. 
 
it's the continuation of the first part, nothing changed except for a slight flashback at wammy house. i was expecting more of near's and mello's perspective but there wasn't enough. i think this version was easier to understand compared to the original. 
 
my review doesn't justify for my rating, doesn't it? that's just me. haha.

 now to be completely honest if i was 8 years younger and still have the maturity and attention span of a gerbil then i probably would've enjoyed this anime 
now if you dont heed my warning and pursue to watch this regardless of what this random person on internet is saying... well then keep keyboard mouse glasses at a distance to avoid unconsciously throwing them also move yourself back 2 feet from desk to avoid slamming your head on the desk...

          
 
       Helpful I came upon Loki Ragnarock on amazon prime a little while ago. I think the main reason I watched it was because,I'm a really big marvel fan and the name ""loki"" was in the title,at first,I did'nt expect this to actually be about the norse gods witch was kinda stupid. 
I do like this anime,I found it really intriguing at times.There was always this sense of mystery to the episodes,while still being funny and charming in in it's own unique way.It's definatly not for everyone, it does lose a bit of that mystery element as it goes on and drags itself out for 26 episodes,but dont take it from me.It's certanly a good series to watch just for a laugh and for quirky characters and story lines (as cheesy as they can get)

          
 
       Helpful This show had a manga that was never fully released here in the USA but from what I have been able to read I am thoroughly shocked that they did not use the manga's brilliant writing to it's advantage. Instead we get a slapping together of mediocrity with little to no relation to the original material. Everything is mediocre at best, laughable and pathetic at worse. 
 
That being said I love this anime, as it is one of my firsts. It does have a certain charm to it if you can look past how lazy it is. It takes so many shortcuts and just does not seem to care, and that makes it enjoyable in an ironic sort of way.

(Source: ANN) ","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']",none,"This review, like the anime, is short. 
 
                  Frankly(sorry to the fans), I feel that my experience of watching this series was not precious. Viewing this was not a waste of time yet it wasn't really enjoying either. For some people,  this is deep, tells about death in a artistic and anime-like way and I agree with them but still Shinigami no Ballad left no impact to me is incomparable to other series that really blows my head and heart.It does tell us that we should accept death and move on for its is just a fleeting moment i n the world that is very precious yet misunderstood; however, this message was not portrayed in a way that will make the audience rethink. 
 
Momo is cute but also are many other girls and she did not really show more of her character;we know little of her personality. The show may have failed to keep other viewers interested and I really did not find a lot of uniqueness and surprises from this anime, it was typical.  
 
This is one of the shows that I personally label as the &quot;ones that some insist to be deep because there is deepness in it yet in reality it is just like other heartwarming animes&quot;.  The six episodes seemed looonnnnggggg to me because of the slow pacing.  
 
On the good side, kids can watch this and will not fear the concept of death. As a conclusion: this anime tackles a deep issue in a shallow way.

          
 
       Helpful To begin, I was not expecting this series to be that great.  
I initially viewed it on the basis that it was 6 episodes in length. 
I took ""Shinigami no Ballad"" more seriously after watching ""House of Five Leaves"", and learned the director - Tomomi Mochizuki - had directed both series. ""House of Five Leaves"" left that much of an impression on me.  
The script writer Reiko Yoshida also had some influence on my decision, as she has written a lot of great scripts for many series such as Aria: The Natural, Major, Kaleido Star, and so on. 
 
Like Aria, this series is episodic, you can literally watch any episode at any time, they're self contained. 
Reading the synopsis and watching the first episode, you expect the series to be about what it is implying, a Shinigami taking the souls of people ready to leave this world. But this series is surprisingly more than a Shinigami taking a life every episode. 
It has a lot to do with getting over death, or living your life to its fullest as you never know when the ""end"" will come. 
 
This series is about a Shinigami who looks like a cute girl wearing white, her name is Momo. She's not your average Shinigami, she likes to appear before the souls she will take and let them know that they should start living life to its fullest, or she may even appear before the family, or a sibling[s] of the deceased, as the deceased had some ""regrets"" before leaving. Since people obviously find it hard to believe this cute girl is a Shinigami [despite her floating in the air and carrying a giant scythe around], she frequently flashes her ID card reading ""Shinigami 100100"" as proof. 
She has a ""sidekick"" named Daniel, and he's kind of a quirky individual. Oh yes, he's a black cat with a bell around its neck. Most people believe she's a Shinigami after the cat starts talking. 
Daniel usually calls Momo a crybaby, because Momo does exactly that. You will see it in episode 1. 
 
Much like ""House of Five Leaves"" - I'm referring to the calm factor - , ""Mushi-shi"", or even ""Aria: the Natural"", which sounds like a very odd comparison to a show like this, but you'd understand if you've seen it. ""Shinigami no Ballad"" is calming and unusually touching. 
This is in no way a horror, at all. 
 
After finishing the last episode, I was actually sad that this very well directed series was over, and wanted to see more of Momo's adventures as a Shinigami. 
The aesthetics fit the mood, the music was calming, and for the most part, the acting was very good. 
I did not feel there was anything that was left out after each episode, except for in the 5th episode. Each episode is written and directed extremely well. You would think the slow pace would leave things unfinished, which is not the case here. 
 
If there were a few things that put me off, some of the acting was a little too laid back at times, actually it was like they weren't even trying. 
The idea of the Shinigami being a cute girl with a cat seems a little too generic when it comes to anime, but you get used to it after a few episodes. 
Lastly, the series with its very slow pace and calmness, can be boring to some viewers. 
Also the eye-catch is so unfitting and macabre that I burst into laughter every time I watch it.  It does not fit the mood at all. Although there's a unique picture on the eye-catch for each episode, that's a nice edition, even though I only noticed it after 3 episodes. 
 
___ 
 
To conclude, this is a series, if you have any inclination into ""Shinigami no Ballad"", and don't mind the slow pace of anime like ""House of Five Leaves"", ""Mushi-shi"", or ""Aria"", this is a great story to delve into and enjoy to its fullest, as there are only 6 episodes. You can watch it like it's a long chapter by chapter film. 
A surprisingly calm and touching series about death. It is not a horror in any way. 
 
Keep pursuing your dreams! ~ Wynn 
 
P.S.  
[This show is currently rated at #2478]  
Just because a series rating is not over 100 does not mean it is bad in any way (it can also be true that it is bad though), but the same goes for the fact that a series rated at 100 does not mean it is good. 
I recommend reading the reviews that do not spoil the series as well as seeing if the synopsis agrees with your taste. But you can still be missing out even after not agreeing with any of those points. 
 
So basically you just have to get lucky, and hope for the best most of the time.

          
 
       Helpful ""Shinigami no Ballad"" is a collection of six laid back short stories about an emotional shinigami Momo observing and often meddling in the lives of those who had to deal with the death of someone dear.  
 
For a show centred around death, ""Shinigami no Ballad"" is neither dramatic nor exciting. Its episodic stories all share a similar contemplative mood, and there's a common underlying theme of living life to the fullest. It's a melancholy, relaxing kind of show that gently opens your eyes and lets you appreciate what's around you that little bit more. However, the stroll-in-the-park pacing means that it isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. I was watching the 2nd episode whilst eating dinner, and found that episode to be boring; the remainder I watched without doing anything else, and found those enjoyable. So it seems to me it's probably the kind of series that requires undivided attention in order to be enjoyed, even for a viewer as patient as myself. 
 
Though not spectacular in any department, ""Shinigami no Ballad"" is also a show that doesn't really do much wrong. It's likely to bore a lot of people out there, but I personally have a soft spot for this quiet, unassuming show.

(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Demons', 'Fantasy']",none,"Among the prolific lineage of Light Novel Adaptations, there is a before and after ""Shakugan no Shana"". This title dramatically modeled the modern scenery of this medium, from 2005 to onwards... But what about its lesser known debuts? The most cultured elements of the community would answer that there is ""Slayers"" in the 90s, but they would be only half right. Although it is true that this light-hearted 'sword and sorcery' is the first of its kind to be popular in the West, a long running Light Novel was already well established in Japan: that, is Utsunomiko. 
Spanning to 52 volumes under the pen of the honorable Keisuke Fujikawa, his brain child started in 1984, only to be concluded in 1998. 
 
A prequel movie (which is still untranslated) premiered in march 1989. Even though it was far to be a smashing hit of ""Delivery Girl Kiki"" scale, it garnered enough success at the box-office to warrant the creation of the present OAV series. The franchise is, at core, a Fantasy Jidaigeki Epic. Themes in relation to piety and chivalry being dear to Fujikawa, his creation sort of comes off as an oriental equivalent of the Arthurian cycle. Replace the Camelot era by the Jinshin-no-Ran civil war of 762, the knights of the round by Shugenja monks, Christianity by Shugendo, the dazzling charger by a celestial boat and you may notice they share like-minded topoi. Furthermore, they both blend a Historical base with a more Fantastic component. The big difference is that Utsunomiko, the main character, is a champion of the people instead of a lord. 
 
As its name indicates, Utsunomiko: Heaven Chapter, merely adapts the second arc of the Light Novel. As such, there is this latent impression to jump on it In Media Res, as the intrigue was defined previously. Indeed, upon completion, the spectator is left with many questions on his mind: How the little goddess Kijimuna joined the Shugenja? What were the events driving the prince Kawashima to betray his entourage? Why was Ootsu no Miko executed? What lead the valiant thief Uokai to meet the same fate? Fortunately, the focused storytelling of this OAV series alleviates the confusion. It is largely due to its protagonist, Utsunomiko, who is a proactive leader. There is no beating around the bush, because he is straightforward in what he aims for. Not even the idealistic romance between Utsunomiko and Kagami, which is particularly elevated, is disruptive. It intersects neatly with the plot, rather than shunting it through unnecessary digressions. 
 
In essence, U:HC is as anti Isekai as it gets: it starts with the small Terran crew departing to Heaven as fleshly VISITORS. That is all the subtlety, as the main protagonist and his companions are not perceived as chosen ones by their hosts... On the contrary, they are seen as intruders who might be up to no good. Moreover, they initially come to seek enlightenment, not meddle with otherwordly affairs. The ascetic outfits of the monks is indicative of their humility, in contrast with the pomp of the Touriden Gods. The tense conflict between the two parties is emotionally involving, as it stems up from a dramatic double truth. 
 
Art Direction has a pivotal importance as its mission is to convince the spectator that the title is not a fraud. Anyone who owned the Laserdisc of the series at the time, was certainly blown away by the gracious ballet of Yukata-clad angels flying in the sky, the frolicking winged horses or the floating lagoons enfolding at screen. The supreme God's castle is itself a imposing structure, harmonizing a rough Chinese style with the exuberance of Art Nouveau. The Chara-design in itself goes for practicality. The distinctive Toei Douga touch, strays somewhat from Mutsumi Inohata's chara-design, who illustrated the source. This matter of fact is further evidenced by the appearance of certain characters; master Ozunu looks like Toki whereas Taishakuten has a vague likeliness with Rei. It would not be surprising if Toei enlisted the help of key animators who worked on ""Hokuto no Ken"". Thankfully, the mecha design of Katsumi Itabashi adds enough of an extra to avoid it looking derivative. 
 
As for Saki Makihiro's score, it is captivating. The background musics are solemn, yet are neither ponderous nor stuffy. Synth backs up more traditional instrumentation as they pulse at every turn of phrase with epic breadth. A less vibrant contribution would have undermined the show's atmosphere, but a shortcoming the soundtrack is not... All the Seiyuu provide an inspired performance; Toei went as far as casting the voice of Seiya for Utsunomiko, as to associate in the spectator's mind the mythological backdrop of two different series. Personal favorite being Banjou Ginga as Taishakuten, exuding with godly self confidence as his blaring, deep voice echoes like a war horn. 
 
Half extrospective and introspective, half spiritual and grounded, U:HC is a metaphysical Odyssey into Mystery, Enchantment and Danger. Whereas it does not innovate in any way, it extracts a Nekketsu motif and translates it in a near flawless way. It is a most recommended addition, to anyone willing to watch a Fantasy Epic balancing aptly the fun, the tense and the ethereal together. If it were not for the flaws listed on the colophon, this unfairly overlooked entry would have been rewarded with a perfect 10...

This section is dedicated to content indication in order to inform audience in a practical way. On the next paragraph, the buzzwords offer hints about the title's strong suits and drawbacks. 
 
Ketchup meter: Nothing too objectionable. There is no gore or blood shed to be seen. Most of the violence results from Utsunomiko intensely suffering his passion, as he learns to concile his dual nature. 
xXx meter: What do you think this is? Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai? 
Fishing scene(s): Oddly enough, in the second episode, it features the only existing instance of a ship hooked and dragged below the sea level. It is a clever way to introduce the heroes to an exiled deity's plea. 
 
 
POSITIVE aspects: 
+ The timeless fairytale art direction, going for a classicist approach 
+ The Laserdisc worthy animation 
+ The stakes being adjusted in consequence, as the protagonist is a demi-god. Is there a more fearsome obstacle than a Supreme God, after all? 
+ An excellent balance, between the didactic subplot, the romance and the main conflict 
+ No cringy Isekai tropes to ruin the premise 
+ The limpid narration, helping to immerse into the big-scaled epic 
 
 
NEGATIVE aspects: 
- The esoteric Buddhist flavoring, which may deter a casual western spectator. 
- A regrettably necessary In Media Res start 
- The concept of physical and spiritual death, not tackled properly 
- The recurrent tendency to utilize master Ozunu's appearances as an almighty plot device. 
- The cliffhanger ending making one wish for more (even though the Heaven arc was at least fully finalized)

       Helpful Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a show that lived by its characters and died by its plot. The show kind of came out of left field in Fall 2014. It was an adaptation of a mobile game (or gotcha game) and was coming from a fairly new studio Mappa. Although it started under the radar, it did not take long for the show to pick up steam, and it even ended up being one of the most popular and hyped shows of its season. The lead characters, Kaiser and Favaro, were outstanding, and it had several side characters to give them a run for their money. Personally, I think the cast is one the best in anime and at bare minimum one of the most fun. Sadly, the plot could not back up its ridiculously good character lineup. Genesis started as a character driven adventure story, but ended up a rather generic fantasy-action show by the end of its run. Even though I do not think the show is a must watch, I would still recommend it for its quality characters, especially its leads. 
 
Luckily, most of the cast is back for another season, Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul. Although Kaiser and Favaro take a back seat in the second season, they are replaced with equally great leads, Nina and Charioce… or so it seemed. Both Nina and Charioce started off absolutely fantastic, but they end utterly abysmal, as they are some of the most butchered character arcs I have ever seen. Although Nina’s character is totally wrecked by the end of the series, all her faults end up tying back to Charioce, and he does not stop after destroying Nina and himself, as he goes so far to make both Favaro and Kaiser come crashing down with them. Charioce is certainly the most disappointing character I have seen in recent years and is certainly in the running for overall worst character in anime, as he drags multiple otherwise great characters down into the grave with him. 
 
Charioce plays the role of the main villain of Virgin Soul and starts of as a pretty damn good one. Virgin Soul picks up ten years after the events of Genesis, and Charioce has been crowned the new king in the time between them. It is never really made clear how much power he holds as king, but it seems he pretty much has power over the entire human race. Although he is essentially the head pin of humanity, he focuses on furthering his own goals rather helping others, so to call Charioce evil would be an understatement, as he uses his power and charisma to enslave demons, murder, imprison the innocent, kidnap, and manipulate. He is pretty much the ultimate villain, and even if someone this evil may sound more cartoony rather than an actual person, he isn't. The show makes sure that viewer understands he does all these horrible things not because he is some madman, but because he has goals he wants to achieve no matter the cost. Charioce is evil, but even if he has his reasons for being evil, he is still evil. 
 
Let us take a look at how Charioce is introduced at the beginning of Virgin Soul. After the catastrophe of the massive dragon Bahamut, it was Charioce who helped humanity back on its feet after he took the role of King, but to do this, he had to turn his back against their old allies, the angels and cruelly enslaved their old enemies, the demons. Although he built up the humans, he did so on the blood of others. Charioce would do anything and everything to make his dream come true, even if that meant he had to kill and betray countless times to get there, and as the show unfolds, Charioce only adds to the list of atrocities he has committed. A person like this, so tunnel visioned by their ambitions that they throw compassion out the window, makes for a very interesting villain, because it lets you empathize with them even though you know they can never truly be forgiven for their previous actions. In the last act of the anime, it is revealed that Charioce’s goal is to put an end to Bahamut, as the attack ten years ago was responsible for the death of his mother. As it stood, Bahamut would eventually return, so he chooses to resurrect him (killing numerous more people) so that he can finish him once and for all. 
 
It is all fine and dandy that Virgin Soul wants me to sympathize with Charioce, but it cannot try and tell me that I should forgive him, or should they let not one, but basically their entire cast of characters show him forgiveness. All the horrible things that Charioce did are forgotten about when they find out that Charioce was (kinda) doing a good thing for the world in the end. This is complete bullshit! The ends do not always justify the means. Even if humanity does benefit from Charioce’s plans, he is still only selfishly doing it to get revenge for his mother. Charioce can have his reasons for the crimes he committed, but those reasons should not mean that everything he did should just go away (especially when a lot of it had little to nothing to do with killing Bahamut in the end), and it does not. This one decision Virgin Soul made killed everything the show built up to at that point. 
 
Charioce's redemption also gets to ruin several other characters alongside his own. Nina, the new protagonist of this season, falls in love with Charioce and wants to separate the two sides she sees in him, the first side, the person she loves and the second side, the evil king responsible for countless heartless acts. When Nina finally realizes that her loved one and her enemy are the same person, she somewhat reluctantly decides she still needs to stand against him, even at the cost of letting go of the person she loves. Up to this point, Nina’s character is still quite good, and even if she decided to jump ship and stand next to the king, because said king is also the one she loves, I would not of faulted her character for it. That is not the case though, she decides that no matter what, Charioce must be stopped and his crimes cannot go unpunished, but after hearing a BS excuse for his actions, Nina immediately forgives him going against everything her character just stood for at that point. Forgiving Charioce single-handedly killed Nina’s character arc, and hers was not the only one butchered by this very same action. 
 
Favaro and Kaiser have almost two full seasons of being great characters with firm beliefs and moral standings, but forgiving Charioce made everything come tumbling down for them too. Favaro supports Nina for choosing to choose Charioce over her own identity—dumb but grounded in the idea that love triumphs over all. Favaro chose to selflessly save the world over the girl he loved, Amira, at the climax of the first season, but he tells Nina to put her own love over everything else, because he wishes he could go back and do the same, throwing his previous character arc out of the window. It was certainly disappointing to see Favaro’s character U-turn like this, but it was even more disappointing witnessing Kaiser’s downfall. 
 
Kaiser was always a person who stood strongly for his personal idea of justice. At the start of Genesis, Kaiser was a knight who fought against Favaro, because he was a criminal bounty hunter, but after he realizes his adversary is less of a crook than he originally thought, he does not hesitate to jump ship, joining Favaro, and even fight against some of his old allies. The reason Kaiser became a knight in the first place is because he wanted to spend his life fighting for his beliefs, so when he figures out Charioce is not the good-wholesome king he and everyone else thought he was, he quickly starts to rethink his position. Kaiser has always been loyal to justice, not loyal to the king. He jumps ship, in a similar way to Genesis, and joins Favaro and Nina in a rebellion against Charioce, but after finding out that Charioce had ""reasons"" for committing SOME of his crimes, Kaiser instantly forgives him going so far to even (spoilers) give his own life to save his. This completely goes against what Kaiser has stood for this entire time, sparing a mass murder because he is maybe kind of a little bit sorry. Kaiser forgiving Charioce to the extent of laying down his life for him is insanely out of character and goes against all his core beliefs. At least Nina and Favaro were bounty hunters with at least a little moral ambiguity, but Kaiser is literally a knight that is supposed to be fighting for justice. 
 
Luckily, not everyone is so quick to jump on the Charioce-forgiveness bandwagon. Two characters, Azazel and Jeanne d’Arc, do not agree with the retribution everyone else seems to be giving Charioce. Both Azazel and Jeanne have one extra thing they hold Charioce responsible for on top of all his other crimes, the death of their son (pretty much adopted son in Azazel’s case), Mugaro. Although Charioce did not directly kill Mugaro (that criminal act goes to one of his men, Alessand) he tried to multiple times, so when Alessand kills him to gain his approval, Azazel and Jeanne still hold him accountable to a large degree. Azazel and Jeanne have every right to hate Charioce for both personal and general reasons… This is Virgin Soul though, so, of course, the show decides the paint them in wrong and Charioce in the right, because did not you know? Charioce did all those horrible things in an attempt to stop a dormant Bahamut by resurrecting him, killing more in the process. Fuck, man. Can Virgin Soul do anything right? 
 
Virgin Soul was actually a pretty good anime up until Charioce’s redemption, so am I going to hard on a single plot point? Maybe, but they fucked up so hard with Charioce that his problems actually became everyone else’s. Charioce, in my opinion, will most definitely go down as one the biggest blunders in anime history. He had so much potential as a character and lived up to none of it, just like Virgin Soul. Genesis was a really good anime despite having a lot of problems and rather than fixing those problems, Virgin Soul gave us Charioce.

          
 
       Helpful For the most part Virgin Soul seems like its going to be better than Genesis, but then when it finishes, it just feels empty.  Like, it could have delivered more than it did, but it was so dead set on cramming the romance angle into the finish of the story, than truly delivering the realism and great finish it could have and should have had, that the whole ending suffered.  There is a reason that most animes don't have the Protagonist and the Antagonist in the kind of relationship that Nina and Chris were in: It just doesn't work and causes logic holes all throughout the story.  Still, it was a very good anime for the most part, and while the ending was a bit lacking, you'd still very much enjoy the first 21-22 episodes.

Each episode tells a story of a different federation soldier that is cursed by a Death God that came down to earth with the Zakus and shows the desperate struggle against mobile suits with only conventional weapons such as tanks and missiles. Each soldier, fueled with revenge, and a Death God looming over their backs, fights against the odds that is the terrible might of a Zaku. ","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"MS Igloo 2 is an improvement on the original, but doesn't manage to live up to the rest of the MSG franchise. The biggest change this time around is a focus on more personal stories, the story happening exclusively on Earth, and the introduction of a spiritual aspect - each main character is haunted by a Shinigami (although this is easily seen as metaphorical).  
 
What I liked: 
 
- Better animation. MS Igloo 2 boasts very nice looking mobile suit animation, and a lot of love went into characters' hair. The shinigami looks great with long flowing locks.  
 
- Cooler Mobile Suits and fights. The original MS Igloo suffered from a dearth of interesting Mobile Suits and relied on weird new designs like the Oggo to draw Mobile Suit enthusiasts. Fortunately MS Igloo 2 has possibly the coolest Guntank yet, as well as plenty of incredible Zakus, GMs and other assorted weaponry. The battles are dynamic, strategic and fun to watch. Since all the fights are on land it's a lot easier to understand everything's relative location, which was harder in the original when most fights were in space.  
 
- More personal plots. MS Igloo 3 focuses on three individual stories with plots very personal to the main characters. This makes the series more emotional than the original (although that's like saying it's more emotional than a rock). 
 
What I didn't like: 
 
- The facial animations. Little has changed in this department. Facial expressions are distorted and ugly, to the point of ridiculousness. This can ruin suspense and make serious scenes look very silly. The female characters interestingly don't suffer as much, while still displaying strong emotion. 
 
- Extremely unlikable characters. Many of the characters are snide, aggressive and rude to each other. Some of them even seemed verging on insane. I would have preferred a more creative take on the emotional toll of war. 
 
- The contrived shinigami aspect. The shinigami felt very out of place in MS Igloo. The UC timeline, especially events like the one year war, are known for being more realistic and technology driven than later timelines, so throwing a god of death in there felt like an odd choice.  
 
Should you watch MS Igloo 2?: Yes, but only if you're a diehard Gundam fan. My preferred watching order would be: 
- episode 1 of MS Igloo: the Hidden one year war for that sweet Char cameo 
- then skip the rest and watch MS Igloo 2 in its entirety

          
 
       Helpful As a fan of MS Igloo I was excited to finally see this in its entirety and was not disappointed. 
 
Story and Characters 
 
The year is Universial Century 0079 at the start of the war when Zeon has just landed on earth. These 3 OVAs are the stories of 3 common soldiers, their weaponary and revenge as their motivation in fighting for the Earth Forces during the period.  
 
OVA1's protagonist is the conflicted Ben Barberry, notorious as a death god for sucking the life out of his unit but somehow surviving. At the start of the war, Zeon's Zaku's held the tactical advantage and Ben's anti tank unit is hastily renamed the anti Mobile Suit unit with their weapon of choice being a modified bazooka that fires (larger) anti Mobile suit missiles. Ben and his new unit of fresh recruits are sent to hunt Zaku's while providing cover for the Earth Forces Retreat - in other words, a suicide mission. 
 
OVA 1 was reminiscent of world war 2 movies where everything is in black and white - the color, the landscape, good/bad, right/wrong, strong/weak. You felt like you were there with Ben struggling to survive and keep his men alive, and if nothing else it drove home 2 messages for me. First, it SUCKS to be ground troops against Mobile Suits. Second, technological superiority DOES matter. 
 
OVA 2 had the most tactics as it was a cat and mouse game between two old enemies. Earth Forces tank Ace Herman Yardell survived against the Zaku ace Elmer Snell, the ""White Ogre"" and has sought revenge since. Both men have somewhat of a bushido code, wanting to fight only the best, and go to great lengths to achieve it, including feigning mechanical failure to get out of ""Boring"" fights.  
 
At this stage in the war, earth forces tank has clearly somewhat bridged the technological gap to the Zakus and it is a pleasure to watch the genius Yardell (who is nuts) fight. 
 
OVA 3 is the story of Arleen Nozen, a technical lieutenant unjustly imprisoned for leaking information to Zeon on the RTX-440 Ground Assault type Guntank. Arleen lives for revenge against the true informant, her ex (lover) because he not only betrayed her but the information leak resulted in her guntank program's development being halted with only 3 being produced. The Evil General offers a chance of amnesty to 3 prisoners in exchange for fighting in the battle of Odessa - Arleen accepts. By Odessa, the earth forces now have their own mobile suits so Odessa is the battle to push Zeon back into space. 
 
Of the 3 OVA, this one had the best weapon. I thought the Guntank was phenomenal in it's flexibility! It had awesome maneuverability, high speed, ability to transform into 3 form factors and a TON of armaments to boot! Oh my god, information on this is truly worth stealing. If development continued this would surely have become a Mobile Armor. This OVA as a standalone would deserve a 9 because of the beautiful plot twist at the end. 
 
All 3 ovas had easily identifiable and likeable characters developed in a short period of time, one could even consider their weapons as characters which grow in importance from OVA 1 to 3. The OVAs succeeded in making me cry. However, I felt like the death god theme was misplaced or could have been left out and the story would have been much better. The death god certinly wasn't ""needed"" and it seemed like it was put in just to showcase the beautiful animation of this character. 
 
Art/Animation 
 
The Animation was incredible from a technical standpoint (10) but weak in characterization (6) for an average score of 8.  
 
One thing that cannot be denied is CGI has made great strides in a short time. I am continually amazed by the level of detail rendered - you can see individual strands of hair, eyelashes/eyebrows, even the pores on the skin of an individual's face! Compared to MS Igloo I they've also made great improvements in movement and explosions, these no longer look chunky/block/fake but are instead smoother, rounder and more realistic. 
 
The problem is with characterization. The shots of a character acting surprised by widening/opening their eyes bigger is overused and looks artificial. Cel drawings don't have the same issue as we are accustomed to exaggerated facial reactions. Igloo 2 suffers from this problem because the art is so good you tend to compare it with what real life people would do and if it isn't a realistic reaction or expression in live action it looks artificial in CGI. Now, the women are rendered very lovingly and their expressions are for the most part realistic, but not so for the men in OVA1 and OVA2.  
 
Sound 
 
Igloo 2 has no OP, but 3 different EDs, all of which tie to their stories so I thought this was inventive and clever. The voice acting wasn't as good as I hoped, some of the voices just didn't seem to mesh with the character personalities. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall 
 
I loved how realistic this was. Each OVA was a look through the eyes of a small common soldier, but the overarching theme is Earth eventually caught up with Zeon's technological superiority and the entire course of the war changed. All things being said I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone. I hope to see more MS Igloo.

Tomoe's former master, Lord Mikage, appears after his long absence and places Tomoe into a magical pocket mirror in order to stave off his ailment. 
 
Mikage explains that long ago, before he and Tomoe had met, the fox youkai was in love with a human woman. Seeking to live as a human with his beloved, he made a deal with a fallen god, but he only ended up cursed and dying. When Mikage discovered Tomoe, the god made the youkai forget his human love as a quick solution. However, something has changed recently to reactivate the curse; Tomoe has fallen in love with his new human master, Nanami. Since there is no way to stop the curse, Nanami wants to stop Tomoe from getting cursed in the first place by traveling back through time, even if it means they may never meet. As Nanami travels back hundreds of years to save her precious familiar, she discovers that she is far more closely bonded to Tomoe than she previously thought.

Instead, she must cope with the fact that her father, who is a constant gambler, has accumulated a bunch of gambling debts in her name. As she can't afford to pay the rent, she gets kicked out of her apartment by the debt collectors and is now homeless. Despite this unfortunate turn of events, she still maintains a kind heart.
While sitting on a park bench collecting her thoughts, Nanami meets a strange man hanging from a tree because he is being chased by a dog. After saving him from the dog, she learns that the man's name is Mikage. Upon learning about Nanami's current situation, in a perfect example of how good deeds are rewarded, he gives her his home as a token of his gratitude. She accepts the offer because she is homeless. When Nanami arrives at Mikage's home, she is shocked to see that it is not a normal home but a shrine for worship. After being greeted by Onikiri and Kotetsu, who are the keepers of the shrine, she meets Tomoe, Mikage's familiar, and she learns that Mikage used to be the Land God of the shrine and has bestowed upon her his mark on her forehead so that she may be the new God. At first, Nanami is reluctant, but as she lives with Tomoe, Onikiri, and Kotetsu she begins to understand and works hard in her new position as the Land God. As the story progresses Nanami finds herself falling in love with Tomoe, but he rejects her because the love between a human and a yokai is taboo. Despite saying that, Tomoe finds himself falling in love with her too.
","To speak about this OVA it's important to acknowledge first of all the huge difference between the manga of Kamisama Hajimemashita and it's anime adaptation. The adaptation has never been completely faithful to the manga, and the same happens with this OVA. If you haven't read the manga, this OVA is just a great addition to the anime. However, if you already read the manga, you won't be able to help feeling a little disappointed.  
 
The OVA is very well done, just like the regular anime; good art, good  cast, good rythm, good everything. The love between the main characters is reinforced and some secrets are revealed. BUT! (And this is a huge ""But"") The feels one gets in the manga are 300% more intense than in the OVA, so as an adaptation, it's just mediocre.  
 
I'll try to explain briefly  what we are missing in the OVA without giving any explicit spoiler:  
 
First of all, the time-travel logic is far better depicted in the manga, and Nanami goes through way more hardship to accomplish her mission. Besides, with regard to the whole story, it is in this Past Arc where we are supposed to discover most of the important information about the nature of Tomoe and Nanami's relationship, as well as Tomoe and Yukiji's, which is not explaind in the OVA at all, when it really shoud have been because it is by far the most interesting part of the story and it really changes everything. (It is there where you finally say ""Hey! This is clearly not Inuyasha!"" ) But not trace of it in the OVA.  
Last but not least, within this arc of the manga, Nanami gets to know quite well Akura-ou, who becomes a major character in the following arcs, and the absence of the Akura-ou part in the OVA, added to the fact of condensing everyone's favorite part of the manga (4 volumes of it actually) in barely 4 episodes, only makes me fear that there might not be next anime season in the future. 
 
The past arc of Kamisama Hajimemashita has been one of the most pasionate stories I've read in a manga, and one of the most coherent time-travel stories I've ever come across. So it saddens me considerably to see it cheapened like this.  
 
However, as I said at the begining of the review, if you haven't read the manga, go ahead, the story is undoubtably enjoyable and sweet. 

          
 
       Helpful It was so good I actually cried.  (Rarely cries when watching tv shows or movies) 
 
End of story. 
 
I really don't want to spoil anything but this really is the sole reason I was willing to continue with the story and read the manga. The TV show arcs are a little too ""slice of life"" for me. I'm the type of person who likes watching love stories that have A LOT of life or death drama and those in which the girl kinda ""changes"" the evil male protagonists. 
 
Hence I'm kinda a fan of the Hunger games XD. ALSO, AI TO MAKOTO, a manga from the 70s is soooooooo good. It deserves so much more attention. I didn't cry for that but I just love the female lead so much... then again, I often prefer male leads cuz the girls are often quite weak.

          
 
       Helpful I'm a big fan of this anime series, and have read the manga, so I know what happens throughout these four episodes. On one hand I'm happy to be able to continue this series, but on the other I'm not sure how this will span out considering in the manga it is the part of this series that is the most romance filled , and so spreading it through only 4 half an hour episodes may feel rushed. Hopefully not. 
 
Although, the story that comes along with this is really fun and sweet to watch, especially if you've watched the past episodes in the first and second seasons that build up to this part and builds the relationship. Which is what I think is the most enjoyable aspect of this anime; it doesn't rush. Which is why I am worried for this due to it being condensed into 4 parts. 
 
In this you learn more about the relationship with Yukiji and Tomoe, as well as Tomoe's past. It also answers some questions from past episodes, such as the eye that was in Nanami's stomach and how/why it got there. 
 
Still, I would recommend it to anyone for obvious reasons.

","It took me a really long time to sit down and actually get into watching this show. It feels a bit like a traditional gag/romance anime, with the caveat being something pretty typical: a focus on angels and gods. What's different about it, and thus attention-capturing, is that the son of god has to come down on earth and learn to appreciate humanity, as a bit of a trial. 
 
The love-triangle is a bit hard to get into, as it feels stilted and strained. The main character can also be quite frustrating! However, after several years of having seen only the first few episodes, I powered through the problems and really enjoyed the ending of this show. 
 
The cliches are going to be tiresome. The characters may get on your nerves at times. Still, if you enjoy the humor of the show, it *does* improve after the first few episodes. There are a few little arcs that break up the monotony, and even a couple cool plot twists that make this show worth the watch. Give it a shot if you like the whole romance schtick and simple entertainment.

          
 
       Helpful Now here's an unusual anime concept. 
 
I wasn't too sure what to expect from this series as the conecpt seemed a little unusual for an anime - the story not being about angels or gods dealing with humans, but rather the son of god learning what it means to be human. 
 
The show is well written and moves along at a nice pace. The story itself is quite intruiging, and the main characters develop quite well throughout the show.I especially enjoyed the fact that the show evolved to include darker themes towards the end 
 
The animation is of a very high standard, and the opening music is a very catchy rock/pop tune. 
 
Overall this is a nice series that develops the characters well. It gets a little dark towards the end of the series, but this is done very effectively. 
 
This is an enjoyable show to watch and I would recommend this to fans of Chrno Crusade, Ah! Megami-sama, Pita-ten, etc. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I wasn't expecting much from this series but what I got really surprised me. This seems like the complete opposite of something I would enjoy but it turned out to be very well thought out, cute and tender.  
 
 
Story 8 It does have a bit of a juvenile feel to it, but thats what an anime like this is supposed to be like. This series did not disappoint and did not lead off with a cliff hanger or unanswered questions. Though I would love to see a second season, this stands up on it's own just fine.  
 
Art-9 Not the typical style I usually like, the colors here are bright and unrealistic, but in a world like this it really works. Opening animation was great and while at the begining I was turned off to the character design as the series progressed I was able to just view them as another cute quirk of this anime.  
 
Sound- Op was great, ending was interesting. Voice acting was top notch. The character Meme has to be one of my favorite characters of all time, due mostly to her voice actor. The voices fit seamlessly into the animation. The male side character's voice is a tad annoying, but he is playing an annoying side character so even that worked.  
 
Characters-9 My only gripe was with the male lead, his character came off as incredibly selfish and you spent most of the anime thinking what a brat he was, or how could someone do that. While that may not have been the creators intention it didn't hinder the show too much, and by the end you grew to care so much about the other characters you didn't really notice.  
 
Tenko- Was amazing, the personality, the character design the voice acting fit together perfectly. I love that every time she gets flustered a little poof of halo smoke pops out of her head along with a little fart type noise.  
 
Meme- Just might be one of my favorite characters of all time.  
 
Misa- Proved herself to be quite essential to the plot and a valuable member of the family, I would be interested to learn more about her character since none of her personal life ever really gets discussed.  
 
Another great concept this anime had was the little people talking... thing.. Hard to describe but sort of like telekinesis, just with little minature pupets. Only the members of the family (and Tenko) have them, and it really brought alot to the show.  
 
With shows like this it can get a little crazy sometimes, random abilities constantly being introduced, a new concept in every episode etc. But that wasn't the case here, the writters clearly had a vision of what was, and what wasn't possible even in their world of the gods and they didn't stray much from the first episode, which makes it much more believable.  (Not that any of it is actually believable, but it wasn't one of the series where you roll your eyes at every episode) 
Enjoyment-8 it was rare that I sat at the end of my seat after an episode, but while watching them I certainly enjoyed it. I'm surprised this isn't a much more popular anime. A few times the characters seemed to be traveling down their road and you're waiting to see where they end up, when boom random sub plot kicks in, the sub plots weren't bad and while for the most part I can see why they were included, weren't really needed.  
 
Overall 8- As far as cutsie animes go, this is one of the best I've seen. I highly recommend this to fans of the lighter side of anime.

","Ok my friends, it is time for a very rare time I give a glowing review on a remarkable anime work. This time I set out on Shuffle!, one of the many recommendations I got from other users as far as harems and supernatural types of anime goes. And I must say, I was blown away by some of the plot points and twists that went with them. I got jerked around back and forth so many times in all the right ways with what was going to happen next and who it would happen too. This anime is not just a comedy, my dear readers. It is a veritable plethora of so many blended elements that begins as a run of the mill until you get engrossed by around episode 3. When things took off I was completely glued to the story. I felt for the characters, and I saw how a kindhearted person could be in a number of situations yet remain a good natured, helpful individual. I refuse to spoil as many parts of this show as I can and will be short here. WATCH THIS SHOW! it is as simple as that. Like I said, I had no idea how things were going to turn out, but I totally wish it would have taken longer to get there because I wanted to see so much more. This show just was not long enough for me. I liked it so much that the time flew by on me. It will suck you in that well, and I will again say to you all, if you are a harem, drama, supernatural, comedy anime fan. This one needs to be in your library.

          
 
       Helpful Shuffle!... it's dark and light mixed together, and I don't just mean the worlds of the Demons and the Gods.  Shuffle is an absolutely fantastic, and highly susepenseful, harem anime that can easily compete as one of the best in its genre.  If you want the ""Overall Review,"" skip to the bottom.  Otherwise, stay tuned. 
 
STORY:  10/10  The story in Shuffle! is very good.  There are some plot twists that might leave some viewers scratching their heads, and the ending *spoiler alert* was quite the surprise, since it runs contrary to what one would expect from reading the official description of the show.  The story remains comical and lighthearted, with plenty of action throughout the first half of the season... however, at episode 12, things take a dark turn for the worst, and the show's true ability to evoke emotion in a viewer comes to life.  This dark and devastating emotional rollercoaster that follows is by far one of the most heart-wrenching I have ever experienced.... and the ending, so satisfying. 
 
ART:  9/10  There were few, if any places, where I could confidently say the art wasn't perfect in this anime.  Overall, I'm not going to dock it much in its rating! 
 
SOUND: 10/10  While it may seem that Sound Design doesn't really add much to an anime, the sound engineering in Shuffle! adds depth and perspective to an otherwise flat soundscape.  That, and the soundtrack is optimally timed with emotional interludes that precisely emphasize the emotions of the moment.  *Spoiler Alert*  You'll likely find yourself listening for one key song throughout the entire season, which is quite the cue for when something dramatic is about to happen. 
 
CHARACTERS: 10/10  While a stereotypical harem anime in almost every respect, I was pleased beyond measure to see that the male hero was not a loser or a pervert.  It was nice to see a guy whose ""knight in shining armor"" personality really added depth to the series.  As for the girls, enough said.... they were expertly, and perfectly, crafted. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10  To girls: don't watch this series without a tissue box handy, expect a lot of tears near the middle and end.  To guys: be prepared to cough up some ego/pride and shed a man tear.  Believe it or not, this series nearly made my eyes leak a couple times, and the ending gave me goosebumps.  Enjoyable, but one heck of an emotional battle throughout. 
 
 
OVERALL:  Why 10/10?  Shuffle! doesn't stereotype... it looks, sounds, and feels dramatic.  Everything about it draws you in, and the whirlpool of clashing emotions will keep you riveted to the end, which will either break your heart, or mend it... your choice.  My top favorite, and a top contender in its field.

          
 
       Helpful So let me just start off by saying, if you have just watched, say, clannad, this is a great anime to jump into, while im not usually a fan of harems the excellent story and character development made it easy to look past. Nearly every character introduced does serve a purpose, and while in the first bits of this anime you may feel as if it isnt anything special, they all start to grow on you, by the time the ending arc starts, you feel such compassion and love for the characters that you want everyone to be happy! The story itself doesnt really contain any filler episodes or anything of the sort, everything moves at a nice decent pace, though finding a good episode to stop after for the night it a real challenge! I do wish they had done a few more episodes myself, but that cant really be helped! Without giving anything away though, the end result actually had me a little surprised, be sure to see it all for yourself!

(Source: Wikipedia) ",['Fantasy'],none,"This is truly a francise than in Japan held a household name in the 1990's ova/ RPG boom and for GOD-BLOODY SAKE its not available on dvd ( maybe LCD), still to me a gem in the category of being an amethyst. 
This storyline is goe's further in detail about the purpose of wataru and got rid of the mecha's and using more magical powers and creatures, wich honestly stalled a bit in the previous 2 serie's, and replacing it by protecting a dragon but i think some of the change is for the better, i mean sometimes the formula loses its taste after so many seasons but THANK GOD no fillers, unlike a lot of 21 century anime,w ich some exceptions on late 80's ,90's long running t.v shows but not nearly as bad as todays anime. 
As for the art, the animation has been improved ofc since it was 1993, yeah just improved . 
What i like the most about the sound is the ED music soundtrack , ok i just watched this anime a while ago ( not 1993) but the music from that time i remember, and i couln'd stop dancing and you just figure out why :). 
Soooo happy st see the apperances of most of the previous serie's original charachters in all their glory, but i even was happier to see a new enemy on the scene and a strong , relentless one to say. 
The feeling of a adventure rpg anime is always going for a intense, but positive feeling and i am a fan of that , even to compare the anime to the videogame is a though behind for example Dragon quest, still to me its an anime that kids these days prob would have liked, u can watch it with almost ppl from all age's. 
Overall this is a good ( without the re-imagine serie's ) a very enjoyable closure of the serie's , but the problem in once again the availabillity and even if its sold u can count spending an easy 250-325 Euro on the boxset serie's  since its japan import, on this case its just with pain in my heart to say its better to download this.

(Source: ANN)","['Demons', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Supernatural']",none,"Frankly, as I haven't done much research, I have no idea how this is related to Shingeki no Bahamut besides it being related to Cygames and the fact the end of episode one shows a picture of Favaro and Kaisar. In my opinion, everything from the (main) characters (whom are polar opposites) to the story line (which there is no story) is a completely different feel from Bahamut besides maybe the art. Though one could say that's what makes it unique. Unfortunately there's no real story and we never get anything exciting like peering into the royalty lives of either princess. There's definitely a lover's vibe between the two princesses throughout the show, though it stays PG13. I guess we'll leave that to the people of the doujinshi world. To me, Manaria Friends wasn't bad per se, but it wasn't amazing. If I were you, I wouldn't go into this expecting much out of it but to just watch it for fun. 
 
Who I'd recommend this to: anyone who wants a quick watch for a chill nonsensical slice of life with some magic in it. The show isn't very intense and is pretty lax throughout. There's some points in the show where they try to mislead you to make you think another way, but that's about it.

          
 
       Helpful In short, this anime brings nothing of substance and is just plain boring. Not sure why I see everyone else handing it out a perfect 10. 
 
We primarily follow along two characters named Grea and Anne, as they live in this somewhat generic fantasy world. Anne is a lonely princess, and Grea is a blushing dragon. They attend a school, and... I guess they go places together. Their relationship is either two friends just hanging out, or some sort of yuri bait. There has been no character progression anywhere as far as I can see, except for this paladin dude who is entrusted to protect the princess, who loves following her around, and nothing more. Sure this may just seem like your typical slice of life set in a fantasy world, but in all honesty, I don't experience a single enjoyable aspect in regards to any of these characters interactions/adventures. 
 
Direction wise, we are constantly given classical background music and some pretty shots. However, this pretty much makes up the whole show, and there are just so many of these shots that have characters and scenery with nothing going on in them, being standstill in attempt to make something look pretty and or meaningful. Again, classical music played in the background while little to nothing going on in the scene or moment automatically make it beautiful or a 10/10 for the OST.  There are also often many unnatural pauses between dialogue and scenes, making it painstakingly boring and just to make me ask the question, why? Perhaps it's seemingly trying to aim for something more than it's worth, but I don't see the value. 
 
Overall, this show is just filled with constant blushing and gasping from a dragon girl, and a non-existent plot that revolves more around some shots of scenery and characters going through things. I know I sound like I am repeating myself by this point, but there really isn't much more to add. In episode five, we are suddenly under attack by serious enemies, and then suddenly in episode six, we are just chilling at the beach. Even when an attempt to represent some sort of adventure or goal in the show, being that Anne has to help Grea in episode two, in the end, it renders useless and wastes time, just like the rest of the show does. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I really cant find any fault in this to be honest and seeing such a low rating for such an amazing anime is hard to take in. This is that one underrated show that didn't get the attention and praise it deserved and is definitely worth the watch. 
 
Story/Characters 10 
The story isn't really that intense or serious (atleast so far), since it revolves around the daily lives of the main characters, Grea and Anne, who experience different things as their friendship slowly deepens. The bond of friendship between Anne and Grea is just beautiful and so calming to watch that it'll turn your mood from good to bad in an instant. 
 
Art/Sound 10 
The Art is just outstanding , literally every scene is a feast for your eyes.The characters are designed flawlessly and the amount of detail to the background and the surroundings is just amazing. The colors are bright,stunning and perfectly suited to an anime related to magic. The sound is also amazing and it wouldn't be the same without the sound. The OST is so calming and relaxing and when its mixed together with the art everything gets even better. 
 
Overall 10 
I would definitely recommend watching this and i can say that this is and will be one of my favorite and most memorable shows for this season.

Under the guise of young mecha conceptor Ladios Sopp, he is compelled by an old friend, Dr Ballanche, to save his two latest Fatimas Lachesis and Clotho. And so began the stories of the Joker System, as well as Amaterasu's love for Lachesis.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","The Five Star Stories takes its name from the Joker Star Cluster where the stories take place. The star cluster is made up of four stars: Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern. The ""fifth star"" is a large comet named Stant that passes through that sector of space every 1,500 years pulling with it its own collection of orbiting planets.
In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the ""Super Empire"", controlled all 4 solar systems of the Joker Cluster. They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Cluster. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for ""Joker Calendar"" and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized.
The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered ""fatimas"" are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar heads that dominate the battlefields. Warfare between nations is commonplace and few still hope for peace.
Mortar heads are the combat mainstays of the Joker Universe. They are mecha which require superhuman reflexes and skill to control, and are therefore only utilized by headliners with Fatima copilots. Fatimas are humanoid creatures genetically engineered for a life of service on the battlefield. Fatimas are necessary copilots for mortar heads and mentally merge with the computer systems of these devastating machines to control weapons, communications and other vital processes. As such, Fatimas are designed to have computational skills rivaling any computer.
As of the 2013 May issue of Newtype, the setting of FSS has changed to fit the lore of Mamoru Nagano's 2012 film Gothicmade. MH (Mortar Headd) has been renamed GTM (GothicMade), while Fatimas have been renamed AF (Automatic Flowers).
","It's a beautiful show, with distinctive character designs and richly drawn backgrounds.  And the prettiest of pretty-boy main characters to boot.  And yet...  
   
The thing is, Five Star Stories is a very long-running and popular manga series.  In fact, so long running is that it started in 1986, and is still coming out three decades later.  It's a massive exercise in world building (or, rather in this case, multi-solar-system building), with a back-story that stretches past a thousand years, far too many characters to count, and intertwining machinations that would take hours to explain.  Think Dune.  Think Legend of Galactic Heroes.  It's a massive amount of material.   
   
And here, you have a single, one-hour OVA, to cover it all.  Or, to be more succinct, to introduce it all.     
   
An almost impossible task, and unfortunately it shows.  There's a ton of exposition that has to take place, all sorts of explaining of concepts and people, and it's a whole lot to take in at once.  You spend half the time just trying to suss out who is doing what and why, and it never really sinks in.     
   
I guess if this whets your appetite, this is to entice you to check out the manga.  Which, was probably half the intention of this one-shot OVA in the first place.

          
 
       Helpful The Five Star Stories is a notoriously complex and detailed manga by Nagano Mamoru, who also worked on L-Gaim, a mecha show that Yoshiyuki Tomino fans should be familiar with.  
 
 
The movie, however, had minimal involvement from Nagano, and only tells the story of the first 3 or so volumes of the manga or the first ""book"" released here in the U.S. and so by the end it feels like it has just set the stage for an epic, interstellar adventure filled with androids, robots, and androgynous gods. And that's it. That's where it stops. This could be seen as a major flaw, and it is, for those who don't ever plan on reading the manga. For those who have had the pleasure to experience the story on paper though, this movie is a great visual treat. The story we get to see is nothing but an introduction, so it does feel a bit weak, even if there is an action packed climax at the end. 
 
 
The art style gives away the era it is from quite easily, and will invoke nostalgia in many veteran anime viewers, and possibly repulsion by those newer and more spoiled. The mech design, though barely seen here is fantastic. I can't stress enough how amazing Nagano's mechanical designs are. If you can get this movie in 1080p, DO IT! 
 
 
The music from what I remember was great, the notes that bombard your ears as soon as the title screen shows up is very fitting for the type of story this is. The theme played in the credits is catchy and again, very nostalgic for its era. 
 
The characters are all great, and I love them. But this is from the perspective of one who has read the manga. You don't get to really see their full potential here, but there are some glimpses of what they may become.  
 
 
This movie is just fun to watch, I wouldn't say it's the pinnacle of cel animation, I'd shift more towards ""Do You Remember Love?"" for that, but this is definitely up there. For those interested in this series, I recommend this movie as an introduction, then the manga as a followup. Grab yourself every artbook you can find, I know there's gigabytes of material out there, they're all worth it, Nagano is fantastic. 
 
 
Any fan of mecha, especially of the fantastic variety (Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Dunbine) should look into this series. You won't regret it. 


          
 
       Helpful If you're into sci-fi/mecha-related anime from the 80s chances are you are aware of the existence of Five Star Stories and you're probably wondering whether to watch it or not.  
 
This will be a fairly short review wherewith I will try to answer this question. For those of you who don't have time nor patience to read the full review, here's a short answer: no, just don't. For the rest of you, here's why you should avoid this anime and save 1 hour of your life that can be spent in so many better ways. 
 
There isn't much to say, actually. The story is a complete mess: a weak and rushed plot that explains almost nothing (and the few things that are explained are confused and not well developed) is a bad thing on its own, but if you add no character development at all... well, you have a bad anime. And that's what it is: not horrible, not trash, it's just a bad anime that isn't worh to be watched. 
 
Interesting mecha and ship design and decent animation aren't enough to save it from a 4 out of 10, and the character design is weird. This anime offers no enjoyment so don't even bother and just ignore it.

Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber. 
They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable.

","I deeply regret that I paused watching this series for some time and ended up re-watching from the beginning. It kinda ruins the fun IMO. If only I weren't that picky in the past while trying to watch an anime without romance tag...   
 
Story; 
 
A pair of NEETs with some serious mental performance was brought by ""god"" from another world just for the sake of watching them owning every game/challenges. From there, they challenged or were challenged by some opponents with variety of games with some serious bet and met a certain character which leads them to more high risk games involving country stuffs. 
 
Its pretty cool though since they show you the game rules, its loopholes and how they managed to overcome it and every time they explained how those pair of NEETs won, it gives you like a feeling of 'wow, these two are f*ckin' genius' and surely it made me wanting to watch more. Kinda addicted. 
 
The story progresses pretty well, it shows those NEETs owning every single crazy challenges until to the level of ""ruling the country"" thingy. Some dirty jokes and fanservice to be expected with an ecchi tag, I don't think there any serious romance but only some little bits of incest lovey-dovey stuff. It doesn't overdone it or ruin the show IMO. 
 
As a dumbass dude, sometimes I just can't understand the game rules or how it works, but for some reason every time they win, It'll just give me a feeling of satisfaction LOL. But don't worry, you'll at least get a rough idea after all while they're playing throughout the game. 
 
Art: 
 
I don't know if this is only me or the anime itself, but it has this overbright effect and personally I kinda disliked it. I watched the HD version of it on my laptop and I can't imagine watching it in lower resolutions. IDK man, probably my laptop screen is crap cause when I watch it on my mobile phone (it has an IPS display) it was way better. 
 
Anyways, it looks colorful, character designs are okay combined with all of the background scenery stuffs.

Those reverb kicks effects really gave the game scene show a lot more punch LOL. OP was okay, I liked the ED a lot more personally. I don't find anything wrong with the character voices so far...  
 
Character: 
 
I think these pair of NEETs are way OP. Well I don't really like when the main character is losing so... 
 
But yeah, those two were OP like, its really amazing how they could predict every single outcome and solutions to it and their explanation goes like  'we knew this and that so we did that and this which ends up you reacting to this and you lost, I won'. 
 
As the story goes by, you'll be introduced to some powerful opponents too. The way it presents its opponents are pretty interesting. It shows that those opponents are quite skilled and will left you thinking, 'can those pair of NEETs really win???!!! I NEED TO KNOW!!!'. It isn't just some character where you know he's a bad guy after noticing some of his appearance or attitude. I really liked that presentation style.

A 2014 anime. Wow. Really glad that I was finally able to finish this. Loved this series a lot. It managed to keep my ass on the seat and watch every episode till the end and still wanting to continue for more. Looking foward to watch its next sequel! 
 
Overall: 
 
This is a good series. Although I personally disliked the overbright effect, it didn't stop me from dropping this series. Just be sure watch on a proper screen!  
 
What to expect from this anime 
- Bits of fanservice, dirty jokes (not much, tolerable) 
- Pretty good comedy scenes after an intense battle moments  
- OP main characters. No worries till the ending! 
- The way its opponent losing isn't that really depressing (Its a game world, have fun!) 
- Kinda unpredictable sometimes 
- Games and their rules, explained everything from A to Z, along with their loopholes. You get to see how the opponent counter attack sometimes.

A mediocre isekai anime where the opponents use besides magic, their minds and try to challenge the world itself where they are summoned to.  
 
Well, I'm not really impressed about this anime. I thought it would have something peculiar about it. But somehow is an anime that can be watched. 
 
Art is a little bother. Mediocre and even sub-par. They tried to use colors to give the vibe of a virtual reality or something like that. I found it pretty distasteful.  
 
Sound was good.  Not something really interesting. But it had synth. Synth gives it a 10. That and Unexpected fanservice.  That is what fanservice should be about. You'll know what I mean if you are a fan of Ace Attourney. 
 
Plot device like is similar to Death Note. So if you are a fan of Death Note I guess you should watch this.

---Story--- (3/10) 
The anime hardly has munch of a story to it, although it is a rather unique story. It started out with potential but as the episodes progressed it got worse and completely wasted its potential. The story didn't seem to go anywhere or it was all over the place which made the show somewhat hard to follow as to what was going on. The episodes we also seemingly stretched out to where Sora and Shiro playing one game that lasted about 2 whole episodes and the game didn't even make sense in the end which was frustrating! (Those that have watched the anime probably know exactly what game I'm referring to in particular). Also a lot of the anime seemed is purely for fan service (this is probably the main reason that this anime has such a high rating), which keeps the story from properly progressing. 
 
---Art--- (9/10) 
The art is rather lovely with it's bright, various colors which adds depth to the scenery but sometimes the art is overdone and puts a bit of strain on the eye but otherwise it's great. 
 
---Sound--- (3/10) 
The openings and ending songs of No Game No Life is really good but other than that there isn't much else to say due to their not really being a lot of music paying during the anime itself; therefore, giving a pretty low score. It could have had music during some of the games. 
 
---Characters--- (2/10) 
The characters in No Game No Life are very underdeveloped and have no depth to them and are used mostly for fan sevice. Stephanie doesn't even really serve a purpose within the anime despite her being a main character she is there just to be made fun of by everyone calling her a moron and she is basically used for fan service and nothing more. Jibril is, like Stephanie, a remotely useless character that is also yet again used mostly for fan service and is also underdeveloped character. Shiro is somewhat more developed but still doesn't show any significant character change which is a HUGE part of character development but she was, like almost all of the female characters, was used for fan service and remind you she is only 11! Shiro also seems to have a disturbing and perverse relationship with her brother, Sora. Zell had yet again a somewhat useless role, although she did serve a bigger role and more character development than Stephanie and Jibril, but she did serve the role of competing against Sora and Shiro in one of the games. She did have her thoughts and feelings expressed which was an improvement from Stephanie and Jibril. Sora on the other hand had a bit more character development than all of the characters and is an at least decent character. 
 
---Enjoyment--- (5/10) 
Despite the problems with the anime the show was somewhat enjoyable. The show was somewhat entertaining and funny which was a somewhat redeeming quality. However, it did no fully compensate for the problems within the anime. Due to the fact that the episodes seemed long, stretched out, and sometimes pointless along with it being hard to follow at times as to what was going on, I wasn't able to properly enjoy this anime to its full extent. 
 
---Overall Score--- (4.4/10) 
This show was rather disappointing and quite appalling as to how flawed it was. There seems to be more fan service than actual story which is saddening to say the least, along with underdeveloped and pointless characters. This anime was a waste of time to watch and one I wouldn't recommend to watch. I hope this helps other people see for themselves how bad this anime actually is and that this gets rated lower.

Enter Beerus, the God of Destruction. Having awoken from his slumber, Beerus seeks to find an opponent worthy of challenging his power. After being shocked to learn that Frieza has been defeated by a Saiyan, Beerus sets out to analyze the legend of the Super Saiyan God in order to find his ultimate opponent. His destination: Earth, home to the few survivors of the Saiyan race. And if a Super Saiyan God is not there, the Earth's destruction will just have to do as entertainment. 
 
How will Gokuu and friends fare against a god that is even feared among the other gods?","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen', 'Super Power']","Beerus, the God of Destruction, is woken from a lengthy slumber by his attendant Whis. While reviewing the current state of the universe, he is surprised to learn that Frieza was defeated by a Saiyan named Goku. He recalls that thirty-nine years prior, the Oracle Fish foretold that a mighty opponent would appear before Beerus called the Super Saiyan God. Intrigued by the potential challenge, Beerus then tracks Goku to King Kai's planet. Goku excitedly challenges Beerus to a fight and despite powering up to Super Saiyan 3, is effortlessly defeated. Disappointed, Beerus departs in order to seek out the other Saiyans.
On Earth, Bulma's birthday party is interrupted by Beerus' arrival. Vegeta, aware of the might of the God of Destruction, casts his pride aside in order to appease him, who along with Whis, soon both develop a curiosity for Earth's cuisine. While the party is ongoing, the Pilaf Gang attempts (and fails) to infiltrate the party to steal the magical Dragon Balls, and accidentally shoots Videl while making a scene. While Dende is healing her, he learns that Videl is pregnant with Gohan's child. As the celebration continues, Beerus is soon provoked by Buu who refuses to share any pudding. Beerus attacks Buu and decides to destroy the Earth when Android 18, Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Gohan attempt to fight Beerus but are all swiftly defeated. Vegeta reluctantly tries his hand at fighting Beerus as does Goten and Trunks, who fuse into Gotenks, but they both are beaten as well. Bulma becomes upset at the fighting ruining her party and scolds Beerus before slapping him. When Beerus hits her back, Vegeta, already in ""Super Saiyan 2"" form, is sent into fit of rage and despite faring the best in combat against Beerus of anyone thus far, is still defeated.
As Beerus prepares to obliterate the planet, Goku arrives and asks Beerus for more time to learn about the Super Saiyan God. Using the Dragon Balls, he summons Shenron and the eternal dragon reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the form. Thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and Videl's unborn child channeling their energy together, Goku ascends to the level of Super Saiyan God. He confronts Beerus and they engage in an intense battle. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its apparent time limit. However, he acquires the form's godlike feeling which allows him to retain some of the power in his fight against Beerus who eventually decides to use a massive energy attack to truly put Goku to the test. Goku struggles to stop the energy sphere but after he laments on the potential deaths of his loved ones, he is able to absorb the attack and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. He recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns that there are other universes with other Gods of Destruction as well. Beerus decides to spare the Earth by only destroying a small rock (thus technically keeping his word), and he and Whis bid farewell as they depart back to their home world.

This was the first new source material (is that the proper term?) in 17 years! 17 YEARS! I can't believe it was that long since Dragon Ball Z first began, until I saw the first poster for this movie. I was SOOOO HYPED! And did I get what I wanted? Does this movie do the series of Dragon Ball Z justice? Yes. 
 
Kami to Kami is a nice breath of fresh air for fans of classical Dragon Ball Z, because it expands upon the universe, brings in brand new characters, and does it great! This movie may not be the greatest Dragon Ball Z movie, but it's up there. The reason I liked this movie is because it was just so nice to see Goku and the gang back again, going up against a new threat. And on top oof that, the art, the sound, the direction, and the story are great.  
 
Now for the real question: Do I recommend this movie? Yes. If your a fan of Dragon Ball Z, then yes. For non-fans of Dragon Ball Z, I MIGHT recommend this movie. Why? You MIGHT not understand anything, but the movie does do a good job of welcoming new people as well, so maybe!

       Helpful Dragon Ball Z is Back! I was so excited to see this movie and it didn't disappoint. Not like that other piece of shit Dragon Ball: Evolution which will go down as the absolute worst piece of cinema I have ever seen in my life. But I'm not here to talk about that I'm here to review Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami a.k.a. Battle of Gods. 
 
The overall story is that Lord Beerus and his master Whis travel to Earth in order to find the Super Saiyan God for him to fight. After hearing that Frieza was defeated by Goku he decides to locate him and challenge him to a fight. After kicking Goku's ass in their first encounter Beerus travels to Earth and arrives at Bulma's Birthday party and if he wasn't amused about with the Earth's culture, people, food, etc. he would destroy the planet. Vegeta then tries to make sure Beerus was happy, so he could make sure that the Earth doesn't get destroyed. However, after Buu wouldn't share his pudding with Beerus, he throws a tantrum and starts a brawl with the Z-fighters. Goku arrives and later summons Shenron, who is also scared of Beerus, and tells Goku that a Super Saiyan God does exist and how to become one. After his transformation he and Beerus battle to decide if Beerus will destroy the Earth or not. 
 
One major thing about this movie is that it is hands down the funniest DBZ movie I have ever seen. I mean there are so many funny moments in this movie. In addition there is kind of a breaking the forth wall joke in the beginning of the movie that got the whole theater laughing. The problem I had with this movie is how Goku becomes a Super Saiyan God. It was strange how someone becomes one, but it's even more strange on what they needed to turn Goku into a Super Saiyan God. Another, problem was Super Saiyan God itself. It just looks like a Kaio-ken. Even though it looks awesome with the reddish gold aura around him it wasn't that impressive of a design. 
 
The art is outstanding. This was something I wanted to see and see how the fight scenes were going to play out with the updated animation. And my god is its amazing. Now this is a double-edged sword because even though the animation was beautiful it was a little unusual to watch because the animation was so much different then what I remembered as a kid. 
 
The voice acting, as expected, was awesome. I mean come on it's Funimation and all the voices I remembered as a kid. However, got to give major praise to Manica Rial who wasn't the original voice of Bulma, but she did such a superb job that I didn't even recognize it. 
 
The characters are basically the same. The one I want to talk about is Lord Beerus. His design is like an Egyptian cat which was a good design seeing that cats were considered gods back in ancient Egypt. He is incredible powerful, but still not as strong as Whis. Not to mention he has the title of ""The God of Destruction"". Beerus acts like a spoiled child, but acts like a gentlemen at the same time giving him a likable personality. 
 
Overall this movie was a blast. It was funny, it had action, it had badass characters... It's Dragon Ball Z. What else it there to say. If you can find this movie in the DVD section of a store I recommend you buy it. Not only that it was just a delight to finally have a new DBZ movie be released. Did it have it problems, Yes, but it's still DBZ being DBZ and it will always be awesome.

          
 
       Helpful tho has some slow moments but its worth the waiting for the final battle against berrus and goku animation was spectacular and battle was intense but slow moments where fun to especially if you like characters like vegeta bulma whis berrus and some secondary characters get some light to and have some entertainig moment's especially when vegeta prince of the sayjans starts to dance bingo dance but it was strange how the main battel was set up berrus got angry and wanted to destroy earth just becouse buu didn't give him pudding so yeah but after all its db it can be serious sometimes but its mostly comedic and entertaining so in conclusion  it  was the movie that showed that db can continue in modern day.if you are fan of the db go see it for the new comers to db it may be a little complicated because they will not know a big quantity of characters but they can still enjoy this one

It is one of the best animes out their in my opinion. This anime is a shorter anime with under 60 episodes long and it kept my leaning at the edge of seat. The story starts with a necessary build to introduce the deathnote, but never makes it too slow to get bored of the show. Then it starts getting interesting when they investigate how so many people are dying and why. From this moment on it is pretty much a game of chess between the two main characters which gets intense pretty quick. From there in the story untill the end of the show it keeps its high intensity. The characters in this show are relatable to real life people and what actions they would do which makes it such a great anime.Hopes you guys love it as much as I did.

       Helpful I just finished watching Death Note last night, and I just had to write a review for the series. 
 
After my friend spending months trying to get me to watch Death note, I decided, ""what the hay, I might as well give it a try."" From the very first episode I was hooked. 
 
Story: I like the story a lot. I thought it was pretty original compared to a lot of anime's I've seen where the plot is recycled. If you don't know already, the Death Note is a notebook in which whose ever name is written down in it will die. Him or her will die in 40 seconds if the writer doesn't specify when they will die. If the cause of death is not written, then the person written down in the note will die of a heart attack. It's not that simple. For a person to die, you need to know their name and their face for the death to take place. These notebooks are in the world of the Shinigami, or death Gods, if you will, and the shinigami only use them to lengthen their lives by taking away from the humans lives. Well what happens when the notebook is dropped onto earth and the power of the Death Note is passed onto a human? Lets just say calamity ensues.  
 
Pick your own definition of justice. Light or L. 
 
Characters: I absolutely loved the characters in Death Note. Although I wasn't on their sides most of the time, (mainly Light) I still liked the character development as well as the character design. L and Light are very intellectual and mysterious in someways; it adds to the story. There are many times throughout the series where you think, ""Nuh-uh, how the hell did he think of that?"" Basically they're not very predictable. 
 
I adored the first theme song; I think it's called ""the world"" by nightmare. I thought it went perfectly with the series and it truly did get me amped up to watch the show. I never skipped the theme song, even when I watched many episodes in one sitting. The second theme song was a little to creepy in my opinion. It made everything seem all dark and demonic, although you can argue that it fits in with DN too. I wouldn't disagree, it just wasn't my taste. 
 
There are moments in Death Note where you're just thinking, "".... Seriously? Why did they even do that?"" - useless moments that don't add or subtract from the storyline. Death note hits a boring patch for a bit. Well, I mean it still is kind of interesting, but the episodes beforehand were more alluring. But trust me, it does get out of the 'slump'. 
 
The thing I like about this series is that they did things that deliberately pissed off fans of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything, but they did the unthinkable in certain cases, and it just added onto the overall effect of the show and made it seem more real, so to speak. 
 
The overall enjoyment of this show was high, and I would highly recommend it to people who haven't seen the series. Even if you're a Rom/com junkie like I ;) Death Note is still a good investment. Only will take 37x23m to watch ;D

Meanwhile, dhampir Donovan Baine seeks to rid himself of the cursed blood which runs through his veins.
Four of the original Darkstalkers, Anakaris, Rikuo, Sasquatch and Victor, were featured in the intro but not in the OVA's main storyline, apparently having been killed by Pyron in a flashback sequence shown in the beginning of the fourth episode.
","The first time I discovered this anime I was excited. The main reason is because it had Morrigan Aensland on the picture, and I really like her on Marvel Vs. Capcom (the game). Also it have only 4 episodes, which is great for me (I really hate long animes. I'm in pain with Naruto, 17/220). Of course, having only 4 episodes makes it an OVA, and as some people say, OVAs have better drawings. In this case it's true, the drawings are really god. The story too is great. It really caught my attention. 
I think in the end I could compare it to the Streeth Fighter series. It's not that kind of regular anime we have at bunchs. Even the animation looks different, like with some american influences (very similar to Street Fighter II). The characters are serious, you won't find any jokes or comedy like most of animes have. And it's a great profit. 
If you're expecting a serious, short anime, with a good story then I recommend it.

       Helpful In the three years I've been one this site, my early reviews were focused on video game-based anime or manga (of the fighting genre). I'm not sure why, it just happened, but I've praised the good (Fatal Fury 2), ranted about the bad (Battle Arena Toshinden), and speculated the disappointing (Street Fighter 2 V). Now I tackle the average.....The absolute average. 
 It's apalling as to how middle-of-the-road Night Warriors actually is without being flat out awful. Back when Manga Entertainment first announced this in 1998, I was stoked. I played Darkstalker's Revenge religulously on the Sega Saturn and was certain that this game could surpass Street Fighter on a gameglay level. So when I got my hands on volume 1 of the Night Warriors anime, I was blown away immediately by the visuals. As far as video game anime, this looks the very best, even by today's standards. The dark, moody atmosphere, the shading and black levels, all the characters look phenominally detailed. The animation is crisp and fluid, characters like Morrigan and Demitri striking familiar poses from the game. The fights are pretty top notch as well. But that's about it.  
 For as great as a title can look, if you can't follow it with a credible story or engaging characters, you're just going to have something you can't possibly sink your teeth into. For as straightforward a plot that this show has, almost 78% of it's 4 episodes is devoted to waxing philosophical or fake political jargon amongst the Dark Ones and humans. There is a lot of dialouge in this, and most of it is nauseatingly dull and uninteresting. You'll find yourself wishing for a fight to break out (since this is based on a FIGHTING game), but even the action is rather lackluster. Each episode is roughly 40 minutes and at least 2 major action scenes will take place. And 1 of the two major scenes will involve 2 characters from the game battling each other to a stalemate. I am not exaggerating this. Instead of Anakaris the phaeroh versus Rikuo the fish man or Sasquatch the yeti versus Victor, Frankenstein's monster (these character's aren't even featured in the damn thing, btw), you get to witness Donovan fighting faceless thugs, Hsien Ko fighting faceless thugs, and Lord Raptor fighting......faceless thugs. Even Art of Fighting had characters from it's respective game squaring off with each other!! Watching one person lay waste to generic foot soldiers gets old very fast, and it usually leads to nothing.  
 The show is only focused on four characters (Donovan, Demitri, Hsien Ko/Lei Lei, and Morrigan) and two villains (Alien Pyron and the Huitzil robots). But at no point throughout these episodes are you given a slight reason to actually care about their journey or what happens to any of them. It seems more like they want to defeat Pyron because the plot says so as opposed to some dire cause that was put in to motion by the bad guy. You know, almost ANYTHING WOULD WORK!!!!!!!!  The four ""good guys"" are all boring as all hell, a bridge game would spice up the tension. I've never taken Pyron seriously as a villain, other characters like Felicia, Bishamon, and John Talbain are virtually wasted as mere cameos. Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture at least had a three act story. In Night Warriors, things are just happening for almost no explained reason as you just move on to the next scene. Aside from the brief bout between Demtiri and Morrigan way back in episode one, there is no other point that I can recall where anything picks up. Keep in mind, I think this is AVERAGE. *Sigh* At least the voice acting and the music are pretty good. 
 IN CLOSING: Much like the terrible Tomb Raider movies with Angelina Jolie that ruined that franchise, I can only assume that this lackadasical anime offering was a death knell for Darkstalkers as very little has been heard from since. While it isn't as completely bad as most fighting game anime, boring characters, a sleep-inducing story, and a bad script makes Night Warriors such a yawn fest that it's no surprise they introduced a Little Red Riding Hood with machine guns to liven things up. You can make Morrigan and Felicia as curvy and revealing as you want and create Lilith to appeal to lolita fetishes, but Darkstalkers could never recover from this lame endeavor and will always be Street Fighter's whipping boy.

       Helpful Overall/Enjoyment: 
Most games never survive the transition to another medium. They are usually universally terrible and this would be the first adaptation I've seen that I liked. I was surprised when within the first few minutes of watching I thought &quot;hey, this doesn't completely suck...&quot; By the end I had concluded &quot;yeah, that wasn't bad&quot;. I'm not a huge Darkstalkers fan, but I played enough of it to think &quot;ehhh, what the hell, why not?&quot; I think even if I wasn't vaguely familiar with the characters I would've still enjoyed this. I watched all 4 eps in a row fairly painlessly and could've easily watched more (see Characters below). 
 
Story: 
Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a show for people who like shows about fighting. If you don't like fighting games or shows like DBZ or Yu Yu Hakusho or Kenshin or even Bleach/Naruto then... I have no idea why you are even reading this. Otherwise I thought the story was about as good as anyone could expect for a show about a fighting game. To try to criticize the story beyond that misses the point and does a disservice to its accomplishment.  
 
There's a lot of repetitive use of the word &quot;dark&quot; (you could make a deadly drinking game out of it) and the general setup is fairly generic, BUT, the OTT plot is perfectly suited for the show, considering fighting games are OTT by design. I've seen much worse excuses to get characters to come together to beat each other up. 
 
In fact, I thought the premise that ties them together was actually pretty good as far as these kind of shows go. They actually make some kind of effort to explain the presence of &quot;the dark&quot; and make interesting use of what would otherwise be a cliche mix of &quot;something from space&quot;, &quot;an ancient race&quot;, and &quot;something from another dimension&quot;. Which was already a lot more than I was expecting. 
 
I actually liked that it kept itself kind of serious (I'm tired of anime with goofy/wacky sight gags and comic relief). It gave it a dramatic feel but not so much that it lost sight of being an anime about people fighting. 
 
I really liked how they centered the story around Donovan/Anita. They could've gone many ways with this: It could've been another ambitious story about an overpowered vampire and his quest for domination or some trumped up tournament to see who is the worlds strongest. I feel their choice in a &quot;protagonist&quot; was probably the best one they could've made of all the characters available. Sure the &quot;half-demon&quot; thing is overused, but in a world where humanity is being devoured by darkness, something about the virtue of a man who is constantly at war with his (literally) inner demon and the traumatized little girl he has vowed to protect just seemed right. 
 
The ending was a little disappointing, mostly because I think it crossed that line of cliche over-the-topness, but eh, I've also seen much worse and more frustrating endings, so... 
 
Characters: 
The characters have some questionable dialogue sometimes, but otherwise I thought it was surprisingly solid if not pretty good. Again, experience had me already expecting much worse. I thought they captured the characters unique personalities pretty well and didn't go too overboard with any of them. I thought they did a good job with introducing Donovan, Anita, Demitri, Morrigan, Huitzel, Pyron and the sisters. Felicia, Talbain and Bishamon showed promise. Lord Raptor was pretty much just an odd cameo, so aside from him, I liked how they were handling use of the characters and not just rushing/stuffing everyone into the story in some contrived and insipid manner. For this reason I actually felt the story was too short. I would've liked to have seen this as a series and see them try to include all the characters and somehow tie them into the epic confrontation with Pyron. 
 
Art: 
I actually didn't think the art was that great for an OVA. I did like how they didn't get overly retarded with the designs and stayed mostly faithful to the game (both in characters and combat). So for that it still ranks high with me. 
 
Sound: 
The sound was fine, more surprisingly however was that the dub didn't make me want to gag. Considering how cheesy and potentially disastrous the dialogue probably was, I thought they delivered it well. I assume the dialogue was cheesy only because I've watched enough fighting anime to tune out all but the worst of hammy speeches.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","Nanami Momozono dreams of living an average school life just like any other high school girl does. Instead, she must cope with the fact that her father, who is a constant gambler, has accumulated a bunch of gambling debts in her name. As she can't afford to pay the rent, she gets kicked out of her apartment by the debt collectors and is now homeless. Despite this unfortunate turn of events, she still maintains a kind heart.
While sitting on a park bench collecting her thoughts, Nanami meets a strange man hanging from a tree because he is being chased by a dog. After saving him from the dog, she learns that the man's name is Mikage. Upon learning about Nanami's current situation, in a perfect example of how good deeds are rewarded, he gives her his home as a token of his gratitude. She accepts the offer because she is homeless. When Nanami arrives at Mikage's home, she is shocked to see that it is not a normal home but a shrine for worship. After being greeted by Onikiri and Kotetsu, who are the keepers of the shrine, she meets Tomoe, Mikage's familiar, and she learns that Mikage used to be the Land God of the shrine and has bestowed upon her his mark on her forehead so that she may be the new God. At first, Nanami is reluctant, but as she lives with Tomoe, Onikiri, and Kotetsu she begins to understand and works hard in her new position as the Land God. As the story progresses Nanami finds herself falling in love with Tomoe, but he rejects her because the love between a human and a yokai is taboo. Despite saying that, Tomoe finds himself falling in love with her too.
","Kamisama Hajimemashita, or Kamisama Kiss is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Julietta Suzuki and serialized by Hakusensha in the shoujo manga magazine called ‘Hana to Yume.’ An anime television series adaptation of Kamisama Kiss was produced by ‘TMS Entertainment’ and directed by Akitaro Daichi (Fruits Basket, Kaleido Star). It began airing on October 1, 2012. There are also two OVA episodes, which first aired on August 26, 2013, bundled with the 16th volume of the manga. One of the included episodes is based on the story from the 15th volume, while the other contains an all-new original story. The 17th issue of Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine announced on August 2014 that the manga series inspired a second anime season, which began airing on January 5, 2015. 
 
Momozono Nanami is only 17 years old, but she has never felt lucky. She has quite an average academic progress and boys do not think that she is cute. She would love to fix her school problems and spare more time for the girls’ stuff, but she cannot do that, since her father is a big gambler, who always causes her daughter a ton of problems. Too bad, but her misfortune only continues: she is evicted from her apartment, because of her father’s debts.  
 
However, Nanami does not curse her misfortune. One day, she saves a good-looking young man in a park from a huge phobia he has; he is afraid of dogs. After a small talk, the young man listens to Nanami’s problems and offers her to live at his place, which he abandoned 20 years ago. In addition to this, he also kisses her on the forehead to express his gratitude. It turns out that Nanami is invited to live in a God’s shrine and that the young man that kissed her actually passed her the mark of the area’s deity. The unfortunate girl is no longer unfortunate, but her life has not gotten any easier, too. She now should take care of her academic progress, as well as of her deity’s duties.  
 
While Kamisama Kiss’ story-line does look generic, it still manages to show its uniqueness. The story-line does a great job explaining characters’ motives and their backstories, but the most important thing about it is, of course, the fact that it manages to keep the viewer interested. Kamikiss is a romantic comedy, however, sometimes it gets very dark and it also focuses on some philosophical topics. And after some time you will surely appreciate the fact that the creator of Kamikiss understands that watching a pure romantic comedy for two seasons is just boring and that she can also make you forget about the romance and to make you simply worry about the characters of Kamikiss. However, after 19 minutes of fear you hear the anime’s ending song and understand that it is all over.  
 
The visuals are not great, but there is nothing to complain about. Backgrounds are often gorgeous and the anime also pays attention to many important details. Sound wise, it is quite difficult to say if this anime should be watched in English, or in Japanese; they both are good, so feel free to watch it in whatever language you wish. The anime has also a very calming OST; whenever you hear the anime’s ending, it just warms your heart. 
 
Character wise, there are two main characters and also a big supporting characters cast. The first main character, she is voiced by Mimori Suzuko and Ballard Tia, is Nanami Momozono. She is a teenage girl, who is having quite a difficult life. She has quite an average academic progress and boys do not think that she is cute. She would love to fix her school problems and spare more time for the girls’ stuff, but she cannot do that, since her father is a big gambler, who always causes her daughter a ton of problems. Too bad, but her misfortune only continues: she is evicted from her apartment, because of her father’s debts. Thankfully, a young man listens to Nanami’s problems and offers her to live at his place, which he abandoned 20 years ago. In addition to this, he also kisses her on the forehead to express his gratitude. After some time, it turns out that Nanami is invited to live in a God’s shrine and that the young man that kissed her passed her the mark of the area’s deity, which changed her life a lot. The second main character is Tomoe, who is voiced by Tachibana Shinnosuke and Tatum John Michael. Tomoe is a fox yokai, who serves as the familiar of the land God Mikage. However, one day, Mikage leaves his shrine, leaving Tomoe alone. After 20 years, Mikage makes Nanami the new mistress of the shrine, and so it makes Tomoe her familiar now. At first, the fox youkai does not appreciate the fact that he now has a new master, who is just a schoolgirl and, of course, a human. However, because of something, he changes his opinion about Nanami and starts to care about her.  
 
That being said, both main characters receive good character development. Though, you will only find out more about Tomoe in the second season; it is not that important. I guess you will surely appreciate the fact that both main characters change as the anime progresses. You will also like the fact that there is a huge supporting characters cast, which will not make you feel bored.  
 
If you want to know my personal opinion on this anime, I would say that it is one of the best romance anime I have ever seen in my life. I am not a fan of that genre, and ‘ shoujo’ is definitely not my favorite genre. However, Kamikiss, somehow, won my interest. It manages to keep you interested, because it has a very misleading first episode, which will surely form a very wrong opinion on this anime. However, the more you watch it, the more you understand that this anime is not that simple. It tries to make you feel secure, but then it says ‘hey, you cannot feel relaxed yet, we have plenty of ways to make you worry about the characters.’ 
 
Overall, I cannot say that Kamisama Kiss is an absolute masterpiece. However, as a romance it did manage to keep me interested. I would not recommend this anime for someone, who does not like romance; just avoid this anime if you are not a fan of the genre. However, if you are a big sucker for a good romance anime, then you should definitively give this show a try; it will not disappoint you.

          
 
       Helpful Dear Fellow Otaku/ Anime lovers, :3 
 
If you guys are new to this anime and are trying to pick which anime you should watch next then watch this one!  
 
 
You get to see the story of Nanami and her familiars and how she always seems to have an effect on people without even knowing it. Tomoe is her first familiar ( a being who serves a master by a secret contracted made by the two individuals.) a wolf (I'm guessing) demon.... he served for the shrines long before Nanami takes over. After it's recent master passes the role over to her.  Tomoe seems to have the common dislike for humans for he thinks there are just weak beings and nothing else.  But soon Nanami starts to fall in love with him, and after a while, he starts to realize he loves her too.........

          
 
       Helpful Kamisama Hajimemashita or Kamisama Kiss was made over a decade ago, but that’s not enough to compensate for how cliche and typical it was. There have been several shows that feature a headstrong lead woman who believes if she tries to do her best, she can do anything; and in effect, other characters find themselves drawn to her. I guess the plot line was somewhat different - I mean, it’s not everyday that an ordinary high schooler is chosen to become a god out of whim. However, for something released after the likes of Kachou wa Maid-sama and Special A, it was just okay.  
 
Appeal for the series probably comes from the so-called forbidden master-servant affair; supernatural taboo making it all the more sweet. It could have been more enticing if the romance were less forced and the two actually had chemistry. What’s more is that the presumed charisma from the main character caused an unnecessary, nonsensical reverse harem. Many things that are unexplained are either attributed to the magic/other worldly powers or left up in the air. 
 
At the end, the anime can be described as, well, cute. Adorable, sure. Good, though, I’m not so certain.

12,2029,20,8.612218672,Story between god and human,Sirius no Densetsu,"Gods once lived on earth, and two siblings, Oceanus - God of Water, and Hyperia - Goddess of Fire, lived in peace and dearly loved each other. However, the God of Wind, Algaroc, become jealous of the pair's happiness, and spread lies and deceit between them until their hatred for each other brought about war.  
 
Finally, Algaroc was imprisoned by the King of Gods, but after that time, the brother and sister still despised each other, so the Children of Fire and Water forever remained apart. But, then Prince Syrius of the Water and Princess Malta of the Fire meet and fall in love. The love of Syrius and Malta may not be enough to surpass their parents' hatred. Whether they can stay together forever may be impossible  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","Long ago both Glaucus (named Oceanus in the English adaptation), the God of Water, and Themis (named Hyperia in the English adaptation), the Goddess of Fire, lived as one. However, Argon (named Algorac in the English adaptation), Lord of the Winds, grew jealous of Glaucus and Themis's love and turned them against one another by lying to each that the other was plotting to overthrow them. The war between Water and Fire began. After both sides were nearly destroyed, the highest god of them all intervened and struck down Argon, tearing loose his eye (the source of his power), and damned him to the deepest abyss of the oceans, entrusting the eye to Glaucus and keeping the seas calm. Themis at that same time created a Holy Flame near the sea that would, in her opinion, keep the seas calm so that her children of Fire would live forever and never be extinguished. From that point on, the two elemental siblings were forever parted to keep peace between them.
Years later, Prince Sirius (named Syrius in the English adaptation), the son of Glaucus, becomes heir to the Sea Kingdom and is given the Eye of Argon to protect. Princess Malta, the daughter of Themis, also becomes the new heir to the Fire Kingdom, being charged with guarding the Holy Flame at the edge of the sea each night until her sixteenth birthday, when she will become queen. As Sirius plays with his little brother Teak (named Bibble in the English adaptation), he wanders off into the forbidden waters of the Sea Kingdom. He follows a bright light which leads him above the surface of the water for the first time. There Sirius and Malta see each other for the first time. As Sirius climbs on to a rock to get a closer look, the flame burns brightly and forces Sirius back into the water where he falls unconscious. Teak finds him and rescues him from being pulled into the whirlpool where Argon is kept. As Sirius is made ruler of the Sea Kingdom, a jealous and bullying Japanese giant salamander named Mabuse (named Mugwug in the English adaptation), attempts to take the eye of Argon away from Sirius and get the creatures of the deep to make him the king of the sea, but Sirius deals with him easily and sends him flying.
Malta returns to the Holy Flame, accompanied by her friend Piale, but becomes agitated as she worries that the strange boy - or one of the monsters from the sea that her mother has warned her about - will appear. The next night Sirius returns to see her. They introduce themselves and after realizing they mean each other no harm, they begin to fall in love. Sirius tells her all about life under the sea, which Malta finds fascinating. As the sun begins to rise, however, Sirius must return to the sea, because the children of the water will die if they are touched by sunlight. They bid each other farewell until the next night and Malta gives him a kiss.
Sirius and Malta are extremely happy throughout the following day, which doesn't go unnoticed by Teak, Piale and Themis. As Sirius and Malta play in Malta's secret garden that night, Teak journeys through the forbidden waters and sees the two dancing with each other. Unfortunately, a group of gigantic, deadly jellyfish take the opportunity to attack the sea kingdom while Sirius is away. Sirius sees the calm waters turn rough and goes to fight, but it is too late. Teak, who was hurt by the jellyfish, lashes out at his brother and reveals he knew where he was. After asking Moelle (named Aristurtle in the English adaptation), the oldest and wisest sea turtle in the ocean, for some advice, Sirius is advised to forget about Malta. Malta is upset when Sirius doesn't return the following evening. Mabuse tries to convince Sirius that the burden of the Eye is too heavy and he will gladly take it from him, but Sirius refuses and instead decides to see Malta again. Mabuse, deducing that he is hiding something, follows him.
In the Fire Kingdom, Themis sees how sad her daughter is and reminds her that during an eclipse coming in five days, she will be the next Queen of the Fire Clan. Malta is heartbroken and begs her mother to let her keep taking care of the sacred flame, to which her mother refuses. Sirius returns that night much to Malta's happiness, but Piale catches them kissing and attacks Sirius. She flies off, heartbroken. Malta, beginning to realize they can never be together, performs a farewell dance for Sirius and throws herself into the Holy Flame. Refusing to believe what she says, Sirius jumps into the flame after her, but they fall out. Before they can both hit the surface of the water, they land on top of Moelle, who brings them safely back to shore. He now understands the love Sirius has for Malta. Moelle tells them the story of how water and fire no longer lived together as one, but when he's done, he sees Malta and Sirius embracing, surviving the amount of heat from the nearby flame. Moelle tells them there may be a way for them to stay together—it is rumored that somewhere in the heavens there is a star where fire and water live together. During the same eclipse where Malta is to be made queen, strange pink flowers of fire and water known as Klaesco blossoms (called Kalea flowers in the English adaptation), on Mobius Hill (called the Hill of Elysium in the English adaptation), burst into bloom and release white spores that fly up into the sky, making their way to that star.
Unfortunately, Mabuse overhears everything and after making himself known to the ""traitors"", swims off to tell King Glaucus. Moelle chases after him before he can tell Malta and Sirius where Mobius Hill is. To make matters worse, the Holy Flame, left unattended too long, goes out. Malta knows without the sacred flame, her mother will lose her youth and most likely kill Sirius for what he has done. As she sobs on his shoulder, Piale, who had been watching the whole time, promises to distract everyone while Malta and Sirius escape to Mobius Hill. Piale declares her love for Malta and becomes the Holy Flame herself. Themis and the Fire Children notice the change in the flame, however. When they fly down from the palace to see it, the Queen discovers Piale's sacrifice and sends the Fire Children to bring back Malta. They almost succeed in recapturing her but Sirius fights back until they are cornered by both Glaucus and Themis. They confront each other and force Malta and Sirius apart. Both of them imprison the two children as punishment for betraying their own kind and so they can not elope together.
Three small sprites free Malta and distract the guards so she may escape to Mobius Hill. Teak visits Sirius in prison and unsuccessfully tries to get him out. Malta wanders through a desert for days, encountering the strange creatures of Sand Riddle Hill who transport her to Mobius Hill for answering their riddle. Sirius keeps calling Malta's name, earning the sympathy of most of the creatures of the sea. Mabuse comes with a dangerous idea for Teak to get Sirius out—steal the eye of Argon and bring it to his prison. Once free he will attack and destroy most of the kingdom, allowing Sirius to escape. Teak doesn't like this plan but thinking he has no choice goes to tell Sirius, unaware of Mabuse's true intentions to finally take the eye for himself. Sirius refuses to hand over the eye, but when Teak says being king matters more to him than his fire child, Sirius tells him that he doesn't deserve to be king. He tells him to return the eye to Glaucus instead and tell him he was never worthy of being his heir, hoping perhaps Glaucus will let him go. On the way there, Teak is ambushed by Mabuse and his gang and he takes the eye for himself. Now declaring himself king, they drunkenly celebrate until Teak is able to escape and take back the eye.
Teak makes it to Glaucus' temple but the guards refuse to let him in, believing the eye is a fake. In anger, Teak heads to the forbidden waters to give the eye to Argon instead. After approaching the deadly chasm, Teak changes his mind and tries to return to Sirius, but the eye is overcome by Argon’s power and pulls Teak into the whirlpool. Argon is unleashed and he begins to destroy the ocean. The world above is affected as well; Malta is almost sucked into a maelstrom that forms below Mobius Hill. Glaucus battles with Argon and defeats him for good. Sirius escapes the dungeon before it collapses on him, and finds Teak, who is mortally wounded. Teak tells him to go to Malta before he dies. Meanwhile, on Mobius Hill, the eclipse begins and the Klaesco blossoms start to bloom. Malta tries to stop all of the spores from floating away but it is too late. Malta falls to the ground sobbing, believing Sirius had lied to her about returning. During the eclipse, Malta is transformed into the new Fire Queen.
Sirius desperately searches for Malta on land but falls off a cliff and loses his sight when he hits the ground. When he finally reaches Malta, the Fire Children present are astounded that the Water Child kept his promise. A heartbroken and haughty Malta tells him the flowers are gone and refuses to speak to him ever again. Sirius still calls out for her and runs to her as the eclipse ends. Malta begs him to go back but it is too late. The sunlight kills Sirius and Malta begins to weep over his body. The Fire Children and Themis watch as she mourns the loss of her love. She says that they will never be apart again, and carries him into the water, where she returns to her original form and at the same time, also dies. Themis is heartbroken when Glaucus appears out of the sea with their bodies. He reminds the world that fire and water were indeed once one, and sends Malta and Sirius up to the faraway heavens to let their love create that world once more. In an epilogue, Moelle appears saying that fire and water now live again in peace on this planet, but he passes on the story of Malta and Sirius, and how they now watch over the world from their own star in the night sky.
","I’m reluctant to categorize Sea Prince and the Fire Child as a children’s cartoon―seeing as the overarching theme of Windaria, an ADULT-ORIENTED animated film felt a little bit less bleak. This film was produced by Sanrio Films, which also created the infamously dark “children’s” cartoon―Ringing Bell; which had me scratching my head as an adult―I can’t even imagine what a child would decipher a film that teaches, “if someone slaughters your entire family―hunt them down to… ask them to be your mentor, and then kill more of your own kind!” I don’t know, it’s a kooky film! 
 
?	This story, in layman’s terms, is a mythical rendition of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, which, probably sounds really cool―until you see how the plot is handled. There are several stupid mishaps by characters that could have easily been avoided; but, apparently, every single character in this fantastical Grecian tale is mentally impaired―causing problem after problem to intensify the tragedy. 
 
?	The romance is weak, but I don’t fault the story for that. Romeo and Juliet only happens because two people happen to meet and because crazily infatuated with each other, nothing new there. Piale’s (a lesbian fire fairy) dedication to Malta (essentially Juliet) seems stronger than the breadth of their love and her role in the film, while important, is very fleeting. 
 
?	Many characters die over stupid things, like, “I’m going to do this really risky thing to try to help this person, even though it might end our entire civilization.” The main hero and heroine don’t help with the stupidity, seeing as they are both bequeathed with the greatest responsibilities in their kingdoms and they both aren’t able to even live up to these titles for ONE day; they literally sacrifice the lives of hundreds or thousands mythical sea or fire creatures to smooch! It’s infuriating. 
 
?	People think that they thirsty character motivations in School Days is irritating―this is stupendously worse. In fact, School Days has much better catharsis and morality than this idiocy. This movie teaches youngsters that if you toss your duties onto other people, sacrifice the innocent lives of your kingdom to have a forbidden love, make decisions that further ensue calamity, and die holding onto that “pure” love―it will reunite the elders of the kingdom, in lieu of your death, despite their reasons for quarreling being incredibly pithy as well. Seriously, if the kingdoms of fire and water were torn apart at the seams because of the Wind God throwing shade and gossiping―how is the death of the lovers supposed to having any lasting impact on the illusory amalgamation of the two kingdoms? 
 
?	Overall, despite the production values being gorgeous―the animation and character designs reminded me of Disney’s Fantasia―the story, characters, and ethos of the story are severely lacking; Ringing Bell was much better, although the morality was also skewed. I give it a 3/10. 


          
 
       Helpful The story is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet style with elemental gods instead of humans. This makes me have mixed feelings. While the story is so old and pretty much exactly what you would expect of the tale, I do like the gods a bit. Sadly, it was not enough to save the story as it felt bland in both voice acting and artwork. It just doesn’t pop at all and I felt myself becoming bored while watching it as there was no surprise, no special meaning behind any of it. 
 
The artwork is pretty beautiful but it is far from perfect. While the watercolors and special backgrounds pop, the characters seem to feel a little lack luster. The design of the characters feel like they are bland. Malta has only a small hint of wearing something although she is pretty much nude to a point and her limbs are just think sticks compared to her body with rather strange eyes that seem to be overly slanted. On the other hand, Sirius has thin limbs too but with rather clumpy looking ‘feet’ and hands. It makes me wish they were beautiful images like in the credits but sadly, they don’t fit the background at all. 
 
The voices… oh boy the voices… They have no feeling what so ever in their words and Malta’s voice is just overly high pitched. It’s a sad dub that makes me wish that I watched the Japanese version but the show was so bland to me that I don’t want to watch it again.

          
 
       Helpful Hey this is my second review for a show that hasn't gotten any recognition. 
 
Story-Well its the Romeo Juliet esque plot line with two sets of parents and or families in which despise each other. The introductory part of the story tells how the Water god and Fire god came into conflict.The sea prince is the son of the Water god at first he shows a trait for running away on his escapades. Conversingly the fire princess and or fire child is dutiful to her mother at first( guarding the flame etc..). After the two main characters encounter each other is less friendly with an exchange of verbose name calling, but this is due to their parents respectively portraying the other side in a pejorative manner. Then of course after several meetings the veneer that taught them to hate each other was reproved. Afterwards segments of conflict insue in whether they can coexist and love one another. 
 
Art-This show finished airing in the early 1980's. Don't expect pristine depictions of any scenery or setting. However the animation looked disney liked at times or similar to the style used by Ghibli films. For its epoch its quite well done and rarely are there any inconsistencies with the characters. 
 
Sound-The music is clandestine and classical, almost scintillating that it illustrates the relationship between the characters.It's quite profound with the calming effects and peacefulness gained with the two main characters together without interruption. 
 
Character-Sirius the sea prince is more akin the adventurous and disobient type.  He adjusted rather quickly with the fire society disproving of his relationship with Malta. Malta however is calculating, calm and obedient for the most part but she also has her curious nature. Sirius had a direct influence on her changing of character in developing to become less dependent or questioning. 
 
Enjoyment- The movie had its cheesy moments but that's what you should expect from Romeo and Juliet type romance. Childish and facile at times making it a proponent of disney themes but that doesn't trump the serious and poignant relationship that the main characters  have for each other. 
 
Overall-If you would like to diversify your list with an antiquated theme thats been done before but with different characterisations. The dosage of disney themes that this show ascribes to maybe be perilous to some. Overall a pretty good movie for its intended audience.

""Tenshu Monogatari"", the story of forbidden love between a goddess and a human, and ""Bakeneko"", the story of a mysterious cat monster with a vendetta against a certain family.  
","['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Fantasy']","
","When I started watching Ayakashi, I did not have any high hopes for it. Horror as a genre is not easy to pull off successfully. But Ayakashi was pretty good at what it does. It is not the kind of horror that scares you or disturbs you, but it does leave a strong impression on you. It is probably more reasonable to classsify it as an anthology of tragic dramas than a work of horror. All the stories are set in the classical Japanese period and they accurately portray the cruel and harsh conditions of that era. The horrifying elements are not that of the paranormal monsters but rather of the violence and cruelty that is part of the humans. 
 
The animation is pretty good, especially in the ""Bake Neko"" segment with some pretty unique artwork. The background score is pretty much on the mark, creating the appropriate atmosphere to complement the plot. ED track is among my favorites. I was instantly hooked the first time i heard it. The Characters are what make the story intriguing. It becomes all the more significant during the ""Bake Neko"" part which is more or less a whodunit thriller. Can't wait to check out ""Mononoke"" which is a spin-off from ""Bake Neko"" segment. 
 
If you are a fan of anime set in edo era, be sure to add Ayakashi to your collection. It is binge-worthy in my opinion. 
 


          
 
       Helpful It's difficult to provide a single rating, considering the series consists of three separate arcs of unrelated stories. They even have differences in their art style, making it even more difficult. So I'll just mention my opinion of each story below. 
 
 
The first arc, a famous revenge story named Yotsuya Kaidan, is my least favorite. I can say, however, that it is dramatic and that revenge is served in the end. It has an overall grim and depressing tone, and if you're not in the mood for that I would suggest you skip it. It's definitely horror to the core. 
 
 
The second arc is more of a tragic love story between a human and a spirit. This one is quite depressing as well, but it has moments of comedy thanks to a pair of side characters and there is more positivity in general. The art and colors are less grim than the first arc and is definitely an upgrade from the previous episodes. 
 
 
The third arc is most likely the reason people watch this series. The story about the bakeneko and medicine seller is a leap above and beyond the previous two. The artstyle and colorful decor and outfits more than make up for the darkness in the previous two stories. Not only that, but there is some mystery and tense dialogue that carries the episode along. The character and style proved popular enough to warrant an anime of its own called Mononoke. 
 
 
All in all it was entertaining enough, if only because it's different in content from most animated series I have seen so far.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
In this anime the story is based on three different short traditional folklore stories from Japan. They are mostly horror stories, however I would say the the last two ones were dealt more with mythical phenomenons and were not so scary. Specifically, it is not as scary as Japanese horror movies are a days. However it is kind of psychological and revolves around issues that have some kind of melancholy into them. It is definitely a very good way to learn about Japanese literature while getting entertained.  
Art:  
The art is not manga art actually. It resembles ukiyo-e, which is a type of traditional Japanese way of drawing. Nevertheless the last story has a different type of art and is a prequel to the anime Mononoke. The last stories art is more like manga art but it seems as if the surface in which it was drawn was some kind of wrinkled paper, I don't really know the reasons which the artists decided to make it seem that way but in my opinion it doesn't really look attractive that way, though the characters design was quite pretty. 
Sound: 
The sound was mostly Japanese traditional music which made the story more intense and interesting. On the other side I found the ending really nice, because it wasn't completely traditional music, it also seemed to have some elements of more modern music. 
Character: 
There wasn't any character development at all, but it seemed like at those times folklore legends/stories didn't really deal with character development (maybe there was some in the second story). Generally these types of stories concentrate more on the topic of revenge and hatred encountered in the plot. 
The characters were kind of similar between them, I must state that all the stories deal with women that have been deeply hurt because of some man, in one way or another. 
Enjoyment: 
Finally I found this show really enjoyable because I learned new things about Japanese culture and their traditional stories while I experienced some of the Japanese classic horror aura which made me think about how it evolved to Japanese modern horror encountered in movies such as Ringu or Hanako-san.

She now lives with a human girl who runs an antique shop. The anime is mostly about the cat god and her fellow gods spending time together and getting into some trouble along the way. 
 
People would’ve probably just passed through this anime and didn’t give it a second look. I kind of understand because this anime is a bit dull and plain. An anime released in 2011 shouldn’t be dull and plain yet this anime remarkably is. There is nothing in this anime that you haven’t seen before and almost all of its elements worked against it.  
 
The one big problem about this anime is that the first episode introduced all the characters and it already had an already established status quo. The cat god, Mayu, was kicked out of her house in heaven but the next scene we see is her in a house with a girl. So there was a time leap and the anime kind of just told us that the events in between wasn’t important but it actually is. Out come a bunch of characters who casually speaks to one another as if they’ve been introduced already but they weren’t. The anime immediately told viewers that this is what we have: a bunch of characters talking to one another. It’s now the viewer’s job to catch up with the anime. Most first episodes start out strong with an exciting premise but this anime opened with a yawner that will hardly interest you. The one thing that made me want to watch about this anime though is the way the characters interact with each other.  I’m not saying it’s great but there is some pretty impressive blending here. Also, I don’t judge on first impressions. “This anime will get better” is what I said to myself. 
 
This anime will only start to get good though after the third episode. Like I said, the character interaction is it’s only saving grace. The story is non-episodic and they come off as a bit predictable. Why watch an anime if you already know how it will end? This anime is of the Comedy genre and it’s flat. It most certainly won’t make you laugh. Believe me, I tried and forced to laugh but it won’t. It’s just too simple to even try and make you laugh. Even the characters are a bit flat because they didn’t have a proper introduction. There are a lot of negative aspects in this anime that it overwhelms its good parts. This anime is just meant to be watched for simple fun and nothing else. Oh, don’t marathon it as well. It won’t do you any good and you’re just punishing yourself. 
 
The episodes have some basic set up to them and they are mostly divided into three types. The first type is episodes about a random god and some trouble it causes on the characters. Just like the first episode, the characters are scrambling to chase off the god of poverty that wandered into their town. The second type is the simple kind of episodes where the characters just hang out and do random things together. There are episodes like telling ghost stories or helping a mangaka with her work. I like these episodes because the characters play off each other and their individual charm gets to shine for a while. The third type of episode is about Mayu and her relationship with Yuzu, the human girl who owns the house she lives in. These episodes are particularly deep because they explore some dramatic moments of their relationship like the incidents after Yuzu’s parents die and the events on how they first met. This is the special part of the anime but you first must not over think the anime and just have fun while watching. 
 
The character design is simple. I actually like this kind of design because the simplicity makes the characters more pleasing to look at. If you look closely too, some of the characters have some big boobs on them. I love how some fan service is able to make its way on the character design. It has some “moe” on some of the characters as well. They were cute and they were paired with some cute voices. The outfits are pretty nice as well. There is a large range of outfits in the anime from simple shrine maiden clothes to some frilly dresses. 
 
Overall Score 
 
6/10 “It’s a pretty nice anime if you want to just sit back and relax and just enjoy some silly random fun.” 
 
The anime is OK. That’s it. I’ve said all I can say about this anime and it’s up to you if you will like it or not. There are some nice things here. In the overall look of things though, this anime is sadly forgettable.

          
 
       Helpful If you are searching for chibi art and a fan of cute animals such as nekos (cats) or kitsunes (fox), you might enjoy this. ^_^ 
 
Artwork: Colourful + Simple -> Designed to ease viewers in, as the design is to reel you into the aspects of childish fun & games. 
 
Story: A very spoiled neko -_- , and must be punished -> outcome? You decided: ""Stay spoiled"" || ""becomes Obedient""  :T  + random storylines that gives you a chuckle or two to remember. 
 
Sound: Additional sounds such as passive natural background noises included should be a supplement to this anime. As of now, the sounds are aligned so it does give the anime the push it needs to go to. 
 
Enjoyment/Character: Roles are entitled to them: Different reactions are shown based on their personality & moral, all tied down to the aspects of respecting their ""role"" they have to play as. Plus random characters are introduced very smoothly to bring you the ""More the Merrier"" embracement feeling. 
 
Overall: This is a comedy, get a couple of laughs out :Dc 
 
Try finding out which character in this anime is relative to you ;3

12,16067,23,8.537831411,Story between god and human,Nagi no Asu kara,"Long ago, all humans lived beneath the sea. However, some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently. As a consequence, they were stripped of their god-given protection called ""Ena"" which allowed them to breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the denizens of the sea and of the surface widened, although contact between the two peoples still existed. 
 
 Nagi no Asu kara  follows the story of Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido, along with their childhood friends Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki, who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea. 
 
Hikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","Since long ago, human civilization had lived on the ocean floor, developing a scale-like layer on their skins called Ena which allows them to live underwater. However, there were many humans who wanted to live above the surface and they moved to land creating a fundamental separation between the two. After Nami Junior High School closes down, four 14-year-old students from the sea village Shioshishio have to attend Mihama Junior High School on the surface. What follows is their struggles adjusting to a new environment and the relationships between the land and sea humans, while dealing with their own newfound feelings that have just started appearing with the end of their childhood.
","Nagi No Asukara is, for me, an example of a series with a great potential that was executed poorly. Althoguh people mark this show very highly, the story is really badly written, the characters are sketches and the fantasy aspect was just ruined. The best aspect of this show is the animation. 
 
The series is set in a world in which there are two types of human: those who live under the water, and those who live on the surface. The story is about students from an underwater village who transfer schools to a school on the surface, and its main subject (as much as I understood) is the racism between the two kinds of people.  
Now, the story has a great potential, but it was very poorly written, and this is the main reason for my mean score. We don't get to know about the background and history of the world (which is essential for a fantasy books and series), so things like the strong racism between the water and the surface human, the sea god and her powers, the salty rain and many other are just left unexplained, although they play a very important role in the series. The characters often act stupidly and without reason (an example - Hikari hugs Manaka after she hears a very bad news. Manaka kicks him hard, and sees surprised of herself). The dialogues are stupid (the characters argue about whenether they should change themselves. But why do they have to change? What should they change in themselves? No clue).  
The turning point of the story was quite promising, but from there, it deteriorted quickly. When a disaster comes close, the people on the surface act normally - continue with their life as nothing will happen. The few dramatical dialogues between the characters did not sove this problem. And when they finally found a possible solution, it was just horrible and pointless  (I will not spoil), and if you ask me, it was added just for the drama. After that, I dropped the series, because I saw that it was not heading to a good direction. 
 
The characters themselves are really one-dimensional. Hikari just keeps shouting and hitting other people (he is the only character who gets a character development, but it is too sudden and polar to be reliable). Manaka is just cute. Kihara is the only character that I found convincing. 
 
The animation, however, is really good. The character designs, the school, both of the villages were done very well. 
 
Overall, I think Nagi No Asukara is a rather dissapointing series. The story makes no sense, and although the fantasy setting sees promising, there is a lack of information about it, which is essential for the series. So if you try to find a fantasy series with a good story and not just a good concept, I suggest you to skip this one.

          
 
       Helpful Nagi no Asukara or lull in the sea is a good anime in my opinion. the story has an interesting concept of human living under the sea and it's prejudice to the people who live in the land. It has a complicated love story as you don't know who will end up with one another. It kinda gets bland  after the time skip. 
 
The anime's animation is such an eye candy, it has a lot of bright colors that makes it bright.The character's design is simple with  characters having big eyes  that makes them quite cute.I did like the color of the eyes, Since I am fond of  color blue.  
 
I also love the OP and ED song of the anime especially OP2 and ED1. 
 
The characters are good. I wish they put more emphasis to Tsumugu because I didn't really get to know him as a characters besides that he is not close to his parents, He loves the sea and fell in love with one of the characters.  
 
 
Well overall, I enjoyed watching it but It could have been better. 
 


          
 
       Helpful In my opinion, it is my belief that most anime that have been hyped beyond belief (at least the ones that have been airing recently) are of significantly poorer quality that most would've hoped. This happened with Sword Art Online, Kill la Kill, and for what has been shown already, Black Bullet (keep in mind I've only seen 4 episodes of that show at the time of writing this review). The worst thing about hyped shows are not actually the shows themselves, but their effect on other anime airing in the same season as them. Many anime that are arguably better than those shows are often overlooked by the general populous. This happened with shows like Shinsekai Yori, Golden Time, and the anime I will be reviewing today, Nagi no Asukara.  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Story: 
 
The thing that I like the most about the story is how it has a multitude of themes and messages to send to the viewer, but it does it in a way that feels very subtle. Even during the dramatic moments, nothing really feels too overbearing, and has a more lighthearted scene (but not completely comedic and out of place, mind you) almost directly after that to ease you out of it. It almost feels like the pacing and timing of the story was trying to mimic that of a wave crashing onto shore. A dramatic moment would resemble a strong wave full of emotion, and, most of the time at least, retreat back to where it comes from.  
 
As previously said, there are a multitude of themes and messages throughout this anime, ranging from rascism, to climate change, unrequitted love, and of course, change. Focusing on the first half and the ""rascist"" aspect, the thing I liked about this was that it didn't shove the theme down you're throat like you're mom forcing you to eat brussel sprouts. It's not like the two villages were on the brink of war or anything, just a very bitter relationship.In this case, it works with the atmospheric mood of the whole anime. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Characters: 
One really weird thing to talk about concerning this anime is that of character development. I say this because of the whole ""change"" aspect of anime. A lot of the anime focuses on how the various characters want to stay how they have been. This is actually one of the best parts of the show, as the characters are noticeably aware of their own ""character development"", and they want to stop it from occuring. I won't spoil how that actually turns out, but it's rather enjoyable to witness. 
 
Moving on to individual characters, let's start of with Hikari (Hii-kun as Manaka would say). There is one line in the anime that Miuna, Hikari's friend and another main character, says. She says that Hikari is straight (among other verbs, but I can't bother to find the particular line). Now, I don't mean in the sexual preference kind of straight. He fixates on one particular goal, and never stops until that goal is complete. He brash, and speaks before he thinks, but he truly cares for his friends (and his love interest). Although the way he goes about things is not really the way I would do it, it's interesting to see how he reacts to the various occurences that happen during the course of this anime. 
 
I don't want to drag on much longer than I already have, so I'll just give brief sentence summaries for each character, and then you can witness each of their greatness for yourself. You have Manaka, the bright and bubbly girl, and Hikari's main love interest. Kaname, the more logical of the group, who always tries to be in control of the situations and his feelings, even though thats the root cause of his pain sometimes. Chisaki, a busty purple-haired girl who is fairly silent (and probably my least favourite character of the bunch, but I won't go into detail on that). Tsumugu, the land dweller that has a strong passion for the sea. Last but not least, you have Miuna and Sayu, the two younger best  friends who are also troubled with love. 
 
Although the amount of screentime and focus of some of these characters (mainly Kaname) is very inconsistent, you really do feel their dilemna, and you have a strong sense of really getting to know who they are.  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Animation: 
 
Atmospheric. That's the best term to describe the animation of Nagi no Asukara in my opinion. The backgrounds are absolutely stunning, the movement, albeit a little limited at times, is fluid and precise, and the distinct look between land and water was phenomenal. At times, it almost feels like this anime had the budget of a movie. It's something that is pretty hard to match. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Sound: 
 
This is probably the least enjoyable thing about this anime. Not to say that the music is bad, because it isn't. It's just that everything else is so great that the sound kind of gets buried by it all. A lot of the music is very simplistic, sometimes only using one or two instruments for any given song. This can be seen as a pro and a con. It fits the atmospheric and scenic tone of the anime to a T, but most of it is really that memorable in the slightest. Fortunately, it knows when to kick it up when you have more dramatic scenes coming up to play. Lastly, the openings and endings. To be honest, I found almost all of them to be pretty generic. The exception to this would be the second opening. It still wasn't great, but it was a good notch above the other OP's and ED's this show had to offer. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
The great thing about this show is how well it knows who it is, and how every single aspect of the show has a place. There are very few moments where the characters, music, pacing, etc. stray off from what the show is. What this show is is a feast to the eyes, portraying an enjoyable romance, relatable characters, and a well written story, all while doing it in such a manner that feels natural and realistic (well, as realistic as you can be with a tribe of people living underwater). And to discuss the ending, I can safely say that it was very well done, if not just a tad unsatisfying. I won't spoil a thing, but let's just say there is a major point in almost any romance anime shown near the end that the show forgets to add, and it just made me a bit sad. Overall, this anime gets a high recommendation from me, so make sure to watch it sometime. 
 
Also, remember me saying how every single aspect of the show has a place? 
Well, there is one line in the first episode that breaks that, but in the most hilarious way possible. SMELLS LIKE YOU'RE OVULATING. Like seriously, I laughed for a good ten minutes on that shit.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']",none,"It is a light-hearted anime that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has plenty of relatively light fanservice. It is also quite silly, but that is what makes it interesting. The anime also has surprisingly nice art/character design... and at the same time occasionally displays significant dips in music quality. I would say the series are a bit underrated. Detailed breakdown below. 
 
Story: 5/10 
It is based of several japanese legends, but mostly those are an excuse to make heroine travel around, doing various silly things and often changing costumes. The story isn't exactly DUMB despite being silly, meaning I didn't get any facepalms while watching.  Occasionally story gets a bit predictable, and its quality drops in several filler-like episodes. 
 
Art: 7/10 
It is surprisingly good/solid. Very nice character designs on everybody, without rushed drawings anywhere. Most characters are visually very interesting, from girls/women which are cute (onihime specifically) to the large detailed onis. It is definitely not a super high budget designs, but it is surprisingly solid and above average quality. I think the only issue with art is odd design of momoko's primary costume, but everything else looks good. 
 
Sound: 4/10. 
The music is odd. There are a lot of interesting or average sounding tunes, but the anime frequently switches to some very weird electronic music that at times sounds almost like a chiptune. Those fragments feel completely out of place. 
 
Characters: 5/10. 
It is a light comedy, meaning characters are mostly plot devices and thier primary purpose is to be entertaining, so there isn't much to tell. THey aren't horribly written, and main characters are okay. There's nothing deep in character, but they're entertaining/amusing enough without being overly predictable. In short - archetypes, but no or at least not many horrible cliches. 
 
Enjoyement: 6/10. 
I liked it. It is a good anime to unwind while watching some characters doings something silly. It is not a super high quality comedy, and honestly the main reason to watch it is eye candy in term of character designs.  
 
Overall: 6/10: 
Worth checking out if you're okay with light fancervice or like/don't mind a bit of ecchi. However, this isn't really an strong ecchi title... to put it bluntly it doesn't ever show a nipple, and characters (surprisingly) don't have a habit of falling into some sort of risque/provocative pose every time. Still, there were several obviously fanservicey episodes.  
 
Bottom line: Light comedy with cute characters and some ecchi overtones. Worth a watch if you want to unwind, skip if fanservice offends you. 


          
 
       Helpful Momo Kyun Sword 
The story revolves around a naive Momoko and her 3 animal gods that took care of her and trained her since a little girl. 
 
Story 
It was a typical fan service anime, where this group of girls have to find some stones of power so the demons don't control the humanity, where there's little action and a lot of fan service. 
 
Art & Animation 
The art on this is very good being a fan service it has to be, for some reason their boobs shines, and the animation is really colorful. 
 
Sound 
It wasn't something great, it was fine and the ED for some reason was hypnotizing. 
 
Character 
They were fine, it wasn't anything remarkable but the fan service on them was. 
 
Enjoyment 
It was fine to see the fan service and the colorful art but more than that there wasn't anything. 
If you are here for the fan service then don't there are better anime series that has better fan service but this is fine.

          
 
       Helpful This is the best bad anime I've seen in a while. It isn't good. It doesn't really stand out. Due to Momo Kyun Sword's rather shallow exterior and interior, there isn't really a good way to write a long review about it without some filler. Therefore, I'm going to keep this review short. But I'm going to try to recommend that you watch it, despite the low score that I think it deserves.  
 
Here's the story: Follow Momoko, her boobs, and her 3 animal friends as they travel Japan, meeting more boobs and changing costumes along the way. Beware of predictable plot twists and cliches.  
 
The art is colorful, but isn't all that special. Everyone's shoulders and cleavage and various other body parts are blushing at almost all times, unless they are male and are therefore not sexual objects. But who cares about them, right? 
 
The music confuses me, it's usually generic and more annoying than not, but then sometimes I can almost dig it. I was left with a feeling of vague satisfaction coupled with deep disappointment in the sounds in this anime. 
 
Every character falls into some archetype and doesn't expand on it or do anything out of the ordinary. Onihime was my favorite. That's really all I can say here. 
 
Enjoyment: Well, I enjoyed this. I'll explain why, but that's where this review kind of gets long, so if you want to leave off here, just know that it's possible to revel in Momo Kyun Sword's lack of substance, but that doesn't at all make it a ""good"" anime. It is inherently bad, as (hopefully) evidenced by my brief description of everything about it above. I didn't really leave anything out, I think I've described the entire anime in this review.  
 
Anyway, here's where my ""short"" review ends, and my ""long"" analysis of why I enjoyed this anime despite its terrible-ness begins: 
 
This is a very simple-minded anime made with a very simple-minded audience in mind. It doesn't look down on its viewers at all - it puts itself exactly on their level and celebrates the mediocrity. I assume that if you're going so far as to read a review about Momo Kyun Sword, you aren't the type of person it was intended for. So, in order to enjoy this anime, you need to exert some effort. There is no meeting halfway here. You won't be rewarded for your trouble with anything that is at all redeemable by the end of this story. No, for someone that enjoys thinking critically about anime, the only surefire way to make this worth your while is to go all in and lower yourself to the very standards it expects of its audience.  
 
At least, that's what you have to do if you want to enjoy it and also rate it higher than a 3. I, however, enjoyed this anime without respecting it. It was risky though, I very easily could have hated it (still probably giving it a 3, but without the fond memories). All I had to do was start watching this anime, fully anticipating something underwhelming. I know that people say that you shouldn't watch this anime if you're wanting something deep, but I'm going to change this to ""only watch this anime if you're wanting something shallow."" It's not enough to know that this anime is bad, you have to WANT it to be bad. If you want this enough, you will be rewarded with exactly what you want, and therefore enjoy this anime! 
 
But really, everyone needs a mediocre anime or two under their belt. Not necessarily to accentuate the better anime, although that's not a bad reason. I just kind of like to take a breather, to stay grounded in reality. If I throw in some bad anime along with the exceptional anime, I won't get bored with my favorite medium always meeting my expectations. But that may just be me.

","Gestalt seemed to be an interesting story concept when I read about it and I found myself intrigued by the good artwork (for this era).  Unfortunately and mostly because of the overall length and lack of any follow-up anime to carry on the story, Gestalt is left with a very unfinished feel to it. 
 
The story revolves around a priest named Olivier, who having some sort of crisis of faith announces he is leaving his order and traveling to a forbidden land known as Gestalt or G as it is believed to be a cursed place.  There he hopes to find the answers to his questions.  Along the way he comes across a mysterious girl, Ohri who seems to be from the very land he wishes to visit.  From here he begins his journey, while being pursued by a bounty hunter type elf that was sent by the leader of Olivier's order to bring him back.  There is some good magical action and a good amount of comedy and mild fan service.  Gestalt is not meant to be taken seriously but I did not find it excessively silly either.  The plot is not exceptionally deep but it does do a pretty nice job of building up the world and delivering an interesting chapter of the overall story.  Yes just a chapter, because by the end you will not get a resolution to any of the major plot elements.  I do not know if there was an intention by the producers to make a further OVA but the ending as it is now is not satisfactory.  Because of this series age I find it doubtful there ever will be one either. 
 
The main characters of Olivier and Ohri were enjoyable but a bit shallow.  Again the brevity of the series is mainly to blame.  I found them interesting enough I would like to have seen more.  The supporting cast is pretty basic and flat as well, though Suzu as the dark elf bounty hunter was the highlight.  The villains’ motivations were not adequately explained either and seemed to be bad just because.. well they were the bad guys. 
 
For a series of this era I found the artwork to be really good.  Though they use a lot of the pastel colors that seemed washed out I still liked the overall style used.  It loses some points for the inclusion of bishies, the main male villain in particular who if not for his voice actor I would have sword was a girl.  I just never will understand what is so attractive about these feminized men.  There is not much to comment on with the sound.  The acting is good and I can’t complain about any of the performances but there is very little music at all.  No opening theme and just a brief and unmemorable closing. 
 
If you’re interested in a light hearted magical action then you could do worse than Gestalt.  As long as you can look past the lack of a complete ending, there is some enjoyment to be found.  I suspect the manga which ran 8 volumes would complete the story but at this time it has not been scanlated by anyone though it does seem be releasing this year in retail from Viz.  I found it interesting enough that I plan to read it when it comes out. 


          
 
       Helpful Choujuu Densetsu Gestalt is a somewhat obscure two episode OVA produced by TV Tokyo. It's based on an eight volume manga by Kouga Yun. What is it about and why has it been largely overlooked by people? Is it a forgotten gem or should it be left in a refuse bin somewhere? Let's delve in and see if we can find out. 
 
Story: 
 
We open with a dark elf named Suzu, who incidentally looks nothing like the traditional jet black skinned, silver haired dark elf, talking to a priest. He tells her that Father Olivier has left the order on a journey to the forbidden land of “G” in order to find the truth about their religion and the world and needs to be returned because religious orders frown on truth finding excursions. Plus there's the whole forbidden thing. We transition to a scene of Father Olivier performing a blessing for some townspeople at the urging of the innkeeper. She's so grateful that she gives him a woman named Ouri who can only communicate in video game style text boxes. Having a moral compass, he doesn't approve of slavery but he reluctantly takes her just so that she won't be sold to an establishment of ill repute where terrible things will happen to her. They encounter Suzu but they're saved when Olivier dispels the silence spell that's sealing Ouri's magic. The OVA covers their first stop on their way to the cursed island and what happens with that. 
 
Let's start with the first really noticeable problem with the OVA. The spontaneous romance. Being a decent person, Olivier offers Ouri her freedom pretty much the instant they leave the town where they met, but she needs a reason to stick with him because otherwise there wouldn't be a story. So, they use the most cliched, and one of the most contrived, excuse they can think of. She instantly falls in love with him. The climax also has a deus ex moment but, in all fairness, it's kind of a light offender since it's clearly establishing something for later in the narrative. The OVA just doesn't get far enough into the story to have the payoff. 
 
The comedic elements in this are kind of weak too. The whole thing with Ouri communicating with text boxes for a while is clearly meant to be funny, but it really isn't and there are a lot of jokes like that. You can tell what they're going for but it's either just not funny or the execution isn't good so it ends up not working. It's not cringe-worthily bad or offensive, it's just lacking actual humour value. 
 
Characters: 
 
The cast is pretty basic. Olivier's the generic nice guy. He has convictions but isn't strong enough to do anything about them. So he ends up in situations where he's completely inadequate. Ouri is the action girl love interest. Suzu is... a romantic rival for Ouri, I think. Her character is so bland it's hard to tell. I suppose that they might be decent enough for a comedy if there were really good jokes surrounding them, but that isn't the case so they just come across as dull and rather listless. 
 
Art: 
 
The artwork is pretty good. The character designs are nicely done and the action sequences are quite good. The only real problem is that the backgrounds can be kind of stock and lazy. 
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is fine. They got some really talented actors like Koyasu Takehito and Araki Kae. But, there's not a lot for them to work with. Koyasu doesn't get to show much emotion and Araki doesn't get to employ any subtlety, with a lot of her dialogue being exaggerated. They're still passable performances, just not ones that leave much impact. The music is pretty mediocre. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
This one doesn't have any homo-eroticism. Of course, it's bad at romance so that's probably a good thing. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Choujuu Densetsu Gestalt doesn't really do much. As a comedy it's largely unfunny. As a fantasy work it's just banal. I don't particularly dislike it and I wouldn't call it bad per se. It's easy to see why it's largely forgotten since it really doesn't have much impact whatsoever, positive or negative. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's a sub-par piece. Next week I'll look at Glass no Kamen, which was requested quite a while ago but I had the Gintama request to finish first. So look forward to that next week. I'll try to make it worth the wait.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Martial Arts', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","The series describes the various trials of Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, two middle-school students. While at the library one day, Miaka and Yui encounter a strange book known as The Universe of the Four Gods. Reading this book transports them into the novel's universe in ancient China. Yui is transported back to the real world almost immediately, but Miaka finds herself the Priestess of Suzaku. Miaka is destined to gather the seven Celestial Warriors of the god Suzaku in order to summon Suzaku and obtain three wishes. She falls in love with the Celestial Warrior Tamahome, who eventually reciprocates and Miaka's desire to use a wish to enter the high school of her choice begins to shift towards finding a way to be with Tamahome. Yui is also drawn into the book when she tries to help Miaka to come back to the real world; becoming the Priestess of Seiryuu, working against Miaka out of jealousy over Tamahome and revenge for the humiliation and pain she had suffered when she first came into the book's world.
","This anime is a bit old but it rivals (is as good as) any romance anime I've watched till now. 
 
Miaka, main character- attractive, cute, honest, caring but annoying, is sucked into an ancient book and found herself in plenty of trouble. Well first, she falls in love with Tamahome. Somehow, Miaka is so hot that even the Emperor is in love with her LOL:) There are some love triangles going on, adding spice to the story. 
 
The (Suzaku) warriors are slowly revealed in an interesting manner. Each has their own tale and attractive personalities. I would say my favourite is Tatsuki- because he adds a lot of comedy besides looking soo hot. Also, he initially was rough and sort of a bad guy. Other than Tamahome, he seems to have actual character depth and development out the the 7 warriors. 
 
For the Seiryu warriors, my favourite are the twins. The really livened up the story. As you know, Miaka's best friend, Yui became the priestess of Seiryu and so became enemies with Miaka. However, you'll have to watch the anime to find out why Yui went over to the dark side:)  The real bad guy here is Nakago of course- he is smart and manipulative. However, you'll feel sorry for him when you learned of his tragic past. 
 
Since this anime's setting is in ancient China, the surroundings and clothings will be of that. Think Chinese temples, emperors, etc. Each warrior also has a Chinese character on his forehead. Ironically, the villian Nakago's character represents 'heart' ,while the protagonist Tamahome's character means 'demon'. 
 
The story is compelling as it is not the usual 'fight the bad guy, save the world type'. A very important part of the story (other than romance) is about friendship. It is really touching to know after all the bad things Yui did, Miaka still forgives her and retain their frienship. 
 
Overall, the story is great and entertaining. There is a fair bit of fight scenes but violence is kept to a minimum. Lots of drama and suspense moments.  
A word of caution: Miaka and Tamahome will proclaim their eternal love for each other multiple times throughout the anime. Translation: there will be a lot of kissing, hugging, etc. Most of the time it's sweet and cute though:) 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Its almost impossible for me to express how much I love this anime just in a review... This anime was and is very inspirational! The plot had me beyond the edge of my seat! The characters are all so colorful and different, they make you laugh and make you cry. Speaking of crying, I could raise the sea level back up with the amount of tears I shed for this anime. But I laughed so hard at so many of the scenes! Every second of this INCREDIBLE anime was worth while! I'd say that this anime has all the elements of what makes a great anime great. The story line is just so unbelievably addicting!!! I might sound a bit over enthusiastic but you know how (almost) every anime fan has that one anime that they just go crazy for? This is mine. And oh my gawd am I CRAZY for it. :) WATCH IT!!!

          
 
       Helpful Fushigi Yuugi was one of the cartoon shows I watched in AXN when I was a kid. It was fun to watch but now I'm older, I have a different perspective. The art and animation was ok. The fighting scenes are ok as well but the problem lies within the main character of the show. 
 
Miaka Yuki: 
 
She is greedy, stupid, coward, crybaby. Everytime when she wants to rescue Yui, she always thinks of Tamahome. She keeps saying ""Tamahome! Tamahome!"" many times until I got tired of it. Just like characters keep saying the name of a person who he or she loves like Yuka Minase from 11eyes, Orihime Inoue from Bleach. She also becomes vulnerable in situations and becomes the damsel in distress. She always do not want to accept the difficulties in life and she easily cries all the time. 
 
I really just don't understand why the characters like Miaka. 
 
So because of her, she screwed the whole show for me and I am not going to watch it again. As a note, I really hate whiny and crybaby anime characters like her. If you enjoy the series, that's cool. But I just couldn't dwell in it.

12,4362,27,8.171795588,Story between god and human,Fireball,"Fireball takes place during the war between humans and robots. There is no real story, just individual episode skits.","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","The series' main characters, Ged?chtnis and Drossel von Flügel, reside in a gigantic manor surrounded by a presumably robot-inhabited city, beyond which is a desert that humanity's forces slowly encroach across during the 144-year timeframe in which the series is set (identified onscreen as the ""Merkur Era"", 48,650–48,794).
Ged?chtnis is Drossel's servant and guardian, having sworn to her late father to protect her. Drossel treats him very much after the manner of the ""spoiled princess"" stereotype. A running gag in the series is that, at the beginning, Ged?chtnis waits for Drossel to arrive and is called by a name Drossel chooses seemingly at random (although some, such as Sancho Panza and Rasputin, infer an unambiguously subservient status upon him). Ged?chtnis then attempts (in a gentle, butler-like fashion) to remind Drossel of his name, upon which she tells him not to interrupt her. Another recurring joke is Drossel claiming that she practices karate despite her moves obviously being capoeira.
Drossel was manufactured as having the mind of a 14-year-old girl, with Ged?chtnis' being that of a 50-year-old man; neither's age is explicitly stated, although both are known to be at least 2,800 years old–Ged?chtnis stated that he entered service with the von Flugel family 2,800 years ago, and that it has been his duty to remain by Drossel's side for all of that time. Both Ged?chtnis and Drossel move and speak in markedly unconventional ways, for example: instantly replying to each other at inhumanly fast speeds; freezing in postures until a new one is assumed; replying in seemingly unrelated ways. They remark upon how illogical human speech seems to them and act in what could be said to be an unemotional manner, though they do show emotions at times.
The characters occasionally display knowledge of elements that would normally be considered on the other side of the fourth wall–Drossel makes reference to what happened ""in the last episode"", and at another time points out that she has heard something already in an anime; Ged?chtnis stops a laughter track (and indeed, the episode) by punching the screen, causing it to fracture in the accustomed glass-splinter visual code and then to fall sideways to the floor.
The series sometimes makes serious points in otherwise complete nonsense–the city in which Tempest Tower is built (shown during the opening title sequence) appears to be stereotypically dystopian in appearance; in the episode ""Butterfly"", Ged?chtnis discusses the nature of rules, and what it is to be 'real' in an almost philosophical fashion, and the last episode features some distinctive ""last stand"" elements (it is this episode in which Drossel recites her entire name and title and then walks to face the human forces just as the series ends).
","Another new and short CGI anime from past year. 
 
But this time, it's done by Disney, yes, Disney. 
 
Fireball excists out of 13 episodes between, roughly said, 1 and 3 minutes. 
The story's no big deal, since there's none.. no.. really. On the back-back-background there is on, some war between Mankind and Robots, or something of the sort. The &quot;story's&quot; that happen in the episodes is a different story, it starts the same everytime, but it develops to some random conversation ending or monkey sounds. Which is pretty fair, since it's hilarious. 
 
The art is very good, I like it, the Robots are done great and the animation is a bit stiff (it's supposed to be stiff) but good. Nothing to say here really, for a short like this, it's great. 
 
The sounds great to, besides the &quot;stop-motion&quot; conversation parts, the voice-actors do a great job, and so does the monkey. All sounds are done carefully, but good. 
 
The characters are the highlight of this series, the robot who's name isn't important (Ged&auml;chtenis) and none other than Drossel von Fl&uuml;gel, apart from the names (that makes sense if you know these characters), they are unique. The &quot;stop-motion&quot; way Drossel lives is at least unique, but hilarious, she does randoms poses every two seconds, if not every second. Ged&auml;chtenis is a smart robot, but probably a bit frightened of his master. Then as last, the funky monkey which delivers some problems in episodes and scares the main characters with loud screeches, he .. or she.. is done brilliantly as a background character. 
 
This is a good-to-highly-enjoyable series for a quick fix of anime, if you need it. It's not really a recommendation, but you just have to see this. The overall rating brings the score back to an 7,8 which I'll round off to an 8. Which, is my personal score too.

","Shojo manga series by Julietta Suzuki that adapted once again into anime after it first season, Kamisama Hajimemashita. The first season left some curiosities to the audience who enjoys romance genre about “what will happen between the main characters after this?” Well, the answer might be found in this second season. But, I can’t guarantee that you’ll find all of those answers in it either. So, it would be better just watch it for yourself and you will know what I meant. 
 
(SPOILER ALERT) 
 
(*) Story 
The story remains around our main characters, let’s just say “the girl and the fox” who continue their life in Mikage’s temple after several of supernatural events in the first season happened and affect their relationship with each other very well into some kind of “more-love-interest” relationship. The first season starts with the character’s past and main conflict that goes on until pops up some supporting characters who help fill the sensation, mood and the story itself to be life and joy. But, we’re not gonna talk about the first season in here. So, still. according to that, just don’t confuse when you see the beginning episode of the second season starts with scary vision and dark red color background which apparently a dream belongs to a white-pale but cool guy that just wake up from his sleep. You’ll need to memorize the last episode of the first season to know who is that character. But, don’t worry if you lazy to watch it again because you’ll see a “familiar introduction” after that (just like in the first season) and you’ll know who that is when you watching this anime completely.  Well, back to the main topic, the story consist of two parts in one episode. Those parts linked to one another and they give sign about it with some “free pic” (I called it because I always save the pic whenever they show up haha, so it is “free”) which is similar to most other anime. In this season, there’s different seasoning than the first, for an example like the problem solving of the conflict that I thought it would spend a long time to be solved but it solved with some simple idea. I didn’t say that was bad, but what can I say? It’s so supernatural, everything could happen. Or I guess they need to hurry the solving part to match or catch up the amount of episode of this anime which I suggest they need to plus the amount of it to do it just like I thought. But, despite it, I think the story was good enough, I like the writer’s idea whenever there’s romance scene that somehow manage to balanced the comedy which makes me feel the essence and the character’s feeling about themselves or the events that they’ve been through. The ending was absurd, that makes sense because the pace and new character that shows up. They need more episode to make it epic “if” this is their last anime adaptation. (I hope not!) But, it’s not that bad to watch it till the end. It’s romantic, it’s hilarious, it’s supernature and fantastical, it describes how love could grow between a human and a yokai. I would say that is “very touching and makes my heart melted”. 
 
(*) Art 
The art was good. It’s certainly nailed it to bring the romance and peaceful aura to the audience. It fits the story although I hope they could detail the background to help the story a little. But, I don’t mind about that. Because I believe there’s limit in everyone’s skill and we should respect other’s work. It’s unique in a good way and actually, I found that I fond of the character’s art. All with the background effects, filler and especially the chibi or funny looking expression that often shows up. 
 
(*) Sound 
Suzuko Mimori’s voice suits Nanami well. I loved it, especially whenever she shouts and mad on Tomoe because some kind of simple or serious problems she had with him. And the character voice of Tomoe is even better. I could say that Shinnosuke Tachibana has succeeded to cast Tomoe from the first season and I bet he especially nailed it for drawing attention to female’s audience out there to watch this anime too. And don’t forget about the other’s character voice actor like Daisuke Kishio (Kurama), Nobuhiko Okamoto (Mizuki), Junichi Suwabe (Akura-oh), Horie Yui (Himemiko), Akira Ishida (Mikage) and many others, they have succeeded too. I will not protest about them. They’re professional and they absolutely “nailed” it! For the OP and ED theme, I’d like to say that it’s fair enough. The singer as same as the first season. It’s good and cute to hear. Talking about the back sounds, I…. really loved them. They hit the feel, the situation and help the story serving a lot to the audience. My favorite back sound was the sound that historical but peaceful when there’s some meaningful scene that shows up. 
 
(*) Character 
There’s new characters that show up in this second season. For an example like Akura-oh (Tomoe’s partner from the past) who enjoys caused destruction through all over the world or Jirou (the fourth chief of Kurama Mountain) that suddenly turns into a memorable yet important for several episodes (you’ll understand when you watch it) and many others. They have unique characteristic and amazing looks too that make my brain memorize them. Besides that, I like how Nanami develops her character even more in this season (through her past or her attitude towards some problems that makes her skill of spiritual power level up) and I like how she could handle her feeling towards Tomoe. I see her courage even more rather than the first season and by that, I can tell that her character was well-developed. For Tomoe, he changed to care for Nanami a lot rather than usual, he more often to jealous, sulking, teasing and see Nanami differently especially after the last episode when he saw Nanami’s past. And he did realize what he actually feel towards Nanami in this season. I would say that their both character develop as same as their feeling to one another. I love the quotes too especially the quote that Mikage said to Nanami about “the taboo love between human and yokai”. 
 
(*) Enjoyment 
I enjoy watching this. I can’t believe it for myself either but it is enjoyable. For several times, the director and the writer had succeeded to draw curiosities and cut episode when there’s surprising event. I hate whenever they did that, but as long as it worth to watch, why not? As it ended, I just hoped that the last episode was not the last of it. 
 
In conclusion, “all of you who likes romance or rom-com story genre would be best to watch this anime right now”. Kamisama Hajimemashita (Season 2) it’s worth to watch, funny, heartwarming and I found it amazingly enjoyable (haha). Well, I suggest you watch the first season before watching this one.          

          
 
       Helpful Well, I am so happy that they actually decided to do a season 2. The first review that I did was a bit too short. It is also a good way for me to sort of fix my review of the first season without actually having to go back and rewrite it. I noticed that I really didn’t explain well what I felt about this show. I do love watching this show and the characters are rather interesting, even more so in the new season then the last one. We get to see a lot more character development as well as backgrounds that were not explained before. This makes me like the characters even more now that I can tell why they are the way they are.  
 
We get a lot more info on Kurama and his family situation, on the inner workings of the gods and so on. Where the first one was more slice of life with supernatural elements, this one is more supernatural with slice of life elements. Instead of every episode being sort of episodic in nature, we have story arcs that last about three or four episodes before finally concluding. I like how this one also seems to have a ‘standard’ enemy that the characters should face instead of just random inconveniences that pop up every once in a while along with the everyday troubles of the human world. It gives the show a bit more stability to hang on to. 
 
Nanami has also grown on me a bit, making me like her character a little more. She is getting stronger and stronger each day with her powers. The romance between her and Tomoe is also stronger but it sort of makes me want to bang my head against the desk as when Nanami is so open to her feelings about Tomoe, Tomoe on the other hand is just so stubborn and cold-hearted to her even when he figures out his own feelings. If he’s not truthful, she may end up with all the other suitors she has been collecting. And I mean many. Almost everywhere she goes, for some reason the really hard core mean boys end up falling for her slightly.  
 
The animation is pretty much the same as the first one, meaning the good and the bad are the same. The artwork is dark in a colorful way but what I didn’t really say before was that the very light hearted bit of the show is bright with a lot of pastels. Again, it’s a nice contrast between the two worlds and the fact that each episode seems to get darker and darker as the story goes on adds to a build up that might be coming. I say might because I don’t want to spoil anything. 
 
The English voices are the same as well and I’m not sure about what to add to what I said before. Again, Tatum does a amazing job as Tomoe, A very strong voice that also can be gentle when needed to be. Nanami talks way too much still but in this season, she seems to of grown on me or just has learned to not rattle off a ton of stuff. I kind of like this more ‘mature’ Nanami in that way as she grows with the show. There is actually much more growth in season two then in season one and I think that is why they sort of took the series and split it this way. I found there were also two OVA’s that were between this one and the first but at this time, I have not seen them yet so not sure if that had any base to her growth. 
 
To sum it all up, I like the second season a bit more then the first. We had a lot more story and background to the characters but on the sad side, they opened a lot more questions that need to be answered. There wasn't an ending with this one like the first one seemed to have. The ending for the first series may have landed a bit flat but at least it did have an ending that I could consider a ending. This one ended with a lot more questions, especially on the main antagonist that they had.

          
 
       Helpful this is nothing but cliche's, and plot holes with dry slap stick comedy and half assed romance(queue the laughter track). don't waste your time watching this stupid anime. it was simple and straight forward trash. i went into this hoping it would carry at least the mediocre content of the of the former and instead it drops all of the romantic development from the previous season and starts over again. as if we want to watch the same cringe inducing bantering that took them too long to realize their feelings all over again. the main charicter is pathetic and useless wearing obvious plot armor made of enchanted diamonds. a summary of this anime: something bad happens, the main character says we should help, the supporting character says grr i don't want to, they slap each other a few times and then the support give in and they magically find a way to fix things. rinse and repeat.

He revived the deceased gold saints and use them and a few god saints as bodyguards. But Athena did not obey him, Apollo had no choice but send her to hell. On the otherhand, the bronze saints are on their way to save Athena. 
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']",none,"No review yet ? It's a shame... 
This was the best thing ever produced related to Saint-Seiya. I'll be trying to explain you why as good as I can... 
 
While the other Saint-Seiya movies were painfully formulaic, Legend of Crimson Youth was one of a kind. Granted, its story is rather basic: Phoebus Abel, a fallen God banished by Zeus and Apollo, resurfaced after a long absence. He's accompanied by his bodyguards, the corona saints, while showing to Saori Kidou, i.e. Athena his sister. He proposed her to join him to his final residence following World's end. Bronze saints sedition ensues. 
 
In fact, what differs is art execution. For the era, displayed means were exceptional. Character design, animation, music, background art it has aged stunningly well, given that the title is 23 years old ! 
If one word can sum it up, it's poetry. There isn't a single moment of emotion falling flat if you pay attention, thanks to the strong, imaginative and yet simple mise-en-scene... 
From Abel immersed in his cup's play of light while brooding over spooky memories to Seiya awkwardly stumbling on harbor surroundings, cut to a shot of some scrapped doll representing his state of misery.  
Imagery never cease to be downright amazing, from start to last frame. 
 
To be fair, characterization of some of the main cast needed to be worked more. That's why I rated it a 9 instead of 10. 
Abel's the best villain of the serie ever created, next to the knight of Gemini. He's an extremely refined person who cherish beauty of art, while at the same time he can turn in the wink of an eye into a terrifying brute in order to defend his convictions. His relation with Athena is really interesting, too bad their common past was never used. In fact, I wouldn't mind watching an entire arc if it was to build his character at full potential. 
Some says it borders to incest. I don't know, you can only speculate about it... 
Even so, incest isn't shocking for a deity. Hera's Zeus sister and spouse after all, and examples abound in Greek mythology. I personally think it's fraternal passion formed when he was on his own against jealousy of major Gods. 
 
I can hardly describe how much I love this movie. I saw it when I was a kid (sure, I wasn't supposed to watch a PG -13 but meh...) it literally blew my mind. I was totally receptive to its sensitiveness... Here probably originates my long time love for animes, as far as I can tell. Yet, I seldom rate 10 my overall reviews: I do it only for overwhelming stuff like studio Ghibli's...  
I hope Legend of Crimson youth bring to you, reader, as much joy and fascination as it did to me back then...

The third Saint Seiya movie. The longer, complex (yes, complex) and better of the original movies. This one was so badass that, in my country (and ton of others too), it actually was showed in cinemas. With this one, the anime road was paved definitely. 
So, I hope you can understand my broken english, and learn about the Legend of Crimson Youth. 
 
Story: Abel, the Sun God (banished in the past by Apollo, apparently) comes back to the world with the intentions of human annihilation, so the gods may rule the world one again. This is original in the way that Abel want to rule with Athena, his sister, instead of just kill her and take the world for him. And guess what: Athena agrees, and tell the bronze saints that she doesn't need them anymore, since Abel not only have the Corona saints (Carina Atlas, Coma Berenice Berenike and Lynx Jaow), but the fallen golden saints too. Of course, Seiya doesn't take this calmly, but since Atlas clean the stairs with his head (a colorful way of kicking ass), Athena orders the four bronze saints to leave. Crushed with the decision of their goddess of... well, firing them, Seiya and co. eventually learn the truth: Athena didn't betrayed humanity, her plan was to beat Abel herself, since she doesn't want a fight between the saints and a powerful god (she apparently forgot that the saints are supposed to fight gods every now and then, specially Hades, since he come regularly). Athena obviously fails, and her soul is send straight to the Elysion. And that people, is the trigger for a battle between the bronze saints and the golden saints loyal to Athena vs. the Corona saints and the golden saints loyal to Abel. 
Enjoy the rest! 
 
Animation: Well, this time there is an improvement. Not mind blowing, but very significant. The environments (the temple look really nice, but I really like the little prairie were Abel and Athena first met), the attacks (flashier than ever, specially Atlas and Berenike's attacks), the animation (a bit more fluid) and the characters, everything is better done (comparing to the TV series and the other movies). 
 
Sound: the music is not only good, as usual... this time, they created and ending song!. You Are My Reason To Be (english lyrics, people!) isn't the best ballad ever, but is pretty nice, and is a good closure to a movie with tons of fights. 
The japanese voice acting is great, like always (you never get tired of the ""Saori-saaan"" scream over and over xD). 
 
Verdict: The best Saint Seiya movie so far. There's not only and improvement in the visuals, the story is better told, and the most important thing: we have more and better fights. The enemies this time are more satisfactory, the corona saints are really strong (and vile, their treacherous attacks are hilarious), and the golden saints are an excellent add (they aren't the more popular characters for nothing). And a few other things I can't comment for the spoiler thing. 
Oh, and I almost forgot, for crying loud sake, this one is 70 min long! This one qualifies as a real movie! (Truth to be told, the others are closer to OVAs) 
So, all in all, this is one of the best things with the Saint Seiya name on it. This is the way an anime movie should be done.

Amigos hispanoparlantes, ?se acuerdan del primer opening que vimos de Saint Seiya? No Pegasus Fantasy, si no ese de “Los guardianes del uuuuuuuuuniverso al triunfar el maaaaaaaaaaaaal”? Bueno, ese tenía escenas (y spoilers masivos) de esta película. Esta es la número 3, la que vimos en cine los que tenemos más de 20 (la primera película de Anime que yo recuerdo...), y una de las responsables de cementar el fenómeno anime por estos lares, abriendo paso más tarde, al menos en Argentina, a futuras incursiones como Dragon Ball... 
Se?ores, se?oras, con ustedes, Los Caballeros del Zodiaco Contraatacan (Latinoamérica) o La leyenda de los jóvenes escarlata (Espa?a... este nombre me gusta más. Bien por los espa?oles). 
 
Historia: Abel, Dios del Sol (o al menos uno de los dioses del sol, dado que en el pasado fue vencido y desterrado por Apolo), regresa al mundo de los humanos con la intención de eliminar a la humanidad y empezar una nueva época donde los dioses dominen la tierra. Esto es ciertamente original, dado que Abel quiere reinar el mundo junto a su hermana Athena, en lugar de simplemente borrarla del mapa y regir solo. Y acá esta el giro: Athena acepta, y releva a los santos de bronce de sus puestos, dado que Abel no solo cuenta con sus santos de la corona (Atlas del signo de Carina, Jaō del signo de Lince y Belenger del signo de Coma Berenices), sino que también revivió a los santos de oro caídos. Obvio que Seiya no toma esto muy bien, pero después de que Atlas le diera una paliza, Athena ordena a los cuatro caballeros de bronce presentes que se retiren. Devastados por haber sido abandonados por su diosa, Seiya y compa?ía terminan descubriendo la verdad: Athena no estaba realmente dispuesta a abandonar a la humanidad, pero no quería que sus caballeros lucharan contra algo tan poderoso como un dios (se ve que no le llego el memo de que se supone que los santos SI pelean contra los dioses, especialmente contra Hades, que viene cada 242 a?os aproximadamente), por lo que se enfrenta a su hermano, obviamente perdiendo, y siendo su alma enviada a los campos Eliseos. Así es como se desata la batalla entre los santos de bronce y los de oro leales a Athena vs los santos de la corona y los santos de oro leales a Abel. 
 
Animación: Bueno, esta vez realmente se nota un esfuerzo por parte de los animadores. No voy a decir que fue un salto gigantesco en la calidad, pero tanto el entorno (especialmente al principio de la película, cuando Athena y Abel se encuentran en ese campo floreado tan bonito), los ataques (aplauso para los ataques de Atlas y Belenger!), la animación y los personajes están mejor hechos que en la serie o en las otras películas. Será porque está realmente es una película (podríamos decir que las otras tres eran más bien OVAS). 
 
Sonido: La música no solo es buena, si no que esta vez, crearon un ending para la película!. You Are My Reason To Be (cantada en ingles) no será la balada más brillante del mundo, pero es agradable y da un buen cierre a una película donde llovieron golpes por todos lados. En cuanto al doblaje... la versión latina (al menos la que yo vi, porque apostaría que hay una versión mas) contaba con un cambio total en las voces. Excepto por la de Shun, que sonaba medio rara, todas eran correctas (especialmente la de Seiya, que tenía que competir con alguien como Jesús Barrero). También, hay alguna que otra cosa peculiar, como que al caballero de Acuario le digan Camil en lugar de Camus, y que al ataque ofensivo de Ikki le hayan metido la palabra fantasma (el pu?o fantasma del fénix es el que destruía cerebros, no el que destruía huesos), pero nada grave (ahora que me acuerdo bien, varios ataques tenían cambios menores de nombre).  
 
Veredicto: Esta es la mejor película de Saint Seiya hasta el momento. No solo hay un aumento en calidad técnica, la historia está mejor planteada (sin salirse de lo tradicional), y lo más importante de todo: más y mejores peleas. Los enemigos esta vez son mucho más satisfactorios, los santos de la corona dan mucha batalla (y son rastreros como pocos, atacando por la espalda a diestra y siniestra), y la inclusión de los caballeros de oro fue genial (no por nada son los personajes más populares de la serie... aunque, por alguna razón, los que estaban vivos no aparecieron). Además de muchas cosas más que no puedo comentar por cuestiones de spoilers. En resumen, esto es de lo mejor que hay con el nombre de Saint Seiya. Así es como deberían ser las películas de un anime.

          
 
       Helpful Legend of Crimson Youth is the 3rd film of the Saint Seiya series which is the longest of the bunch, but sadly it's probably the worst of the features. Note: this movie takes place after the events of the Sanctuary arc. Episodes 1-73. 
 
The story begins with Saori meeting her brother Abel along with his servants, The Corona Saints, & the revived Gold Saints. In short, Abel wants to rid of humanity as they are a vile & wicked species set on self-annihilation. To enforce his actions, Abel asks for the aid of his sister Saori to cleanse the planet of humanity and begin anew as messiahs. The moral of the film is to emphasize a divine figure whose solemn duty is to abolish the dangers of Earth with his sins being justified for the greater good. It is the duty of The Bronze Saints to rebel against this holy figure to prove his actions are wrong.  
 
While the subject matter seems promising for a full length feature it doesn't hold up on very basic story principles being action and motivation. For starters, the film states right away what the story is but takes a slow pace towards it as the first 20 minutes is focused on a brooding Seiya due to Athena siding with Abel aka Apollo. This plot point quickly becomes irrelevant as Athena was only feigning her loyalty to Abel in order to assassinate him. The murder attempt fails and the story follows the same structure as the other plots of Saint Seiya being to rescue Athena from sort of act of self sacrifice. So the rest of the movie is what you can in Saint Seiya but delivers poorly. 
 
While it may seem trivial to complain about the action in a film where the emphasis is the story; the fights are terrible. Being the first movie debut for the Gold Saints I expected more out of them but they are dispatched very quickly. The same can be said for every other battle as they end far too quick, eliminating the build up presented in the previous scenes. It gets to the point where the audience can call ""bullshit"" on the power scale presented in the action as most fights feel ""fixed"".  
 
While the action is poor the same goes for the story as Abel never elaborates why he must be rid of humans or what classifies them as evil. This is where the movie starts to fall flat in its ethics as it never goes into detail of the sins man has committed. From what has been presented in the series, Earth is currently a peaceful place so there is no need to wipe out humanity. If anything, all the conflict came from Gemini Saga. Ironically, Saga is the saving grace of the movie as he motivates Seiya to rescue Athena as a way to atone for his past sins. I certainly wished he played a bigger role in the story as Abel's current actions reflect his own during his time as Pope Ayres. 
 
To sum this up, Legend of Crimson Youth basically repeats the villain characterization of Gemini Saga offering very little action &  a story that isn't as complicated as it claims. The only highlights to the movie are the animation, a rematch between Shiryu & Cancer Deathmask, and the brief inclusion of The Gold Saints. Saint Seiya Movie 3 just felt like recycled material in an updated look. While the art remains gorgeous as ever, the pacing & structure needed improvement.

","The anime is one of adventure and traveling with friends to gain strength. Throughout the anime, a sort of comforting feel is developed due to the characters that act and appear like little kids. The feel is also advanced a bit more through the use of comedy most of the time and haveing a positive outlook on all situations. I personally do not like the kid like atmosphere much, but it will for sure appeal to younger audiences. the anime is also one great to pass the time and just enjoy a fantasy adventure show, like other animes that have similar feels to them. The show is subbed and the has a good “complete” ending; however, if your like me then the ending will leave you wanting more since it combines a bit of sad emotions with excitement and fun. It is a video game based anime so if you like shows like dragons and puzzles then you will like this (basically the same feel).

But in another hand I really like that, because I have more episodes to watch!! 
And this time the art and design it's better that the previous seasons! 
 
I can get sick of saying this! Every time I watch something related to this anime, I can see the true power of love, the really love story of the main characters and we can get enough of the others characters of the anime. 
 
Of course we love Taka/Tamahome and Miaka.. But how would be story without Noriko, Hotohori, Tasuki and the others??!  
 
I think in this OVA they pay more attention to the others characters and it was a really good choice! 


          
 
       Helpful This OVA was an amazing way to end the Fushigi Yugi series.  Although I liked the original TV series ending a lot, this one was just as good if not better.  You kind of have to sit through the horrible first OVA to understand the background of what is going on in this second OVA, but this one makes up for the last one.  Don't worry if you are completely confused while watching the first one, cause everyone is just as confused.  Plus the first OVA has some nice comical shorts at the end of the whole gang going to a hot spring. 
 
The animation is just as good as the TV series, and this OVA give a lot of the background of the Suzaku 7 that isn't really shown in the TV series.  You also finally get to see the white tiger Byakko (one of the 4 gods).  If you enjoyed the TV series, I guarantee you will like this OVA.

In reality, he opts for the two-dimensional world of gaming over real life because he is an unhealthily obsessed otaku of galge games (a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls). 
 
When he arrogantly accepts an anonymous offer to prove his supremacy at dating sim games, Keima is misled into aiding a na?ve and impish demon from hell named Elucia ""Elsie"" de Lute Ima with her mission: retrieving runaway evil spirits who have escaped from hell and scattered themselves throughout the human world. Keima discovers that the only way to capture these spirits is to conquer what he hates the most: the unpredictable hearts of three-dimensional girls! Shackled to Elsie via a deadly collar, Keima now has his title of ""God of Conquest"" put to the ultimate test as he is forced to navigate through the hearts of a multitude of real-life girls. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","Keima Katsuragi, a second-year high school student, is an avid player of gal games (video games that involve interactions with anime-styled pretty girls). He is known on the Internet as ""The God of Conquests"" (落とし神, Otoshi-gami) for his legendary skills to be able to ""conquer"" any 2D girl in games. However, in his actual school life, Keima is called otamega (オタメガ), a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku (オタク) and megane (メガネ, glasses).
At the start of the series, Keima receives an e-mail offering him a contract to ""conquer"" girls and, thinking it is an invitation to a game challenge, he accepts. In response, a cute demon from Hell named Elsie appears: a Spirit Hunter. She asks for his cooperation to help her in catching the evil spirits that have escaped to the Human Realm: the ""Loose Souls"", which were once Old Demons from Hell. These evil spirits hide themselves inside the hearts of girls, feeding off the hosts' negative emotions to replenish their power and strength, thus becoming whole demons once again (and in turn, the host becomes an empty shell of a person). Elsie suggests that the only method to force the evil spirits out is by ""conquering"" the girls' hearts, making them fall in love with him and filling up the gaps which the escaped evil spirits hide in, in which she is then able to capture them. Interested only in video game girls, however, Keima is appalled by the idea, and refuses the assignment as he has no romantic real life experiences whatsoever. Nevertheless, with the contract already agreed, Keima has no choice but to help Elsie no matter what, as they will be beheaded by an invisible (to others) purple collar around their necks if they fail.
After winning the hearts of fourteen girls (and capturing the spirits residing in them), Keima and Elsie are given an even greater mission: to awaken the six goddesses known as the Jupiter Sisters. Each sister is dormant in the heart of a girl among those they have previously helped, thus Keima must locate them and conquer their hearts a second time. This time however, they remember the encounters he has had with them already, due to the goddesses inside them, causing high tension and constant possible failure as he tries to conquer the girls simultaneously. However, his time is limited as a rebel demon faction called ""Vintage"" is planning to capture the goddesses and take over the world.
After Vintage's plans are thwarted, Keima starts seeing visions of a child who is somewhat familiar to him. The goddesses send Keima and Elsie to the past with the task of helping her. Upon arriving, they team up with a mysterious girl who apparently has some connection with Dokuro, Elsie's superior in the underworld, and Keima discovers that several occurrences in the past are different from what he remembers, leading to a tragic chain of events that he must avert to ensure that the present stays unaltered, as well as another demon faction which releases giant humanoid monsters.
As Keima completes his final mission, he discovers the truth about one of the giants and is able to reconcile with it. He is relieved from the collar and returns to his normal life in the real world.
In addition to Keima's romantic comedy adventures, the series makes fun of and parodies common, and popular cliches about dating sims, anime character stereotypes, and pop culture.

       Helpful I don't know if the Dub for this anime was just plain bad but it just left me flat.  I have the next two seasons and I can't find myself being bothered to watch them.  
 
The initial premise strains suspension of disbelief. You literally have to work to not think about the situation that drives the story. It's like a toothache, you know if you probe it, it will hurt but you just can't stop. You just can't help but ask ""What's in this deal for him"". If you think the obvious answer is a compelling answer you should never negotiate for yourself. 
 
The show is episodic with an overall arc, which is nowhere near resolved in the first season. The episodes are composed along the lines of the equivalent of romantic word problems. Main character has to win the heart of girl with quirk. It's the kind of thing that works for a monster of the week show only because you can kill just about anything in half an hour or less. Not so much for the 30 minute romance.  
 
As a comedy it's a flat out fail. I didn't laugh once. There were parts where you could see it making a half hearted attempt at humor, but the timing and spirit just weren't there. 
 
I am glad there are nice things to say about this. I admit my take on the art and sound may be less than useful as I really love the anime style of art but this show does a really nice job of it. It play with style while still having that nice clean colorful presentation. The music in general is also very pleasing, even if the to voice acting at times could be like chalk on a blackboard.

","This review contains minor spoilers! 
 
I decided to watch this movie on a whim, expecting nothing of it, and I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the first 30 minutes of the film. After the absolutely adorable opening song, Unico is sent away to a wasteland. The lonely, cold atmosphere really got to me, and seeing Unico, the beacon of happiness and hope, pull through and turn the selfish, temperamental devil Akuma into a charmingly awkward friend was really inspirational.  
 
Sadly, the rest of the movie is much more average and not well-constructed. The second character Unico meets on his journeys is Chao the cat, a far less charming friend than Akuma. She stays a boring ditz the whole movie, not really learning much from Unico.  
 
The villain, while totally fearsome and creepy (mostly due to excellent visual design), really detracts from what the film could have been. He has no depth and is defeated without any emotional fanfare. While his battle with Unico might be visually grandiose, there is nothing of substance here. 
 
I really did enjoy the bittersweet ending, though. Unico’s curse, bringing happiness to all, but never being able to stay with his friends, is tragic but meaningful to me. The plot and pacing are really unfocused for most of the film, leading to plenty of interesting themes…that are completely underutilized.  
 
Still, I really admire how atmospheric and interesting the visuals are in Unico. The sheer scale of important figures like the West Wind, the Night Wind and the villain is immediately apparent with their distinct designs that look great animated. Unico is literally the most adorable character on the planet. The whole package oozes creativity.  
 
I should also mention that while this is technically a children’s film, I wouldn’t recommend it for really young ones. There’s plenty of violence and dark atmosphere, a very imposing big bad, not to mention subtle rapey undertones.  
 
Unico has a lot of problems, but its heart and creativity push it into the 7/10 territory for me. On a bad day, maybe 6/10. I recommend it to anyone who’s a sucker for this power of friendship type of stuff and wants to see some fun art and animation. There are much worse things you can spend your time on. 


          
 
       Helpful This is cute movie to watch with the kids (if you have some) or with a friend. The story is quite simple, which is not bad considering this is a kid's movies.  
The music is very cute and the art is nicely done. 
 
The fight scene towards the end of the movie was crazy and vibrant in color. The fight scene remind me of the dragon fight in sleeping beauty.  
 
 I would of liked to see Unico meet more people. but the two he did meet were both good. I liked the cat and her na?ve. It drove the plot forward and caused good character development and was taught a good lesson about kindness. The demon Unico meets learns about friendship and how to be a good friend. Kid movies should have morals like these in them.  
 
The west and winter winds are good plot devices, which can be use to continue the story indefinitely. Remember that this movie as a sequel.

Having now watched it, I am wondering what he was smoking. 
 
I'll go through each aspect individually. Tharrrrr be spoilers (at least in the plot section), so read at your own risk. 
 
Art = 5 
I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, the backgrounds are great. It looks like a small village. They are beautiful, though a bit colourful at times for an anime which is supposed to be ""dark"". Points also go to this one for mixing up the character designs and not having all the characters as beautiful supermodels. Though not excessively gory, the blood and gore aren't skimped on either, another important point. 
 
On the other, there are big problems with the character designs. Some of the characters look utterly ridiculous. Seriously, what is with their hair? It detracts from the ""horror experience"". The best horror anime have characters who look vaguely like real people, not people who have had their hair styled by Ronald McDonald. Okay, enough about the hair.  
 
Another nitpick I had about the art was how obvious it was when a character was turned, so to speak. Red eyes, glowing white skin, just unnatural looking. It might have been more interesting if it was hard to tell the two groups apart. 
 
I am pretty forgiving when it comes to art so I can ignore a lot of ugly if the story is decent. 
 
Sound = 7 
Credit where credit is due here. The majority of the voice acting worked for me. Everyone had a distinct voice and most of them were fitting. I couldn't tell you what any of the minor characters voices sounded like (or if they were ""off"") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  
 
The music is ... interesting. The openings are fine, for the most part. Ending songs aren't quite as good but still passable. Some of the in-show music works very well, in a creepy subtle way. By that token, there is also some that are too subtle and fail to evoke any mood. And then there's the weird pop-techno blend song that comes in once in a while. Each time I heard it, I spent the entire time trying to figure out what popular song it sounded like. 
 
The sound is pretty good. It works. No real problems here. 
 
Character = 3 
We start off by sticking close to a pink haired girl named Megumi. She is a stuck-up bitch who hates the town she lives in (and many of the people, including some who go out of their way to be nice) and has an unhealthy obsession with a boy named Yuuki. Think she's the protagonist? Nope. 
 
What about Yuuki? He's the outsider who's just moved to a new town and is slowly making friends. Again, not really the main character. We spend a good portion of time with him until about a third of the way in. 
 
The people we spend most of the time with are the Doctor (Ozai) and the Junior Monk (Seishein). This is a mixed blessing, since Ozai is perhaps the most interesting and likeable character in Shiki. Megumi is, for the most part, annoying as all hell, though she gets better as the series goes on (and her role is downplayed). Yuuki is tolerable but never really breaks out as a character. He's the stoic (semi-)badass who says he doesn't want friends but has a good heart. Seishein is ... horrible. I know I'm supposed to agree with or sympathize with him since we spend a decent chunk of time with him, but he's a drag in every scene he's in. Ozai is perhaps the most logical and realistic of the characters. He realizes something is wrong and he ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT! 
 
The problem with the characters is development. There is a large cast of characters, the majority of which aren't important anyway, which means we don't spend enough time with any character to get too attached to them. And very few of these characters change in any meaningful way. Most of the characters are the exact same whether alive or dead, though the dead do angst a bit.  
 
The character I had the most sympathy for was the girl in the track suit. She's young, unprepared for this, forced to choose between doing unthinkable things and dealing with friends and family who have risen. Her increasing instability is one of the few interesting changes within the series. Too bad she's downplayed in the second half. 
 
Plot = 3 
There are spoilers now. You have been warned. 
 
Shiki is about vampires. If you didn't know that going in, you would have figured it out by the second episode at the latest.  
 
It takes the rest of the characters at least another three or four episodes to catch up. The plot is sloooooow. Most of the mystery, if there was any to begin with, is dispelled right away. Every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I felt like I wanted to see what was next. Then the plot would drag its feet a few episodes with no substantial progress being made. 
 
To sum up the first 2/3rds of the plot, the vampires are killing people. A lot of people die. Only Doctor Ozai, Seishein and a few kids realize what's going on. Then the kids drop off the face of the earth for a while and barely factor in again (with one exception). Most episodes in this bit focus on Ozai  trying to do something, the townsfolk doing nothing and Seishein being tormented. Should he do something? (YES!!!!) 
 
To repeat, the vampires kill a good portion of the population and no one is all that disturbed about it.  
 
In the last 1/3rd, the show does a 180 and tries to make us sympathize with the vampires. This might have worked if they hadn't been mercilessly slaughtering townsfolk for half of the series. There are some moments where you genuinely think the vampires have been dealt a shitty hand (not choosing to become one but being forced by whoever bit them), but they are few and far between. Suddenly, the humans are the bad guys for protecting themselves and their families against the immortal people who have been murdering them. 
 
While many of the humans who are cleansing the vampires are obviously enjoying the experience waaaay too much, it's hard to argue that they're wrong in doing it. Should the vampires survive, the humans will just be mined for blood until there are none left. You can complain that the vampires want to live too and they've retained their memories, but the bottom line is that their existence is just to kill former neighbours and friends. 
 
And then there's just moments of incredible stupidity. 
-At one point, it's suggested that the Shiki want to convert all the humans they can so the village is entirely Shiki. This would make sense, if you forgot that they NEED the humans for sustenance. Without them, the vampires starve.  
-A third to half the town is wiped out and everyone is content to believe it's an epidemic, yet make no effort to do anything about it.  
-No one questions why there are now large populations of people who work only at night, why many families have just disappeared and where the death records have went. 
-Ozai makes a tape of him dissecting his wife, proving the existence of Shiki .. then shows it to no one.  
-If you can figure out Seishein, you deserve a cookie, his entire character and motivations make no sense.  
-The technology problem prevalent in horror. Why does no one phone about this?  
 
The final few episodes make an attempt to tie everything together but it only partly satisfies. Many of the characters motivations are still stupid and there are jumps that we're never shown. 
 
This isn't to say that there isn't ANY depth in Shiki. There is. It just happens to be muddied by other aspects. In the second half of Shiki, we start being presented with questions about the value of life, whether it is ethical to kill (if your life is on the line), the propensity to deny rather than act. The questions are interesting. It's the way they're executed that doesn't do them justice. 
 
Enjoyment = 4 
I wanted to like this series. I really did. And there were some positives. I liked that they used some old-school vampire tropes (not being able to enter buildings without being invited ect). I liked the tracksuit girl. I liked Doctor Ozai, who has a couple of badass moments (though not enough!).  
 
It's the pacing and the plotting that really let this series down. For every thought-provoking idea (""is it right to kill someone else so I can live?"") or genuinely nice/interesting moment, there is much more padding. And stupidity. No one (besides a few characters) seem to ever catch onto what's happening before they kick the bucket. Everyone is so complacent that you wonder whether they're all too stupid to live. I was ready to scream at these characters sometimes. DO SOMETHING!  
 
Overall = 5 
See above, really. 
 
Shiki has potential, but squanders it by dragging everything out and failing to make any compelling characters. 
 
Look ma, no Twilight references!

          
 
       Helpful Shiki is a good example of a vampires story done right. The plot starts out nice and slow for the first 3 episodes and then starts to pick up its pace right away. 
 
It does a good job of introducing characters, make you hate or love them and then kill them off, or leave them in a cliffhanger for your enjoyment or dismay. 
 
Something that bothers me about this anime (that a lot of anime do) is that they left some loose ends towards the ending which were detailed in the manga. Stupid DVD-selling gimmicks, LOL. 
 
I'm not too particularly fond of its soundtrack, but I don't hate it either. It's not like there was anything out of place; at the same time, none of its tracks really stood out. 
 
Overall, Shiki is quite a solid series and probably the best one I've seen lately.

          
 
       Helpful This is pretty much vampires done completely right. Yep. This is the vampire anime for you. 
 
Something is happening in the town of Sotoba, where people are being killed off one by one. Who's killing those people? Either called The Risen or Shiki. There's the title of the anime for you. These vampires are killing not on purpose, but for their own good. Wait, did that make sense? I don't think so. So, here's whats going on. These vampires are only hungry. Makes sense, vampires always have a taste for blood. So, basically, they end up killing a bunch of people and the town's doctor, Ozaki, is aware of their existence. So they end up going all out in battle and stuff like that. 
 
Animation is always a thing for me. Anime must have a perfect animation in order for it to be good. Is that right? Nope, not necessarily. To me it is, though. I have some weird taste in anime, because I have enjoyed some anime people think I'm being possessed or crazy. They're not in my list, but... yeah. The animation of Shiki is incredibly... incredible. 
 
The music is great. Often in scenes where somebody is dying, or someone is crying, the music makes the scene even more depressing. There is quite a few depressing scenes in Shiki, I've only cried like a little bitch in about 4 scenes, all containing a certain character. That one character. 
 
Oh, characters... we were just talking about you. The characters in this anime are astonishing. Truly astonishing. I often changed my favorite character from time to time due to introducing of new ones. Also, I often didn't know whether I was to be siding with the Shiki's or the Humans. Or werewolves. Werewolves are probably better than all of them. Because it contains my favorite character, again. 
 
I think this review is cut short. I'd normally write... no I wouldn't, I'm lying. This is probably a normal review, well, for me. I think this is the length of almost all my reviews. I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, I dropped it after 3 episodes though, but I recently came back to it. The reason I dropped it was because I thought my favorite character was going to die, but then he only dies a few episodes later, to come back as a werewolf. You'll find out who that is soon enough. 
 
I give this anime a 10, because it truly is an astonishing experience. You are not going to know who is going to die, unless there's someone you hate, and you had a feeling that person was going to die, then never mind.  Everything in this review is a 10, because I do believe everything was done perfectly. This series went by rather quickly when I was watching it, and I was sad when it suddenly ended.

12,384,36,7.759419287,Story between god and human,Gantz,"Thought your life was bad? Sometimes, death is worse. There is no salvation, peace, nor god waiting to receive you into their care. But wait, a god? Maybe you are talking about that big black ball stuck in the room with you. Now you are thrown into a game, fighting green aliens and robot monsters for the chance to survive. 
 
When Kei Kurono is killed, he thus finds himself caught in such a game—a test of his skills, morals, and will to survive. His life is not his own; his death is spat and trampled upon over and over again. What happens if he does not listen? God knows. 
 
A word of warning: Gantz is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is it as simple as it looks. Gore, rape, and violence is rampant, as are portrayals of greed, violence, and all the ugliness that one sees in society today. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Ecchi']","A pair of high school students, Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, are hit by a subway train in an attempt to save the life of a drunk homeless man who had fallen onto the tracks. Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find themselves transported to the interior of an unfurnished Tokyo apartment, where they meet Joichiro Nishi, a Gantz veteran, and other clueless participants. The pair soon realizes that they are not allowed to leave the apartment. At one end of the room there is a large black sphere known as ""Gantz"".
After some time in the room, the Gantz sphere opens up, revealing a bald naked man with a breathing mask and wires attached to his head, and various weapons for them to use. These include the custom fitting black suits which give them super-human strength, speed, stamina and damage resistance, a controller which acts as a radar and stealth unit, X-gun, X-Shotgun, Y-Gun. Later on the series the Gantz sword, Gantz Bike are made available as well as much more powerful weapons are awarded in the 100 point menu.
When the Gantz sphere opens, green text appears on its surface, informing those present that their ""lives have ended and now belong to him"". A picture and brief information is shown of some of the Gantz' targets; Gantz orders them to go and kill them. Except for a single mission, all the targets are aliens living on Earth, which take on a wide variety of forms. During the mission, normal people cannot see the players or the aliens. Gantz transports them to the area of the mission, and they cannot leave or return until all the enemies have been killed, or the time limit has run out. If they survive a successful mission, each individual is awarded points for the aliens they have killed. Once a participant has scored 100 points, a ""100 point menu"" will appear. The menu offers three options:

Option 1: The participant can return to their normal life, never having to be summoned by Gantz again. As a price, their memories of Gantz and the missions will be erased.
Option 2: The participant obtains a unique and extremely powerful weapon.
Option 3: The participant can revive someone who has died during a mission from Gantz' memory. This option appeared halfway through the series.After a mission has been completed, points are tallied up, the participants are allowed to leave and do as they see fit until their next mission, with the exception of talking about Gantz, which would lead to their heads exploding. During Kurono and Kato's third mission, all the participants except Kurono are killed, however, Kato kills the last boss, giving Kurono a chance to survive. Kurono survives the third mission bleeding on the floor with his limbs cut apart. After the third mission Kurono starts to change inside, adopting a hero complex similar to Kato's personality. As the series continues, Kurono participates with the objective of reviving his deceased friends with the 100 point reward option. A new team of Gantz players is assembled, which Kurono leads, as the most experienced veteran and one of the best fighters. In the Oni mission it is shown that with Kurono's ""will to live"" he becomes the most ferocious Gantz hunter in the team. Through his interactions with the other members of the team and his life or death battles, Kurono gradually grows into a responsible leader. After the Oni mission Kato is revived by Kurono, and soon after Kurono meets his demise against the vampires. As the series goes on, the rules of the missions change; they can now be seen by regular people, the aliens they encounter are increasingly more powerful and dangerous, and they participate in a mission with another Gantz team from Osaka. Kato becomes the center of attention in the manga and his quest to revive Kurono. In a desperate attempt to revive his best friend, Kato fights the one hundred point alien Nurarihyon which obliterates both Osaka and Kurono's team. At the end of the mission, similar to the first time Kato died, he defeats arguably the strongest alien in the series and is laid bleeding on the floor. The series depicts both the missions and Kurono's regular life, as well as the daily lives of other Gantz players (to a lesser extent).
After several missions, an old participant named Nishi, who knows more than the others about how Gantz works, shows them a ""catastrophe countdown"" on the Gantz sphere which the other players were unaware of. The countdown reveals that there is one week left until some unknown ""catastrophe."" At the end of that week, a massive alien force invades the Earth and begins exterminating the human race, while Kurono and his companions try their best to make use of Gantz' advanced technology and weaponry in defense. At the end, Nishi and Kurono are depicted to be similar, both of whom were despised by their family and were sinister; however, unlike Nishi, Kurono has a reason to live. Nishi, in the chapter ""The Great Escape"", is left for dead by Kurono, vowing vengeance against him and crying out for Gantz and mother for help. It is hinted that Nishi died, but his death seems to be unclear. The Japanese also learn of the existence of Gantz teams all around the world. After a long battle, the humans manage to stop the alien invasion and soon after, it is revealed that it was another, highly advanced alien species that provided mankind with the means to defend itself against the invaders, for reasons they refuse to reveal, calling it a whim. In a desperate last effort, the leader of the alien forces, Eeva, challenges the whole human race, promising to exterminate every inhabitant by himself by crashing their mother ship, killing both races if Kurono does not come to their mother ship to fight him. Prior to this announcement Eeva completely dominates all Gantz teams in his vicinity by killing all the hunters, giving the human race a sense of their mortality. The world calls on Kurono, which is broadcast to the entire world, and, with a revived Kato's help, Kurono bets all his chance of winning and saving the human race on himself. Kurono manages to defeat Eeva, thus preventing the alien mothership from destroying Earth. The series ends with Kurono and Kato returning safely to Earth and being greeted as heroes.

 		“Dark, morbid, violent, blood, gore, death, insanity… 
 
Sexy, naked, boobies... 
 
The nature of human beings…” 
 
If you can relate with the terms above, this is the anime for you. 
 
The Story (8/10) 
 
	The story has a realistic feel drawn in with an awkward twist of science fiction. The purpose and the origins of what was happening is quite questioning and unrealistic but that makes you wonder and it keeps you wondering throughout the entire series.  
 
Art (9/10) 
 
 	The realistic theme continues its flow right down to its art. The art is utterly unique whereas most would stereotype an anime as something dreamy or cute and has big puppy dog eyes. The excruciating details of a human being blasting into tiny pieces, the mind boggling shots of a character reflecting on life’s cruelty, that overwhelming moment of a grueling battle shot, their meticulous and oddball costumes and weaponry… Everything was near perfection and well-suited the story. 
 
Sound (8/10) 
 
	The intro has a very gangster or badass feel to it which quite suits the entire story and at the same time makes you feel epic. The outro is so-so but the sound effects and the thrilling sounds make the scenes pop out and come to life. The characters voices in the English dub were also well done and distinguishable from the rest especially the one who voiced Kei Kurono who has a quite husky voice.  
	 
 
Character (10/10)  
 
The characters are quite diverse; it ranges from a typically annoying damsel in distress to a perverted selfish little knuckle-head protagonist who most people would hate. Unlike the usual villain-like protagonist such as Light Yagami from Death Note and Lelouch vi Britannia from Code Geass who fights for the sake of justice and goodness of all man-kind, one of the protagonists in this anime is heartless and cruel like the animal he is.  
 
The character development is not that noticeable if you do not have a keen eye unlike in the manga since there are only 13 episodes and two seasons but the way the characters move the story is something that makes the entire anime brilliant and captivating.  
 
*Overall, this is something a glutton who deeply craves for the insane anime showcasing the loathsome nature of man kind; quite the opposite of a standard orthodox anime that you would see in the mainstream. 
 
 	After experiencing the anime, if you are the kind of being who would enjoy or is fascinated with different forms of literary pieces, I would recommend you to see the live-action film although it is not as great as the anime as there have been a major change in the main character’s personality and the story itself had been stripped down of its own nudity, but unlike in the anime, the movie had a better dramatic ending. The manga is quite similar to the anime, if there are changes; there are only quite a few. The most conspicuous difference between the manga and the anime is the filler ending in the Gantz Second Stage.   
 
 


          
 
       Helpful My first introduction to Gantz was Gantz.0 on netflix. I have read about this show in regards to the violence and sci fi nature, so I thought I would give it a go. I wont go too much into details about the story as many others have.  
 
So what was good? 
Interesting concept. The animation and sound was good. I tend to like more of the violent types of Anime, so this was good for that. Lots of graphic violence and language 
 
What wasn't good? 
Here is where I really got annoyed with the show. 
The characters are so incredibly annoying and horrible. The main characters are so whiny and indecisive. They are constantly afraid and complaining about things.  They are afraid to kill the aliens, unsure if it good or bad to do, even when they are told thats how they get back to normal. Other characters sit around and watch and do nothing while something bad happens to others. Its so unbelievably stupid, alien attacks one person, everyone else stands around and watches and doesnt shoot. I understand its make believe, but if a bunch of people are standing around with weapons, alien goes after one in the group (and sticks around for a while as they talk), the others dont shoot.  
So much of each episode is about them thinking about what to do, or saying what should be done. This makes things drag on for so long. And it takes forever to find out what is the point to anything.  
There are some of the bad stereotype characters. The old grandma who is useless, the child who is always crying, the bikers who are thugs, horny teenager etc. The other thing is these are supposed to be grade 10 kids, but they look like full grown adults.  
 
I spend a bunch of time yelling at the screen about how stupid they are or how annoying they are. If you can get past that, then its not bad. Too bad they did such a crap job of the characters, which ruin an otherwise good show. 

          
 
       Helpful Gantz, a black comedy anime with many dragging moments with just as many shockingly awesome moments. If you love gore, nudity, violence and cursing then this anime will make you smile and laugh. Unfortunately it's not for everyone. If you prefer an anime with a solid ending and character development I'd say stay away from this. The anime was cut short due to budget issues, the manga extends much longer and the plot is much different. If you don't mind having a lackluster ending than I'd say give this anime a go. It's got a interesting story with a lot of characters you may enjoy yet get frustrated with throughout the life of this anime. I won't go into the plot because that is given to you, but if you want a less emotional gore fest similar to Elfen Lied than watch this anime. It may become one of your dirty secrets.

★★★★ 
 
Rage of Bahamut isn’t the most amazing or original show out there, but it’s without a doubt thoroughly enjoyable. It doesn’t try to be deep or complex. It has a Pirates of the Caribbean feel of fun and adventure. It’s a story about a bounty hunter helping a girl get to her destination, but they get swept up in the bigger picture involving humans, angels, demons, and a world destroying dragon. 
 
The first thing you’ll notice about Bahamut is it’s a very good looking show. The fantasy setting is a breath of fresh air from seeing yet another high school classroom. The fantasy elements aren’t trying to re-invent the wheel. You’ve got swords, giant crabs, necromancy, and hot demon chicks. The quality animation keeps every episode and scene a treat to look at. 
 
The character designs are refreshing, too. The main character isn’t a generic pretty boy with bangs or impossible spikes. He’s got a red afro, he’s tan—even his personality is fun from the usual apathetic or wimpy or try-hard main characters. Everyone is drawn much more to proportion which is also refreshing from the usual moe baby features and bug eyes. 
 
The cast is kept small. You’ve got your care-free main character who’s just looking out for himself so he’s got questionable morals. He has a righteous knight after him for revenge, but they have great buddy chemistry. There’s a na?ve demon girl trying to find her mother, and even a little zombie girl with a “deadpan” look on her face that injects some pragmatism in the their plans. 
 
The story starts off lightheartedly to reel you in while the visuals and setting keeps you hooked, but it escalates until they’re on the verge of bringing back a 2,000 year old apocalypse. Some might regret that it loses its initial charm, but the characters keep you invested even if the story becomes a generic “save the world.” 
 
I don’t have any gripes. At best you could say the fantasy story isn’t original, but even that is an un-original, almost dishonest complaint against anything. Everything’s been done so you can only put new twists on it. Bahamut is easily one of 2014’s best shows, and shouldn’t be missed. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Shingeki no Bahamut is a series that I don't seem to love as much as others, which I will explain in detail while trying not to spoil too much. 
 
First of all, the music and art is great, presenting the show in a spectacular package. Even the occasional CGI monsters works for the most part, sticking out yet without looking lazy. 
 
I was drawn in by the idea of bounty-hunting and the refreshing design of our swashbuckling main character, Favaro, who brings in just the right balance of charm and goofiness. The conflicting relationships he shares with everyone around him is also an unending spring of entertainment.  
 
The first episodes present an interesting concept. After bragging at a bar, Favaro unwittingly tricks a demon-girl and gets into a contract with her. Our suave rogue is now stuck with a demon far stronger than himself, who could easily destroy him with the flick of a finger if she realized he lied to her. It had great potential for some mind-games, with Favaro constantly having to lie and outsmart the demon in order to survive. 
 
Sadly this is where the characters start to show how underdeveloped they are. The demon-girl turns out to be a na?ve girl, easily outsmarted by everyone, turning into a plot-device and a damsel in distress. The promise of a great character-dynamic between her and Favaro goes straight out the window. My biggest pet-peeve however is that Favaro suffers from an old shounen-trait, which is that he’s too cool to care about anything. Is Favaro cool? Sure. Does having no clear motivation make him cooler? Not really. If anything it just makes him look like a third wheel when he's dragged into situations against his will. He even states out loud that he doesn't know exactly why he's doing what he's doing. He says he wants to rebel against destiny and forge his own path, yet his motto is “the wind blows to tomorrow”, symbolizing just how much he's guided by wherever the wind blows him. In a nut-shell this is what made the characters a let-down for me. 
 
The story is a mish-mash of ideas that I’ve already seen done better. The great personification of evil that’s about to be awakened after a thousand years. The bickering trio from Samurai Champloo. The literal retelling of Jeanne d’Arc’s legend with the added twist at the end. 
 
The story has several problems, but one is far bigger than the others. Our title-character Bahamut is not even remotely involved with the main characters until the last third of the series. The angels, demons and Jean d’Arc however are involved with Bahamut early on. I felt like the actual main characters were left to aimlessly wander while the main plot developed in the background. 
 
Overall it is a well-animated series with an underdeveloped story that never delivers on what could have been something far greater.

Rage of Bahamut: Genesis (6/10): To learn about my rating system check the description below. Now it is time to ooze into this spoilery review.  
 
Rage of Bahamut Genesis is fun, and for an anime adaptation of a videogame it is pretty darn special. There are moments where the animation is truly mind blowing, the first episode being a fantastic over the top introduction to the style and the characters. Where Bahamut struggles is a feeling of consistency, the characters start out doing odd jobs going after bounties, then they are having a dramatic sea battle, then they are dealing with demons is a floating Cthulhu fortress, then they are bumming around a castle oh wait now they are engaged in defending the castle from a demonic onslaught, now they are in an alternate dimension chatting up a dragon, and now there is a demonic insurrection. A sizable issue is the a main villain that feels underwhelming as their motives are unknown and their character has been playing a very reserved role up until now but suddenly is crazy? The world doesn't feel very realized as it pulls from way to many areas at once, for example they keep referencing Satan but honestly he played little to no role in the show. The magic system is also a problem as the show tries to place dramatic weight on magical actions being taken, but you never know how powerful any given beam of magic light is supposed to be as it all starts to blend together after awhile. It makes up for its scattered world and narrative by having a fun cast of zany characters that, for the most part, remain consistent. If you are willing to overlook some crazy plot and magic conveniences than Rage of Bahamut Genesis can be an entertaining adventure to follow.

Taking place in the future, during this time wars were occuring in heaven, mostly for possession between the eight moons created by the savior Fuse that surrounded God's land. When the war ended, there was only one ruling family - that of the Oowaris, and the remaining son gained control of all the moons of heaven, except for one. Meiten, the moon of the pope, where people refrained from war and were therefore out of it's terms. 
 
Eight people. Each from one of the eight moons. Each possessing one of the jewels - the elements that compose Earth. They are those who are destined to become saviors of humanity. All of them have sacrificed for these jewels, and are determined to complete their duty to Queen Fuse who entrusted these to them. When the mad emperor Kai threatens to revive a ghost who wants to prevent the restoration of Earth, these eight must battle using the powers given by their jewels in order to create Earth and defeat those who want to prevent it. 
 
So they all go to Kusanagi, the ship in the center of God's land. They must gather the jewels in the key called Yatsufusa at Kusanagi's center, in order to create Earth.

The planet once called ""Earth"" is on the brink of destruction due to the overflowing population and continuing environmental destruction. Queen Fuse prophesied an incoming meteor onto a collision course with ""Earth"", and all those who believed in her built the Yatsufusa, an imperial interstellar starship to accommodate all of Earth's humanity and escape.

","Overview: 
Shin Hakkenden is based on a very old Japanese novel that took around 4 decades to complete, but Shin Hakkenden sets in the future, and has some changes. 
 
Story: 
The Story of Shin Hakenden start hundreds of year after the Planet Earth got destroyed by a large comet, dividing it into 8 planets. At that time the Leader of Earth (called Fuse) rescued some people from the impact via space ships and wondered the space for a new home. Fuse tried to create a new Earth, in doing so she break the balance of the galaxy and people hated her for that. 
 
Years and Years after, 8 persons, with 8 different jewels with 8 different background and tragic stories. re-unite to fight injustice and return Earth, which revealed to be a tough task for many obstacles, super power factions and a psychopath villain. 
 
Art: 
Shin Hakkenden aired in 1999, for an anime produced in that period and comparing to other anime in the same time. Animation and Art are outdated, bland and sometimes silly. maybe the series was produced on a low-budget, but fortunately for those who don't concern much about animation, it won't hurt the experience of watching this anime and its great story. 
 
Sound: 
Here's the awful part, the music! as a point to strengthen the assumption of this produced under low-budget, the entire series run with limited music pieces, maybe even few. every episode has the same music playing again and again. the fight scenes could be more intense with better music. 
 
Character: 
What made this series interesting and worth the watch is its characters. 
the characters are well-developed. each one had its own sub-story running in the series. each had their moments and tragic events.  
The way The 8 jewels fighters fight their way, met each other, helped each other, traveled, struggled, sacrificed , with many supporting characters helping them in the bloody journey was well-done. 
the characters are realistic too. they are not the common-type of protagonists. each act on their normal behavior. they argue, fight and leave each other sometimes. over the 26 episodes, i can say characters got pretty deep development which really interesting and great. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I can't say it will be enjoyable for any individual. As long you put in mind you are watching an old anime. And forgive its animations and sound/music. 
I bet you'll enjoy the story and the characters. 
 
 
 
Thank You for reading my review. and sorry for the crappy English :)

As the rulers of Barou, they now fall under the protection of the island's god, Neo Ranga, which turns out to be a gigantic monster reminiscent of Godzilla.

","I watched 22 episodes of this series. I gave it far more chances than it deserves. 
 
To say the least, this is the worst anime series I have ever seen. The story was just undesirable from the beginning. I couldn't connect with the characters or even care about them... ANY. As for animation, it was decently made. Nothing to gawk at. The box and cover art is misleading because it portrays girls in colorful and interesting looking body paint and near nudity... but in the show there are only a few sparse scenes involving such. Its like making a movie about the moon with box art featuring an artful shot of a tree. Most of the episodes are irrelevant to anything... and no major underlying plot was perceivable. 
 
The story seems to lull and just spin around nothing. Its all about a big rock creature that shows up in the first episode. For the entire 22 episodes I've seen, the plot advanced at a snail's pace. Basically nothing changed. I finally couldn't take it anymore so I dropped it. If I could go back in time I would punch myself in the face and kick myself in the balls for even considering watching it.  
 
I had to write this because no one else had placed a negative review here. The numbers may speak for themselves. Check how many times this has been favorited. Only twice at the time that I wrote this review. 
 
In conclusion, you are completely free to watch this series. But if you're anything like me... go watch something with a more progressive plot, like paint drying on a wall.

          
 
       Helpful Yeah, I can see why this doesn't get much fanfare after seeing it years later when I bought it for my collection. Pretty much, Neo Ranga is focused on how the presence of Ranga makes the lives of the Shimabara sisters turn upside-down when they inherit a kingdom from their dead brother. The first half of the series is mostly a mix of social satire and slice-of-life comedy focused on how Ranga's presence effects the neighborhood in which the Shimabaras live in and how this invites figures like crooked politicians, the mass media, yakuza and the military to get entangled in the hijinks. From how I interpreted things, Neo Ranga was apparently poking fun of the cultural divide between those embracing Western influences and those trying to uphold the older traditions of Japan's past. While the humor was a bit hit or miss for me, the show's first half was structured well enough where it knew what it wished to focus on and things appeared to be getting interesting when the secret society called the Kyoshin Council made their move to gain influence in Japan. 
 
Sadly, the second half to Neo Ranga takes a big hit in quality as the show got too experimental for its own good in what it wanted to focus on. The focus seemed to have shifted on the tensions between the Shimabaras and the Kyoshin Council at first, but the series decided to return to its slice-of-life/ social satire mix for a bit with the addition of ""monster of the day"" plot setups compliments of the Kyoshin Council as this mixture was a bit of a miss. Some of the themes focused on with Christmas and filming for TV specials were quite outlandish compared to the first half's focus on poking fun of more influential elements of Japanese society. The series then decides to go back to being more serious for the show's final episodes with the actions of the Kyoshin Council, a third faction that gets poorly introduced and hardly any depth and attempting to philosophize the worth of freedom and worship of gods. However with the sloppy handling of these developments and not being consistent with the tone of Neo Ranga's first half, these elements for the show's finale lack the punch they could have delivered if consistently delivered throughout the title's complete run. 
 
Another area that Neo Ranga tends to be weak in is character depth. The series tacked on many of its prominent character with simple personalities such as Yuuhi being rebellious and pampered, Ushio being the heroic tomboy and Minami their stressed-out surrogate mother/ sister. While the simplicity was fine for much of the show's first half, Neo Ranga's attempts to incorporate more serious plot development and complex themes required more depth for these characters introduced. With exception to a few notable characters whose roles are expanded upon from the first half, the Shimabara sisters and most other characters don't get much depth given to their characters and their characters don't evolve too much throughout the show's run. 
 
Visual-wise, Neo Ranga does make use of cel-shaded animation in the designs of scenery and character designs which looked solid to a great extent throughout the show's run as many shots featured a great amount of detail put into the designs of scenery and monster designs. The animation isn't the title's best highlight, but it gets the job done in depicting character movement and battle scenes. 
 
Overall, I'm not really sure what drew my mind to come back to this show when I put it on hold years ago. Neo Ranga was seemingly experimenting with differing ways in which to explore its themes as its first half had a solid focus with its mix of slice-of-life and social satire while the second half became quite a mess in its overall focus. While it explores some interesting themes related to Japanese society at large, the series didn't seem to be sure how it wanted to implement them effectively while maintaining a consistent focus and tone. I suppose your mileage could vary on how well you enjoy Neo Ranga. 

          
 
       Helpful Neo Ranga 
 
 
As I stated on my anime list, it is pretty much a real Masterpiece 
 
Animation is very well done, classical in its feel, though in some eps different team was clearly in charge of the production, with a lesser quality but that did not affect the flow of the series, and they did no more than 4 eps. 
 
The plot idea may not be really original, as the use of science fiction elements and misticism is not really new in anime production, but we need to consider that Neo Ranga is nt really new, beingf one of those productions that used really well the concept. 
 
The plot has many interesting points and turns, and the action is fair without transforming it into one of those boooooring fighting animes so in fashion (sadly). 
 
The plot is carried well and without filler episodes, being a constant evolution to the final episodes. 
 
Some elements, as Minami and Haseoka, were not completely explored in the end, but then again perfection is had to achieve. 
 
The end was well done and does close the story, and yet leaves it open for a real sequel, as it did laid a very interesting ideas and plot points that could produce a really interesting sequel. 
 
Some o the plot ideas echoes animes like Demon Lord Dante, which has a really interesting plot regarding ancient powers fighting in Earth's past and mixing/victimizing humans in the process. 
 
I really liked Neo Ranga's concept, which can even be moved into full science fiction category if seen into the perspectivew that the Kyoshinkai were classified as machines by the Tao's emissaries. Tao itself being an egotistical, tyrannical entity evolved elsewhere and wishing to control everything oposing it. 
 
All in all, great show, very good anmation, very well developed plot and a really entertaining show to watch. 
 
I highly recomend it!  
 
I reasn I give it an overall 9 because the animation team was not the same through the whole series, and some characters could have been better developed. Minor over the whole of the series but yet could have been a full 10 easily.

Revealing himself to be an actual entity, Deus grants Yukiteru a ""Random Diary,"" which shows highly descriptive entries based on the future and forces him into a bloody battle royale with 11 other holders of similarly powerful future diaries. 
 
With the last person standing designated as the new god of time and space, Yukiteru must find and kill the other 11 in order to survive. He reluctantly teams up with his obsessive stalker Yuno Gasai (who also possesses such a diary), and she takes it upon herself to ensure his safety. But there's more to the girl than meets the eye, as she might have other plans for her unrequited love... 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","Yukiteru Amano (天野雪輝) is a 14-year-old, shy and daydreaming loner who observes life and jots down the events on his cell phone. His only friends are Deus Ex Machina (デウス?エクス?マキナ), the God of Space and Time, and his assistant Muru Muru (ムルムル). Deus transforms Yukiteru's phone into a Future Diary, capable of predicting the future up to ninety days. Yukiteru discovers he and eleven others are part of a battle royale survival game orchestrated by Deus. The aim of this game is to eliminate the other diary holders, the winner to succeed Deus as god and prevent the Apocalypse. Yukiteru finds himself protected by Yuno Gasai (我妻由乃), a charming but psychopathic classmate who obsessively stalks him after they had promised to go stargazing together a year before.
Two major players they encounter are terrorist Minene Uryu, who wants to destroy all religion after her parents died in a faith-fueled war; and Keigo Kurusu, a police officer who wants to end the game. Later, Kurusu betrays Yukiteru and Yuno when he discovers his bed-ridden son is suffering from a terminal illness. He assassinates diary holder Karyuudo Tsukishima and frames Yukiteru and Yuno. Minene turns to detective Masumi Nishijima, exposing Kurusu's crime. In his shame, Kurusu eliminates himself from the game.
John Bacchus, the city's mayor and designer of the Future Diaries, tries to manipulate Yukiteru's debt-ridden father Kurou into stealing his son's diary. Kurou fails, unintentionally murdering his ex-wife Rea, and is then assassinated by Bacchus' men. Yukiteru vows to win the game and resurrect his parents. He and Yuno target the remaining diary holders, Minene, Bacchus, and Kamado Ueshita who runs an orphanage. Meanwhile, Yukiteru's astute friend Aru Akise, and Nishijima investigate the discovery of three corpses in Yuno's house, two being her parents, and the third identified as being Yuno Gasai, bringing her identity into question.
Kamado's diary, which can give others substitute diaries, is connected to a supercomputer, giving citizens in the city Future Diaries as part of Bacchus' plan to help humanity evolve. Yukiteru and Yuno, Minene, Nishijima, and Yukiteru's friends storm Bacchus' headquarters. He seals himself in a bank vault owned by Yuno's parents, her fingerprints the only way to access it. Minene sacrifices herself to destroy the vault but fails, only for Aru to witness Yuno access the vault and kill Bacchus. Wanting answers, Aru confronts Deus who reveals the boy is an artificial human designed to observe the game and keep it in balance, but confirms there is a conspiracy around Yuno.
Yukiteru murders his friends and then Kamado. Aru battles Yuno, destroying her diary but discovers she has a spare. Realising the truth, Aru shows a text to Yukiteru before Yuno decapitates him. As the days to the Apocalypse approach, Yukiteru and Yuno consummate their relationship. However, Yukiteru reveals Aru's suggestion that Yuno originates from another timeline and she immediately turns on him. Muru Muru, the true mastermind behind the game's course, confirms Aru's theory. Yukiteru died and Yuno won the game in another timeline but discovered not even the power of a god could bring back the dead. In her sorrow, Yuno went back in time, creating an alternate timeline, murdering and replacing her other self.
Yuno and Muru Muru go back in time again, creating a third world, pursued by Yukiteru and Minene, kept alive by Deus as a wild card and imbued with a portion of his power. Both parties battle to protect or kill the third world's Yuno and her parents. Yuno, unable to kill Yukiteru, traps him in a dream world where she doesn't exist, and then attacks her alternate self. Yukiteru remembers Yuno, escaping his prison aided by the second world's Muru Muru, and stops Yuno. Though Yukiteru asks Yuno to kill him so she can live, she instead eliminates herself and dies in his arms. Yukiteru becomes god and is dragged to the second world by Muru Muru.
Ten-thousand years later, a mournful Yukiteru has done nothing with his godly powers. He managed to cut off all influences that the first and second worlds had with the third and prevents the third world's deus from dying. Yukiteru gazes at his diary, mourning that he will never see the first world Yuno, the only one he will ever love, ever again. However, the interdimensional walls are broken down by the third world Yuno, who possesses the first world's memories courtesy of an atoning Muru Muru. Yukiteru and Yuno reunite as gods of the second world and prepare to fulfill their promise to go stargazing with each other.
","Survival anime, one of my favorite genres, I love stories where a lot of people die just to reach the goal of the game, then we have Mirai Nikki, or Future Diary, if you like the dub, which is actually pretty bad. 
 
Our protagonist Amano Yukkiteru is put in a survival game which will choose who is the new god of time and space, you have to kill eleven players in other to win. The only tool you have to prevent you from dying, is a diary that tells the future and what's to happen to you. Yukki doesn't want to become god or get killed, he later meets a girl named Yuno Gasai, aKa the queen of yanderes, who is willing to kill anyone who touches Yuki, mostly because she's crazy for him. 
 
Now let me tell why this is on my top 20 favorite anime series. 
 
First thing to start off is the characters. My favorite character is not Yuno, it's the 9th, Uryuu Minene. She's such a badass and a character that I can relate when it comes to death situations. Another character I admire is Akisa Aru, he may not be part of the game, but he plays a huge role in the series when comes to keep Yukki alive. I like Yuno too, but I wish she was less horny for Yukki. I like Yukki too, he starts off as a wimpy crybaby but he later becomes , determined guy every since, well, the incident happened, but he's a still a crybaby. 
 
The setting is ideal for a story like this, a normal city in Japan where probably nothing bad will happen, well, you can guess what happens next, lots of psychological shit. 
 
Overall, a great psychologic survival suspence story with an amazing plot and characters. Defenently a highly recommending serie for people who love survival anime or guys with insane lovesick girlfriends. 

          
 
       Helpful Where do I begin? Before watching this, I did my usual background research over this show to see if it was worth watching. I started this show with mixed feelings, I was excited to indulge in a enticing premise involving future diaries, but at the same time I was sceptical because of all the poor reviews that the show received. BUT, I'm thankful that I managed to overlook the fact that the show was not all that well-received and still carried on with it. In return, I was rewarded with a beautiful story.  
 
I shall first start with the bad points of the show, and the reason why many dislike it. The execution of the story isn't done very well, with the plot being rushed at some points in time and becoming too slow at the next, there also isn't as much suspense as there should be for a mystery thriller genre. The story itself is also filled with too many disconnected story arcs that makes it feel as though you're watching many sub stories instead of one as a whole. As for the characters, I personally found all characters to be pretty too over the top and extreme and only took fancy to Yuno, Akise, and Minene. Character development definitely wasn't this anime's strong point, with pretty big personality inconsistency with the two mains (although personally I found them to be justifiable).  
 
HOWEVER, I was still able to enjoy myself throughout the course of watching this anime because the ending is spectacular. Without revealing too much, I just want to mention that nearing the ending episodes, things start to go a little crazy and just when you think you know what will happen next, the most unexpected of things happen. With one of the CRAZIEST plot twists, and some unexpected themes that are a personal favourite of mine, I can't help but love this anime for it. The romance in this anime, although extremely unconventional because Yuno is a yandere, was still nice to root for as it progressed and Yuki began to have a change in his feelings for Yuno.  
 
Adding on, I really enjoyed the art and music for this, with one of the most beautiful pieces of instrumental piano in touching moments, it really adds to the tenderness of the scenes, giving them more FEELS! It really depends on a personal level whether or not you will enjoy this anime. If you're someone that has an extremely keen eye for details or plot holes, then perhaps you would be too bothered by the bad parts of Mirai Nikki to enjoy it. But if you're looking for a compelling story, go ahead and watch it! 

          
 
       Helpful NO SPOILERS. I promise! :) 
 
Mirai Nikki, for most people, will be a hit or miss. It tries to combine a HELL of a lot of genres into one small package's worth of 26 episodes. There's probably a misconception that Mirai Nikki can be classified a ""psychological thriller"" the same way Death Note or Steins;Gate is commonly labeled, however, Mirai Nikki takes on a slightly different tone. At its core, Mirai Nikki was a romance. 
 
 
Story - 8 
 
It's difficult to judge Mirai Nikki's story. While it's concept is incredibly unique, it's hard to say that the presentation of it is done well. The plot twists are unexpected and wild, especially as the story reaches its climax, but gaping plot holes tarnish the experience a bit. You will NOT enjoy Mirai Nikki's story if you are expecting a bulletproof mystery story. 
 
The first few episodes were extremely interesting for me. As the story progresses, however, it becomes apparent that many questions are left unanswered, and the show starts to become dull and dragged on. Mirai Nikki is another example of an anime that was too long for the story it had to tell. However, the show pulls itself together during the final episodes and picks up the pace in time to leave a mixed final impression.  
 
 
Art - 9 
 
The art is great, but not outstanding. It's evident that a lot of work was put into the action scenes to make it, well, action, and characters are drawn well. Overall, the art scheme is simply very fitting for what Mirai Nikki is. It's dark enough to be taken seriously as an action/psychological/thriller, but comedic and lighthearted as well for the aspects that need it. Mood changes within the anime are carried out pretty well. 
 
 
Sound - 9 
 
Great openings, endings, and BGM. Nothing too memorable, though. 
 
 
Character - 10 
 
Character is where Mirai Nikki becomes something to love or hate. For one thing, there are so many characters in this anime that it could not possibly hope to develop all of them or properly introduce them. The one thing it never falters from, however, is the focus on the two main characters, Yuki and Yuno. And this is where I believe Mirai Nikki truly shines. 
 
A note on the main protagonist: Yuki is the typical Shinji archetype. He's weak, pathetic, and socially screwed, and although he goes through some incredible character development, he never becomes strong. If you are looking for that kind of Shounen anime, you should turn away now, because this kind of main character gets annoying REALLY fast.  
 
There is no doubt in my heart, though, that Yuki becomes an entirely different person at the end of the show. He goes through a beautiful cycle of love, depression, misunderstanding and regret. Although Yuno's character development seems nonexistent at first, she is a truly unique character that is slowly unraveled and developed as well as the story reaches its climax. 
 
 
Enjoyment - 8 
 
Overall, I was pleased with the feeling that Mirai Nikki gave me. The only aspect of the show that brought it down to an 8 was that the story dragged on too long in the middle and my interest waned. I was pleasantly surprised, however, as the series finished. And although I usually come to dislike most endings, the ending to Mirai Nikki wasn't too bad. 
 
 
Overall - 9 
 
Watch it for a unique experience, but it may not be what you're looking for.

Hiyori Iki has yet to have her loose soul fixed by Yato, but she enjoys life and prepares to attend high school nonetheless. 
 
Taking place immediately after the first season,  Noragami Aragoto  delves into the complicated past between Yato and the god of war Bishamon. The female god holds a mysterious grudge against Yato, which often results in violent clashes between them. It doesn't help that Bishamon's most trusted and beloved Regalia, Kazuma, appears to be indebted to Yato. When lives are on the line, unraveling these mysteries and others may be the only way to correct past mistakes. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","Hiyori Iki was a normal middle school student until she was involved in a bus accident while trying to protect a stranger. This incident causes her soul to frequently slip out of her body, and she becomes aware of the existence of two parallel worlds: the Near Shore, where regular humans and creatures reside, and the Far Shore, where phantoms (demonic beasts) and human souls linger. Through her soul, she meets the strange, nameless god without a shrine, Yato. Yato is determined to make a name for himself out there by accepting any wishes for 5 yen coins , including Hiyori's to fix her body. Along with Yato's Regalia — a weapon from a spirit (dead human’s soul), and named by the god in question — Yukine/Yuki, the trio go through many adventures struggling with their friendship, identity, and pasts.
","Fall 2015 was a season filled to the brim with disappointments.  Things like the failed trio of shows developed by Silver Link to other spinoffs and shows that just didn't really get up there in terms of quality.  Thankfully, Bones was able to provide us a second adaptation to the Noragami series to make up where the other shows failed or didn't do as proficiently.   
 
Story: Aragato, as I will refer to this second season of Noragami as, continues the story of the our titular main trio of characters, Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine as they continue fighting Phantoms and dealing with various godly issues.   
 
From a story standpoint, Aragato picks up directly where the first season ended, moving onto two more arcs, the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs, where the show puts more focus on those characters rather than our main cast.  What makes this season different than the first one is how more developed the world is.  More of the world of gods is introduced to us, as well as the backstory to previously unknown developments in the first season, including who Yato is (kind of), and what was up with Bishamon's boundless hatred towards Yato.   
 
One more thing that makes this season better is the fact that the show really puts focus on Yato as a character, as the arcs that are presented here really put emphasis onto Yato as a character and really develop him as he works his way up the proverbial 'corporate ladder' in order to become an important god.  Not only for Yato though, the story arcs that are presented also develop the characters that they're named after; the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs.  These gods in addition get quite a bit of attention and really make sense.   
 
All in all, the big issue that I have with this show is the fact that the show didn't really put much emphasis on Hiyori or Yukine.  Sure, the show was never really about either one of them personally, but as members of the main cast, they weren't really all THAT important in context, and because the show focused on Yato primarily, they were shelved off to the side most of the time.  Also, the last episode wasn't really all that grand.  It just kinda trailed off after everything happened.  I know the climax happened before, but it just seemed like it was just leading into another season which I do hope we get, cause this story is really good. 
 
Overview: 
+  Character development 
+  Interesting story arcs 
-  Kind of a bland end 
 
Characters: As mentioned before, the characters for Noragami are more or less split into characters that carry a lot of weight for the show, or just simply add to the story. 
 
Up first, we have Yato, the main protagonist in this entire Japanese god story.  Reprising his role as the Delivery God, Yato himself takes a huge brunt of development in this story, particularly in the second half, as he aids the two featured gods in this season with their issues and problems.  Yato changes, he changes over the course of the entire season so much that you the growth really becomes apparent from episode to episode.  It's great change that is really appreciated because you don't get to see the amount of development or attention he gets all that much anymore.   
 
Other characters that deserve mention are Ebisu and Bishamon.  As the two other gods that take the main role in this season, both of these gods have issues and major problems that Yato spends the entire arc fixing and helping.  In addition to Yato changing, these gods of fortune are shown to alter themselves as time goes on, growing alongside our main character, creating a change that is both noticeable and pleasant to watch.  (Sadly, I can't say how or why because...spoilers.) 
 
The one problem I have about this season comes with the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both are sort of shafted to the sidelines.  Both of these characters while extremely important in the first season, don't really have all that much of an impact as a whole in Aragato.  They're important to some extent, adding to the series since they are the two most important people to Yato, but in terms of importance and development, they don't really contribute to that aspect all too much. 
 
Other characters for the most part serve a similar role to Hiyori and Yukine.  Since they are more or less related to the respective gods that they are associated with, (Like Kazuma to Bishamon), their change or role in the series stems off from that part about them and really nothing else.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since they're supporting cast, yet they still take a good foothold and have quite a lot of importance in the series. 
 
Overview: 
+ Good character development for featured gods 
+  Good supporting cast 
-  Most of the Main cast gets kind of shafted... 
 
Art:  The animation for Aragato was produced by Studio Bones, and as such, hosts a fantastic  artstyle that reflects the style of the series.  The artwork is very clean and holds both a mystical and eerie tone to it, as the Phantoms and Yomi both have that feel to it.   
 
in addition, the fluidity of the battle scenes and the appearance of the more magical aspects (like huge magical rings) are both outstanding to look at.  While maybe not as fantastic as other things in terms of staggering beauty in terms of fight scenes like other fight scenes in recent years, but it's still great to look at.   
 
Overview: 
+ Good, clean art 
+ Fight scene fluidity 
 
Sound: Like last season, Noragami employed a rock band to give us once again, another great OP by the name of ""Hey Kids"" by the Oral Cigarettes which is not only an action heavy song that fits with the visuals of the OP, but is also very memorable and quite addicting to listen to.   
 
The ED on the other hand doesn't really fit with the show as it sounds...rather happy and joyful.  It's pretty memorable and it's a good song but...it doesn't really fit Noragami.   
 
Overview: 
+ Great and memorable songs 
-  ED doesn't really fit... 
 
Personal Enjoyment: I enjoy Noragami.  As a series, it boasts a lot of connection to Shintoism and has great and enjoyable characters in addition to a very engaging plot that never deviates from what it wants to do.  It's a consistently great series that I very much enjoy watching. 
 
Did I like this anime? 
 
Noragami is a series that never fails to impress me.  There are virtually no flaws with it as for me, it never fails to engage me into its plot and throughout the whole series, I never lost any interest in watching it.  It gripped me in and I was always happy to see another epsiode come in. 
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
I'm not a big fan of the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both really never make too much of an impact in this season.  Sure they are in the show and they help move the plot along quite frequently and well, but they just felt a lot less important this season and as such, I was a bit disappointed simply because they didn't have as much impact on the plot as they did before. 
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
Overall, Noragami as a series is one that I would recommend to watch.  It's a very well written story that I feel is just good period, something that you don't normally see with a lot of anime these days.  It's not without its flaws, but they're not so glaring that they would hinder the watching of the series.  That being said, only watch Aragato after the first season because it wouldn't really make sense to watch season 2 before season 1.

Big Wars comes out of the period of anime history when Sci-Fi was the clear and present King of the medium. This stage in the development of the industry suffered a myriad of triumphs and epic failures. Big Wars is one of those obscure movies that falls somewhere in-between. 
 
The basic storyline is familiar enough. Humanity has colonized Mars and, following the opening of transforming operations, is attacked by an alien race known as ""The Gods"". A massive, technologically advanced war ensues over the next several decades in which (it is implied) there has been no real significant progress.  
 
Big Wars lives up to its name in principle (though it is limited slightly in its presentation). We are greeted by massive clouds of fighters, reports of whole cities being wiped out as if it’s nothing, sand Battleships (that's right: BATTLESHIPS! MANLY!), and a stealth carrier named ""Hell"". Without spoiling anything, essentially a cruiser/battleship captain is assigned a covert task-force (how they expect to keep a battleship covert is beyond me, but I didn't write this) and is eventually assigned to take-out the Hell. 
 
The majority of the movie is taken up by references to the actual battlefield action and focuses more on cloak & dagger intrigue. The Gods have the ability to spread a sort of ""mind control"" virus enabling them to recruit spies and terrorists from within the human ranks. Really most of the story deals with this issue and the Post-Vietnam era ""concept-of-war"" dialogue. Likely, this movie would have fared better by sticking to the battlefield action. 
 
If I wanted to be crude about it, I could sum it up thus: 
Explosions-Sex-Spies-Sex-Spies+Explosions-Explosions 
 
I've seen much better work in the art department, even from this period. None the less, the sand battleships are rather well-drawn and fun to watch. The characters are well-designed as well (artistically speaking anyway). The battlefield art varies, though should be given on the basis that it is mostly the standard issue of having massive amounts of units impacting presentation. 
 
The dub did not make me cringe. It may just be me, but CPM's old dubs don't seem as bad as one usually expects. Though possibly this is just my primary exposure bias, or getting used to English versions. Battle sound effects are nothing unique, and often seem repetitive. I've yet to track down a Japanese language version, so I have nothing to compare it to. The sex scenes may be seen as overplayed (though this is common; note, however, that upon learning the actual story, the overplay actually fits). 
 
This movie fails pretty hard on the issue of characterization. It's hard to sympathize with anyone, and I came out of it not even sure which side I wanted to win the war. To me Big Wars couldn't make up its mind as to whether the Gods of the Humans were the morally upright ones. This would actually be an interesting aspect, except I'm fairly certain it wasn't done on purpose, merely as poor writing. No individual is given nearly enough time (even with screen-hogging most of the movie Captain) for anyone to get a sense of the people. The best we get are vague references to past events and lack of real character development. 
 
Summing everything up, I am surprised to say I enjoyed watching the movie to a certain extent. I have a fondness for large-scale war anime (they are a rarity these days), plus as an 80s movies I just had to see it. For those of you wondering if you should give this one a try: I'd say ""yes"". I am not one to shy away from the mediocre; if I did that I could hardly appreciate the good. Big Wars has a certain charm of its own in its massive battle scales and plot-deprived sex scenes; giving a rather decent feel for what entertainment really meant back in the early 80s: sex and explosions, with a token dash of espionage.  
 
It's certainly not for everyone, and I'd recommend it even less than I would Space Adventure Cobra the movie. It's a movie for war fans, or for those of you that have a particularly boring day and want to entertain yourselves MTS3K style.

          
 
       Helpful If you looking for a good sci-fi anime movie, this isn't it.  Everything about this 1993 anime movie is average to bad.  From the story about the future of Mars and the war there with the mysterious aliens to the uncharismatic characters to the bad music.  This anime movie is one of the ones you don't want to see.  If they hadn't tried to make it so big of a movie it might have been better.  The creators of the anime movie should had made it into a OVA or a short series.  I think it would have been much better had they done that.

          
 
       Helpful The title of this movie, ‘Big Wars’, did not leave one with the impression that it would be a film with any intellectual substance or emotive storytelling. In fact, the effect of such a ridiculous title is to whet the male appetite for explosions and guns and blood, guts and gore. It creates an expectation that the following hour will be spent ogling over sense of intense cruelty and wave after wave of laser cannon induced bloodshed. That ‘Big Wars’ failed to deliver in this regard is as much a shock to me as it probably will be to you. 
 
Rather than use this opportunity to create an entertaining, unintelligent exploitation piece that will appease bottom feeders such as myself, the creators of this turgid anime have developed a taste for luxuries, and have attempted to give the film a plot that lies out with the abilities of the writing staff. And it quickly turns what seemed like a promising happy hour of hack n’ slash into one of the largest battle to maintain consciousness this reviewer has ever faced. 
 
Our story begins as so many of its contemporaries do; with a lightning fast multiple paragraph explanation of the setting and basic premise of the story. This is seldom used in quality productions and for good reason- it leaves the audience with the impression that the film itself will either be incomplete or inadequate. Both of these hold true in the case of ‘Big Wars’. To summarise, in the somewhat distant future humanity has colonised Mars, and in doing so have awoken the wrath of the ‘Gods’ who may or may not be the creators of the Universe. They begin a long war with the humans residing on both Earth and Mars. 
 
 The opening passage does not however prevent the writers from stumbling through irritatingly obvious exposition and awkward dialogue for the first ten minutes of the film. For example, in the opening scene the protagonist arrives at a Martian airport, complete with security so overzealous they make real life airport security seem haphazard: no less than three announcements warning the public of the imminent threat of terror attacks and ‘subversion’ by the Gods. Needless to say this kills any chance of suspense when a terror attack occurs only seconds later. Despite a sizable explosion, the insurgents are quickly dispatched and life returns to normal at the airport. Making his way down an escalator, our protagonist bumps into an old flame, and they promptly make arrangements for the first of many a sexual liaison. These occur several times throughout the film, typically whenever things start to lose direction or things get boring. Meanwhile, the audience is given several hints that our protagonist’s old flame is under the God’s ‘subversion’, in case they were unable to figure it out in the opening sequence. With any possibility for intrigue killed stone dead by the blitzkrieg foreshadowing, the rest of the first half of the film becomes tedious. Eventually the story progresses towards the titular ‘big war’ and the prospect of penance for its quasi-religious meandering in the first half.  
 
Unfortunately, despite the warnings that the attack will be a suicide mission, the level of carnage is a more than a tad disappointing. There are a few gorey deaths in store for the less important members of the crew as well as some extra-terrestrial deicide, but not in levels which can account for the forty tiresome minutes spent building up to it. Instead of the mass slaughter we have been led to anticipate, we instead g et several hallucination scenes featuring our protagonist’s old flame, which are gratuitous without exception- appearing nude in every one and doing all manner of bizarre things. 
 
The greatest strength ‘Big Wars’ has is its animation, which is of fair quality. Similar productions are often wrought with elementary animation errors and cheap production but ‘Big Wars’ maintains an acceptable standard throughout, although this can be accounted more to the lack of high-paced action sequences and the simple character designs.  Camera use is fairly standard, but thankfully free from poor panning shots. The biggest problem with the film’s art is that the vast majority of scenes are very dark, resulting in poor picture definition. This is a common problem among science fiction anime from this era but this doesn’t stop it from becoming irritating. 
 
The soundtrack on the other hand is eclectic but completely unfit for purpose; it simply never gets it right. It’s primarily composed of Bossa Nova influenced 80s synth music, which gives off a jungle vibe completely unsuitable for a story set in space or the desert surface of the red planet. It was presumably chosen to emphasise the ‘hallucination’ sequences but even then fails to pull it off. Finally there is the voice acting. A subtitled Japanese version of the film is available but when you’re watching something like this, the English dub is the preferred choice, for comedic value. Though it features the same dry acting you would anticipate, unfortunately the lines are seldom ridiculous enough to be amusing. 
 
On the whole, “Big Wars” felt more like a “Big Waste of Time” and I wouldn’t recommend that you bother, even if you are normally fond of the ‘so bad it’s good’ variety of eighties/nineties OVAs. You could do a lot better watching another series like Angel Cop, Black Lion or Mad Bull 34. On the other hand if you have exhausted these possibilities and you’re desperate this one may be worth your while. However, if you are looking for something genuinely good to watch, this is definitely not worthy of your consideration.

","I was expecting quite a lot from this anime, and I didn't get it. The characters are attractive, the story sounded interesting enough on paper, but it just lacked style. Some of the scripting is so forced and unrealistic that it just makes you squirm with embarrassment. And the fight scenes...erm...they got glossed over. The scenarios and the plot were far too &quot;convenient&quot;, pushing the bishounen characters into situations where they could touch each other endearingly (aka inappropriately, yahoo!) and struggle with their inner most feelings (aka lots of angst). 
Saint Best is a bishounen-fest. There isn't really much else to recommend it. There are only ( I think) 2 female characters in it; a goddess who seems to need her strapping lads to do everything for her and a midget angel that bounces about thinking she's being very cute (aka putting &quot;dechu&quot; on the end of every sentence - argh!) 
If you're happy with just looking at the characters (lets be fair, they do look nice) then go for it, but I recommend turning off the audio and subs, because otherwise you'll spend a lot of time cringing.

          
 
       Helpful Don't expect more than light shounen-ai fluff out of this one -- you'll be disappointed. Story-wise, there isn't much to see here. The first few episodes are monster of the day type encounters that are supposed to give us some insight into the main characters (while simultaneously placing them in position to be slashed with each other.) The story picks up in the last two episodes, at which point it promptly ends without actually coming to a conclusion. The action is scant, and consists mainly of posed characters dashing across the screen making slashing attacks that do more damage to clothing than to anything else. That is, of course, when they bothered animating the action at all. In several instances the fighting takes place off screen, while the other characters comment on the battle. This ended up being very irritating; luckily, there's hardly any fighting that doesn't start and end in an energy blast after the second episode. 
 
The characters themselves, while terribly attractive, aren't anything special. They follow standard bishounen archetypes: Gou is the strong-willed, stoic leader, Shin the quiet, wise one (and he's got the spectacles to prove it,) Rei is bizarrely effeminate and sensitive, and young Gai is the head-strong, childish type. There isn't sufficient back-story to make any of the characters particularly sympathetic, and the attempts at placing them in relationships are weak and somewhat tawdry. ""One time he was nice to me!"" *blush*  
 
I wanted more out of this series, especially with such a great cast and an appealing premise (I get a kick out of angelic pretty boys,) but I was left unsatisfied. If you happen to have exhausted your supply of bishounen lovin' and need some RIGHT NOW, go ahead and give this a gander. Otherwise, move along. Nothing to see here.

","I've been on a streak of positive reviews recently, so to shake things up and prove I still know how to criticize where criticism is due, here are my thoughts on a show so bland I dropped it TWICE. 
 
-Story- 
 
'Hero Tales' is as generic as the name would have you believe. Setting a story in medieval China (or a fantasy look-alike) is as common in East Asian media as setting a Western fantasy in medieval Europe. The basic plot isn't any more original, following seven warriors who are each the reincarnation of various warrior deities, with two (conveniently our protagonist and antagonist) being well-known as the most powerful while the other five pick sides. Why are they fighting? THE KARMA OF THE STARS!!! Now, the concept of fate and free will has been with humans as long we've told stories, but it can also be a crutch for the author who can use it as a cheap cop-out. In this case, 'Hero Tales' uses fate and karma as an excuse to drive the plot in the absence of developed character motivations. 
 
The story itself actually isn't bad, but it plays so painfully and unimaginatively close to formula that there's nothing to make it good either. Anything you see here you've seen better elsewhere. 
 
-Art- 
 
Hiromu Arakawa created one of the most famous manga series of all time with 'Fullmetal Alchemist'. That fame creates a bit of a problem when she tries to reuse the character designs in other works- you'll be playing ""Spot the FMA character"" while watching this show (and judging by 'The Heroic Legend of Arslan' this is a recurring mistake for her). The quality and aesthetic are nothing impressive either, having decent animation but a very generic and simple palette - lots of bright, flat colors. The series doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look good either (noticing a trend here?) 
 
-Sound- 
 
When not even J. Michael Tatum can't make his character sound very interesting, the show most likely has a writing deficiency. English dub voice actors do fine, but the sound is still pretty generic (nobody is given much that's memorable to say, so there's little opportunity to shine or suck). The soundtrack does nothing special either, the OP and ED are very basic. 
 
-Characters- 
 
The cast wouldn't be unique even if their designs weren't copy-pasted from a stupendously better series. Taitou is the untouched archetype of a Shonen protagonist: loud, violent, not terribly bright, and a big eater. The rest stick extremely close to archetype as well: the not-related-by-blood-so-it-technically-wouldn't-be-consanguinity sister, the goofball best friend, the pirate with a good heart, the bad girl with a good heart, the warlord who wants to take over for kicks and giggles- it's all been done before. The only interesting one is the assassin Shimei, who doesn't care who actually wins so long as he gets to watch a good show- however, he's a relatively minor character. The point where I stopped watching 'Hero Tales' for the second time came when a certain character switched sides and joined the villain- because the villain said he was fighting for peace. No explanation of how his evil deeds would actually bring peace, his just stated that was his goal and this character (who knew his evil deeds full well) simply up and joined him with hardly a moment's hesitation. And that's when I left.  
 
-Enjoyment- 
 
It was good for a while as 'turn your brain off' fun, but with the plot taking its sweet time to get anywhere and the cast not being interesting enough to make up for it, it dropped the show. Then a few months later I took a second stab at it, nothing got better, and when the dumb plot twist I just said 'forget it' and haven't bothered with Hero Tales since. I rarely drop a series because I won't start one unless I think there's a good chance I'll like it. I took a gamble on this one and it failed. 
 
-Overall- 
 
'Hero Tales' doesn't actually stink, but for the same reason there's nothing good to note either: it's utterly generic. You can avoid catastrophic failure by sticking to the archetype, but you'll never be remembered for it one way or the other (people like to crap on ""School Days"", but they're still talking about it long after they've forgotten other more generic romantic dramas). It's not worth watching for something good, or just to see how bad it can get. Skip this lukewarm series, I doubt it's worth your time.

          
 
       Helpful There were so many negative reviews I felt compelled to leave a positive one because I actually quite liked it. 
 
The anime itself I feel isn't as bad as others are making it out to be. I feel the reason it leaves a bad taste in people's mouth is because they try to over complicate things. 
 
The story is a straight forward good vs evil fantasy set in a fictional ancient empire. It's the classic save the world from an overpowered evil power hell bent on wreaking havoc. The plot is somewhat predictable and the characters lack depth but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for an anime like this. 
 
Who is this anime for? If you want to sit back and watch an entertaining, easy to digest anime with tons of action, comedy and the characters have an unwavering sense of loyalty and duty then this is for you. It's an adventure from start to finish and the plot isn't tied down to any one location. Nothing is over complicated and the anime doesn't emphasise on character's emotional baggage. 
 
I wouldn't call this the best anime out there, or even one of the greats, but if you come in with realistic expectations then there's a good chance you'll enjoy it as much as I have.

          
 
       Helpful In the sea of shounen anime, it takes a lot to stand out in the crowd. No matter how hard a work tries to be different, it is constantly compared to its genre-kin. Such is the fate of any work. Jyuushin Enbu: Hero Tales (HT) is a series that plays it safe, yet somehow finds a way to stick with viewers even after the last somewhat cliche scenes.  
 
Story: 8 
 
HT is a story about a simple-minded young man named Taito who is just living his life with his family, minding his own business, when Keiro, a power-hungry warlord busts down his door and demands for the sacred sword that will make him the emperor. Taito, barely surviving his confrontation with Keiro, soon learns that the two of them have their fates tied to two celestial deities and their destines are mapped out by the Karma of the Stars. Taito knows that he can't face Keiro alone so he, along with his sister Laila, embark on a quest to gather the five Celestial Guardians and take down the Dubhe warmonger, Keiro, before Empire collapses under the powers of fate itself. 
 
The plot is very by-the-books shonen: one guy needs to gather whole bunch of other guys to beat the final boss. Despite that, the anime deserves more credit for what it does right. It shows the development of character strength in a realistic fashion. It throws wrenches in the heroes' road to Keiro and the good part about that is that the good guys don't always win. Characters that Taito and his friends love die before their eyes. The cast discovers themselves and while some may find closure, others only find more conflict. Soon, those trapped within fate's plans try to break free and make their own choices. This is a show that could not have been rushed, and it is clear that time was taken to make sure that the audience could develop a feeling for the characters. Sure, you might guess that they'd probably win later down the line, but at what cost?  
 
Action is the obvious focus of the series and the action present is quite well done. Fighting isn't every episode, but its in the episodes that matter. The comedy in the series is decent, nothing ground breaking. However, there are a few scenes where despair is accurately portrayed. You'll feel the anguish, the exhaustion and the desperation of the characters, especially during the conclusion. Its a shame that the conclusion wasn't wholly original, but as I said earlier, this anime plays it safe genre-wise but that's not always a bad thing.  
 
Art: 8  
 
Anyone who has seen FMA can notice the striking similarity to the art in HT. Its an art style that will probably pique at least a ""oh, that looks like FMA."" It was the reason why I decided to give this series a chance. 
 
The animation is solid. Character designs are pretty down to earth, at least by anime standards. What really stands out is the choice to make a very Chinese-esque setting. While colors don't pop off the screen, the series at least makes an effort to look different than a lot of modern shounen.  
 
Sound: 7  
 
Each one of the openings is catchy in its own way, especially the first one. The first ending left a lot to be desired but the second ending was very good. It maintains the kind of the typical friendship theme but is still a very nice track, even though there is some sub-par engrish. That part is all to opinion, however. The rest of the BGM is composed of mostly Chinese-influenced tracks that don't help or hurt the series. The voice acting fits each character nicely.  
 
Characters: 7 
 
There seems to be an inherit problem with a lot of shounens: too many characters, not enough development for the vast majority. Taito doesn't change that much and neither does Keiro, but each fufills their role perfectly. Keiro is a brutal warmonger who uses anyone and anything to achieve his ends and isn't afraid to kill his own men to do so. Taito, on the other hand, is a knuckle head powered by friendship. While at times he can be a fool, he knows how to bring out the best in people. He's an all around good guy and proceeds to at least he fufill his role. Ryuko is the rival of Taito and the two of them eventually cross paths. Along the way to fight Keiro, Ryuko learns a lot about himself and he eventually needs to work out his priorities and loyalties in life. Hosei is the clown of the group, but he too begins to see that there are more important things than making fun of Taito's habit of repeating himself.  
 
Sadly, that's about as far as the character development goes. Laila does a decent job at standing out in the little sister crowd (she's not in love with Taito, by the way, which is a nice bonus) and she and Rinmei have a blast with the ""Men are useless"" club, but neither of them go farther than that. All of the others character don't go too far with their developments either. There are a few other side characters that make a splash, but their significance is better left to be experienced rather than just explained.  
 
Overall, HT doesn't go far with its characters, but the subtle details do matter and the party chemistry is still entertaining none the less.  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
So, what makes HT so enjoyable? Is it the actions scenes, the comedy, or the friendship? My answer: Why not all three? What really makes it stand apart is actually the very thing that makes it seem so unremarkable: Its absolutely shounen. It should be a must see for anyone just getting into anime, but wants an alternative to those big series. HT is all the shounen goodness anyone could possible ask for in just 26 episodes. It might not rock the boat, but it coasts relatively smoothly. Unlike a lot shounen that try to be more, HT is comfortable with what it is and the passion really shows. Its plays out and sticks with the audience like how an ancient Chinese myth might stick with a person: Looking back, isn't aren't anything brilliant but still enjoyable and deserves to be shared.

12,12293,45,7.213225797,Story between god and human,Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maou,"Some people suddenly find religion, but for 16-year-old Kusanagi Godou, it's that REALLY old time religion that's found him! As the result of defeating the God of War in mortal combat, Godou's stuck with the unwanted position of Campione!, or God Slayer, whose duty is to fight Heretical Gods whenever they try to muscle in on the local turf. Not only is this likely to make Godou roadkill on the Highway to Heaven, it's also a job that comes with a lot of other problems. Like how to deal with the fact that his ""enhanced status"" is attracting a bevy of overly-worshippy female followers. After all, they're just there to aid him in his demi-godly duties, right? So why is it that their leader, the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, seems to have such a devilish interest in encouraging some VERY unorthodox activities? Get ready for immortal affairs, heavenly harems and lots of dueling deities taking pious in the face as the ultimate smash, bash and thrash of the Titans rocks both Heaven and Earth. 
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Magic', 'Romance']","Godou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who had to retire due to injury, is asked by his grandfather to return a stone tablet to a friend in Sardinia named Lucrezia Zora. After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, Verethragna. After killing the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Erica, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular. Every time he fights a god, he kisses one of the girls he has brought with him.
","This anime is ""alright"" in a general aspect. The story development executes an understandable set of events while also handling character development considerably well, and we get to see the male lead turn into a dynamic part of the anime. Campione! also gives a good reason to why it's labeled as ""ecchi,"" and I'm sure you won't be disappointed when you watch. Though, after about halfway into the anime, it just feels dragged-on and get's quite boring in my opinion. It was really hard to watch Campione! after about seven episodes, but the conclusion to the animeography made the wait well-worth it. 

          
 
       Helpful There are a few basic conditions that you have to meet to like this anime. 
1. Do you like mythology? (Mostly Greek, with a little bit of Persian and Egyptian) 
2. Do you like harem?  
 
The first one is extremely important. The entire story revolves around mythical gods and heroes, so if you get bored from that kind of stuff or just straight out don't like it, this anime is not for you.  
 
Godou, the main character, defeats a god called Verethragna, the Oriental god of War and Victory. He takes his powers, called Authorities, and basically his job is to fight other mythological gods who threaten humanity's safety, although that's not really the focal point. The overall threat is the Prophecy of the Starless Night, which says a rogue god will claim his/her powers and end the world. But being a God-Slayer and all, he naturally attracts girls and that's where the harem part comes in, but the girls play a crucial part in each of his battles, so it's not just about them falling in love with him. The plot sounds a bit cheesy, and to some extent, it is. That's why it's so important that you do enjoy stories about mythology, or else this show will bore you.  
But if you do love mythology like I do, you're going to love this show. The fight scenes are epic; not just the action, but the dialogue exchanged between the opponents.  
 
The art and sound are brilliant; the battle theme used is pretty incredible; search it up on Youtube if you want a listen.  
 
As far as characters go, I really liked the male harem lead since he was kind but also badass; some harem leads may be kind but they're too weak. He tries to be a pacifist, but if one of his friends is in trouble, he'll do anything to help them.  
The main girl, Erica Blandelli, is powerful, seductive, and intelligent. She saves Godou's life multiple times, and he definitely could not have made it far without her. She constantly professes her love to him, but he remains doubtful, and you will see why after the second episode. He doubts her, but he also says he trusts her completely, so their interaction is pretty entertaining as you try to figure out who's really in control of their relationship.  
 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I have an obsession with mythology, so if you like that kind of stuff too, definitely give this a watch. If not, I'd still recommend it if you like comedy and harem mixed in with epic fight scenes.  
 


          
 
       Helpful The first episode was a bit rushed to me but after watching more the story and the plot have started to flow naturally. The characters are absolutely daring and funny to watch them interact with one another. It has everything to make an anime great filled with funny moments romance, mythological powers, fighting and ofcourse love twists. I have to say i absolutely love this series because of all the genres that this  series brings to the table and i for one will continue to watch. And hope for more seasons to come. I will post another for upcoming episodes because this show keeps me wanting more

","It's an disappointment. The story is just plain out bad, you can feel when watching the anime that it's just looking for anything they can do to make it feel entertaining. They drag out unnecessary scenes over the whole episodes. They try to drag out anything to stall time so they can find a story to animate. The animation is bad, it's clean but bad. Poor camera angels mixed with poor animation and you have a dragon ball super fight. Fight scenes have nothing with them except for punching and kamehameha's. fighting choreography is close to none.  I heard that the animators for dragon ball super are new to animation and is just beginning to animate. And you can see how little the creator of dragon balls care about it. Dragon balls used to be a an anime like one punch man, you weren't really there for the story just more for the raw power fights. But it has really gone downhill. If you have watched all the other dragon balls and is wondering if this is worth watching, my answer to you is no. Do not watch it, it will ruin everything you liked about dragon balls 


          
 
       Helpful Does anybody remember when Goku went Super Saiyan for the first time? It was on Namek, the whole arc had been building up Frieza as this impossibly strong monster, the Z Fighters had to fight tooth and nail just to defeat his lackies. The only reason we had to hope that Goku stood a chance was this mysterious term floating around about a ""Super Saiyan."" Unless you were following the manga as it came out, you knew how it was going to go, Goku would go Super Saiyan and beat the alien tyrant in a classic case of good defeats evil. But, that's not how it goes. Sure, Goku unlocks the legendary power and is able to beat Frieza, but it's only after all the Namekians are dead, it was only after Vegeta had gone from unlikable prick to respectable anti-hero only to get unceremoniously pierced through the chest. It was only after Krillin, a character that had been with us since early in the original Dragon Ball, was dead, and as far as we knew at the time, he wasn't coming back. Goku going Super Saiyan wasn't a moment of masculine glory, it's just kind of sad. Even Goku recognizes this, one of his defining characteristics is a love for fighting, but he doesn't even want to finish the fight, Freiza is brought down with his own attack and Goku only finishes him off because he refuses to accept defeat. That's why this moment still resonates with people 30 years later, as many problems Dragon Ball Z had, be it horrible pacing or not aging well in other ways, DBZ at its core had heart and it deserves its place as a classic. 
 
Dragon Ball Super has none of that. Every arc is the exact same; introduce a new rival, Goku gets a new form to fight them with, Goku loses because of some stupid reason like a time limit or he lets his guard down, but everything turns out fine anyway because we know how this is all going to end from the time skip in Z. There's never any tension, there's never any excitement, there's never any character development, all the plot twists feel contrived, the new plot elements are hit or miss, and most of the time it is just boring to watch because while the technology has improved, their animation style hasn't been updated in 3 decades. All in all, this show is a painful waste of time designed to prey on nostalgia for a much better series.

          
 
       Helpful Let's start by re-introducing how I review Animes. First off, no Gamespot/IGN scores. This means 7 DOES NOT mean Average, nor 6 means Bad. That's the usual perspective of a lot of ppl, and has gone quite troublesome when properly reviewing. We'll take MAL's rating system, and round-off the overall score of all 5 elements. Second, I'll be saying as little to no spoilers as much as possible, unless stated otherwise when deemed necessary for a proper review. Third, take everything with a grain of salt. 
 
Dragon Ball Super. A continuation from the classic Dragon Ball series, Z. An extended take on a shounen-genre anime, that uses simple formula, but still works fairly well. I won't take my time reviewing previous Dragon Balls, such as the first and Z, and I will base my review solely on this with little comparison of Z and this as much as possible. 
 
Dragon Ball Super is one of the first few Shounen anime I've watch again in quite some time as I've felt that I've outgrown the genre. But the simple take on the genre, even without much regard on other elements like storytelling, or character development still makes quite some great enjoyment. If there's one thing that proper Shounen animes can get away with, is that plot advancement can be done on the spot, without unnecessary story backtracking, and some Deus Ex Machina can even work on story/character development, without needlessly diminishing enjoyment.  
 
Critical Review: 
 
Story - [6/10] 
A fair rating for a shounen anime. Like I previously said, most shounen animes plot are usually made on spot, and aren't usually connecting major plot devices in previous storylines. There are some exceptions to this obviously, but those are quite uncommon. While DB Super connects a few things from back even as far as the original Dragon Ball, these are not major factors that will affect a lot of things that can become influential to the current story. Most of DB Super's plot are on-the-spot and advances from there taking a few things from the old and re-imagining them to something new. 
 
In anycase, this doesn't mean it's bad, but that also means there's not much depth. Hence why the automatic memes of ""Akira Toriyama's asspulls"" is all true real...in some form atleast. Nevertheless, it's a simple formula that works, and for DB's lengthy run, it works well enough to stand on it's own. And it's this formula that keeps the series alive and well, and most likely it'll keep the series running for a long time...of course there are some things that we don't ever want to mention that has never worked for...(ehem GT). 
 
If there's anything I will like to greatly compliment, it will be the pacing. DB Super has improved it's story pacing quite significantly, and has managed to forward it's plot properly without being too long nor short compared to Z. In the case of Universal Survival Saga of course, a 48 min battle in a course of a lot of episodes is somewhat understandable. Weird, but understandable, considering fights happening mostly at the same time in the course of 20+ episodes however I wished they would've made a more realistic timer than 48 mins. 
 
Art - [7/10] 
To start off, this was a mixed-bag for me honestly. DB Super's art in earlier episodes were...lackluster to say the least. Toei's legendary animation is showing, and the quality was so obvious even in a lot of crucial moments. Even seeing things that were of so low quality that when compared to Dragon Ball Z, it was just an embarrassment. However the quality gradually changes around later episodes, and the style becomes significantly eye-catching in some moments. Of course there are still some scenes where the quality drops which are still present in newer episodes, but these becomes mostly isolated in scenes where high-paced action is taken or where only a few seconds take place. Even so, quality in crucial scenes has become better to the point you'd be wanting for more.  
 
Sound - [9/10] 
I'm a fan of good sound and music. Sound is one thing, where something fits into an action, voice, or anything in the environment. In this case, it's good. I won't say there's anything I noticed bad in particular, because sounds like ambient are usually gone unnoticed in a lot of shows.  
 
(Seiyuu/VA) 
Voice acting is done quite well by everyone, especially the main characters like Goku, Vegeta, even Frieza, etc. They all follow their roles well, and is always in character. Legendary seiyuus like Masako Nozawa who can do multiple characters in one go, I applaud you. (Rest In Peace, Hiromi Tsuru; 1960 - 2017; Voice of Bulma) 
 
(Music) 
Music is also amazing. I'd say Norihito Sumitomo has done well in the series, and a lot of the background music fits well in their respective scenes. From Goku first transforming to SSJG to Ultra Instinct. Classic intense shounen music that fits on almost everything shounen-like. I would even go far as to saying, my favorite music/scene combination in the series so far would have to go to Vegito Blue vs Fused Zamasu. That moment, even though it was just short, was enough to give me goosebumps. Continue on with the great music~ 
 
Character - [7/10] 
Properly delivering character development is somewhat hard in shounen animes without bloating the character themselves. But since the simple plot formula works, as long as they don't stray from this and don't focus for heavy-story elements like what some newer, ambitious animes do(eg. heavy back story of a character), it'll go smoothly. In the case of DB Super, this has been executed well. 
 
Most of the main cast has developed well off from their original selves in their prequels, as well as some previously thought obsolete characters like most of the Z-Fighters have redeemed themselves in the series. Which is why Super's character plot is actually a lot better than Z, because instead of slowly setting aside the old forgotten roster for newer, stronger characters, it has gone it's way back to their roots to make them useful again...atleast most of them(poor Yamcha).  
 
The two main saiyans, Goku and Vegeta retains most of their old personalities. With Goku still the fun dumbstruck as ever, with a heart of gold, and Vegeta with his somewhat ""more Tsun, less dere"" side. Showing bits of their characters making them feel natural rather than forced, their human side despite being incredible forces of nature. While they're the ones mostly shown with their somewhat easygoing side(in terms of a story universe where almost anything can just flat out kill you), these characteristics are also shown to others as well, like Gods of Destruction, some enemies, etc. Making the show feel at pace with the main cast without the latter being too heavy for them to face in a normal conversation. 
 
Setting that aside, the show's use of character self-willpower/guts is heavy. As for all shounen-anime this works very well, and just intensifies the characters themselves. This simple thing, is one of the foundations of the series and most shounen animes. At the very least, self-willpower/guts power is something that's more satisfying to watch in a shounen anime, than ""nakama power"". Of course, this still has tiny bits of that, but atleast it doesn't overblown it to the point it feels...ughhh. 
 
Enjoyment - [10/10] 
I'd be lying if I say I didn't enjoy DB Super. Regardless of its undesirable animation quality in the earlier episodes, or anything remotely bad in some way, it still manages to get me wanting for more. Like I previously said, DB Super is one first mainstream shounen anime again I've watch in quite a while. I'm a person who thinks to himself ""I have superior taste than all those pathetic lowlife and weaboos."", of course we all know that's what we all tell to ourselves. 
 
I've deviated from shounen animes for quite some time, thinking I've outgrown them. Watching a few hero animes like Boku no Hero Academia, OPM, etc. What triggered me to watch DB Super wasn't exactly nostalgia. No, it wasn't nostalgia as a child watching old DB/Z that rekindled my fondness of the series, rather how eye-catching the simple execution of shounen elements in a series like Dragon Ball Super. Being spoiled in facebook by friends, seeing Ultra Instinct scenes, already made me eager to watch it. Apparently, I just realized that there was little to no blood in the series...that's how much I enjoyed it that I completely unnoticed small details like that, but I guess I could say majority of shounen series are somewhat kid-friendly, like Fairy Tail even. 
 
Just seeing someone like Goku push his limits, taunt and fight Godlike beings. Sending shivers down my spine, and remembering memorable things like Vegito saying ""What's wrong? Is this all the power a God has?"" to Goku first achieving Ultra Instinct. It was exciting, just doing simple fighting, using martial arts, and tackle of Godlike beings. It was all intensifying and exciting overall, making me crave for newer episodes to come.  
 
And so... 
 
Overall - [8*/10] *7.8 rounded to 8 
A classic series like Dragon Ball, and Super, proves that a series doesn't necessarily needs to have very heavy story elements and depth, like what a lot of modern series strives to do today to be enjoyed. Sure it'll add to the immersion, but one wrong slip, it can be fatal to the series. The right execution of shounen-elements will provide a long-running series have endless possibilities of enjoyment. 
 
DB Super's use of simple shounen-formula makes it safe from heavy criticism, and also a safe and fun choice for any fan of the shounen genre. It's plain and simple, and it's those reasons why it's good and enjoyable.

Each of the four episodes chronicle one of Miyu's encounters with a Shinma and the humans that it is affecting, from the perspective of Himiko's pursuit of Miyu.  
 
(Source: AniDB) ","['Action', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Drama', 'Vampire', 'Shoujo']","Stranded in the space between the human world and the demon underworld, the series central characters are a Japanese vampire girl named Miyu and her Western Shinma companion Larva. Miyu is the daughter of both a human being and a Shinma (a name for a race of ""god-demon""). She was born a vampire and as such, she was awakened as the guardian whose destiny is to hunt down all stray Shinma and send them back to ""the Darkness""; charged with the responsibility of returning the evil demons away. Before turning 15 years old, she yearns to return to the darkness herself but not until she has banished all the Shinma from Earth. And since her awakening, she remains cut off by the facts of who and what she is.
Most locations in the series are evocative of traditional Japan.
","Miyu is a Guardian, a vampire whose destiny is to hunt down stray shinma (demons, shapeshifters, vampires) and send them back into the darkness from whence they originated. Unlike the TV Series, the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA has a secondary lead character in Spiritualist Himiko. Himiko is under the impression that Miyu has something to do with vampiric victims, and follows her around trying to find out what is going on and to get proof. 
 
The OVA's strength is that the stories are much more interesting than most of the ones in the TV series. There are only 4 episodes and each is unique. The weakness is it tends to be like X-Files, here is the mystery of the week and the shinma/monster of the week. It gets predictably boring after a while, but luckily the short 4 episode length managed to keep it from being too boring or predictable. If there were more background or an overarching plot it would have scored higher. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Welcome back, my friends, to horror anime month. This week we'll be looking at an OVA about a vampire. After last week I needed something with a strong and well developed female character who isn't sexualised, so we're looking at Vampire Princess Miyu. Vampire Princess Miyu originated as a manga by a married couple: Hirano Toshiki and Kakinouchi Narumi. You may recognise him as the director of Magic Knight Rayearth, Devilman Lady and many others. Her works are quite a bit more obscure so if you've heard of her it's probably going to be because of this or Yakushiji Ryoko no Kaiki Jikenbo, which she did the illustrations for. Vampire Princess Miyu has two adaptations, an OVA from the late 80s and a TV series from nearly a decade later. I might get to the TV series at some point, but right now let's look at the OVA. 
 
There's not a major over-arching story for this. Basically, each of the episodes tells a different story. The first begins with a spiritualist named Himiko. She's called in to investigate a young girl who's been asleep for months. A condition that her parents believe is caused by possession. When she investigates she discovers that women have been being found with all the blood drained from their bodies. She's attacked in the dead of night by a swift moving robed figure and finds herself rescued by a girl in a kimono, a girl who feeds on blood and knows more than she'll reveal. Don't worry, I'm not going to do that for all four episodes. One thing I can say to the OVA's credit is that it has some really good suspense, a lot of which is created through mysteries. In the first episode you're left wondering what exactly is attacking people and what its connection to Miyu is or even if there is any. Every episode has a mystery like that, except for the last which answers a mystery that's been building for the entire OVA. The only real downside is the second episode which isn't nearly as suspenseful or interesting as the rest. A lot of the issue is that its mystery has an obvious solution virtually from the beginning. It's not really scary, but it does have some legitimately creepy moments so it's doing better with the horror aspect than everything I've reviewed so far this month.  
 
There are really only three characters worth mentioning in this. Miyu, Larva and Himiko. The other characters show up for one episode or part of an episode. A few of them do get developed, but most just serve a very specific purpose and never get actual development. As for our three major characters, Miyu is fascinating. A lot of the details about her are left unsaid, but very effectively illustrated. She's a multi-faceted character who's neither a paragon of virtue nor a blood sucking monster. She has a great deal of verisimilitude. Larva is less developed. He's a very mysterious character with motivations that are touched on a bit, but not much. He's mostly defined by his protectiveness of Miyu.  Himiko is another interesting character. She wants to find and stop Miyu, but frequently ends up on the same side as her. She's the most relatable character since she's an ordinary human who's trying to make the most of extraordinary circumstances. So there's a lot of character depth for these three. Especially when you factor in the number of episodes.  
 
The art is reminiscent of 3x3 Eyes. The character designs use the same basic style and both feature very stylized and interesting supernatural elements. Vampire Princess Miyu has very atmospheric art. The backgrounds, the character movements, the entire aesthetic really, helps with the sense of suspense. That isn't to say that it's perfect. There are some scenes where the characters mouths aren't in sync with their dialogue but that's a minor complaint. The biggest art issue is that the action scenes aren't particularly intense. They tend to end pretty quickly. Although I'm not going to hold it against the series too much because it does use that time effectively to build suspense and develop the characters.  
 
The voice acting is pretty well done. I really like Watanabe Naoko's performance as Miyu. The laugh especially is just perfect. Which is good since you hear it quite a bit. Koyama Mami doesn't do as well in her role as Himiko, but she still does a good job. Shiozawa Kaneto only gets a few lines, but he gives a good performance. The music in this is amazing. It works with the art to establish and maintain a really strong atmosphere. Kudos there.  
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really nothing homoerotic here.  
 
My final rating for the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA is a 7.6/10. The stories have good suspense. The characters are well developed and interesting. The atmosphere, from a combination of the art and sound, is amazing. If there's one thing that holds it back it's the second episode and even it's okay. If you like 3x3 eyes or suspense in general you'll probably enjoy this too. 

          
 
       Helpful this is a classic 1988 anime in the fact that it has a great story, great characters, but bad voice acting. Miyu is a fascinating character tipe and has been underrated. i found the VHS for all four episodes in a Little miscellaneous store that was about to shut down and i payed $6 for it. If i had know that i would like it so much then i probably would have payed the man more. If you like classic anime and also are a big vampire fan than this is the perfect anime for you.             Vampire Princess Miyu is so well done you forget about the bad voice overs and focus completely on the plot.

His ultimate sacrifice is so out of character that the authorities of the spirit realm are not yet prepared to let him pass on. Koenma, heir to the throne of the spirit realm, offers Yuusuke an opportunity to regain his life through completion of a series of tasks. With the guidance of the death god Botan, he is to thwart evil presences on Earth as a Spirit Detective. 
 
To help him on his venture, Yuusuke enlists ex-rival Kazuma Kuwabara, and two demons, Hiei and Kurama, who have criminal pasts. Together, they train and battle against enemies who would threaten humanity's very existence. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen']","YuYu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way. His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the Underworld (霊界, Reikai, ""Spirit World"" in the English dub) where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of ""Underworld Detective"" (霊界探偵, Reikai Tantei, lit. ""Spirit World Detective"", ""Spirit Detective"" in the English dub), charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World (人間界, Ningen Kai, lit. ""Human World""). Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or Reiki (霊気, Reiki, lit. ""Spirit Energy"") fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane (魔界, Makai, lit. ""Demon World""), a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World.
Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. To test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament (暗黒武術会, Ankoku Bujutsukai, lit. ""Dark Martial Arts Association""), an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.
After the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.
As they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. 
Two years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the cast. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach.
","Yu Yu hakusho is one of your typical action based anime with comedy and a lot more. Even though it is so typical, there is still a lot more to offer because it will keep you interested until the end of the series (yes, it’s a long series, 112 episodes to be exact).  
 
STORY - the story is about Yusuke Urameshi, a spirit detective, who became one when he died while saving a kid. He was given another chance to go back to the living provided that he will become a spirit detective. Since this is an action type anime, expect a lot of fighting. I enjoyed the the story because it does not show just “fightings”. It also showcase the different stories that tackles emotions. The humor in this anime is not “trying-hard” type of humor. Most of it will also come to the throwing of lines of the characters in the series, and you will never know who of those characters might amuse you because everyone has its own.  
 
MUSIC/SOUND - i do love the opening and ending songs of this anime that made me listen to it over and over again.  
 
CHARACTERS - the four main characters have totally different package. It might be the same as the other action-type anime but still, the characters were justified by giving them unique stories, personalities and background. What made me like this is that the story did not evolve only to Yusuke but with all its supporting cast giving them enough air time to be introduced and be loved. I’m sure that if you watched this anime, you will be able to love one of these characters, you might have ending liking also some of the antagonists in this anime. 
 
ART - This anime might not have the best art but whatever it lacks in the art was justified by having a lot of styles. The creative team and the stories kept me interested until the end. 
 
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER: 
Hiei Jaganashi - he’s my favorite here because I totally love him being snobbish but will always be there for his sister Yukina and his friends. He has a bad history being abandoned by the town where he was born but was able to regain himself along with his long-time friend Kurama Minamino. Even though he’s not the title role, he can definitely kick ass when it comes to fighting that also made Yusuke fear for some time. 
 
RATING: 9 
 
Well, what can i say, this is one of the anime that i grew up with. And all I can say is that I can’t help compare all the action-type anime that i come across after this. Just like Dragon Ball Z.

       Helpful This anime is outstanding because it is based on a great story where Spirit Detective Yusuke Urameshi has to team up with Kazuma Kuwabara,Yoko Kurama ( Minamoto Suichi ) and Hiei Jaganshi and save the Human World from demons. 
  I like the action, storyline, graphics ( Needs improvement though, but still outstanding !!!) and the Cool Super Powers that each one of those character has,its just outstanding. 
  I also like how they put the Saga's together,they're only 4 Saga's,which is good.Unlike Dragonball ( Z,GT etc...),which has alot of Saga's,the makers of Yuu Yuu Hakusho knew that if they put in too many Saga's,the whole anime would be messed up. 
  I do wish they add another Saga and more episodes though,i think about 6 Saga's would be enough and 201 Episodes would be enough although i think i watched 201 already so i think someone got the number wrong (112). 
 
This Review refers to my feelings towards the anime Yuu Yuu Hakusho, it truly does not help anyone in anyway possible.........haha...

          
 
       Helpful This series is a bit older, but it's one of the few that holds up really well. It has a solid cast of characters, and it has a simple but well done story line. It is full of comedy and has a great cast of voice actors supporting it.  
 
It is your typical fighting story where the main character gets stronger as he needs to defeat each opponent, but he's a brawling tough guy from the beginning. He develops his skills through his solid determination as he needs to overcome each trial that he faces. This is one of the series that helped set the bar for the genre, and it's one that shouldn't be overlooked. 
 
Yusuke is a delinquent in the beginning of the story, but he isn't really a bad guy. He has a bad rep due to the fact that none of the other delinquents can defeat him, so he is pretty well feared. Thanks to his death that wasn't supposed to happen (I don't want to spoil anything but there's a great quote in the beginning about his death), one thing leads to another and he ends up having to prove he deserves a second chance at life. With his newly regained life comes the new responsibility of working for the spirit world hunting down demons as a spirit detective. Many quirky things happen, but the ride is definitely a fun one to watch. 
 
My biggest complaint is that my favorite part of the story is the shortest (the last story arc), but you can never have too much of a good thing. This anime is a great adaptation of the manga series, and it even pieces together a solid ending that is slightly different than the manga but works well. Even though this is older, I do highly recommend adding this to your list of must watch anime.

OPERATION COZY FAMILY.  
 
Thousands of years ago, Enka the God of Destruction, was killed. However, with a dying breath it claimed that its child would appear and destroy humanity. Now in futuristic Japan, all of the potential children of Enka have been found and placed into a haphazard family.  
 
Teika the lion, Gekka the jellyfish, Yuuka the oni, Ginka the cross-dressing mafia son, and Hyouka the bioweapon--along with their parents Ouka and Kyouka (the ruler of a demon underworld)--all live under one roof in a family frenzy. ","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"What do you get when you take a Jellyfish, an oni, a lion, a cyborg, a cross dressing mafia member and a cat with a serious God complex? You get one of the strangest comedy anime of all time. For such a long time whilst watching this show I couldn't pinpoint what exactly it was trying to achieve nor what it wanted to be. It constantly jumped between comedy and random shenanigans to tragic backstories and drama at the drop of a hat, all of which made the show incredibly jarring and confusing to watch, resulting in some of the worst tonal shifts I have seen for any anime. Now, before I actually get into that, let me talk more about the plot for this show. 
 
Enka, the God of destruction died one thousand years ago but upon dying, proclaimed that one of his children will carry on his will to destroy the world. Now, in modern Japan, all of the possible children of Enka have been gathered together and are joined as a family in an attempt to prevent the destruction of the Earth by showing them how wonderful and beautiful human life is. The possible children of the God Enka, include Teika the lion, Gekka the Jellyfish and even a biological weapon, Hyouka. Each of the main characters are both unique in terms of design and personalities, and have decent chemistry with each other, as well as lengthy backstories and tragic past. And that's it for narrative really. Nothing really happens of much significance and all the events that do happen in the show feel random and intrusive rather than a natural progression from arc to arc. While the show does attempt to create comedy, and for the most part, the comedy could make me smile and even laugh a couple of times, it's ultimately ruined by the abrupt and strange tonal shifts that change so frequently, which ruins the dramatic tensions of the show. One moment they're throwing out some random gag and the immediate next one we are watching the backstories of a young girl who is being whipped by her evil family. It feels jarring; clunky. 
 
Some of the most entertaining episodes of the show are just when they are sticking to comedy and random hijinks and if the show was more like this in its entirety I would've had a lot more fun as a result. It's just that they chuck so much in with so many random characters that it begins to feel tiresome and the show begins to drag mid-way through. While, as I said, the characters can have decent chemistry with each other, their backstories are forced in and are so boring that I lose interest right away. Even when the show does introduce a more central and focused narrative for the final four or so episodes, it still feels rather awkward and confusing as well since the characters keep jumping from one place to the next without reason and characters are introduced which go nowhere. The show as a whole is just rather inconsistent with no rhyme or reason to any of the events that are happening. 
 
And it's not like the show is completely devoid of any interesting ideas or themes, it's just that the ideas are executed so poorly or never expanded enough on to feel worthwhile in the end. Most notably, when one of the arcs focuses on the mistreatment of animals and how they should be the ones to control society and not humans, but not enough time is spent on fleshing it out enough. 
 
The characters themselves could provide a joke here and there that made me smile but that was the most I ever got out of them. Kyouka, the cat with a serious God complex is both selfish and annoying and easily my least favorite thing about the show. While they do try and present her as being full of insecurities, justifying her behaviour, not nearly enough time was spent on fleshing it out nor developing it. Ouka, the father of this jumbled family, was rather plain and flat and hardly memorable in the slightest. The other characters of the family are a little more interesting in terms of personality but their backstories felt trite and forced, used as a cheap way to make us sympathise and connect with the character rather than building them up as people.  There are a plethora of other characters but they're so forgettable, that's it hardly worth the time speaking about them. 
 
The animation was fairly consistent but there are not really all too many moments of great art or movement. The art style works in the shows favour and conveys the goofy and silly nature of the show rather well, in the same vein as Konasuba does with its animation and art. I liked most of the soundtrack for the show, albeit it, if it is pretty forgettable but the opening is catchy as hell. 
 
In conclusion, I really did want to enjoy myself with this show, I really did. It had a good set-up, a nice main cast, all of which with different gimmicks and personalities that could have bounced off each other very well but the constant shifts in tone and the forced tragic backstories as well as melodrama are what kept me back from having a good time. It's a shame too, since this show did have some things going for it at the very least...

          
 
       Helpful The basic construction of this series is a little odd. One get's used to seeing mainstream entertainment stick to fairly similar genre patterns, sometimes subverting these tropes and sometimes sprinkling some flavour from a complimentary genre (e.g. action comedy). However KKN is odd in that it attempts to blend an impressive range of genre's that one doesn’t often see together. Now sometime's when you mix lots of colours together you get brown, but in this case it's done and works surprisingly well. It makes for an engaging viewing experience as the show moves from slapstick comedy to heavy drama seamlessly. The pace of the plot and these rapid changes of emotion make for an extremely entertaining show. 
 
All of the characters, while generally fairly outré, are well characterised and appealing. None more so than Kyouka, the main protagonist or at least the common focal point of the show. As I said above it contains a number of elements all of which are well executed and integrated. The comedy in particular is extremely funny, while some of it does rely on being passably familiar with other anime or Japanese culture the majority of it should be accessible and amusing for any audience.  
 
While the humour alone would be enough for me to recommend it the action and in particular the drama are also great. The drama in particular is rife with pathos. It deals with some pretty heavy elements in a pretty competent way. Though now that I write that I begin to wonder; are these things actually well done? Is it really good at invoking pathos or have I become emotionally unstable? Sometimes the latter seems more probable as I find myself reacting strongly to material which I objectively feel shouldn’t really be eliciting the responses it does.

          
 
       Helpful There seems to be a lack of reviews of Kyouran Kazoku Nikki where all the episodes have been watched at the time of writing so I shall attempt to fill that void. 
 
The Diary of a Crazed Family, that should tell you something about this anime.  In fact, if you were any bit serious about it, it would take your face to the curb and beat it out of you.  At least for the most part.  But let's get this party started shall we? 
 
There is no real story in Kyouran Kazoku Nikki, each episode could easily function as a standalone short, but that doesn't mean the show lacks continuity or has no real meat within the episodes themselves.  Usually there is an Aesop or moral or something or other to be taught by Kyouka-sama and that's about the only thing that would annoy me.  It's more or less a slice of life.  Your mileage may vary. 
 
The art, fitting to the theme, is vibrant and colourful.  In fact, this is one of the few anime that does not have over-the-top &quot;anime&quot; hairstyled characters.  For that I applaud it.  Heck, even a Stinger is faithfully recreated in anime form and ofcourse, the sparkles are appropriately added so there really isn't anything to say about it.  Not outstanding, but not terrible. 
 
The same can be said of the sound.  The OP, is one of the few that I willingly sit through to listen to.  A very good indicator of what the show is about as well.  There are multiple EDs, one for each of the Midarezakis, save perhaps Gekka, but she's a Jellyfish sooo.  Moving on, each ED is in a way, representative of each Miderazaki, quite fitting and credit is given where credit is due.  Next we have the BGM, which I can't say doesn't go terribly well nor wrong.  In fact, not commenting about it probably the best thing I could do.  Because it means they did something right.  I have nothing to complain about. 
 
Almost all of the main cast has some depth to them, a shame really, I wanted to know more about Ouka and Ginka.  In fact, there are still some unexplained flashbacks (and I haven't checked Wikipedia yet) for Ouka and I would like that resolved, thank you very much.  Ginka, on the other hand, got the short-stick when they drew the characterisation priority chart I bet.  Other than that I'm fine with the hyperactive yet insecure Kyouka, the shy and timid Yuuka, the mysterious Gekka, the innocent Hyouka, the mindful Teika and of course the rather normal Chika (rather being the stressed word). 
 
Then of course, comes the enjoyment derived.  But it is hard not to enjoy such a well implemented comedy.  My favourite moment is probably when Santa took a Stinger and later going to town with Kyouka.  There are plenty of  things that are over the top.  But that just adds to the comedy, and somehow it never feels forced.  Which usually then segues into a heartwarming moment.  Quite well pulled off at points but sometimes, I can already see it coming which can dampen the impact somewhat.  Overall, this is something of a must watch for fans of comedy (personally I don't know anyone who would dislike a good comedy).  That's it really, so embrace Goddere and may Kyouka-sama smile upon you.

12,28121,50,6.946480482,Story between god and human,Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka,"Life in the bustling city of Orario is never dull, especially for Bell Cranel, a na?ve young man who hopes to become the greatest adventurer in the land. After a chance encounter with the lonely goddess, Hestia, his dreams become a little closer to reality. With her support, Bell embarks on a fantastic quest as he ventures deep within the city's monster-filled catacombs, known only as the ""Dungeon."" Death lurks around every corner in the cavernous depths of this terrifying labyrinth, and a mysterious power moves amidst the shadows. 
 
Even on the surface, survival is a hard-earned privilege. Indeed, nothing is ever certain in a world where gods and humans live and work together, especially when they often struggle to get along. One thing is for sure, though: a myriad of blunders, triumphs and friendships awaits the dauntlessly optimistic protagonist of this herculean tale. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia (ファミリア, Famiria). The primary activity of these organisations is exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon (ダンジョン, Danjon) in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores. By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known as skills.
The story follows the adventures of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old rookie adventurer and sole member of the Hestia Familia. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman of the Loki Familia, and vows to become as strong as her following a chance encounter where she saves his life from a powerful monster. While Ais is the object of Bell's romantic affection, several other girls, deities and mortals alike, have similar feelings for him; most notably, Hestia herself.
","Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? Evidently not, because our MC sure picks up a lot of them there and everyone thinks he’s a total saint. 
 
I can’t really blame them though; it’s hard not to love Bell despite his denseness. He’s a pure and real kind MC done well, and his struggles in the Labyrinth feel real. He isn’t immediately OP and fails a lot initially. He acts consistently kindly and it feels natural.  
Hestia is an awesome character, and just plain adorable. She does become a lot more yandere-like later in the series, but always puts her family first regardless. And it’s not the idea of Bell she likes, she actually knows and likes him as a person and a friend. You can tell he cares for her deeply too. Their Familia relationship is sweet and at the beginning brings a warm fuzzy feeling to your stomach just watching it.  
 
Out of the supporting characters: Lili has some decent development in just a short couple of episodes. A sweet kid on the whole, but toughened up by a hard life. She just wants someone to show her a bit of kindness, and really Bell’s the perfect character for that. Aiz doesn’t seem to have much to her besides her power, although she does get a bit more screen-time after a while. Quite a monotone and boring character nonetheless. Stalker Freya is just plain cringey and totally unnecessary for the plot – a lousy character who adds absolutely nothing to the anime. Syr also seems unnecessary – I can’t really find anything to say about her one way or the other. Eina is quite a nice character but there’s not much to her either. Hephaestus is good, but not in much. Welf is fine but still pretty generic.  
 
Let’s face it, we’re only here for Hestia and Bell, although Welf, Lili, and Aiz are all necessary as plot devices. There’s a fair amount of fan-service but it fits with this type of anime. 
 
World building: not much seen besides the dungeon, in fact not much is even explained. We’re just thrown into Bell’s life, and at this point we don’t actually need much exposition to understand the story. Less is more. 
  
Op is typical, not great and not terrible. The brushing the teeth scene is fantastic – such strong family vibes. Makes me grin every time I see it. Rest of music and ed are fine too. 
 
The ending felt a bit rushed – all of a sudden everyone’s using these phenomenal powers? It just felt like they were trying to show off how cool everyone is, but wait! They couldn’t be as cool as Bell! So let’s make them all op and then make him even more op. That will show everyone. 
 
Well, Hermes’ speech at the ending is a good set up for a season 2. It will be interesting to see how the backstory impacts the future. It is a bit unoriginal and the story would have been fine without it, but I still didn’t expect it.  
 
It’s a fun watch, but nothing beyond that. If you liked Magi but wish it had a less focussed plot and added a harem, then you’ll probably like this too. Another classic adventure series. XD

Art: 8 - The character and enemy models generally aren't the greatest, compared to anime that came out a few years before it, but the environments and effects are done well enough. I like that the character models are somewhat differentiated. 
  
Sound: 8 - I'm not the best judge of this category, but the intro song is alright and the sound effects match the action well enough that I suppose it deserves an 8/10. 
  
Story: 4 - Here's where the anime goes wrong. Just about everything that's done here is a clone of any number of other anime. There are many shots of a tower in the distance, but instead the story focuses on a dungeon, which goes down. Not very logical, now is it? The workings of this anime are similar to VRMMO-type anime, where there are levels and respawns and such, but it never explicitly tells you that they're in a VRMMO. Instead, they tend to take matters very seriously and present this as the real world, just with goddesses everywhere. They actually get some of the lore mixed up, as at first they were showing off some gods as goddesses (ex: Hephaestus), so I thought ""I guess they just wanted to be consistent,"" but then they introduced us to Hermes, a male god. This anime has a lot of missing backstory (why are there walls? Are there any other towns, etc.) and left a lot of things to be resolved in the second season, which I suppose is alright. Hopefully that season or an OVA or two will explain the story better. For right now, it just drops the viewer in, expecting them to understand everything that's going on. 
  
Characters: 4 - The characters in this anime are very cliche, they fulfill the typical harem roles, that is to say, one alpha and a dozen soulless betas. Other than a few main characters, and perhaps Ryuu, the characters have no personality. In fact, one of the characters (Aiz Wallenstein) is a clone of Mashiro Shiina from Sakurasou, just a pro fighter instead of a pro artist. The characters in this anime are one of its weakest, if not the weakest, point. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 - I like this anime. That is because I play games first, watch anime second. If you are not like me, then you will likely be annoyed this anime exists. There is sometimes too much fan service (such as bouncing boobs in the beginning of every episode), and there are quite a few cliches, but overall it's okay. I watched it in a marathon, and wouldn't mind seeing a season 2 to tie things up. 
 
Overall: 6.4 - Unoriginal ideas, but a few good points make this a decent show. If you like games and/or VRMMO-type anime, then I'd say watch this. It's not the best, but it satisfies.

","I feel like I should write a review because I kept hearing that this arc was going to be really good but now I feel like the recommendations were biased from FGO players since I watched this as someone who only enjoyed the Fate Zero adaptation, and the FSN VN and adaptation and never touched FGO. 
 
I guess this is an unpopular opinion but I really liked the cocky Gilgamesh from FZ so I was excited that he got his own anime, but was disappointed that this Gilgamesh is completely different. He still has hints of cockiness but it's definitely dialed back a ton, which I'm not a fan of. 
 
The story is really weirdly paced, and also weirdly spread. I'm not sure how the FGO game works but the story feels like an adaptation of various quests in the game that partially complete themselves as the plot goes on, in addition to continuing from other quests that were already finished in the game. It's spread across a lot of different plot points which definitely feel like they all eventually reach the same place but as an anime-only it's really boring to watch everything progress at a snail's pace and only getting bits of each plotline. 
 
The sound design was pretty good until they started showing off some of the more powerful moves in recent episodes, then they try using more impactful sound effects but it just turns into earrape which is really unpleasant to listen to. 
 
Visuals are great, not Ufotable quality but still better than most anime I see. There's way too much fanservice though, it's really annoying having a fight scene focus so much on girls' butts, even if it is just for a few seconds each fight, it's definitely distracting and meant to pander to waifu enthusiasts despite being a bad angle for the camera to be at and taking away from the action of the fight. 
 
Fanservice in general is kind of the problem I had with this show. I feel like it's way too moe compared to what I was expecting with FZ and FSN, and I'm probably missing or straight up disliking a lot of in-jokes with the FGO community. It's just that as someone who was expecting some serious plotline, it got annoying with all the fanservice, the turning point for me giving this show a chance to actively disliking it was one of the main antagonists just being an FSN side character in a onesie. 
 
Maybe it is a good adaptation like everyone else says, IDK, but if you're coming in expecting a good show that stands on its own like FSN or Fate Zero, I think you'll be really disappointed. However it did kind of give me the same vibe as Apocrypha so if you enjoyed that I think you'd probably enjoy this show too.

       Helpful So far this anime is doing its job greatly. It step-by-step follows the original game's storyline and presents it with smooth animation, decent art and nostalgic music. 
 
As an FGO game player, I sincerely know how this singularity is very outstanding, even when compared to the old Fate classics. But I'm afraid the anime may ruin it, like how the anime of Fate/Extra is being butchered. I'm glad they don't.  
 
With 21 episodes, there is no doubt the story will not be scrammed. Not much detail is waived, so even anime-only watchers should (or eventually will) understand what's going on. What's better is that each episode has at least one dazzling fight scene to not let you fall asleep by the slow-paced plot. The experience is sublimed by its steady art style. 
 
Currently, the only downside of this show will be the characters, as they are not fully comprehended now. Yes, including our not-beloved protagonist, Fujimaru Ritsuka. He works better as a cameraman than being an actor. 
 
But anyway, whether you want to see some good-looking fights by CloverWorks, read one of the few good stories in this gacha game, or just want to have some Fate fan-service when you are having your supper, this anime is worth a try.

Yato is a minor deity and a self-proclaimed ""Delivery God,"" who dreams of having millions of worshippers. Without a single shrine dedicated to his name, however, his goals are far from being realized. He spends his days doing odd jobs for five yen apiece, until his weapon partner becomes fed up with her useless master and deserts him. 
 
Just as things seem to be looking grim for the god, his fortune changes when a middle school girl, Hiyori Iki, supposedly saves Yato from a car accident, taking the hit for him. Remarkably, she survives, but the event has caused her soul to become loose and hence able to leave her body. Hiyori demands that Yato return her to normal, but upon learning that he needs a new partner to do so, reluctantly agrees to help him find one. And with Hiyori's help, Yato's luck may finally be turning around.

This incident causes her soul to frequently slip out of her body, and she becomes aware of the existence of two parallel worlds: the Near Shore, where regular humans and creatures reside, and the Far Shore, where phantoms (demonic beasts) and human souls linger. Through her soul, she meets the strange, nameless god without a shrine, Yato. Yato is determined to make a name for himself out there by accepting any wishes for 5 yen coins , including Hiyori's to fix her body. Along with Yato's Regalia — a weapon from a spirit (dead human’s soul), and named by the god in question — Yukine/Yuki, the trio go through many adventures struggling with their friendship, identity, and pasts.
","Okay, I believe that many of you have heard of the term that is widely used in anime reviews, book reviews, moview reviews, etc. Yes, it's the ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". Apparently, that idiom applies to Noragami as well. Why? It’s quite simple, while the anime has a nice cover, a nice premise, and also nice previews (which came out several of times before the anime aired) the anime itself isn't nice at all. Then, is it bad? No no no, not at all. It isn’t nice because it's actually above nice . It-it was amazing, way beyond expectations. Of course i'm not going to say that without preparing a reason before hand. *cough* Lets begin then. 
 
Story : 9/10 
 
(If you haven't, please read the synopsis above first then continue reading). Okay then, simply put, the story is about a god named Yato; his weapon,Yukine; and a schoolgirl which is a half phantom, Hiyori. There isn't anything complex about the story, though it could be described as a unique. The plot is great, well executed and also well paced, though it feels like it's rushed a bit at some point. But it seems that doesn't really affect the enjoyment since it's pretty much unnoticeable anyway. The individual elements of the story is also a surplus, for example the action. Action in this anime is a no joke at all. Battles are very fluid and isn't pointless no matter how you look at it. Please don't group this anime with those typical shounen action anime with battles in every episode throughout the anime from the beginning till the very end. I don't say this often, but the thoughts on my head while I was watching it was like, ""really cool"", ""awesome"", ""amazing"", ""we want more, we want more"". All the battles in this anime has a meaning and also a lot of emotions . Though, there aren't that many battles since it's not the sole main aspect of the story. Another element of the story that you'll be getting a lot if you're going to watch it is the relationship progress between the characters which spans until the last episode. And, although the anime doesn't have a comedy genre written in the information page, there are actually comedies in this anime and they're are really funny. There's also little a romance in it, but maybe too little.  
Oh, maybe it's too a little too late to say this but the anime is dark themed. The main time of the anime seems to be evening till night. Also, sometimes the phantom are really scary with many creepy eyes in its dark body, creepy voice of multiple people saying a sentence together telling a certain someone to desperately commit suicide. That’s not a bad thing though.  
After going through a lot of battles and conflicts with a lot of emotions, the ending was really satisfying. Maybe not that satisfying since it causes the anime to end and made a lot of people demanding more and more. :P But still, an ending is an ending, and i'm going to say this again ~it was really satisfying. 
 
Characters : 8/10 
 
Another great aspect that made this anime better and better is the characters. The characters in Noragami are all well rounded. The different types of personality of the three main characters was great. I'm sorry if I used too much good adjectives in this review since it's undeniable-ly(bad English of mine) great in many ways. Yato is strong, badass and looks pretty stupid, but he gets serious when something happens to  Yukine or Hiyori. On the other hand, Yukine is a rebellious boy, something like a delinquent who isn't really grateful of Yato's decision of picking him as his sacred weapon. He gets ...*spoiler*. Then there’s Hiyori. A human who turns into a Half-Phantom because she tried to save Yato from getting hit by a bus, but made herself getting hit by it instead.  Hiyori is a nice and cheerful girl who likes to tag along with Yato and Yukine’s godly activities. She can’t stand the idea of the the two getting hurt. Supporting casts are pretty good too, but i’m not going to go too deep into it. (Watch it by yourself okay?) 
 
Art : 9/10 
 
The first thing that popped in my head when watching the first episode was ‘Beautiful’.  The studio responsible for this beautiful artwork and animation is Bones. If you haven’t heard about it, it’s the studio well-known for many great and popular shounen anime, like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven and a much more. And... if you’re not familiar with any of those, I’ll tell you how it’s very pleasant for the eye.  Fluid eye-catching battles, nice character design and, beautiful breathtaking backgrounds is what you’re going to get from Noragami. So, that’s how it got a 9/10(great) score from me. 
 
Sound : 9/10 
 
Really nice OP and ED. The OP is called Hello Sleepwalkers, which is a a rock themed song.  The artist is a band named Hello Sleepwalkers and the name of the song is Goya no Machiawase. I don’t know about the band before and I just found out about it from watching Noragami, but hell it was really good. And, the ED is called Heart Realize by the famous group of musician in the anime industry, Supercell. The quality of the song is superb. 
Voice acting are great too. Seiyuu’s voice really feels like it matched the characters’s personality. The background sounds also fits the atmosphere. I really like the battle’s background music which is really unique. Of course, sounds are undescribable by words so, please watch it by yourself to hear it. 
 
Enjoyment : 10/10 
 
Oh, those good times of waiting every week for a new episode. I enjoyed this anime fully with all of my heart. It get’s me anxious every time and I really want to know what’s going to happen next. There are some episodes that has a great comedy and made me laugh out loud, some that has great battles, some that has a lot of emotions and affects my emotions as well, and the last episode that made me say “please don’t end!”.  Of course, I’ll be hoping for a second season since there are plenty of story material waiting to be animated, but I guess hoping to much could lead to bad day if it doesn't go your way.  But overall I really enjoyed this series. 10 points from me :D. 
 
Final Words 
 
Noragami or ノラガミ is a great action-shounen anime that has a great story and not-pointless battles and also a little comedy. If you liked those genres, then without doubt, you’ll like Noragami even more. I highly recommended it to everyone looking for a great series to spend their time at. 


          
 
       Helpful All of us have seen that one series or show or book that didn't seem to know which direction in which it was going. Noragami, however, manages to pull off all of its elements perfectly without even batting an eye. Keep in mind that this is my first review so anything I’m about to say may be incredibly biased or just inexperienced as a whole. With that said, let’s begin. 
 
Story: 9/10 
 
The story of Noragami begins with Hiyori: an average high school girl who has a fated encounter with Yato, a homeless god, but we'll get to them later. Hiyori, being the angel of a person she is, pushes Yato out of the way of an incoming bus when he suddenly runs into traffic. This results in not only an accident and her being taken to the hospital, but from then on she gains the somewhat troublesome habit of losing her physical body and taking on a similar form, but travels around as her soul seperated from her body. Deciding she can't live on like this, she begs Yato and pays him in advance to restore her back to her original form, and thus, the two connect and Hiyori is abruptly introduced to the world outside of our reality. 
At least, that's what the show would have you believe from its broad overarching plot. 
Noragami consists of several plot lines that all mesh in beautifully with each other both in terms of pacing and execution. It wastes no time in moving the story forward, save some of Yato's comic relief and character introductions here and there. It even has some realistic darker undertones thrown in smoothly. They make sure you understand the weight of loneliness and just how invisible those who are not of the living can be, how painful it is to be forgotten and wanting to be remembered. Having read the majority of the manga so far, the anime followed it quite well, had it not been for the filler arc that took up the remaining 3-4 episodes. But for the most part, I enjoyed the story very much and hope that it will follow the manga if it were to receive a second season, which is HIGHLY FAVORABLE.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
 
The main reason why I love the characters of Noragami is not only how diverse they all are, but it seems to have a Hiromu Arakawa feel to it; no character is used solely for fanservice or comic relief in spite of their first appearance. Every person in this series is well fleshed-out, developed, and not one-dimensional in the slightest, though that's what you may get the impression of in early episodes.  
Yato, our main character, is somewhat of an underdog aside from being homeless and having a strange fashion sense. He is definitely the real propeller of the show, providing us with not only mystery, insight, and of course, more comic relief than you can shake a stick at, but just such a fun time watching him in general. There wasn’t a moment I didn’t appreciate his presence on my screen. What’s not to like about a bratty, teenage looking god taking up job requests for only 5 Yen? Much about him is still to be revealed, though they’ve given us enough to go on for right now. His viewpoints on humans and life as a whole is somewhat irritating yet fascinating due to his experience of both and naturally, having lived for thousands of years as a vicious war god who has somehow faded to an insanely silly and docile version of that is still unkown. But to end his profile, Yato is a great character who differs from the typical shonen hero who still has plenty of development to go and is an amazing joy to watch at any given time. And personally, my favorite character of the series, so bias warning there. 
Next up is Hiyori. I definitely don’t have as much to say here, as she is a pretty bland character until she meets Yato and gets caught up in the world of gods and evil spirits. Before that she is just the average high school student who goes to school with her friends, has a loving and rich family, and is just normal overall. Her most defining trait is without a doubt, her extreme levels of kindness that most female protagonists seem to ooze with these days (hence the reason why she pushed a complete stranger out of the way of an oncoming bus because she’s a female and therefore is /just /that /nice.) But of course, she isn’t simply that customary for no given reason. Her main purpose is to serve as more of a window into the hidden reality we see that is so different from our daily lives, since she lives the everyday life that most of us do either as well or similarly to a fair extent. She reflects more of the confusion and shock the average human being would feel upon having a million revelations thrown into her face via Yato, and I suppose if you really don’t care for her she could be more of a wish-fulfillment character into an alternate universe. Unlike other leading characters, she’s determined and knows when to take the initiative when the situation is tight. But alas, she starts out as the badass female lead and then ends up getting damseled like some million-dollar-prize in the last couple episodes, which I hate with the burning passion of a million suns. But moving on.  
Last of the main three is Yukine, Yato’s sarcastic, stubborn fourteen-year-old Regalia who serves as his weapon for 98% of the show and also adds some more comic relief to (but mainly against) our poor underdog god. Out of those already mentioned above, he undeniably undergoes the most drastic character development in the entire show and /all of it/ is so, so, so satisfying. It surprises me how much hate he gets from the fandom, though not only is that a) more personal bias, b) not the time to bring this up in a review, and c) a time to complain about the fandom giving him crap, but I thought all of it was well justified, mainly because it is so simple to see what it is he wants, where he’s coming from, why he wants all these things that he can never have. Plus he actually acts similarly to how an actual fourteen-year-old boy with raging hormones and inner angst would. The show finally starts to get into a rhythm of a plot with his introduction, which is majorly important as well. The only complaint that I would have is that I felt that the episodes just took a /little/ too long having the buildup to his extremely Paramount conclusion, though it was so intensely satisfying in the end that I completely forgot about it. It added a sense of desperation to the entire thing, which, when I think about it, is not necessarily a bad factor now. But of course, since he is a part of this show, he is a brilliant and extremely adorable character to watch if you can understand him, which should not really be a problem at all.  
The rest of the supporting cast is also great, each to their own with their own stories, pasts, and different sides, but are all also incredibly fun to watch as they give the show so much colour and variety. The only reason why I wouldn’t give the character aspect a full-on 10 is because of Yato’s rather-late-introduced arch-nemesis from thousands of years ago (who just happens to be a filler character because of the unfortunately short length of this series right now) and Hiyori’s demotion of “Prize to Be Won After We Win Because we Love Her”.  
 
Animation: 8/10 
 
I definitely don’t have any complaints here. For the most part the animation style is typical Bones fare, with the art looking approvingly alike to that of the manga’s. Each character design is bright and interesting to the eye, from Yato’s cat-like blue eyes and strange scarf to the brighter colours of the giggly Kofuku and the other personified gods. Scenery is also well done and detailed, though I wish there were more fight scenes included because this is where the animation /really/ shines through. (Yato’s Rend attack in particular, and mainly since this little cut is re-used multiple times in each episode.) Naturally there are times when the quality would dip here and there, but it does its job and doesn’t fail to please. Solid 8 here.  
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
The soundtrack for Noragami was composed by Taku Iwasaki, the genius who had previously created OSTS for the famous Black Butler and Soul Eater, both of which were known for their very prominent themes varying from rock ballads and pop to Victorian-era themes. Most of the music is light-hearted and a bit repetitive in its loops, but it sets the mood extremely well and never feels out of place. It occasionally mixes in a few classical Japanese themes into it too, and that never feels unnatural either. The battle music is the main point in this entire OST along with a few other tracks that will make you go, “Oh, this played when ______ happened and it sounded awesome!” because honestly it is just that great. No complaints.  
As if it could possibly add onto the already existing 10, the voice acting of Noragami is simply SUPERB and there is no other way I can say it. The casting of the actual god Kamiya Hiroshi as Yato was an absolutely perfect choice that would be practically impossible to imitate by anyone else. I wasn’t used to hearing him play such a wide range in a single role, but I have faith in that man. I got used to it, and he was simply amazing. In fact, even if I didn’t have any interest in Noragami’s story I would still watch this anime just because this guy is present in the cast. I don’t even think I need to mention Yuki Kaji, but I will anyway just for the fact that he pulls of Yukine’s pre-teen angst and personality so intensely well that I almost burst out sobbing the second he spoke a single line. Both of them are really what pull off the characters and that goes for the rest of the cast too. Having seiyuu regulars such as Sawashiro Miyuki, Fukuyama Jun, and Daisuke Ono were all great choices as well, and again, no complaints at ALL. Don’t even talk to me about the OP and ED.  
 
Enjoyment & Final Verdict: 9/10 
 
Now, even though I’d like to call it as such, Noragami is not perfect, as is anything else out there. But though it has its problems, I was never once bored or dissatisfied with this show to a large extent. The only thing that would make this bump up to a ten would be the confirmation of more to come. Though the anime had its happy (if not rushed) ending, there is still so much manga content to be animated, including the /incredible/ arc focusing on Bishamon, Yato’s other arch-nemesis from centuries ago, but now’s not the time to mention that. Noragami is a great blend of comedy and the supernatural, a character-driven show that really gets you to feel and has a tone that tends to capture. Beneath it all are underlying tones of darkness and grief, but still manages to put on a lighthearted tone when it needs to. But all in all, I had a great time watching the ride and grew attached to it. This anime will most definitely have a little reserved corner in my heart as one of the greatest animes of the Winter 2014 season and I’m looking forward to the possibility of a future season. And with that, I leave you.

       Helpful I, like most everyone on this planet, like things. 
 
The things that I like come in many different shapes and sizes. One such thing that I like is the Winter 2014 show Noragami, a 'feels' shounen brought to you by Studio Bones, that brings together elements of shows like Soul Eater and Rurouni Kenshin to give you a 'family-centric' journey exploring what it means to be alive.  
	 
Or rather I wish it did. At its best you've got tear jerking moments of mortality, family, and the struggles of existence. You have a cast of characters you care about, the voice acting encapsulating each character almost perfectly, flowing between emotions and the changing tone beautifully. At its worse you have long 'bouts of 'struggle of the week'. Slow buildup to something with mediocre story telling until the conclusion. And foreshadowing that is either so obvious it hurts, or massively fascinating and never really answered. 
	 
This show's strengths are in its characters, mainly Yato - who consistently brings out the best interactions of the entire show, be it his sweetness or his harshness - and are the primary reason that I want more and more of Noragami. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the cast are all better than average. Certainly better than what I expect from a battle shounen. And when the show is being a harsh drama I am utterly entranced, fulfilled and cathartic. 
 
But. When it is not being amazing. It is mediocre beyond belief. Slow pacing, which ,whilst forwarding the overall plot, could easily have been something else more in line with the show at its best. This is further exemplified by the animation quality which just seems disappointing. The art style deserves better than what it got. The art style on its solid and certain 'Phantoms' (The primary antagonistic beings for most of the series) just ooze awesome. Others look about as cool as a blue frog can look. And whilst I couldn't call the animation terrible, for the most part it does nothing good, the creepiness is not exemplified, the sadness is not exemplified, the little details are simply absent. I'm never impressed and at my worse I'm disappointed by how often the shounen “Power up to kill shit” is copy and pasted. Sure it is cool the first couple of times, but with the amount it is reused it loses its power quickly.  
	 
The soundtrack takes some interesting steps. Using more electronic and dubsteppy tracks than your standard rocky shounen. I personally found it kind of bland, but I can easily see others enjoying it far more as the tracks are not out of place and certainly match the moods of the scenes. Being unique in this regard should be applauded, but whether it really works or not is something we can question heavily. 
	 
However the biggest and most substantial flaw of this show is where the overall plot goes. This is a 12 episode series that does not buckle down and focus. Most of what fascinated me in the earlier episodes was not really built upon. Instead I have a Kenshin-esque fight scene and a re-establishment of the strange 'friend-family-esque' trio, which was only broken up an episode earlier. I want more exploration of Yato and Yukine's character depth and backstory. I want my weird romance subplot between a kinda human and a deity. I want the three main plot lines to be resolved.  
 
But I don't have that. Instead I'm left here waiting and hoping for a season two that takes everything amazing about this show and continues, without the flaws of the first season. Which in itself is an issue, because the ending track is completely and utterly gorgeous. Easily amongst one of the best EDs, based on track alone, that I have had the fortune to listen to in my lifetime. But a single music track alone is not something most people will watch a show for.

Among them is the easily flustered yet brave Bell Cranel, the sole member of the Hestia Familia. With the help of his demi-human supporter Liliruca Arde and competent blacksmith Welf Crozzo, Bell has earned the title of Little Rookie by becoming Orario's fastest-growing adventurer thanks to his endeavors within the deeper levels of the Dungeon. 
 
 Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II  continues Bell's adventures as he tries to bring glory to his goddess and protect those he cares about. However, various familias and gods across the city begin to take notice of his achievements and attempt to add him to their ranks. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia (ファミリア, Famiria). The primary activity of these organisations is exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon (ダンジョン, Danjon) in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores. By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known as skills.
The story follows the adventures of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old rookie adventurer and sole member of the Hestia Familia. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman of the Loki Familia, and vows to become as strong as her following a chance encounter where she saves his life from a powerful monster. While Ais is the object of Bell's romantic affection, several other girls, deities and mortals alike, have similar feelings for him; most notably, Hestia herself.
","Trying to get my point across without spoiling anything. 
 
I've enjoyed the first season quite alot and the beginning of the second season but there is things about it I quite frankly can't let go. The main part is about the characters and their development. Bell Cranel. He does not change at all, through out the whole story and that is something that is annoying. It feels forced the way he acts for the story to progress and it gets tiring after awhile. That's mainly my biggest grudge and why I get angry watching it because it's easy to see how the story progresses but it's not enjoyable if it's the same indecisive character having the same dilemma all the time. The first season was him overcoming himself and not being scared anymore but it feels like he has gone back to the start. If you have seen up to episode 8 you might understand what I mean. 
 
Except my rant about character development i've enjoyed the art and the sound, the story has been alright but just that alot in there that could've been better but its doable. 

          
 
       Helpful DanMachi season 2 feels like it's already been experienced. The story starts some time  after where season 1 ended and characters have since gained some strength for the upcoming challenges to come and with that giving less screen time for the actual dungeoncrawling, which is good since this seasons point isn't to become strong, it's being able to stand up to the challenges that have fallen on Bell due to his fast growth. 
 
We see a lot of conflict between familias compared to what we saw in season 1. This gives highlight to other ""rival"" characters to come and expand our known power policies in the world of Orario itself. The Gods itself have more role in this season than the last where they were just kinda sitting back and just cheering their familias on, but now there is competition and strategy to try to win more area and money to expand the familia and rise in power. As in terms of individuals Hermes is the most interesting one to step up in this season and not just as a quirky player, but as a calm and sharp minded person, plotting behind the scenes. 
      
Still it seems like the points have already been seen, and struggles to find the fresh and adventurous feel like the first season did. Yea Hestia is still in love with Bell and keeps forgetting some obvious things and get in trouble for it, yeah Bell is still a virgin that is throughoutly helpless to talk to girls and shit, but yet it still doesn't have the same energy nor the ring to it that made the first season enjoyable. 
 
Overall this season didn't quite reach the levels to be a fun and enjoyable watch and dropped to leave a mediocre impression that left me a bit dissappointed. 

          
 
       Helpful It is fair to say that I am one of those critics that had no big problem with DanMachi when it first aired in 2015. It was flawed, no doubt, but it was a harmless, fun adventure show that brought about one of the greatest waifu-bait cuties ever to grace the medium; and I will hear no denying that sentiment from here on out!  
 
After nearly five years, we finally get more of DanMachi to continue the story of our two favorite lovable companions going on more adventures and meet new characters on the way. If you remember my review of the previous season, you'd see that I gave it a solid score considering the type of anime that it is: Harem anime with a dim-witted protagonist. However, Bell is a dim-witted protagonist that at least has some heart to him and especially with his interactions with the boob goddess herself, Hestia. That was what made DanMachi a lot better than most of its similar contemporaries. My one big wish for the sequel was to expand on their relationship more and have it be a more significant focus on the narrative. 
 
What I did get was more of that, but not enough. The reason I wanted more of it was that everyone else outside of Hestia and Bell's relationship is merely decent to just downright dull. None of the other female characters have anything to them that makes them stand out or memorable in the slightest. Lili is the only one other than Hestia that has any semblance of charisma only because she does become more integral to Bell's story, and she does have her fair share of funny moments sprinkled throughout the show. Every other character, I could not put my finger on what I'm supposed to latch to. Their personal story arcs aren't exactly anything special or become downright melodramatic to the point where it gets nauseating the more I try to think about it. I would not classify them as terrible characters from a moral or writing standpoint, its just that the sequel did not do much to carry me through whatever struggle or situation they happen to be in. 
 
I have noticed that Hestia does draw some ire among the anime community. A lot will point out how annoying she can be whenever she tries her best to cling on to Bell whenever she has the opportunity to do so. There have been other characters like Hestia that did strike me as annoying to the point where I didn't want to sit through whatever tedious antics they conjure up. With Hestia, I find that what made her special was her eye-catching design and her bright personality that shines through Minase Inori's fantastic performance. Would I say that Inori could only play Hestia? Probably not. But, I think she sells this character with her much needed charisma that makes Hestia's advances more charming than anything else. 
 
I've said before that DanMachi's plot is nothing special. I would say it's not very good in many aspects. Many times I often forget what the main overarching story is supposed to be other than, ""Main character and companion go on RPG adventures A, B, and C."" There isn't much to it other than that. The sequel does try its best to give us plot arcs that jump up the melodrama to try to tug at your heartstrings a little. I don't think it was very successful as it felt a bit contrived once I thought about it. The one thing I will give credit for the 2nd half of the season was that it gave us a familia that is mainly populated by bikini clothed girls. So if you weren't already turned off by the boob goddess sulking up the screen by her gelatinous milk jugs, you will not be swayed by this season by a long shot. For me, I appreciated the gesture, even if the plot itself wasn't very memorable. 
 
The animation quality is about the same as season one. Thankfully. We have been getting a lot of lousy studio changes in other anime that switch up the animation or character designs that make it jarring to go back and forth to. J.C. Staff usually never disappoints to give quality art and animation direction consistently even if it isn't spellbinding like most other big-budget anime studios. 
 
DanMachi is one of those anime that I always stick up for regardless of its many detractors. However, it is one of those situations where I can not argue why those people have their issues. It is dumb in its execution to be a standout RPG/Fantasy anime in a time where there is already enough of those to the point of suffocation. Honestly, without the relationship between Bell and Hestia, I do think I would be on that side of the camp. Regardless, anyone who says anything about Hestia is just wrong in every sense of the word. Just stop. Please? Thank you.

","alright, I've been putting this review off for a while for the simple reason anything I could say has likely been said at this point, however that's a very weak reason not to do something. With that out of the way let's begin with the story 
 
Story: 
I honestly think the story is by far the weakest aspect of this anime. In it's essence, each episode has a focus character and the episodes tends to follow them and the events that unfold. Due to this Gai, being the titular character, does not actually take up a lot of screen time through out the series. Normally this would be fine if the cast is compelling or the side plot is relevant but neither is the case. Each character they try to develop is bland and their stories are either extremely underdeveloped or horribly clichéd. It gets the point where the story gives you no real reason to care about the cast or their motivations, just presents it and expects you to care. Not to mention the horribly unsatisfying ending that purely is meant to bait the sequel and doesn't do anything at all to actually tie things up.  
 
 
Art: hmmmm, i'm torn, the character art isn't actually bad in any sense of the word but the horrible mismanagement of CGI completely pulls you away from fight scenes. Honestly if there was an animation section i'd just pull points from there but since I consider art and animation to be separate I decided to give it a 6. (although the reused transformation scene got tired really quick) 
 
Sound: decent soundtrack, nothing out of this world, but it worked. honestly I can't remember any particular songs so great that I felt compelled to find them on youtube, nor did I find them to be off putting. probably the most average piece of the anime tbh. 
 
 
Characters: wew, man, what can I say about these characters. I'd say two, two of them are potentially intereting, of those two, one has a slight backstory explained, and he never gets good screen time afterwards. The rest of the cast, laughably flat and horribly developed. Character motivations are never fully fleshed out, and you just see people doing shit but you never get why. And if you do get a why, it's a disgustingly basic why. It's like they expected the cursed weapon trope to give them a pass on mindless villians.  
 
Enjoyment: I went in with the expectation it would be a decent seasonal, i was horribly wrong and despite my attempts to turn my brain off, little by little I became aware of the cracks in the show and by the time I reached the end I couldn't but ask myself ""why am I watching this?"". Should have cut my loses at episode 6 but whatever.  
 
 
I highly recommend you don't watch this, honestly i was suprised how bad this was compared to the other show I.G worked on. 
 
 
3/10 


          
 
       Helpful I'm still not sure about what I just watched. I've been going through the anime's that Netflix is showing and so far this is the worst one.  
The premise seems interesting, with the legendary weapons being inside a person and that said person fighting with the weapon and themselves for control. Once you lose control you go into Busoma state and that means you're finished, you are no longer human and the weapon took over completely.  
However the actual show does not deliver, there is no character development, the MC is a little ass and makes you hate him from the beginning. The other ""weapons"" just randomly appear with no context and no explanation. The rest of the characters are introduced in an episode to never be heard from again.  Honestly I watched everything and I still don't know where this was supposed to go.  
The art is good but nothing over the top, and the sound is completely off, doesn't connect well at all. I wish they could have provided something better, since it looked so interesting at first. What a let down. 

          
 
       Helpful This has to be one of the most disjointed, nonsensical, pointless anime I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. After being delayed for two years, Sword Gai has finally graced our screens; spraying us with its lovingly shat out excrement. Now’s the time to grab an umbrella because no one will be spared from this epically bad dumpster fire. 
 
Bear with me please, this synopsis may be hard to understand because well, Sword Gai is total nonsense.  
In a setting that resembles modern day Japan (I still have no clue where or when), there are certain infamous swords so old that they inhabit souls. Once a person grabs hold of one of these swords, they fall under its control and become totally helpless to its beckoning for the wielder to give it blood. This is where we’re introduced to the supposed main character’s parents, his father is killed on the street by some random guy with one of these swords. Leaving his pregnant mother with the sword to swiftly avenge her husband, give birth to the main character Gai, and kill herself all in the same night. Now the holder is Gai because for some unknown reason she chose to leave the sword in the baby’s hands so he could be the next possessed one. He’s discovered by a priest/sword forger who raises Gai to become a forger alongside his daughter, the same age as him. The set-up is simple enough, right? Think again because this is far from the only plot-line we see in episode one alone. 
 
The first episode is made up of vaguely related vignettes about people with swords. There ’s not much cohesion to it but the action is somewhat entertaining. We’re introduced to the corporation known as Shoshidai that discovers a sacred sword, and they later cross paths with the actual protagonist. There are many other stories shown, but I after seeing dozens of vignettes I can barely remember any of them. And if you find yourself forgetting these little side stories in favor of the actual main plot then I wouldn’t blame you. 
 
A majority of the episodes are just a bunch of these random vignettes that feel like they were made totally separate from the main story. We see stories from the perspective of a wealthy treasure hunter (who eats her treasure for reasons), a pop idol because why not, and a hairdresser to name a few. At best the characters were forgettable (I literally can't remember some of them), but at worst they're malicious caricatures that adhere to alienating stereotypes. For example, the treasure hunter character is depicted as an overweight woman who gets multiple panning shots in a bikini with splotchy character art and with a purposefully toadlike face to make sure you are fully disgusted by her. I'm not sure why it was necessary to depict the only overweight character in the show this way, but it comes off as confused misguided writing to the point it’s insulting. And it's not just her who gets this appalling treatment, almost all of the characters have such ridiculously unaware writing. There was really no one to tell them how bad this was? 
As if this show didn't leave enough of a bad taste already. 
 
All of the characters from the vignettes, whether insultingly portrayed or totally forgotten, were totally useless to the story. None of them matter to the main character’s story. It was like they were wasting the audiences time because the main story didn’t have enough content to keep us entertained and frankly it doesn’t!! The main character has the most generic and bland plot line in the show that it made me beg for the side stories to return because they are at least intruiging in how bad they are. 
 
Each vignette has the same sort of formula; a person is driven to kill someone through some horrible misfortune that befalls on them, they receive a sword randomly… and then they beat the living hell out of the people causing their problems! All of the vignettes (and the show overall) have a common theme of anger, each character is driven by raw fury, enraged even further by their sword. I want to believe that Sword Gai is trying to say something interesting about the connection between violence, weapons, and anger, but there’s no commentary part. What we get here is just a raw upsetting exploitation of an interesting theme for the sake of pointless violence. And this series has plenty of violence and gore that is meant to complement the edgy tone they’re aiming for. 
 
There are so many scenes in Sword Gai that make no sense for why they were placed where they were. We could be in a school at one moment, then jump to a random guy in the midst of a duel, then a little girl learning how to play the piano. All within a span of three minutes, because who cares if the viewer understands what’s going on, right? From time to time we get a minor explanation after a series of disjointed scenes settles down, but it’s never enough for us to fully understand what we just witnessed. This issue simply boils down to the poorly distributed 12 episode runtime of the story. A majority of the narrative issues could be alleviated if the series writer Toshiki Inoue shortened (or ideally removed) certain plotlines, and chose to further develop the more necessary ones.  
 
To add insult to injury, Sword Gai has dozens of buzzwords it mixes into the dialogue to ensure you definitely do not understand what is occurring. Busoma, Chrysalis, Shoshidai… the list goes on and on. And if you’re not actively keeping track of each word and what they mean then guess what… you’ll be just as lost as I was!! Even without these pointless buzzwords, the dialogue is still fucking abysmal. It so desperately wants to be dark and serious but it comes off as either mind-numbingly stiff, hilariously overdone, or just outright cringy. 
 
The visuals often fall into an all red color scheme with deep dark shadows (is that you Akame ga Kill?), plenty of blood, lots of angry people yelling at each other; it’s all so overdone. Sometimes the dialogue was so bad that I found it quite laughable, the most enjoyment I got from the show. I’d only recommend this show if you can ironically enjoy it’s how terrible and overbearingly edgy it is. 
 
If you weren’t losing your mind with confusion by those previous issues, then don’t worry because the director’s got you covered! There is no cohesion between the sequence of events between many scenes in Sword Gai. In one of the worst instances of this issue, we’re suddenly shown a montage of this random guy and his girlfriend together at an amusement park… but while I’m watching this play out I can only think, who are these people and why should I care!? There are way too many characters to be supported by such a purposefully disjointed plot! The ‘main’ character shows up from time to time to arbitrarily be a part of the sword fights. But the thing is, Gai is as interesting as a plank of wood for the entire series! So even with the protagonist present, there are no stakes to any of the fights. Maybe if Gai had more screen time we could have learned why he’s worth caring about rather than him getting the everyman character design and generic love interest to swoon over him. It feels like it'd be fitting to say Sword Gai has plot holes, but it's hard to level that criticism at it when THE WHOLE PLOT IS A HOLE. 
 
What made the scenes with Gai bearable was his pairing with my favorite character Seiya. He’s like a diamond in the rough who stood head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Simultaneously he adheres to the macho-asshole archetype but is surprisingly also a 100% certified nice guy. After being awoken from a sleep that lasted years, he returns to his now elderly wife and treats her with all of the same love and respect he would have before. This single brief vignette lasting only half an episode is without a doubt my favorite part of the show, sadly that is all he gets. Save for a few hilarious one-liners and his constant presence around the gloomy protagonist to provide some much needed levity. Sadly neither of them get much screen time due to the story's messy structure. 
 
I can at least praise the visuals for being decent. However, they’re nothing amazing, especially when comparing it to Production I.G.’s other recent release B: The Beginning. Character art is good but occasionally their animation is anything but. I didn’t particularly care for the CGI sword fights either. For a show that is billing itself as ‘the definitive sword guy anime’ it can’t even do sword fights right. B also has far better fight choreography with much more fluidity and impact. Sword Gai comes up with a stupid plot contrivance to make the characters fight each other in weird samurai/mech suits so that they can use CGI and it’s so obvious. As the rule goes, if you use your cursed sword for too long or something or other then it possesses you completely and you become trapped in one of those suits. Forced to fight in some really just mediocre fight sequences. Sound effects don’t line up perfectly with some of the blows a fighter takes during combat, nor do they have the audiovisual impact to convince us that the scene we’re watching is as dangerous as they want us to believe.  
 
This mediocrity extends into the totally forgettable soundtrack that fades into nothing when it’s present at all. As for the opening song, the less said the better because it’s awful. I’d love to analyze it and compare it to the main character’s arc, but the way the singer sounds makes my head want to explode. I did find the English dub good enough, the sub is equally decent, but remember… TERRIBLE DIALOGUE!! No amount of good acting can salvage a horrible script! 
 
Before closing, I should mention that there is no ending. The show ends on not even a cliffhanger, on just the same old ending of any other episode but without any others to follow it. The ending sets itself up for a sequel, even saying ""Part 1"" at the end, but there's almost no chance it will be any better given it was in production before the first even released.  
Whatever I’m sure as hell never coming back to this series if it gets a sequel or not. 
 
Score Breakdown: 
[Story: 1/10] Nonsensical, disjointed, forgettable, no ending. 
[Character: 2.5/10] Boring protagonist, one strong side character. 
[Art: 6/10] Serviceable art, so-so CGI, eye-catching use of color. 
[Sound: 5/10] Decent dub, forgettable music, sound effects lack impact. 
[Enjoyment: 2/10] Painfully serious at some times, laughably stupid at others. 
 
[Overall Score: 3.3/10] 
Sword Gai is a seething pile of angst and rage. It actively tries to make you feel the anger that all of its characters do, and it regrettably succeeded. If you've come this far you surely know that Sword Gai made me angry. Mostly it was a waste of time, but I can at least say it's the special sort of bad that's easy to laugh at. 
 
If you want an outlandish action thriller then I'd recommend you watch B: The Beginning rather than this. In fact, Sword Gai is the worst anime Netflix has released this year, it is an unsightly blemish on their otherwise strong lineup.

None of the characters speak, instead there's an omniscient narrator explaining what is going on, provided by the somewhat-laconic Peter Ustinov.  Also, the stories feature a disco-riffic soundtrack ripped from the decade, with songs by Mick Jagger and Joan Baez.     
   
Think of it sort of like Sanrio's answer to Disney's Fantasia, with a heavy dose of Heavy Metal mixed in for good measure.  Fairly dark and foreboding artwork -- except when it comes to the protagonists of each story, which are played by the Precious Moments Players.  Stories include the myths of Actaeon, Orpheus, Envy, Perseus and Phaeton.  All nice little tragedies to scare young children with.   
   
This really is a weird product of the seventies, and probably only of interest to buffs of the history of animation.

","Predictable, boring.  
 
More for he kind of people who like pretty boys + vampires. Jojo's Bizarre adventure accomplishes more in 5 minutes than this show did in 30 with its nuanced storytelling and unrelatable MC. When the most impressively tenacious and brave character in the episode is the bro character you know your powers of characterization is weak. The opening was good. The art featured a lot of these bright atmospheric shades but suffered from frankly boring choreography and stiff movement. It's a nice way to whet your appetite and a good time killer but not what I would describe as a springboard into the manwha. 

          
 
       Helpful When I saw that my favorite manhwa got animated, I was so excited I could not speak. And I enjoyed it merely because I was waiting for this for so long. But let's face the reality: this OVA isn't too good. I liked the animation, though some characters look a little different. But the soundtrack and the scenario are terrible. They threw away all hilarious and positive moments that made me love this manhwa so much, and left only the battle scenes (which looked pretty decent btw). They also minimized the plot and changed lots of detailes. Of course you'd say ""How do you expect them to put 80 chapters into a 30-min OVA?"" Well the answer is: the shouldn't make it into an OVA in the first place. In my opinion if you decide to do something, do it well. This manhwa deserves a full anime adaptation, with cool soundtrack. 
But as I said earlier, I still enjoyed it because it's better than nothing.

          
 
       Helpful There are several words that come in mind when trying to describe this ONA, and the most suitable one would be that it is hilarious, even with the underlying, or rather, main theme of this work: vampires and Frakenstein.  Yes, you read right, Frankenstein and his very master that awoke after his long slumber. It must be noted that is has its share of action as well. Noblesse: Awakening is an adaptation of the of the korean manhwa Noblesse. 
 
The story surrounding vampires is nothing new, yet the fact that it incorporates both Frankenstein and his master, Cadis Etrama di Raizel, is something I have yet to see in the medium itself. What is actually intriguing is the fact that the ""master"" awakens in modern society, so there are naturally futuristic things he quite doesn't understand, which creates some very amusing situations. 
 
It also includes a good amount of well executed action, which came as surprise. For the matter, it is only 30 minutes long, so it isn't able to represent the scope of Noblesse, and thus is quite condensed, yet this serves to transmit well paced action sequences. However, this also means that there are a lot of things introduced that aren't explained to the viewer, which was to be expected. 
 
As for the characters, there is not much say besides that the main protagonist, the master of Frakenstein, is silent, cunning and ""badass"" character, which is quite pleasing to see. The supporting cast are composed of zombies and vampires, which are necessary for the setting, yet their motives or why they're there is unknown. 
 
Concerning the animation of this ONA, it is very well done, fluid motions and great choreography in the battle scenes. In addition the backgrounds were satisfying enough, including the character's designs which can be a bit generic, yet is a slightly different from what audiences are used to see. I might want to add that Frakenstein and the master are represented as ""bishonens"" yet without its typical personality, which to some may be a great addition - what usually is depicted as a malformed, is now a bishonen. As for the soundtrack, it was average, yet befitting of the anime, including the opening and ending. 
 
All in all, I really enjoyed this ONA despite its generic premise and I am certainly now inclined to read the manhwa of this piece - or rather, seeing an adaptation of the series, as the premise can turn out to be something interesting. I would definitely recommend anyone to check this piece out, it is only 30 minutes long; and you never know, you may end up liking it. 
 
Thank you for reading.

","i will update this review as i watch more episodes... 
 
To begin with the anime does not have much potential the first 2 episodes were not on the mark but it gets good with episode 3.... i am sure they will improve it and i hope it will not disappoint us..... 
 
The plot seems pretty normal we can hope it will get better but i cant say much right now it but hopefully it has variety of good characters and the story line can be twisted and can have plot twists it always does with story line like these  
 
 
It starts with two beautiful girls visiting London to study in a university when suddenly the MC Baileu Ton gets in a supernatural incident when a goblin stole her belonging thats when she meets with Vlad Luke and Toryu the three handsome MC like there are in a typical reverse harem anime all three are not humans..... 
Ton has some powers because of her the bloodline... 
 
 
The anime opens feeling something like a supernatural mystery story but by the end feels like an all-out action anime complete with heavy artillery, flashy explosions, and transformations. The series is clearly going for more of an action-oriented experience rather than slice of life or romance 
 
 
As for animation the show is a wild ride that I can say I absolutely didn’t expect, and while near the middle it The studio, Liden Films, has worked on a few projects I’m familiar with and while I enjoyed those series moderately, the animation work was never the strongest point and again it doesn’t really shine through in this anime either. It’s serviceable, but there are plenty of scenes that are plagued with lazy background faces and sloppy animation in action spots. 
 
 
near the  middle it starts to feel like a mess of themes trying to create a cohesive picture (seriously, why does the Chinese vampire have a minigun?) I found myself enjoying the silliness of it all. As of now, it’s hard to say if this is worth the watch. If you’re like me and just enjoy monster harems, you might want to take a look. The ridiculous spectacle of it all might be all you need to stay entertained. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Limited spoilers review!  
 
This review was written after seeing all episodes. 
 
At first glance, “Phantom in the Twilight” appears to be a reverse harem in the style of many otome-based anime from the past so many years, but it doesn’t quite fit the bill. The series itself doesn’t seem to know what it’s supposed to be and throughout its short twelve-episode life suffers multiple times from an identity crisis. One episode it seems to be following in the footsteps of otome-based series, the next it’s turned to head down the path of one-episode arcs with an overarching theme to tie the episodes together, and yet another episode it begins to crawl towards a focus in action. If you’re looking for a series requiring deep thought, or even active thinking, this series will bore you. If you’re looking for a series to pass the time and chill, something not requiring much thought or attention to understand, then this series might serve you well. With that out of the way, let’s get into why it received an overall rating of 6. 
 
Story: 6 
The story itself is nothing special. Two college-aged girls, Ton and Shinyao, traveled to England to attend school. Ton has always wanted to go to London due to her great-grandmother having left her family to go there. Due to a mysterious incident that happens early in the first episode the two girls become separated, and due to a searching spell which Ton inexplicably knows (you’re supposed to assume she learned it from whatever sources she used to learn of her great-grandmother apparently), she finds herself in a café with individuals whom of course are not human and are male; however, she need not worry, for they have a connection with Ton’s great-grandmother and are plenty eager to assist her. At this point it’s normal to assume that this is a set-up for a bunch of shipping scenes between Ton and all the males, but I’ll give the show credit, it didn’t take the easy route for the relationships (though it would be the logical choice for a show such as this). From the second episode onward the show travels in different directions and doesn’t do an amazing job in any area of the story. The surprises aren’t big, and even when not entirely predictable, simply leave you thinking “okay, no biggie”. After each episode (minus the final) there are little chibi shorts which provide a little insight into the “world” of the show which are a cute addition and are actually be my favorite part of each episode, which isn't exactly a good thing. 
 
Art: Not going to bother going into any details or rating, nothing special, onward to the next thing. 
 
Sound: 8 
The voices suited the characters very well, none felt out of place, which is always nice. The opening theme I personally didn’t care for and tried to add to the action vibe of the show I felt. The ending theme more often than not broke character with the final moments of each episode but was pleasant to listen to. Battle music was nothing extraordinary but served its purpose. 
 
Characters: 5 
Characters are flat, two dimensional, and aside from one of the side characters have no development; even with the side character, the development was foreseeable and nothing special. All the characters, even the villains, fall into neat stereotypes. While decent character growth would be hard to achieve in a short series such as this to begin with, there’s no effort whatsoever to be creative in the character department. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
I began watching the show just to watch it if that makes sense. I didn’t have high expectations, so by the end, I wasn’t disappointed… Okay, I was slightly disappointed; the action scenes truly are lame considering how many of them are thrown in. As I mentioned in the beginning, this show works well if you want to watch something casually, but if you’re looking to become engrossed in a series this isn’t the series you’re looking for.  
 
As previously mentioned, this series lacks a true identity. It doesn’t have enough romance or shipping material to make fans of otome-based series satisfied. The action scenes are not worthy of considering this a true action series. The drama is not dramatic, the surprises are not that surprising, but at least the ending is somewhat of an ending. That’s right, the ending does at least provide enough closure where things are settled enough, you’re not left expecting anything beyond this final episode; a mediocre predictable ending granted, but for a mediocre predictable series, this ending works just fine. 
 
Hope this helps!

          
 
       Helpful It's easy to dismiss the otome and reverse harem genre troupes that Phantom In The Twilight has, but since it's an original series that's made to promote Chinese game developer Happy Elements's (which brought us Spring 2018's Last Period, which was a fun time) latest smartphone game, the similarities could not be stark contrasted until the series started fleshing out itself, with the final product being a completely different stand-alone media, all on its own. 
 
Handled by Fumiaki Maruto (Saekano, Classroom Crisis) and Shunsaku Yano for the overall series composition, Phantom In The Twilight tells us the tale of two friends: Baileu Ton and Mu Shinyao, who has just arrived in London, supposedly for a student exchange program, when suddenly evil forces kidnap Shinyao and leaves Ton in the lurch. In comes 4 men: Vlad the vampire, Luke the Wolf, Toryu the machine-gun frontman, and Wayne the Polygon walk-talk-hacker child-looking kid, with a fierce and cunning true side.  
 
These men, who are called the Twilights, work together at Café Forbidden, the mysterious night-only café that serves as a haven for what they call Umbra: living creatures of the shadow world that was once governed by Sha Rijan to keep peace between both humans and Umbra. It is there too that Ton learns that she is the descendent of Sha Rijan, and has to use her powers to maintain the same peace that the fromer has upheld against the Snowmary Corporation, guarded by 2 men: Haysin and Backup. Each responsible for the power development of both Ton and Shinyao respectively, for both to face each other in an inevitable fight. Along with other side characters (Chris, Detective Gregory on the good side; Van Helsing on the bad side), it's an action-packed supernatural fight that honestly is anything but noteworthy, yet it works to give the original game more retrospective (how this adaptation follows the game, I have no idea so don't ask me how). 
 
The character designs were intriguing yet appealing. Created by Hidari (Fire Emblem Echoes), all characters were uniquely designed to give them their characteristic traits, and based on how the anime adaptation went all out with, it's easy to see why their course of action resembles the demeanor look they have on their faces and expression to keep moving forward and not letting their enemies breathe space. I specially like how both genders were represented here with the troupes being absent, such as Ton with her tomboy-ish shorts and not being the damsel-in-distress (while Shinyao is the total opposite, but silent with an invisible but strong power), and the Twilight guys who are constantly saving the day (with Luke's brother Chris siding with the Twilights to protect Shinyao at all costs). 
 
Speaking of relation-""ships"", I naturally ALSO thought that there would be this constant scene of the main guy fawning over the girl MC, even if vaguely shown in the OP sequence. And earlier I've said the otome and reverse harem clichés are red flags, but guess what? This series ADDS another one into the mix (with Chris and Shinyao becoming the hidden couple) as if one isn't enough! And if that ain't gonna break the bank, they throw the clichés out almost immediately! Simply ingenious. 
 
For a world that's as large as London would go, I have to say that Liden Flims did a good job relating the world-building and confining to the elements of the show, showcasing the vast lands of London and imitating the actual landmarks to a T. The action scenes felt strong too, but a little overdone, as is with the sacrifice of quality in a 50/50 supernatural-action packed series that just chocks emotions of anticipation and ""fine""-ness. And of course, the art is striking and beautiful, just as you would expect from the series itself. 
 
The music, probably is the lowest point of the series (to my taste). The OP, aside from its generic genetics, has grown on me a lot. I still don't like it mind you, but it eclipses the setting of the overall going-into-the-story and setting quite nicely. May'n's ED feels very out of place, until you realize that it's the overarching finale of both Ton and Shinyao coming and returning ""HOME"" to one another as is with their childhood memories, and that's where the ED starts making sense. It's a good song, but the execution was somewhat wrong. 
 
Overall, Phantom In The Twilight has nothing special going for it regardless of its ""Original"" source, but what it does, it executes in what it could succeed at, and that is all that it matters. Think nothing of the general troupes that fills your tastes when you start watching this show, and you will end up fine.

As such, while Touya cannot contact his old world with it, the phone can be easily recharged by magic and can otherwise function such as accessing data from the old world and can use relevant features for his new world such as the GPS function to locations which are comprehensively identified on it.
God also greatly amplifies Touya's physical, magical, and cognitive abilities to a certain degree as a further apology for the inconvenience of killing him. Taking full advantage of his second chance at life, Touya befriends many different people, mainly women and high-ranking people in the new world. He begins to travel from country to country, solving political disputes, minor quests, and nonchalantly enjoying himself with his newfound allies.
","How can you describe this anime; Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.? It's pretty easy. Just say out loud the official English title of this anime; In Another World With My Smartphone. 
 
In Another World With My Smartphone is about Mochizuki, a young teenage boy who was accidentally killed. To apologise to Mochizuki, God allows him to ask of any one thing to be brought with him to be summoned to another fantasy world to which Mochizuki asks for merely a smartphone to be brought to this fantasy world. Being an anime that is set in a fantasy world where the protagonist is being summoned into after their death on Earth, this is seen as a cliche and is compared greatly to Konosuba. Being summoned by God himself, he is given an over substantial amount of magic power to which he is ""OP"" and able to conquer anything in this fantasy world. This is what sets this anime apart from Konosuba, and is also what makes it comparably worse.  
 
To distract us from his over powered buffs he gets from God and immense invincibility, this anime makes sure to set up a harem-like setting where he forms a group with some girls with him being the only male and leader of the group. Again, this is another similarity to Konosuba and this anime can be called a clone of Konosuba; a much worse one in fact. 
 
As Mochizuki is over powered, we know that any complication in the plot and any ""suspensful"" moment becomes meaningless as we already know that there will be a simple resolution as he can just say the ""magic word"" and he saves the day and ends the episode to this pointless Konosuba copycat of an anime. 
 
The OST to this anime is not that good. The music get's too dramatic and distracting, especially when it comes between the dialogue and interactions between characters. The soundtrack is usually meant to fill the blank space to not make the dialogue so bland, but the soundtrack merely just overpowers the dialogue and distracts us from the plot and what is going on. On the contrary, the voice acting for the characters are good. There's nothing really bad I can say or criticise about the voice acting. The seiyuus are all good. 
 
Character development is done well in this anime. Since there is no deep complications that happen in this anime, development of characters are done easily with no need of dramatisation and development is also complemented by the harem-setting of this anime. 
 
The character designs are very familiar and pretty average. There is nothing unique and the characters all look like either your sterotypical male protagonist in a fantasy world or the accompanying female moe cast who are in this endless harem on this one male protagonist. There is also nothing really special about the animation style. It's pretty average. 
 
All in all, this is a pretty average show that is probably not worth your time if you were looking for something different or substantial. But, if you wanted to see something fast-pace that gets straight to the point regardless if there is no suspense or barriers for the main cast, then I recommend that you watch this anime. 
 
In Another World With My Smartphone. The title sums up the plot of the anime. If that's what you're looking for, then that's what you're getting.

This show is pretty bad, but I like it. I feel like it's an experiment in trope density.  
 
It's odd though, the characters are so 1 dimensional that I get the sense that I have no idea what anybody is thinking in the show. Like... retro videos games (bare with me) the graphics were so basic, that your imagination made up detail that was missing. The characters here tap the same vein for me. This can only do so much of course when there's zero payoff but, hey: Tom never did eat Jerry. 
 
On the upside(?), Main guy just straight uses his powers and fixes everything. I've nicknamed this show ""Jesus-kun iPhone"" It's a great example of wish fulfillment and how it can refreshing when everything doesn't return to status quo at the end of the episode. The main dude is an innocent griffith in disguise with how fast hes moving up the rungs in his new world. (and nobody in proximity seems to have a problem with it) 
 
I don't recommend this show to anybody accept maybe the most jaded and cynical aneem addict. They would be the ones I'd guess would hate the show so much they might like it in bass ackwards way.

The anime is okay I my opinion, it is not bad and yet not great and the only bad thing I can think of about the anime is that the main character is WAY overpowered and has no challenges at all in any confrontations 
 
If this is all we got from this series, then I think the anime should have had a lot more episodes in where the main character  came up again another character who is in a way similar, basically what I mean is the lack of a rival made me not think of this anime as a great one.

Story: 8/10 
 
The story is the same as always: some evil people attavk a kingdom and wants to conquer earth. Only because they hate love, kindness, hope and all that good feelings. But they wont have it easy: precure will save the day! 
 
One thing that I like is the new addition of the show: they put international precure: no matter in which country you are. A group of precure will save the day: India, Japan, Texas, Spain... Because, why only the evil organization attack one city if they can attack at the same time all world? 
 
One thing that they used in the first half of the anime is that: if you collect enought precards you can wish something. In the second part this thing was forgotten. At the end its only a cute thing only to collect and use. Why: the cards are clothes and with magic you can change into the clothes that are on the cards. 
 
Art. 7/10 
 
Art and animation aren't good enough. Past season have better animation and character design. But again, a new addition is now on the series: CGI animation on when the precure attack. Yes, its cheap CGI, but is something. For the 10th anniversay of pretty cure the animation is really lame, with episodes that you can say: ""what... where they lazy or don't have enough budget to animate this episode."" 
 
About the character design its not bad. Its cute but to be honest to childish and ""sweet"". You can say, ""hey, its a kids show"" yes, but I have seen several animated kids shiw and they have better. 
 
Character. 9/10 
 
The character is one of the best points of the show. They're aren't perfect ith a lot of cualities and no defects. megimu is a little dumb about love and she doesn't have any dream. Iona hate Hime becouse on her own version he has the fault what happened to her. This 3 characters have bad and good feelings.  
 
But I really don't like too much Yuuko. She is always kind, likes food and thinks all the time about food and honey candy. She sings good and is the perfect lady: knows what she wants, and help others.  
 
Talking about other characters, I also ike Blue, the Earth god. He search for kind girls only to become them precures. He has doubts and secrets. And you know that will be problems when the four protagonist know what really happened. 
 
Enjoyment. 8/10 
 
In overall, I enjoyed the anime. Ignoring bad animation (is bad in several episodes not in all) I really liked this season. but I really wish that toei, in some parts the story were superficial. They can be better.

          
 
       Helpful Happiness Charge Precure is just an animated toy commercial―more or less. Despite it being the first Precure series that I watched, it is one of the weakest that I’ve seen in terms of narrative and visuals. The only character that was more than a one-dimensional archetype was Hime, who had to evolve from being a spoiled princess and accepts the guilt of disappointing members of her kingdom. It’s a kid’s show, so it didn’t dive much more into that; that and the series’ primary focus is on love, crushes, and advertising new toys.  
 
?	There are obnoxious, card-based transformations that revolve around dancing, so there might be an Aloha transformation when one of them is a hula dancer, or a ballet card, etc. In general, I don’t like it when cartoons incorporate a card-based system to a series like Precure, that doesn’t need cards, because it’s just an excuse to sell more things! To the creators: If you make a good enough series, with memorable designs, people will want to buy the trading cards! Having the characters use a transformation device that requires card input is an obvious marketing ploy! I felt that there were so many toys advertised in this series that it distracted from the actual plot! 
 
?	I know the Precure franchise didn’t become an enterprise without shilling and selling tons of toys, but when you make an entire series―Shill: The Animated Series, it’s going too far. It’s like the series didn’t want to pay for television advertisements, so they put them in the series as a means of subliminal messaging. It’s best to go the simplistic route, like the series that aired the following year, Go! Princess Precure, that just has a CG castle that the characters turn a lever on―that’s obviously supposed to be a marketable toy, or the weird Heartcatch Precure spinning wand where they scream to invoke its magical powers and because of the campiness, the scene blended so well with Heartcatch’s obscure, otaku atmosphere. 
 
?	For those who were fans of Heartcatch’s character designs, this series copies that and creates something with a similar art style, but far less quality. From beginning to end, this series is almost filled entirely with stock CG scenes and product placement. It wasn’t so bad at the beginning, but I can barely remember the plot towards the middle of the series because it was so much of a commercial! 
 
?	There’s an addition of “international Precure(s),” so I guess even if you’re a child living in the United States, you can still be a Precure? This Precure series commemorated Precure’s 10th anniversary, so if any of you are hardcore Precure fanatics, there are small vignettes before every episode with each of the old Precure(s) introducing themselves and sometimes saying something quirky, like Erika from Heartcatch. If you don’t want to watch Happiness Charge to see these anniversary specials, there’s a compilation of them online! 
 
?	In a nutshell, the characters in the show, other than Hime can be described as this: Megumi (main girl, tomboy), Yuuko (sweet girl who literally likes making sweets), and Iona (girl looking for revenge, rival with a soft side). If you haven’t seen all of those worn archetypes a million other times in anime, then perhaps, you will enjoy this series more than I did.  
 
?	Overall, some of the animation looked good, but the budget was noticeably frugal. If you want to see good animation in a Precure series, watch Go! Princess Precure or Heartcatch Precure. The romance arc between Megumi and Seiji is the only thing that the series really cares about in the end, though implied Hime and Iona is very close to being a canonical pairing. I thought Queen Mirage was a cool villain who was overshadowed by Phantom; her gothic aesthetic and powers reminded me of Queen Nehellenia from Sailor Moon SuperS, who I thought was one of the best Sailor Moon villains. This series isn’t really worth watching as a whole, there’s far too much filler. In the end, I give this corporate product a 4/10.

          
 
       Helpful Ah, Pretty Cure. It has never failed to make me amused. I'm always excited for a new episode to come out and I always enjoy it. Now that another season finished airing, it's the time for me to write my review. 
 
Story: Young Megumi Aino, age 14, and Hime Shirayuki, age 14, bump into each other unintentionally. They become friends. Soon, Megumi meets Ribbon, her mascot. She is given a Pretty Change Mirror (PreChan Mirror) to transform into the tough Cure Lovely. Hime, who was already a Cure, transforms into Cure Princess. They fight the Saiarks and save the city from destruction. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Art: This...style is extremely unique from other anime. The animation makes it look more cartoonish but with an anime feeling to it. Every episode, the art gets better and better. Never has it been a horrible style. Plus the CG was AMAZING. It was like the endings of Pretty Cure, but this time, it was inserted in the middle of the episode. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
 
Sound: The OST was so beautiful. Each episode had a different sound track and no sound track was the same. The opening and endings (Especially Pretty Cure Memory) are as catchy as burrito. The voice acting was SPLENDID. Back in the beginning of 2014 I was scared because Megumi might have a squeaky voice. NOPE! They made her be voiced by Megumi Nakajima, who was an idol girl. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
 
Character: Megumi Aino is a young girl who, like every other cure, is energetic and fun. Then there is Hime Shirayuki, a shy, timid princess girl. Then, there is Yuko Oomori, who is the sweetie bell of the season. Lastly, there is Iona Hikawa, the boyish of the season. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Enjoyment: This was a WONDERFUL season and the second best season out of all. I give this a 10 out of 10! Which means, THAT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER SAW!!!!!!!!!1!!!!1!!!!!

12,10080,60,6.688096539,Story between god and human,Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai II,"Keima Katsuragi, the ""God of Conquest,"" returns to his quest of expelling runaway spirits that have possessed the hearts of women. Still stuck in his contract with the demon Elsie, he must continue to utilize the knowledge he has gained from mastering multitudes of dating simulators and chase out the phantoms that reside within by capturing the hearts of that which he hates most: three-dimensional girls. 
 
However, the God of Conquest has his work cut out for him. From exorcising karate practitioners and student teachers to the arrival of Elsie's best friend from Hell, he is up against a wide array of girls that will test his wit and may even take him by surprise. Though he would much rather stick to the world of 2D, he is trapped in lousy reality, and so Keima must trudge forward in his conquest of love. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","Keima Katsuragi, a second-year high school student, is an avid player of gal games (video games that involve interactions with anime-styled pretty girls). He is known on the Internet as ""The God of Conquests"" (落とし神, Otoshi-gami) for his legendary skills to be able to ""conquer"" any 2D girl in games. However, in his actual school life, Keima is called otamega (オタメガ), a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku (オタク) and megane (メガネ, glasses).
At the start of the series, Keima receives an e-mail offering him a contract to ""conquer"" girls and, thinking it is an invitation to a game challenge, he accepts. In response, a cute demon from Hell named Elsie appears: a Spirit Hunter. She asks for his cooperation to help her in catching the evil spirits that have escaped to the Human Realm: the ""Loose Souls"", which were once Old Demons from Hell. These evil spirits hide themselves inside the hearts of girls, feeding off the hosts' negative emotions to replenish their power and strength, thus becoming whole demons once again (and in turn, the host becomes an empty shell of a person). Elsie suggests that the only method to force the evil spirits out is by ""conquering"" the girls' hearts, making them fall in love with him and filling up the gaps which the escaped evil spirits hide in, in which she is then able to capture them. Interested only in video game girls, however, Keima is appalled by the idea, and refuses the assignment as he has no romantic real life experiences whatsoever. Nevertheless, with the contract already agreed, Keima has no choice but to help Elsie no matter what, as they will be beheaded by an invisible (to others) purple collar around their necks if they fail.
After winning the hearts of fourteen girls (and capturing the spirits residing in them), Keima and Elsie are given an even greater mission: to awaken the six goddesses known as the Jupiter Sisters. Each sister is dormant in the heart of a girl among those they have previously helped, thus Keima must locate them and conquer their hearts a second time. This time however, they remember the encounters he has had with them already, due to the goddesses inside them, causing high tension and constant possible failure as he tries to conquer the girls simultaneously. However, his time is limited as a rebel demon faction called ""Vintage"" is planning to capture the goddesses and take over the world.
After Vintage's plans are thwarted, Keima starts seeing visions of a child who is somewhat familiar to him. The goddesses send Keima and Elsie to the past with the task of helping her. Upon arriving, they team up with a mysterious girl who apparently has some connection with Dokuro, Elsie's superior in the underworld, and Keima discovers that several occurrences in the past are different from what he remembers, leading to a tragic chain of events that he must avert to ensure that the present stays unaltered, as well as another demon faction which releases giant humanoid monsters.
As Keima completes his final mission, he discovers the truth about one of the giants and is able to reconcile with it. He is relieved from the collar and returns to his normal life in the real world.
In addition to Keima's romantic comedy adventures, the series makes fun of and parodies common, and popular cliches about dating sims, anime character stereotypes, and pop culture.
","Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai II or (The World God Only Knows II) was more then quite enjoyable to watch, after finishing it with 24 hours I can say that the anime was more then enjoyable to watch, with the great amount of comedy spread throughout it and romance from the main story. The school life side of it comes out really well with character development but what really impresses me is that this is one of those second seasons to a show where I did not think it dramatically lost pace. It kept up with the story and didn't have some out right enraging plot twist. The MC's style of character, gamer, withdrawn from society also shows interesting ways of deducting evidence while still remaining in a calm, cool self  I only had one small problem with the show and that was it's repetition when it came to the conclusion to chapter the whole ""Knight in shining armor"" just make me feel like our MC actually cares about reality (even if it is only to save his own life) 
 
Still highly recommend it as a top 20 anime

          
 
       Helpful I loved the first season of this anime, and I didn't have much expectations to the second season once a saw the cast of characters. 
 
The second season starts a little slow, The first capture wasn't all that interesting in my eye's, althought the humor was all solid as ever and none of Kasuga's personlity or charm was interesting enough satisfy me. But once Haqua's arc began this season only got better and better, and it was finally Elisie's time to show her worth and that she isn't all the useless in a capture. 
Chihiro's arc was the arc I was looking least forward to. But I have to admit it was the best capture until now and the far more interesting. 
In Jun's arc Katsuragi really had to use all of his date sim skills and brain power to capture her! And he never stop's impressing me with his timing and his use of words. 
 
Something that did disappoint me a little is that Elisie didn't get more attention, something I was hoping for this season. 
That was the only thing that really disappointed me this season. 
 
And I was happy to watch that it wasn't really some boring filler episode's this season as in the previous one. And it was good watching Katsuragi's silliness and Elsie's clueless once again. And I'll be looking forward to season 3

(Source: AniDB)","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy']","Commander Takuto Meyers is a commander of the 2nd Frontier Fleet, when exiled Prince Eonia launches his coup, Most of the Royal Family on the homeworld were killed via orbital bombardment, and large portions of the Imperial Fleet were destroyed in the surprise attack. As Commander Meyers is unable to contact 2nd Fleet HQ, he waits on standby for orders, until three members of the Angel Wing arrive, with a large fleet chasing them, which turns out to be unmanned ships. After destroying the fleet, Meyers takes his fleet and follows them back to where the Elsior is hiding, the battleship usually used only by the Imperial Guards for ceremonies and meets his old Instructor Lufte, now Commodore, who charges Meyers with commanding the Elsior and the Angel Wing in escorting Prince Shiva, the only survivor of the Royal Family, to the Rhombe system where loyalist forces are gathering for a counter offensive as the 2nd fleet has already been destroyed. Before the engines can be repaired however, more enemy ships arrive, and rather than risking discovery, Commodore Lufte takes command of the remaining fleet and draws the enemy ships away, while the Elsior remains and makes its way to Rhombe, fighting off enemy attacks along the way, including elements of the Imperial Fleet changed sides to side with Prince Eonia.
While attempting to meet up with the 3rd fleet stationed at Rhombe, the Elsior discovers destroyed remnants of the 3rd fleet and runs into a trap by Prince Eonia's main fleet. While fighting the forces, they receive another message from the 3rd fleet with a new rendezvous point, after fighting their way through the enemy fleet to the rendezvous point, allied reinforcements arrive and force the enemy forces to retreat, Commodore Lufte having evaded enemy forces and reached the Rhombe System ahead of the Elsior. Afterwards, the Loyalist fleet launches an operation to destroy Prince Eonia's main fleet at the Nadler system, and they inflict a serious defeat on the enemy and the commanding admirals (and other high-ranking officers of the Imperial Navy) decide to hold a ball in Prince Shiva's honour, and plan to transfer Meyers away to command another fleet while the Angel Wings and the Elsior remain behind to guard Prince Shiva on Fargo, an orbital city around the planet Rhombe. On a routine visit to the ship's hangar, Meyers bumps into a strange girl called Noah, who wants Meyers to give him one of the Emblem Frames. When Meyers refuses, Noah gets angry, says that she will make more and stronger ones, and runs off, disappearing just around the corner. Shrugging the incident off, Meyers takes his chosen love with him to the ball, and while there Prince Eonia shows up with several soldiers to try and take Prince Shiva into his Custody, although Prince Shiva refuses. Shots are fired, and it is revealed that Prince Eonia and the soldiers are just holograms and are not physically present, at this point Eonia's fleet launches a sneak attack while most of the Loyalist fleet is docked and not combat ready, and inflicts serious damage on the port facilities.
Meyers heads back to the ship with Prince Shiva, and after the enemy fleet retreats, the Black Moon, an identical counterpart to the White Moon(a planet sized structure) shows up and fires a massive laser that slices Rhombe in half and destroys much of Fargo and the Loyalist fleet. Meyers and the Angel Wing fight a desperate battle to reach the Black Moon, which is constantly producing attack satellites and unmanned ships, before Noah unleashes an EMP like blast that leaves the Elsior, the Emblem Frames and the Loyalist Fleet powerless except for sensors and communications, before attacking them as they lay helpless. While the situation looks grim, suddenly the Elsior and the Emblem Frames have their power restored to above their original levels, and the Emblem Frames all grow wings. They manage to break through the defensive line and damage the Black Moon which causes Prince Eonia to back off for now, turning it into a stalemate, although afterwards the Emblem Frames lose their wings and their power levels drop to below normal.
As the loyalist fleet gathers on the other side of Rhombe, Commodore Lufte takes command as everyone higher-ranking was MIA and presumed dead. Elsior's chief engineer, Creta and Prince Shiva shed some light on the abilities of the Elsior and the Emblem Frames, and also that there is a weapon possibly capable of destroying the Black Moon, but it is stored in the White Moon. While briefing Commodore Lufte on the situation, he mentions that Noah was spotted on other ships and the port facilities before the attack, although when guards attempted to question her, she disappeared into smoke right before their eyes. The Elsior and the Loyalist fleet then head to the White Moon in order to retrieve the weapon, as Sherry, Prince Eonia's second in command, tries to stop them along the way, but fails, finally sacrificing herself as she tries to ram her flagship into the Elsior, although the Angel Wing manages to destroy her ship just before impact. At the White Moon, Lady Shatoyan, the Holy Mother of the White Moon, reveals that the White Moon is a weapons producing factory just like the Black Moon, but the people who found the White Moon decided to keep it a secret, and only use the technology there for good. Lady Shatoyan then lifts the limiters on the Emblem Frames and installs the Chrono Break Canon on the Elsior.
In the Final Battle, after defeating the Hell Hounds, Prince Eonia's elite fighter wing piloting copied Emblem Frames, Noah causes their frames to grow wings as well by altering their structure, in the process causing the fighters to consume their pilots and turn them into soulless zombies. After destroying their fighters, the Elsior gets into position and destroys Prince Eonia's flagship with the Chrono Break Canon, after which Noah reveals that Noah was just a form used to trick Prince Eonia, whom wanted to use the Lost Technology to create an age of peace and prosperity for everyone, into launching his coup so that the Black Moon could unite with the White Moon and evolve further. While the Black Moon pulls the White Moon out of orbit in an attempt to unite with it, Meyers and the Angel Wing breaks through a large screen of attack satellites to use the Chrono Break Canon on the Black Moon, but before it can finish charging, the Black Moon brings the full weight of its power on them, disabling them, all except for the Emblem Frame piloted by Meyer's chosen heroine.
","Galaxy Angel Z (Season 2) 
 
 A great continuation of the Galaxy Angel series. Fantastic episodes that are broken down into 10-13 minute shorts. We're given a lot of great comedy again, making Season 2 an absolute must watch, but Galaxy Angel Z takes a turn and introduces some very real tense moments. The episode with Forte and the Silent Soldier was down right not a comedy; introducing dark, scary, tense and entirely different emotions from what we normally get in a Galaxy Angel episode. The stark difference works really well too, as the episodes that go in the opposite direction from the standard Galaxy Angel setup seem to act like backstory and of a more serious intent. 
 
 The story is once again, for the most part, non-existent, though it makes Galaxy Angel focus on the harder things like character interaction and actually being funny, something that Galaxy Angel does really well. 
 
 Sound and music design is very 90's, with a lot of sounds that seem to come from many different shows. It doesn't hurt Galaxy Angel, but it's not exactly the best either. Ambient sounds are good though, as are the sounds of guns and other things. Opening and ED are really nice to listen to once again. 
 
 The girls are still really cute and with Galaxy Angel Z, we see more depth and information about them than ever before. Mint and Milfuelle continue to be super adorable and mega cute, my favorites!! ~ 

          
 
       Helpful I've talked about Broccoli Entertainment's Galaxy Angel series before. A long, long time ago. Seriously, it was a very early review and it was a great series. Like Broccoli's other franchise I've reviewed, Di Gi Charat the anime was handled by Madhouse. Does this one live up to its predecessor? Let's look and see. 
 
Story: 
 
Like the first series, this one has no real story. Each episode puts the Angel unit in a different bizarre situation, a lot of which use the lost technology to drive the shenanigans and some of which just rely on putting the characters into a situation and letting them be delightfully quirky. 
 
The big issue with the series, like the first instalment, is that it has an inexplicably serious episode. Yeah, there's an episode about Forte having a traumatic experience on the battlefield and her old enemy returns and she has to face her fears and go against it and the episode has, in total, one joke and it's not a particularly funny one because it's taking itself far too seriously. This is an anime that parodies game shows and sentai series, has an episode with the characters switching bodies and does a bunch of other crazy shit. A largely serious episode doesn't fit. The gags in the Volcott reunion episode are kind of weak too. They're pretty much built around seeing him bossed around by crones. But at least s has some. 
 
Those halves aside, the comedy in this is is spectacular. It's built on high energy, zany absurdity that's excellently executed, with only those aforementioned exceptions that only make up... 12% of the series. 
 
Characters: 
 
This isn't a complex group of characters. They're built on their quirks and on having very strong comedic interactions. Which, to be fair, is a perfectly acceptable route to go down in a comedy. And the characters are designed in such a way that you can put any of them in a scene together and get something funny out of it. You don't need any specific permutations. It's hard to even say whether some work better than others. So, the comedic chemistry is pretty spot on. 
 
Art: 
 
I'll give Madhouse credit on the artwork front again. They have some excellent backgrounds, strong object designs and really good visual gags. The extended chase scene with Vanilla being a good example of that. If there's anything worth being critical about, it's that the comedic art style shifts might be considered excessive for some people. But they also suit the comedy type, so I can't say I had any real issue with them. 
 
Sound: 
 
Tamura Yukari, Yamaguchi Mayumi, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kanai Mika & Shintani Ryuouko get to show off their acting chops a bit more in this series. Yes, they were good in the last one too and all my praise about the surprising levels of nuance still holds true. But the body changing episode has the group of them swap mannerisms and basically imitate the speaking styles of the other characters, which they do fabulously. We can thanks Itou Masumi for the soundtrack. She also worked on music for Phantom & Shigofumi. And I'll give her full credit, she is excellent at composing music that suits the atmosphere of a series. I quite like the theme tunes as well. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
Again, there's a bit. There are points where Ranpha seems to lose her general boy crazy mentality and be more into the other members of the Angel unit. But there's not a lot of that. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Galaxy Angel 2 is a bit of an improvement over the first series. It certainly suffers from some of the same problems, but its high points are better. If you like that variety of off the wall crazy comedy, I'd highly recommend it. If you like your comedy to be more subdued, dry, raunchy or referential it's probably not for you. For myself, I really loved it. I had a god time watching it and was very entertained. As such, I give it a 9/10. Next week I'll look at Melty Lancer.

          
 
       Helpful This review most likely going to be short. 
 
It is more of the same that was present in the first season of Galaxy Angel. However... the show has improved, and contains some very well written non-comedic episodes. Music has also improved and is less annoying. Characters are mostly the same.  
 
Overall (if you haven't watched the first season for some reason). This is mostly a ""silly fun"" kind of anime that talks about some sort of all-girl special force that is supposed to be doing... something? Finding lost technology? Fighitng crime? Protecting justice? I'm not entirely sure. But instead they usually end up in some sort of messy or silly situation instead. 
 
Detailed breakdown below: 
 
Story: 6/10 
The story has improved compared to the first season. While first season mostly had a story that didn't really standa out in any aspect, this season features several episodes with a serious or mysterious atmosphere, which are surprisingly well written. There aren't a lot of those episodes - 3 or 4 of them total, but they're memorable. The rest follows the same pattern, like the first episode - girls dealing with some situation they've gotten into. There are more references to toher anime as well.  
 
The story is episodic, and doesn't really have an overarching storyline. I think the episodes could've been watched in any order without any negative consequences. 
 
Art: 5/10: 
Same art as the first season. It looks relatively low budget, and does not really have a lot of details going on. It is not as bad as, say... Narutaru was, but they're definitely trying to reduce animation budget when they can, even though they don't really ever go overboard with cost cutting tricks. 
 
Sound: 5/10: 
Doesn't really stand out, but the annoying electronic tune from the first season is, thankfully, gone. Music is okay. The music that accompanies ""serious"" episodes is actually good, but it is rarely utilized. 
 
Characters: 5/10: 
They're okay. Basically, everybody has a role/stereotype or archetype they adhere to and they try to stick with it. On an occasion the anime shows other side of the character, but there isn't much character development going on. In the end, it is a gag anime, so this is understandable. 
 
Enjoyment: 6/10: 
I liked it more than the first season. The serious episodes were surprisingly good, especially the one called ""Silent Enemy"". 
 
Overall: 6/10: 
 
This is no masterpiece, but I'd recommend to check it out when you have the time. The show is fairly clean too, meaning no gore and fanservice in it. So, mostly silly fun kind of thing, with occasional sprinkle of seriousness.

She enters the world of the Four Gods, determined to win Taka's heart and be the new priestess.","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","The series describes the various trials of Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, two middle-school students. While at the library one day, Miaka and Yui encounter a strange book known as The Universe of the Four Gods. Reading this book transports them into the novel's universe in ancient China. Yui is transported back to the real world almost immediately, but Miaka finds herself the Priestess of Suzaku.

Yui is also drawn into the book when she tries to help Miaka to come back to the real world; becoming the Priestess of Seiryuu, working against Miaka out of jealousy over Tamahome and revenge for the humiliation and pain she had suffered when she first came into the book's world.
","Fushigi Yuugi is the last OVA of the Fushigi Yuugi series.  It is 4 episodes long. 
For the first 2 to 2 1/2 episodes, things are pretty boring, but it picks up later and you kind of want to see how it wraps up.   
The main character, Myo, is not very likeable.  She's a whiny, selfish girl.  You could say she is the main character, but I'd also say the usuals are also focused on a lot.   
As you may or my not know, Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden was two books in a fan-written light novel series.  The fact that it is fan-written clearly shows itself in some parts of the story.  I'm not going to give anything away, but there is a bit that contradicts what was established and communicated in the main series.  Luckily, it sort of fixes itself if you want to believe so, but I still find it unfortunate. 
The animation keeps up with the art style and animation of the main series and the previous OVA, but I didn't like the CGI animation that was added in.  It took away from the viewing experience and made it seem less like what we've been watching for the past 61 episodes or so. 
Overall, I'd say Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden is worth the watch, especially if you can almost not get enough of the show.  The conclusion makes up for the boring beginning that provides the setup.  Watch it like you would the rest of the show, but whether you like it or not just remember that it never really happened.  This is fanfiction on a professional level.

          
 
       Helpful Having read Fushigi Yuugi recently, a friend of mine suggested watching this for laughs and I have to say that it was incredibly dreadful. 
 
The character of Mayo was horrendous. She felt like a complete Mary Sue, only inserted because they wanted to make more money off the franchise. She was whiny and not appealing at all with how much hatred she had. The other characters weren't incredibly bad, seeing as Miaka was not very active in this.  
 
The story was lacking. They made up back story to characters and completely broke canon. It did not make any sense. They should have just left it off where it had ended before.  
 
Then, there was the CGI. I have seen a few things that were animated and had CGI thrown into them and this was just like them. It looked cheesy and did not need to be in there. They should have just taken it out all together.  
 
The only good thing was that it was good for laughs, not because the story is funny, but as long as you have a good sense of humor, you can pick out the little things that make no sense to laugh at. 
 
Overall, I feel as if this was a waste of time watching. There were very few redeeming qualities to it. 

          
 
       Helpful If you want to see what a OVA looks like, look for the following: 
 
1) An unlikeable heroine 
2) An unoriginal story 
3) Was originally a fanfiction 
 
Trust me, there are good fanfictions out there that would be good enough to be a pretty decent spin off of some kind. However, FY Eikoden is a terrible fanfiction.  
 
Mayo Sakaki is very unlikeable. Now girls would be able to relate to her more if she wasn't so god damned psycho while having this crush on Tamahome. Yui was more believable, but Mayo is downright psycho. Threatening to commit suicide because some boy doesn't like you? Geeze, and I thought Yui was jerk. Yui was believeable in the sense that she was: 
 
1) Extremely heart broken  
2) Wanted revenge for being left behind by who she thought was her best friend 
3) Admitted that she was wrong when she found out that Nakago was only lying to her.  
 
I really felt that I could relate to Yui more then Mayo. I don't know who said that Mayo was believable but trust me, you're wrong.  
 
The story could've been way better. At first, it would seem interesting. Espeically when you're all &quot;oh, a new girl gets into the book? I'd like to see how this turns out.&quot; But then you're set up for disappointment.  
 
The story would've been interesting to read as a fanfiction by itself. Espeically if the writing itself if good. But as an anime, it's just unenjoyable.  
 
And moving onto the fact that it was originally a fanfiction. I have read better fanfiction then this crap. Way better. There are so many fanfictions that deserve to be published and turned into an anime; which is rather depressing.  
 
FYE has all the traits of not only a bad fanfiction but also a bad anime. I loved the first Fushigi Yuugi indeed, but this is just a mockery.

But something was missing. In search of his family, home, and a place to truly belong, Leo traveled back to Africa and began his journey to become the King of the Jungle. 
 
Leo's adventure centers around finding peace between the animals and humans who live in his African home, often competing for space and resources. As he grows, Leo must survive both the area's harsh environment, dangers from other animals, and humans who hunt lions like him for sport. Only communication and mutual understanding can end the fighting, and Leo's knowledge of human culture may be just what the jungle needed. 
 
 Jungle Taitei  is the epic story of a young lion's struggles to survive in a dangerous land.","['Adventure', 'Kids', 'Shounen']","In Africa during the mid-20th century, as mankind encroaches, the white lion Panja (Caesar in the English dub) gives the jungle's wild animals a safe haven. However, he angers nearby villagers by stealing their cattle and their food to feed the jungle carnivores (in the English dub he merely frees the cattle). A professional hunter, Ham Egg (Viper Snakely in the English dub), is called in to stop these raids. He avoids directly attacking Panja. Instead, he records the sounds of Panja and uses them to trap his pregnant mate, Eliza, who then becomes bait in a trap for Panja. Panja is killed for his hide (but not before asking Eliza to name their child Kimba), and Eliza is put on a ship, destined for a zoo.
Kimba (Leo in Japanese) is born on the ship. Eliza teaches him his father's ideals. As a huge tropical storm nears, she urges her cub out through the bars of her cage. The storm wrecks the ship and Kimba starts to drown in the ocean. The fish help him learn to swim. As he begins to despair, the stars in the sky form the face of his mother, who encourages him. Guided by butterflies, he makes it to land.
Kimba lands far from his ancestral home and is found and cared for by some people. He learns the advantages of human culture, and decides that when he returns to his wild home he will bring culture to the jungle and stand for peace like his father.
The show follows Kimba's life after he returns to the wild, still a young cub, and how he learns and grows in the next year. Kimba soon learns that only communication and mutual understanding between animals and humans will bring true peace.
","Critic's Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2012. Review #20: Kimba, The White Lion 
 
Back when I was about 5 or 6 years old, there was a Disney movie that I watched all the time. That Disney movie was The Lion King. I loved the animation in the movie and I never got tired after repeated viewing. Today, I haven't watched it as much because there are other movies I like and I have shows that I want to watch. I decided to do a little research on the movie and I found that it bears a striking resemblance to Kimba from the anime Jungle Emperor (Kimba, The White Lion in The U.S.) There was a controversy over The Lion King because of its similarity to Kimba, The White Lion. It's been 18 years since The Lion King was released so I have no comment about the whole comparison of both things. My theory is that Kimba, The White Lion was the primary influence for The Lion King. It didn't completely plagarized Kimba, The White Lion. I also want to mention that I am treating this review as a retrospective. With that said, here's Kimba, The White Lion! 
 
 
 
The basic premise of this anime is that Leo (Kimba in the American release), a young lion cub who becomes king of the jungle when his father was killed by a human hunter. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Mushi Pro production and this is an anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga of the same name. Don't know who Tezuka-san is? I'll tell you. Tezuka-san is a cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer, activist, and was best known for series such as Astro Boy (which was the first anime to come to the U.S.), Black Jack, and Kimba, The White Lion. Tezuka-san was often nicknamed ""The Godfather of Anime"" and often considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney, which made total sense. Tezuka-san was influenced by some of Walt Disney's work. Tezuka-san has a prolific output, and had pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres that earned him nicknames such as ""The Father of Manga"" or ""The God of Manga"". 
 
 
 
Before I go any further, I want to apologize beforehand that I dropped this series and I don't plan on finishing it. I will simply give out my retrospective of Kimba, The White Lion to the best of my abilities. 
 
First of all, I am going to excuse the quality of animation on this anime for a couple of reasons. First off, this is the first anime in color. Secondly, this was a 60's anime. The animation has definitely aged as time went by. 
 
 
 
 
The music by Isao Tomita may not be recognizable today but he often composes soundtracks of the anime adaptations of Osamu Tezuka's series. 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as voices go. This is going to be a bit difficult to talk about. I am assuming the Japanese cast is good on this show. The Dub is from way before 90's dub quality and the dub is corny but actually watchable and that's saying a lot. Too bad the American release never included the subtitled version. it's a Dub-only affair in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
The characters are simply introduced well but it was hard for me to latch on to the characters in this show. I don't have much to say on this matter 
 
 
 
 
 
Then there's the story, It is kid-friendly but it does challenge the audience with some mature themes. It has a simple premise that expands as the show progresses I should also point out that Rintaro (who went by the name Shigeyuki Hayashi during the making of Kimba) was the chief director. You might want to do a little research on this guy because there might be a few animes that he was involved in that you probably didn't know that he was part of. Also, Eiichi Yamamoto was also the director of this anime and he also did the series composition for Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US). 
 
 
 
After sharing those little tidbits, allow me to mention The Lion King once more. About the whole controversy about whether The Lion King homaged this anime or plagarized it. There seems to be some comparisons between the two and I can see some similarities.  
 
 
 
This anime was influential in Japan and might as well be a major influence to The Lion King. The Lion King might as well be an American tribute to Kimba, The White Lion. 
 
Kimba, The White Lion is available from Right Stuf. 
 
 
 
With that said... Kimba, The White Lion is an anime worth checking out if you are looking for an anime that is definitely worth seeing if you want to go as far as the 60's. This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However in order to fully appreciate this anime, you will have to overlook the flaws and technicalities that this show had to offer. This was a 60's anime, this anime was completely hand-drawn and not many sound effects were possible at the time. What you see is what you get when it comes to this anime. Many children in Japan grew up watching this anime and now are the key players in the anime industry today. I may not have a big interest in this anime, but at least I was able to give out my first-impression retrospective into the series. 
 
 
 
I give Kimba, The White Lion a 5 out of 10, it is SO-SO! 
 
 
 
feel free to comment, and give out a might roar!

Japanese robot technology is making remarkable progress; they can understand human language, and they've even succeeded in developing a humanoid robot that can feel emotions. The setting is a future town on the outskirts of Musashino in the Tokyo area, where humans and robots live together, ""New Musashino City."" In this town, our main character Ichiro and his friends, as well as some robots, all get along very well. Before these friends appears a mad scientist, Professor K, bent on taking over the world. Ichiro and his robot partner, Kombock, and his other friends stand against him to crush his schemes. 
 
Will they be able to protect the peaceful lives of humans and robots from this evil?! The story of the friendship of Ichiro, Kombock, and their friends begins!! 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Cubix, takes place in the futuristic year of 2044, is the story of a bright-eyed young boy named Connor with a deep fascination for robots. His father, Graham, who dislikes all robots, has never truly been supportive of his efforts. That is, until they move to Bubble Town, a city with ""as many robots as people,"" and the location of RobixCorp. The reason for RobixCorp's global success is the EPU (Emotion Processing Unit), which allows a robot to develop their own unique personality, just like a human being.
Now that Connor's dream has finally come true, he finds himself with one really big problem: everyone in Bubble Town owns a robot, except him. Shortly after his arrival, he meets his nosy neighbor Abby, who sends her flying pet robot, Dondon, to spy on him. Graham, being not so fond of a robot spying on him, attempts to capture Dondon. During his escape, he crashes into Connor, knocking him out. A worried Abby, along with Connor, hop onto her hover scooter, rushing for the one place in town that can fix her friend.
Here, Connor meets Hela, who runs a repair shop called The Botties' Pit. However, to become an employee, he has to fix a robot in less than 24 hours. Of all the robots he could have chosen, Connor picks Cubix, a one of a kind test model referred to as the 'Unfixable Robot.' The Botties all tried to repair him, especially Hela, who could never quite throw him out. Cubix is the one memory left of her father, Professor Nemo, who invented the EPU. Sadly, he vanished after an experiment with a highly volatile substance known as Solex.
Suddenly, a rogue robot inventor named Dr. K runs off with a stolen robot, leaving the Botties' Pit on the verge of collapse. Connor races back inside in a final effort to save Cubix, leaving him trapped inside. This act of kindness jumpstarts Cubix's EPU, bringing him back to life. With only a moment to spare, Cubix saves Connor from the collapsing building. It was never a matter of hardware; rather, of heart, that fixed the 'Unfixable Robot'. Therefore, Connor passed the test, earning him a place in the club.
That was not the only surprise Cubix had in store, with his amazing design he can transform into virtually anything. Along with their new friends, Connor and Cubix face up against Dr. K to take back the kidnapped bot.
This series follows the adventures and discoveries of the group, as they unravel Dr. K.'s conspiracy and the disappearance of Professor Nemo.
","Cubix, excuse me, Saiko Robot Kombock is one of the series I obsessed over as a child. I'd flip to Kid's WB at whatever time it was on and make sure I caught every episode. I had every one of the toys (not very many, if I remember) and it was, oddly enough, the show that got me sort of obsessed with mecha. I'm hesitant to say that because I'd already had my fill of Gundam Wing and bootleg copies of G Gundam (how I obtained those as an 8/9 year old is a story for another time) but it made me feel as if I could have a robot of my own.  
 
Knowing a bit about rose-colored glass and all that, I decided to take a crack at this one as an adult. I couldn't remember much about the actual story or the characters as I was really just focused on the robots (read: toys) so this was for all intents and purposes a fresh watching.  
 
I watched a few episodes of the sub before I quit caring and went back to the sub.  
 
Let's start with the animation and models. Even for the time it was just bad. The models quality was inconsistent and it was easy to tell who was not going to be a repeat character. The animations themselves were clunky and it didn't feel as if much effort was put forth. The robots mostly got away with this but the human characters did not feel fluid and felt like robots themselves. I will say that while several look quite generic, many are original and refreshing designs.  
 
The voice acting in both the dub and the sub were horrendous. The mouths didn't even try to match with the audio in either. The acting was over the top and the voices didn't match the characters meaning the antagonist had an overly squeaky voice despite not looking at all that he should.  
 
The story and characters were generic. A generic 'Gary sue' for a lead, his female friend who explains things to drive the story, a smart kid to be used as a McGuffin when the group is stuck in binds, and the lovable dumb oaf. It really could not be more cut-and-paste. Plot development is predictable, even for a children's show. No attempt is made to be original here. It felt like a twisted knockoff of the Mega Man plot but much, much worse. I can't think of what else to say on this, really. Just plain bad. 
 
Overall, the series did not live up to my memory. Everything was bland and just plain awful. This one seems to have been forgotten by most and it deserves to stay that way. I should have left it dead in the past but my curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of any reason for anyone to watch this one in the modern day. Even if you're thinking about it for nostalgia's sake, just don't. 

          
 
       Helpful I haven't done a nostalgia review in a while, and I happened upon Cubix not too long ago- so here we go. 
 
“When a foolproof plan fails, it’s not necessarily proof that the planner himself was a fool, right?” - Dr. K 
 
Preface:  
 
If you were a kid in the late 90s- early 2000s, chances were that you were watching the recently popularized anime Pokemon or Yugioh. A lot of people don't know this, but before Funimation really took off (DBZ was their biggest license prior to acquiring One Piece from 4Kids, and they rescued DBZ from Saban), before Viz Media, before Aniplex America showed up on the scene, you had basically two companies that were licensing the majority of Japanese animation for western audiences: Pioneer/Geneon, and 4Kids.  
 
Nowadays, 4Kids Entertainment is the butt of many jokes and the easy target for  ""bad English dubs"" and censoring, after their mishandling of One Piece and subsequent loss of licenses for a pair of golden eggs: Yugioh and Pokemon.  
However, 4Kids was an important step in shaping the anime licensing and dubbing scene of today. With the smash hit of Pokemon in 1998, then again with Yugioh in 2001, 4Kids proved that not only was there a huge market for children's animation, but that it could be supremely profitable. Back in a time where very few movies series received licensing treatment- let alone TV shows, (which were always niche at best)- 4Kids was paving the way for the aforementioned companies to come.  
 
Now, onto Cubix- a long forgotten and overshadowed production of 4Kids.  
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 1 
 
Starting with the bad: the animation, and boy, is it ever odious. It's that early 2000's 3D CGI that looks so fake, you would rather eat melted down plastic on your pancakes than margarine. Seriously, it's bad. I would rather spoon out my eyeballs, hammer nails into them, dip them in gasoline and light them on fire than watch something with this style of 3D CGI again.  
 
 
Story: 4  
 
Cubix combines the elements of an episodic kids' show with an overarching plotline, mostly to good effect. It doesn't get ultra formulaic like its stablemate Pokemon, and it doesn't get into stupidly long single fight arcs like Yugioh. The basic premise is that the Machiavellian evil Dr. K is attempting to capture an energy source called ""Solex"", which, in a crystallized form, provides a source of nearly unlimited energy with which to power his various robot creations and rule the world. 
 The issue with Solex is that when it manifests, it causes the robot it exists in to go insane and attack people/destroy things, which forms the conflict of the first season. Connor, Abby, Chip, Mong, and Hela are trying to dispose of the Solex so that the robots return to normal, meanwhile, the nefarious Dr. K is foiled time and time again. He even gets blasted off.  
 
 
Characters: 4 
 
Connor and Abby are the pair of protagonists- Connor is the new kid on the block, loyal to a fault, friendship, all that kids' show stuff. Chip is the token nerd kid who quips and makes sarcastic comments, some of which are fairly adult, but mostly just bad puns. Mong is the token fat, strong kid with the temper. Abby is standard fare female protagonist- she helps and contributes, but ultimately everyone falls to the wayside for Cubix, Connor's robot. Cubix is a modular cubic-block robot (wow such naming conventions) that is naturally the hero of the show. He has his own magical girl transformation sequence that's used about 5 times per episode, and transforms into whatever form necessary to defeat the villain of the week, whether it's flying, tunnelling, super OP, or Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann. (I think I just imagined that last one.) 
 
 
Sound: 9 
 
Now, finally, something good. One more thing about 4Kids: they produced some fine voice talent, and while they were employed in-house, similar to how Aniplex does, they were also compensated well for their talents. The names this show has on the credits list reads like an A list Hollywood ensemble of voice acting.  
Connor is voiced by Andrew Rannells, a guy that's made the successful jump from VA to TV and movie acting in some recent NBC productions, but he's of less note than the other main characters. Veronica Taylor (Ash in Pokemon) voices Abby, and sounds fantastic as usual; her counterpart Rachael Lillis, also of Pokemon fame voices Hela, the engineer and repair lady.  
Dan Green, of Yugioh fame voices the robo-hating, angry dad character.  
The late Maddie Blaustein nearly reprises her role as Meowth in Dr. K, the squeaky, scheming villain who seems to be equal parts Dr. Robotnik and Team Rocket. My personal favorite, Megan Hollingshead, also appears as Raska, the self important, arrogant TV star. 
Lastly, they even got the Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin himself to do a role as the bogan (Aussie slang for redneck) robot, Kan-it. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 7  
 
The question is not ""did I enjoy Cubix as a story with characters and a cohesive plot"", but rather, ""did I enjoy Cubix for what it is""? and the answer to that is yes. As far as a kid's show goes, Cubix is absolutely run of the mill generic, and completely forgettable. Even as far as being a production of 4Kids, it's been largely forgotten in favor of much more important and big shows like its stablemates Pokemon and Yugioh. Cubix wasn't important enough to remain relevant, not to mention that it's not even Japanese!  
 
What I liked about Cubix was how this cast of voice actors that have gone on to do awesome things later were together on this little, long abandoned show for just a few months, 12 years back in my childhood. I watched it as a kid, and maybe I enjoyed it then, I don't remember. Now, I'm viewing it with a different perspective and am still finding things to like, and I have 4Kids to thank for that- not to mention what they did for the industry, of which Cubix is just a microscopic part.  
 
 
Overall: 5 
 
Recommend? 
 
If obscure 4Kids licenses with good Voice Actors and the occasional one liner geared towards adults appeal to you, this will be right up your alley.

His family even attempts to throw away Hazuki—Kotarou's name for the Hybrid Child—multiple times when he is not paying attention.

In my opinion it is considered a masterpiece, I could not even wait for sub that I already have finished seeing in raw version. I read the manga in the past, but then upon hearing the news that it would become an anime I immediately had doubts, which instead have turned into satisfaction. It has really exceeded my expectations, despite already the manga was wonderful. 
 
Start by saying that I absolutely prefer it to the other of Shungiku Nakamura (""Junjou Romantica"" and ""Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi""), perhaps because it is presented in a different tone. While the first two are romantic-comedy, Hybrid Child is dramatic themes and gloomy.  
Essentially, it speaks of these dolls that with love and affection (but also negative feelings) grow to physical and mood. 
There are three different stories in this anime which correspond to episodes 1, 2 and 3-4.  
The first story revolves around Kotaro Izumi, a boy from a rich family, who finds a boy-doll (Hazuki) in the trash; despite his parents are against it, he does not give up and continues to care for him.  
The second story talk about Yuzu, another boy-doll, which is adopted by Ichi Seya. This story has an important meaning, especially because it tells us that in life things that happen isn't always happy, but also sad. 
The third story, my favorite and the most dramatic, portraies of friendship between Tsukishima and Kuroda (or maybe love?), they are two sons of chieftains important. Unfortunately the unexpected happen and Tsukishima must take responsibility for everything, but with disapproval of his friend. 
Then we can deduce that the protagonist of Hybrid Child is Kuroda, also because it appears in all three stories. 
 
Take me to the point of being moved is a difficult feat, but ""Hybrid Child"" has done it. 
The designs are very well made and the animations are quite fluid.  
Another thing that surprised me a lot, is the soundtrack: it's beautiful and it's put in the right place.  
Hybrid Child is really amazing although it only has 4 OVA.

Anime don't usually make me emotional, and I certainly didn't expect this one to. But from the beautiful music to the moving dialogue, the story moves fluidly through the episodes, separate but they all come together in the end. You won't regret watching it, so just do it.

Now, I'm not a person who likes writing reviews but I had to write one about my new favorite anime series. Here's my ratings on everything; 
 
Story: 9 - I absolutely fell in love with the story after the first episode. Our main character, Akutsu Takuma, is a high schooler who has anthropophobia (the fear of humans). About 8 years ago before the story begins he lost his mom to illness and before his mother's death he promised her that he would become a good person which he tries to do by studying and trying to become the number 1 student. However, he struggles to focus on his tests due to his anthropophobia. Then, one day he saves a girl who happens to be a Valkyrie. This leads to him becoming the lover of 9 Valkyries aka Einheijer. His job now is to level up these Valkyrie through love and defeat akumas.  
 
Art: 7 - The art was the lowest rating I gave due to the fact that the art was nothing I've seen before and kinda threw me off for the first few episodes. I eventually got used to the art style, but it's just not a perfect 10 for me. 
 
Sound: 10 - I don't think the sound is something many people watch out for when watching anime and to be honest I'm not sure how to really give a rating for it so I just gave it a 10. The reasoning for my 10 is that the sound was just fine and it didn't really add or subtract anything. Sorry for my incompetence. 
 
Character: 10 - The characters were absolutely amazing. We had many different character types, which was a good thing since multiple characters having the same character ""type"" would've been very boring. Each character in this series brought something different to the table. Natsuki being a tsundere was pretty much 99% of the show but I enjoyed that. Mutsumi had a pure love (kinda) for Takuma and loved him since the moment she was introduced. Itsuyo showed the qualities of a confident student council president, but on the inside was actually an insecure girl. Yakumo was just a straight up verbal sadist towards Takuma. Futaba was the big sister who said ""ara ara"" every sentence pretty much. Shino, well, it's hard to explain her due to her lack of screen time but all you gotta know is that she calls Takuma ""Master"". Ichika is just a straight up siscon. Kururi is the innocent little sister who we all need to protect. Then, there's Takuma. He's not like other MCs. He's not overly kind or overly perfect. He has his flaws and his good points. He shows the most amount of determination out of all the characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 - I loved this series the moment I watched the first episode. I was never bored when watching this and every aspect of it was pretty much perfect. I honestly have no complaints, except for one. I wish I could show my family this series and not be called a disappointment. 
 
Overall: 10 - This is a series I never even imagined could've gotten me so hooked on it. Thanks to this amazing anime, I've started to read the manga which I highly recommend. So please, give this anime a watch in your free time.

I give 8/10 instead of 7/10 if the main character is not wimpy. it's one of my least fav trait when it come to any character. but the main character is not that bad all, it was ok and i don't think i ever hate it. would like to have season 2 to see takuma new self.  
 
ok let's get to the point of what I like about this series: 
- the fmc is very lovely, not too tsundere, the honesty to their feeling is there but not much as I hoped for.  
- The art is great  
- As for the story, hmmm just so-so? but atleast it took 1 day for me to complete this series( where it usually took 3-4 days) 
 
what I don't like: 
- not big fan of ecchi...rather watch hentai.(to be fair, what i don't like is, every time the fight scene occur, naked scene or any erotic scene will always be there) 
- wimpy male mc 
 
 
might be update in the future

","Saiyuki fans the world over, if you have not watched this than there is something missing from your fan obligations that need be filled in immediately. This beautifully animated film from 1960 depicts the famous “Journey to the West” in a classic style that has set the foundation for generations to come. The legendary Story of Son Goku: The Monkey King in his epic adventure “Journey to the West” has been retold many times over since its publication 1590 and since then has generated much popularity.  Everything from Dragon Ball to Forbidden Kingdom has draw inspiration from this amazing story. The Monkey King/ Alakazam the Great is one of the most well executed retelling of this classic tell and is a pillar of historical foundation for the 60’s as well as anime as a whole for coming along during the birth of this great genre’s lifespan.  
The animation for its time is quite advanced and done with great finesse. With the exception of a few other films, no other anime during that decade can match up to the beauty of this film’s animation and vibrancy. Voice acting during this day and age is not the best, but is easily over shadowed by its ability to continue on track telling its story. It fuses tasteful tid- bits of 1960 technology during the ancient times of this story such as telegraphs and pistols as well as things that haven’t even been created to this day like video telephones. All in good fun, of course.    It’s a wonderful family film that is beyond enjoyable with lots of adventure, song, dance, mystery, magic and fantasy. Anyone who watches this film will quickly learn to grow with Alakazam/ Son Goku on his journey to learning humility, mercy and wisdom. I thoroughly impress upon any otaku or person who is interested in the “Journey to the West” story to enjoy this film and add it to your resume of films viewed. You won’t regret it. 


          
 
       Helpful Let me begin my review by stating that I did not see this movie as a kid, and therefore have zero nostalgia goggles to work with. Saiyuuki, for lack of a better term, is not a very spectacular movie. The music is, for the most part, forgettable, and doesn't always work. The musical numbers are unneeded. The visuals are passable, but nothing special. The voice work is okay: again, nothing special. 
 
One of this movie's huge problems is getting me to care. I didn't care about the journey. I didn't care about the characters. In fact, I HATED most of the characters. The female love interest is a forgettable, bland cinnamon roll stereotype, and Son Goku is kind of a dick until very, very late into the film (and even then isn't that likable). The side characters are kind of neat on occasion, but most of them only show up for a few seconds aside from the guy who wanted to eat them, the pig, and the monk: and the monk is blander than water. 
 
Quite frankly, I went into this movie expecting a classic animation. However, as is sadly often the case with older Japanese animated movies, I instead found myself wondering why I was watching it, and constantly checking how far along I was (as early as 30 minutes into the film!). While not terrible, the film is certainly not good in my eyes. And on my ratings scale, that comes out to a 4/10. While I'm sure some people might enjoy it, with or without nostalgia glasses, I personally think you should give this one a skip.

          
 
       Helpful Based off the Monkey King character from the classical Chinese epic novel Journey to the West (Journey of the West being the inspiration for other cartoons like Dragon Ball Z), this is the story of Alakazam the Great and his journeys after becoming king of the monkeys. I watched it not expecting much after seeing a lot of low-budget early anime, but I was surprised by the great characters like Alakazam, and especially the pig Sir Quigley, whose character design is straight out of John and Joy Halas' Animal Farm.  
 
The American dub was really well-done, and actually pretty funny at some times. The movie as a whole is pretty lighthearted, and extremely imaginative. Magic is an important aspect of the movie, and the different ways Alakazam uses it never failed to be interesting. As far as the animation goes, it looks like it was very influenced by classic Disney animation. The fact that it's narrated by the voice of Disney-regular Sterling Holloway (the voice of Winnie the Pooh, and Kaa in the Jungle Book) adds to the Disney feel. The animation has aged well, more than a lot of anime from this time.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']",none,"The NES Ninja Gaiden games are known for their high quality and challenging gameplay. They also don't have very complex stories, so you'd think a fifty minute adaptation would be able to provide a pretty good experience, if only for fans of the series. You would be wrong.  
 
Let's start with the story. A scientist supposedly develops a cure for cancer, although this entire piece of information turns out to be completely pointless but I'll go into more detail about that later. Some reporters hear rumours that he's been performing unethical human experiments so they break into his house to find out that the rumours are true and the scientist is involved in a plot to revive the evil Gods. To be fair scientists trying to revive the evil Gods could be a good Ninja Gaiden plot. The problem is that the execution is horrible. You'll notice that the entire cancer cure could've been left out without losing a single thing. There's actually a lot of padding involved in this. Establishing shots drag on and there are several scenes in the beginning that don't have any impact on the plot whatsoever. There's also a lot of clunky dialogue that really doesn't serve a purpose. You might ask, are the action scenes at least good? Well, no they aren't. Part of the problem is the monsters themselves, I'll get to that later. There's also the more serious problem of them being boring. The characters go through the enemies very quickly and they don't seem to pose any real threat which causes a complete lack of dramatic tension. In the games slicing thorough hordes of enemies works because you know that a slight error could result in you dying, but in this it's just boring.  
 
As for the characters, Ninja Gaiden II has very few important characters. There's Ryu, Irene, and Robert. This OVA takes place directly after Ninja Gaiden II. All three of these characters are included along with Sara, Jeff and a random girl with glasses. This is another problem. They have too many supporting characters. None of whom are given developed personalities or characters. The worst part is that the story focuses more on the support characters than Ryu, and he's the bloody protagonist of the games. Aside from the cardboard cutout support characters, let's look at the characters we actually know from the games. Robert is reduced to the cliche, grumpy, ex-soldier. As for Irene, remember in the NES games when she was actually competent and the only reason she got captured was that the odds were heavily against her? In this she's a completely incompetent and cliched damsel in distress. She can barely shoot a gun, when she tries to use a sword she fails miserably, and she gets captured by two guys without even struggling. It's really a disservice to her character since she was a CIA agent in the second game. Where did all her skills go? Ryu isn't even done well. What little we get of his character makes him look like a melodramatic moron.  
 
Let's move into the art. It's bad, even for 1991. The backgrounds are just lazy. When they're actually present they're done as simplistically as possible. There are a lot of cases of characters going cross-eyed for no reason. As for the monsters, I told you I'd get to this, they look ridiculous. Any dramatic tension that the battles might have had vanishes when you see the monsters. They look like they belong in a children's fun house rather than a legitimate threat.  
 
The sound is bland and the voice acting is pretty bad. None of the actors emote very well. This is especially a problem with Ryu and Irene, voiced by Nanba Keiichi and Touma Yumi respectively, since they both get some lines that should be emotional. I honestly blame the Direction since I've heard both Nanba Keiichi and Touma Yomi deliver very emotional lines. Zoisite in Sailor Moon and Refill Sage in Tales of Symphonia being two obvious examples.  
 
There's no yuri in this. So its yuri factor is a 1/10. It's just as well. Given the writing it wouldn't have been any good anyway. 
 
My Final rating for Ninja Gaiden is a 2/10. It's very bad. The premise could have been good but everything else is just terrible. 

          
 
       Helpful I just had to watch this OVA after I beat the NES/Famicom trilogy which is famous for how hard it is.  So I am biased about this one as a fan. 
 
The OVA is a direct sequel to the first game picking up some time after the final battle against Jaqiuo. Though there are some minor changes like Irene not being a special agent or making Robert an ""ex"" soldier. They still do their jobs pretty well. Irene being a damsel in distress and Robert being a rad dude. And Robert has a few more buddies to hang out with. That is fair.  
 
The story isn't anything special. A big science corporation makes human experiments with the power of Evil Gods. Ryu as a Dragon Ninja has to fullfil his purpose and defeat Evil Gods once again. And... save Irene of course, that is just a classic.  
 
Action is great for its era. The scenes can get a bit dark at times. I don't know if it is the copy I got or just the animation. It is still not a deal breaker. Watching those abominations getting shot and sliced is just so satisfying. After 8-bit slashing I needed to see this. 
 
Overall it is a great fanservice to me as a fan of the franchise. It is not the best but it is still a good watch even today. 


          
 
       Helpful It's just a single episode story, and I just watched it maybe five hours ago.   
   
I read through the story description/synopsis.  I recognize some of the names.  And that's about it.   
   
In short, this anime was so exceptionally unexceptional, that even though I watched it mere hours ago, it's all a wash.  I retained almost nothing from this.  Nothing of interest -- at least nothing worth remembering.   
   
At all.   
  
Well, I guess the quality of the artwork and animation were decent enough.  But what's the point if the story itself is so...bland and generic and uninteresting, that it's completely forgotten almost immediately after?

12,324,69,6.526383762,Story between god and human,Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: On Television,"In the future, advanced robotics has created heavy robots (""labors"") for use in a variety of functions: construction, fire-fighting, military, and more. However, though the robots are only machines, their operators are also only human—and humans sometimes turn to crime. Since a heavy labor unit can be a dangerous weapon, the police of the future are set to fight fire with fire, using advanced patrol labor units, ""patlabors."" This is the story of the Second Special Vehicles Division, a motley crew of patlabor policemen and women doing their best to fight crime and live a normal life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Police', 'Sci-Fi']","The story takes place in what was, at the time of release, the near future of 1998–2002. Robots called ""Labors"" are employed in heavy construction work. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police has its own fleet of Patrol Labors (""Patlabors""; as opposed to patrol cars) to combat crimes/terrorism and deal with accidents involving Labors. The story arcs usually revolve around Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2. Noa Izumi is the main protagonist of the series, but all of Division 2 play roles. Hata and Kusumi are main protagonists of the third Patlabor film. The Next Generation takes place in 2013, with an entirely new cast with the exception of Shige and Buchiyama in maintenance, but the new members of SV2 have similar names and personalities to the old ones.
The feature films follow a separate continuity, referred to as the ""movie timeline"", as opposed to the ""TV timeline"", with the Early Days OVA following the ""movie timeline"", and the New Files OVA following the ""TV timeline"". In addition, the manga follows its own continuity.
The Next Generation features episodes that directly reference the TV series, while its final episode and movie are a direct sequel to the second movie.
","This TV series take on Patlabor expands upon the developments of Section 2 implementing the mix of action, comedy and everyday developments facing the cast of the series compared to the first OAV series and first movie. While the series is mostly focused on the developments of main heroine Noa Izumi throughout the series, Patlabor still takes its time to focus on the other prominent characters of Section 2 from the manipulative superior of the group Kiichi Goto to impulsive gun-nut Isao Ota. The action element of the series involves Section 2's use of their Ingrim units in handling Labor threats that can be as mundane as construction labors to military prototypes wrecking havoc on the SDF's forces for illegal field testing. In particular, the latter makes for an ongoing plot where Section 2 and other police agencies try to find details on who is responsible for the testing of Labors against military units. However, it did feel like this particular storyline was left unresolved towards the middle of the series where the show went back to relying on its comedy and focus on Izumi's developments. 
 
The comedy for Patlabor had me drawing some comparisons to it with Police Academy as the personality quirks of Section 2 quite often got in the way of them performing their duties and they were considered the incompetent members of Tokyo's police force. Otherwise, much of the show's comedy comes from the usually unpredictable antics of Section 2 while both on duty and going about everyday routines in their headquarters, which I admit had me laughing on many occasions throughout the show when the show focused on them and the occasional bizarre comedy filler episode. 
 
The series can be an acquired taste for some viewers. In terms of its approach to the ""real robot"" genre of mecha anime, Patlabor gets as real as it can get exploring the great lengths one has to go through to maintain Labors, minimize damage to any crime scene that police and military forces are employed to in order to handle Labor crimes and the financial difficulties of securing new Labors and parts needed to repair them. Action isn't so much the prominent element of the series compared to most mecha anime as it is more focused on the challenges faced by Noa and Section 2 while on duty and living normally. Depending on what you look forward to with mecha anime, you might find the series lacking in terms of grand plot and fighting scenes or find it to be a unique and original premise that makes a more down-to-earth approach to the mecha genre. 
 
In terms of visual presentation, Patlabor is standard quality for the time it was developed as a TV anime. Mecha and character designs are reasonably detailed with subdued color shading with animation that gets the job done in depicting crime scenes that Section 2 are called in to handle, though much of this is certainly outdated compared to modern anime titles. The soundtrack to the series does well to complement the comical and serious elements to it yet, with exception to the title's first OP song, there was nothing memorable that stuck out for me. 
 
Overall, Patlabor offered up a fun, solid mix of comedy, action and everyday developments facing the members of Section 2 while also offering up quite the realistic take on the mecha genre. Anyone looking for a unique and original take to the mecha genre should give this a look, especially if you have interest in looking into older anime titles. 

          
 
       Helpful I have no interest in writing reviews, but I felt that Patlabor deserved something more positive. So here is one that is short, simple and from the heart. 
 
Patlabor the TV series is not about excitement or being heavily psychological. It is a very human show. It’s less about getting hyped up over battles and more about relaxing with your buddies Special Vehicles Section Two. The simple actions and gestures of various characters are well thought out, making them truly believable. The whole cast have their own individual personalities and ways of reacting to things. None of them seem like cardboard stand-ins in the background, something that anime is rife with. It is enjoyable to switch on an episode and see what the group gets up to next. As you spend time with them you really get to know them well, and even feel like a part of it. 
 
The art and sound in the remastered version are very good.

Patlabor is a pretty famous anime from back in the early 90s [I think even part of the 80s]. This was when Mecha animes were at an all time high and it was all about military or police mecha and stuff. Patlabor really stood out because they didn't go off the deep end with the fantasy&mdash;meaning, they don't transform, they don't talk, they can't fly [usually] go into space or the deep ocean, they don't carry endless racks of missiles.....you catch my drift? YEAH, it's pretty obvious that Patlabors don't exist but my point is that this story kind of handled it with some sense of reality like it's just another vehicle like a forklift or crane or some other construction vehicle. Even though the show is kind of old school, and the stories are kind of simplistic which is ALWAYS centered around some kind of mecha/Patlabor, it is still an alright anime to watch and does have it's share of funny and dramatic moments. 
 
 Art-Style  
Totally old school anime art style which I love! Vintage anime art is the best! But I'm not the best when it comes to grading machine art and movement since machines don't speak to me on that emotional level like it does for so many others.....so I'll leave that to those who are more or less into that.  
 
 Sound  
OK right off the bat I gotta say that the English Dub was terrible, I'm pretty sure that the reason why anime fans get hostile when you talk about dubs has to do with the legacy of shows like this one where the voice acting was not bad but HORRIBLE. The main character, Noa, her voice is probably the worst with her hi-pitched, ever-so-perky tones. Also some of the male characters actually sound 'slow' or retarded. The acting was either too weak or over the top, either they were overreacting to some petty issue like Ramen noodles or some lame sporting event or they UNDER-reacted to the real vital issues like terrorist threats and other battles. 
It kinda make me wonder if they even did any line reading for the actors or was there even an auditioning process at all or did they just start picking random readers off the street? 
Also, I wasn't too crazy about the songs either since they sounded really dated.....but by the 15th episode I thought the OP was kind of cool singing along in my horrible Japanese &quot;So Never cry, Itsumo...kimi wo...la la la-la-la! I also liked the animation and how the characters looked for the opening credits.  
 
 Story  
Ridiculous....funny but definitely ridiculous I never saw this show when it originally aired so there really isn't any of that nostalgic bias that always seem to accompany reviews of vintage anime! No, this show is down-right silly at times but that does not mean that is a bad show and that you must not watch it., actually this is one of those shows that should be watched so that we can understand the evolution of the modern anime....specifically the mecha genre! 
This show is all about mecha, specifically the LABORS machines of the humanoid variety&mdash;ones that have two arms and two legs and all the drama they cause in modern society. Consequently there are the PATROL LABORS or PATLABORS that are supposed to minimize all of these new types of crime/criminal behavior. However the group over at PATLABOR Division 2 seem to create more havoc and drama than resolving them......and that's where all the hilarity kicks in. Honestly sometimes it's funny and sometimes no, but I really think it's because of the very, very bad voice acting. I never really understood the importance of comedic timing until now, like a lot of the jokes kind of just fizzled because the speed and delivery was off or maybe the voice was just WRONG all-together! 
Also aside from the whole mecha thing, there is no real unifying theme or plot. Some stories did span a couple of episodes and others seemed linked because they carried a character from a previous episode, but for the most part there was some sort of resolution offered at the end of the 20 or so minutes and by the time ending credits were rolling. This may annoy some people who dislike episodic anime shows. I didn't have a problem with it per se, just more the fact that I don't think it should have gone on for 47 episodes. 
But then again PATLABOR was a very popular show back then......  
 
 Cast/Characters  
Again, likable characters overall, it's just the bad voice acting which may affect you really liking the characters too much. Asuma Shinohara was my favorite probably because he's got the least annoying voice plus he's kinda cute, I also kinda liked the leader of Division 2&mdash;he was very mellow in that cool kinda way....but all the other guys are off the chart [not in the good way!] Noa's voice is way too perky for a cop and it's bit on the whiny side but her personality is OK. All the other women in the show were good and believable.  
 
 Worth it or NOT?  
I think the best gem out of the whole series, has to be when Shige [one of the mechanics] goes to New York and he has to deal with Americans and they all look more like SS poster boys for Nazi-Germany than actual Americans and then that one token ethnic dude who's supposed to be Native American, I guess, with that solitary feather sticking out of his headband. It's funny but at the same time I found it mildly offensive, I think....but then again it WAS only a dream, lol!

***SPOILERS*** 
 
 
The plot. It's about some vampire girl who is being hunted by some kind of organisation( wasn't really explained why, maybe because she's a vampire) and she wants to have kids from guy-protagonist ( isn't explained either why she wants it). 
 
In the beginning plot doesn't make any sense, actually the plot doesn't make any sense at all. I understand that it's pretty hard to explain a decent plot in 60 minutes. I mean they could at least try to do it, but they didn't. The plot has so many holes in it. As an example, It's like you are watching an anime from 10th episode and there is only one episode left. After you have watched last one, everything doesn't make any sense. I guess they tried to make something out of nothing. The story is really corny. 
 
Briefly, plot sucks. That's pretty much expected from short ovas. 
 
Animation and Sound were ok I suppose. Nothing really special. 
 
The plot didn't bother me as much as characters did. Oh man the characters. I'm talking  about the main two characters in particular. Worst characters I've ever seen. I really don't have the words to describe them. 
 
Actually, all my hatred is towards the male lead. I mean, when he meets this girl for the first time, she wants him to come  for a talk and then she basically says that she wants kids from him. And then he goes like ""Uhm.. okey let's do it'', excuse me WHAT???????? Are you shitting me? Who the fuck would accept that when he first meets a girl. He really stands out from all characters. The other characters were bad, half of characters didn't make any sense by this I mean their pressence in the story. The writers could as well not introduce the half of the characters. 
 
Conclusion. It's just simply terrible. Unless you want to see some naked tits or just willing to have another anime in your watched-list, dont watch it. If you're going to watch it, you will just completely waste your precious time.

","*WARNING* 
This review was written under the assumption that every plothole and confusion will be cleared up over the couple next seasons as this series is like a puzzle as a whole and needs to pieced together to get the sense of it 
 
So, to put that matter aside, Bakemonogatari is part of the infamous Monogatari series. To tell you honestly, if this anime was to stand on its own, the story will be a below average level anime but since I write this with the assumption of plothole to be cleared in the next season, I'll give it a good rating. 
 
The story itself isn't that much of a special case, there's a boy who happens to be a vampire (a one-tenth vampire) that loses its curse because a magically-knowledgeable man knows how to deal with supernatural cases. But, this anime really walk itself through character development. I mean, every story moves and revolve around a character and every time you see it, you'll get bored real quick unless you're into a story told through conversation only.  
 
The VA of this anime is a real deal in my opinion because of the main point of the anime was people talking to each other and to pull that one nicely, you need a great VA. The OP and ED are nice too (I like those arc-based OP as they give you an insight of the character that is currently being focused on). 
 
As for character, the headcounts are limited here so you'll understand everyone story and no one falls flat (even the side character are memorable too). 
 
Personally, I enjoy this BECAUSE IT'S PART OF A SERIES CALLED MONOGATARI SERIES. If it was to stand on its own, I'll drop this because of the massive plothole left and right but since it's a full series, I can enjoy this without needing to worry about a plot left unresolved

          
 
       Helpful I'll have to say one thing in advance, if you plan on watching this anime series, if you get the feeling of WTF is going on during the first few episodes and you can't read the random rapid words flashing across the screen, it's all fine. Those things are normal. Don't try to read the words,and just go with the flow, the series style you will get used to. 
Now this is only my personal opinion and whether you choose to think that I'm an idiot or not is up to you. 
 
Story: The only reason I gave the story less than an 8 is because the amount of time I found myself utterly confused and lost in the series. Other than that this series is very unique, presents some tasteful fan-service when needed, and keeps you interested with plot turns and twists. Many things are left unanswered when the series ends, which is also why I plan to watch the prequel and sequel. Ignoring the amount of time I spent asking questions and being confused it was still a good anime. The story doesn't have too much flow from time to time which I find as its main flaw, but as it progresses, it grows on you.  
 
Art and Sound: They were both good and unique, I enjoyed watching the animation of the theme song, and the OST complimented the scenes very well. 
 
Characters: Whoo boy, now this is a tough one, there were standard personalities in this slightly harem themed anime, yet each were different ones than I have seen and were presented in their own ways. The main character especially and his hair... (You'll understand the hair bit while watching the series). Oshino is probably my favorite character being the fact that his nicknames are pretty funny, and his general aura hat he reveals.  
 
Overall this series may seem bad to some, but it is definitely worth checking out. 

          
 
       Helpful Bakemonogatari is an adaptation of one book from a series of light novels written by Nisio Isin. The story follows a boy named Koyomi Araragi and his encounters with several girls that are involved with ""ghosts"" or supernatural entities. 
 
Bakemonogatari has a solid, straight-foward story. The anime is broken up into several arcs, each one introducing a new girl and how she came to be affected by an entity. Araragi solves each girl's problems with the help of an odd man named Oshino, who happens to be an expert in apparitions. Bakemonogatari isn't the start of the story, however. Araragi is a human-turned-vampire-turned-human-again, but there is no explanation of his transformations. Even though the show doesn't go into much detail about this interesting fact, it isn't essential to know his background to enjoy the rest of the show. Fortunately, there is news of a prequel to Bakemonogatari that will hopefully shed some light on Araragi's past. :) 
 
Bakemonogatari may seem like a harem, but romance is present as the episodes progress. Also, if you are looking for action, Bakemonogatari might not be what you're looking for. Nisio Isin is well-known for the witty dialogue in his novels and it is adapted well into the anime, so conversations between characters might feel extremely wordy. It's not like there is absolutely no action; there are some action scenes that are beautifully animated. Plus, the interaction and dialogue between characters is amusing rather than it feeling like a boring drag.  
 
The art of Bakemonogatari is really great. The colors are vivid and even the backgrounds look amazing. All of the characters have distinctive designs and are very likeable. The only negative thing I have to say about the animation is that there are these red and black ""scenes"" that sporadically pop up throughout the anime. I didn't really mind them at first, until there was an obnoxious amount showing up in one of the later episodes. Regardless of this drawback, Bakemonogatari definitely deserves a try.

","Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime. 
 
Story: 10/10 
The storytelling in the Second Season is slightly different then its previous seasons. As almost each arc is told by one of the supporting characters with the help of Araragi and Shinobu who are the main protagonists. Each specific arc in the series is told at different times ranging from summer to winter season in the story. The story itself requires many to watch the previous seasons as the Second Season is fairly complex. The complex story is appealing as it usually surprises me in the ending of the arc. The Story in the Monogatari Series is truly unique as each arc is slowly united into another arc which show the outcome of the consequences that Araragi or another character makes. The pacing in the story is slow likes its previous season. The Season Season does not contain really any fanservice unlike Nisemonogatari except more of an occasional comedy while still maintaining its seriousness in the storytelling. I did not like that the Otorimonogatari arc was pushed aside to be resolved until another arc was finished. The second season was also missing the Hanamonogatari arc.  The ending of Season Season however was great as it paves the way for a new season in the future. 
 
Art: 10/10 
The series excels very well in its unique art style and visuals. A lot of the visuals and scenery that were hand painted were beautifully incorporated into the anime. The art style is realistic as the illustration utilizes the light and shadows in the background to create a wonderful setting for the story without using too much color. I believe the art style fits the story as fine like its previous seasons. The art style was relatively the same quality as before. Near the end of the season the opening visual of the Koimonogatari arc seemed outdated and old. The backgrounds are definitely memorable as VOfan's illustration is very distinct in his paintings and drawings. The character designs were appealing along with the hair style. Each character looked different and special in their own style. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The characters that were portrayed in the previous season fits the different characters great. I believe the voices actors were chosen to fit their typical role for the voices. The background music is a big key to the art and story of Monogatari. By using the beautiful art style and sound like the previous seasons it allows the series to set up a bright or gloomy setting for the story. The soundtracks enhanced the action scenes for the different arcs. The OST that was used in the anime is intriguing and I would probably listen to it when it gets released. The OP/ED always have been one of the best which changes every time a new arc starts or ends. The Nekomonogatari: Shiro, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari OP/ED were one the most notable and best in my opinion. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Many of the characters in Monogatari were well-rounded having a human flaw and strength. They all bare the traits of human nature. Some of the characters are either clever, manipulative, innocent, wise , selfish and brave in someway. The characters reacted in a realistic way; learning and understanding the problems that pop up in the story. I was not able to relate any of the characters together as they were all special in their own way. Some of the characters did deteriorate to the point where they were willing to risk anything to change the outcome and or hide their true intention. I believe it is fine for the characters to deteriorate as it will be interesting to see how it progress in the future seasons of the Monogatari Series.  Shinobu and Kaiki would be the foils for Araragi and Senjougahara in the series as play a strong support role in the last 2 arcs of the season. The main antagonist in the story had a open motivation which to some may seem insane or extreme, however we are told slowly on how the antagonist become this way near the end of the season which is realistic due to natural human behavior of being selfish. We are not really told much in the second season about Ougi Oshino but it seems most likely that the character is the second antagonist in the future. The supporting cast was just fine and perfect without it being overcrowed as Monogatari mostly focuses on the one  supporting character for each specific arc. The main character Koyomi Araragi is the most prominent and memorable character just like the in previous seasons. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
I believe many people will like this anime as the art and story arc are fascinating. I think non-anime/manga fans may like this anime for its unique style but some individual maybe discouraged due to the slow pacing. I might re-watch the entire series in the future if I read the light novel. I think re-watching the series will help me understand some of the information that I missed the first time. If they had complete Monogatari Series translated or straight from Japan I would definitely buy it because I love the story telling with the occasion comedy and action in Monogatari. The Monogatari Series is pretty memorable as it ended year on a good note. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
As you can see, SHAFT continues to bring out a compelling anime series that will satisfy many of its fans with its great story and unique art/sound from the previous season. 


          
 
       Helpful To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face? 
 
The Monogatari Series is one outstanding series. The light novel is well written and the animated series is beautiful. One important aspect of Monogatari Series is that there are many tropes and themes where viewers and readers can enjoy. Monogatari Series provide a variety of interest and it will make the audience want more. What is understandable is the fact that the underlying themes in Monogatari Series make the series stand out. 
 
	One theme that is shared throughout the series is random act of kindness. This theme is important because it shapes people psychologically. These random acts of kindness can vary from giving directions to a stranger to saving a person’s life. If a person is in need of help, it is best to help that person out. Even though there are more themes and tropes, they are all able to connect beautifully. Monogatari Series also have dark themes. These dark themes are used to portray reality and fantasy. To discover the truth behind the dark themes is to uncover the mystery behind apparitions. The saying goes: if there is light, there is also darkness. 
 
	Monogatari Season Two is the continuation of Nisemonogatari. Studio SHAFT plans to animate the whole light novel. There will be a total of three seasons. Monogatari Season Two focuses on Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari, and Koimonogatari. These titles are significant because they relate deeply to the story. For an example, Kizumonogatari, Kizumono means ‘damaged good’, but also ‘a woman who has been deflowered’. Monogatari would mean story. Based off the title, it foreshadows the underlying dark theme.  
 
	Since there is a sequel, the introduction of Monogatari Season Two provides a recap of what happened previously. The sequel started with Nekomonogatari White. Therefore, the story continued from Nisemonogatari time wise and a continuation of plot to Hanekawa in Nekomonogatari Black. Though, Nekomonogatari Black took place before Bakemonogatari. This may be confusing, but the timeline and plot is completely different. Araragi is helping out people with apparitions and it would be boring if the plot was to be linear. As the anime progress, characters have special appearance in certain situations. There are multiple characters and each character has their own arc. In short, each character is important to their respective arc. There are interactions among these characters even though they are not focused in these arcs. Although they are not focused, it gives insight to the character and provides development. What is given for sure is that this technique is smart and well used throughout the series. 
 
	Animations are one reason to seek interest in an anime. If the art work is great and the animations are smooth, most people would tend to watch it because it is appealing to the eye. When it is appealing to the eye, it is easier to enjoy the anime and not complain. One reason that makes the Monogatari series good is because of Studio Shaft. Studio Shaft tends to make unique animations. Unique animations as in great camera view, amazing art work, detailed background and effects. There is also a gag where Studio Shaft likes to put their characters in a difficult head tilt. This is just for comedy purposes, but it is indeed interesting. This can be related to paintings as they have their own form of interpretation. Last but not least, the characters are very detailed, the transitioning is beautiful and the art is crystal clear. 
 
	As the story progress through, the characters adapt to changes. The adaption can be either negative or positive. It is truly boring to watch a static character. Seeing a dynamic character can trigger new events. Having a dynamic character allows the plot to be flexible and create suitable settings. This is important because Monogatari focuses on Araragi and apparitions. As Araragi progress throughout the story, he will learn and experience new information. This is also the same for any other characters in Monogatari. Since there are dynamic characters, there is a beautiful resolve. The resolve can be either a good ending or tragic ending. As characters face an obstacle, they would have to overcome the experience. The journey may be short or long, but the experience is all that matters. 
 
	The character of Araragi Koyomi is notable throughout the Monogatari series. His goal was to protect those who he cared for. To achieve these goals, he has to fight against apparitions and try to help the victims face reality. There are times where people tend to seclude themselves away from reality. Reality is definitely harsh and not pleasant for those who struggle. What makes human the superior race is that humans overcome their problems and advance forward. Throughout Monogatari Second Season, Araragi has starred in most of the arcs and made a huge impact on the plot. Besides the fact that Araragi is the main character, there are other characters that are significant. 
 
As each arc starts, the audience views a nature that a character has hidden.  
 
“Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.” – Greta Garbo. 
 
This quote pretty much sums up the dark themes from Monogatari Second Season. Each character has their own hardships and it is tough to see them face their own problems. Characters such as Hanekawa Tsubasa and Hitagi Senjougahara have their own problems to deal with, but doesn’t show it until their respective arc shows. To acknowledge these problems, each character is related in a special way. Other characters such Oshino Shinobu, Hachikuji Mayoi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko also has their dark secrets. The audience grasps on these secrets and expands their curiosity. These characters are brought over from season one. These characters undergo more development and thus the audience learns more about the character. There is also an apparition that dwells under the host due to their problems. In order to solve the problem, the character would have to adapt and face reality to overcome their problem. 
 
	The voice actors and actress are kept the same. This is generally a must since there is a sequel. It would be quite awkward for a character to have a different voice actor or actress unless it was meant. Nobody in Bakemonogatari had different personalities causing it to have different voice actors or actress. What is known for sure is that the audio is great throughout. The opening is normally made by the arc’s main character. For an example, Nekomonogatari White starred Hanekawa Tsubasa so the voice actress of Hanekawa would sing the opening song. It is unique and it requires money and effort to be made. This is one way to show that Studio Shaft is trying to keep the same format as Bakemonogatari. 
 
	The audio for Monogatari Season Two is great. The opening is kept classy with the main character of the arc starring in the opening. For an example, if Hachikuji was the main character of the arc, Hachikuji will voice the opening and have a unique opening animation. This concept was started in Bakemonogatari and was brought over. I really liked this concept and it was used beautifully in Monogatari Second Season. 
 
	Overall, Monogatari Second Season is a good anime to watch. It is a genre that all could enjoy. I am sure that SHAFT poured their hearts out to appeal to their fan base and the general anime audience. The story is worth following up upon and the light novels are a great read. One cannot judge a book by its cover until its contents was seen.  
	 


          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Honestly, I'm surprised... surprised I was able to make it through to the end of this show.   
 
I'm afraid the long, unnecessary, drawn out conversations that constitute this entire series are a severe test of my patience. More on this in a bit. Due to this being the sole emphasis, the characters should be crucial right? 
 
Well quite frankly there is only one good character in the show, and this guy ends up being the true hero. He is the only character I like. To avoid spoilers... I'll just say, to my severe disappointment, that it doesn't end well.   
 
The rest of the main characters are immature, irrational  imbeciles. Sorry, but I hate tsunderes or whatever Senjougahara's personality is. Aragagi is as bad as any typical shounen protagonist who thinks he can save everyone. The only difference is that's he's a pedophile, not that really I care about that detail in particular - that's not even one of the things I hate about him. I hate the fact that every girl falls in love with him, when there's really nothing special about him. Is it that he's such a goody-two-shoes?  You can find white knights everywhere. His existence itself is probably the main reason I hate Senjo - the fact that she loves someone like him, that she's willing to die for this guy who doesn't understand anything. I don't remember much from Bakemonogatari as I saw it like 5 years ago, but to my recollection the only reason she's given is that it's because ""he is who he is"" or some vague bullshit like that. Yeah, whatever. Ignoring the fact that Hanekawa loves him too, she to me is a soulless creature, a vanilla. If you watch, it's well documented in those oh-so-long conversations as to why that is, in my opinion. I'm trying to put this in a nutshell because describing how I really feel about these people would require a long-winded essay each.  
 
I don't know; maybe Nisio Ishin doesn't intend for these people to be likable. For those of you who don't know, apparently the writer likes to intentionally make main characters who are unlikable and unrelatable. I’ve learned this from reading Medaka Box. If so, considering the ending and all the implications... he's pretty good at that. Pretty deep stuff, I'll give him that. 
 
Now back to those conversations - those endless dialogues between characters that I don't particularly even like. 
 
Take the very first episode for example. Hanekawa meets a tiger. Then her house burns down. Then she gets yelled at by Senjo. Three significant things happen. None of them take very long - around a couple minutes each. That's what like 6 - 10 minutes on the meat of the plot? The rest of the 20-minute episode was spent having unnecessary conversations and soliloquies.  
 
Yes, I'm well aware that that some of this banter leads to some important plot conclusions later. But too much of it is trivial and could easily be shortened without losing anything other than the weird fan-service or whatever it is that so much effort is spent on. The interaction between Hanekawa and Senjo that centers on taking a shower together at the end of the episode goes on for several minutes and well into the next episode. Then it gets even worse - only one thing truly necessary to the plot that happens is another short sighting of the tiger. I mean the majority of an episode is some long drawn-out, redundant small talk. Overall the first arc, 5 long episodes, could easily be shortened to one or two episodes. Most of the show is like this. 
 
We're getting to my point on why this is the main problem with this show. It's not like I wasn't paying attention to all this dialogue. Rest assured. I weathered the storm, waiting patiently for some meaning, some payoff, hanging on to nearly every word. Because naturally I'm always curious as to what is the point. What is the conflict? What is the goal? It's hardly ever obvious in this show when it's there at all. 
 
In a later arc, an episode begins with Araragi and a mysterious creature named Ougi having a conversation about traffic lights. This takes around. four. whole. minutes. Why is this a problem? Well, this conversation is happening for one of three reasons apparent to me: 
- It's leading up to something important to the plot. 
- It's some kind pretentious symbolism. 
- It's part of that weird fan-service or whatever it is that draws people to this show that I don't fully understand. 
 
In the end it doesn't really matter which of these three possible reasons this is conversation is happening, because on the surface it's a pointless conversation. On the surface, I don't know why they are having this conversation. On the surface, it's a long drawn out conversation about nothing, leading to nothing until way later. That is if it leads to anything at all. 
 
The point is that if most of the time I'm listening to long seemingly pointless conversations waiting for an eventual meaning, then watching this show has become a chore. It has become a job filled with boredom and ennui. Because it's not like many of these conversations are particularly fascinating. This is why the ""four whole minutes"" I emphasized about the traffic lights example doesn't seem very long in retrospect, but it felt very, very long. The vague connection with this traffic thing doesn’t show up until a while later. And this kind of thing happens often in this show. 
 
I will say in fairness, the plot was there. And it was mildly interesting. The time travel and the last arc were kind of alright. But it almost felt like the plot just was a backdrop for... conversation porn... because on the surface this is a show about people who stand around talking. I understand why this is.  
 
This series is based on light novels. And this situation might work well in books, but it doesn't work very well on screen. In an attempt to keep it interesting and dress up the fact that people are just standing around talking all the time, the animators even feel the need to flood the screen with constant camera angle shifts, queer poses, flashy patterns and loops, and surreal art. It gets old and irksome pretty fast.  I’ll admit that some of the dialogue, mainly the dialogue that unsubtly advanced the plot, was interesting. There wasn't enough of this kind. 
 
The important thing though is that the plot is a backdrop for the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, all described and analyzed in vivid detail by all these conversations and soliloquies. The important thing is that, small talk aside, the significant dialogue places that much greater emphasis on all their awful traits. That is why this show, why these people left a bad taste in my mouth.  
 
I didn’t enjoy this show because it started out badly with *very* slow pacing and ended badly with a frustrating ending in my opinion, ruining what little redemption it could have had.  Yeah, I’m aware this series is probably not over. But I also didn’t enjoy it because I didn't care for most of the protagonists, and there was simply too. much. talking.

12,1083,73,6.488334227,Story between god and human,Human Crossing,"Though seemingly unconnected, the characters in HUMAN CROSSING all have something in common. They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']",none,"Human Crossing is a very bizarre anime 
 
The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it 
 
I know these things are subjective but Human Crossing's biggest flaw is believability . The show tried incredibly hard to give messages of hope but most episodes come across as very pretentious and totally unrealistic 
 
Additionally while I don't have a problem with predictability you will probably be able to tell what will happen 5 minutes in to most episodes and the conclusions are usually cliche or leave you scratching your head ... 
 
The animation is sub par , there is hardly any music but I thought the voice acting was good 
 
The show to me is definitely worth a watch if you have the patience . I'm sure that at least 2-3 episodes will be worth it for you but you will most likely have to suffer through at least 10 episodes that range from meh to bad . 
 
4/10 Decent :) 
 


          
 
       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

Lots and Lots of chibi charachters, Sunrise Inc after the huge success of the gundam serie's that at that point aired from  1979-1988 (char's counterattack was the latest one at the time) found somewhat a new populair direction by creating a more kid friendly serie's in addition/rivalised of Toei Animation's Dragonball serie's wich was gaining hto uge popularity rating in japan, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru , with a huge pointer to Dragons since that is very important in japanese culture. 
 
The whole serie itself is more a friendly mix between RPG, Action adventure, Mecha's wich sunrise was best in doing and deformed charachters with funny traits to give, even for the villians. 
The first wataru storyline goes about a legend that saved the 1st godrealm ( there are i believe 3 realms in total according to the ova' and last serie's storyline) and that hero was named 'wataru', and it seems a 9 year old boy is a descendant or something of that legend and is asked to cleanse the godrealm of darkness and let the rainbow shine. 
 
Animation reallly fits for its time beeing it a kidsshow  both the OP & ED to me was likable because some of the singing was stuck in my head together wich the good ol oldskool popmusic, and the models looked drawn very colourfull and funny even for the bad one's with a very positive look at 'chibi'as i said, with every now and then some strange behavior is sometimes a good thing to keep the show going.same for the mini mecha models that is personalised for every charachter wich their own unique powers and abillitie's 
 
Musicwise: Copy, Cut& Paste wich was quite normal at the time and cheaper to do it, how repetitive it became god only knows, it could use some more variation for my account! 
 
The charachters were one of the main things that made the show populair and shows a very strong diffrence in personality's, behaviors, looks ect ect. 
but fun nevertheless, wataru himself is not a typical hotheaded ambitious type , more a heroic, helpful  boy just to point out, and i like the side chara as well for their part. 
 
I enjoyed it for a big part minus the 2 or 3 fillers every 10-12 episodes but then again it summaries some previous chapters, but the biggest enjoyment of it all was the rpglike action adventure encounters wataru and his friends had, returning all inhabitants to a normal state. 
 
overall i give it a 7/10, good to enjoy for a kids show , could give some more so hopefully the next serie's (minus the ova wich i have seen) give some less repetitive music and some more new encounters with more actionpacked scene's and a more darkerside storyline!

Four scars, the mark of the Four War Gods Ryūra, Jūra, Kyōra, and Gōra, appear on all of the children's backs except for the youngest one, Ai. Asagi, the oldest, tells Ai to leave the island, and she is rescued by half-demon Inuyasha, schoolgirl Kagome Higurashi, monk Miroku, demon slayer Sango, fox demon Shippo, and Sango's nekomata companion Kirara. After Ai asks for Inuyasha to save the others, Inuyasha explains to his friends the myth of Hōrai Island, a place that appears once every fifty years. He remembers when he and Kikyō arrived on the island fifty years ago, they were ambushed by the Four War Gods, with Gōra extracting Kikyō's blood (used to make her doppelganger) and Ryūra marking Inuyasha's back with the four scars.
Following the island's reappearance, Kikyō learns of it and embarks to investigate, while Sesshomaru breaks off from his group - Jaken and Rin - to face Kyōra, who gave him the four scars in the past. As Inuyasha and company approach at the island, Jūra appears and fires his Thunder Cannon at them. Miroku and Sango fly away on Kirara to deter the attack, while Inuyasha, Kagome and Ai escape to the island shore where they meet Ryūra. When Ryūra nearly kills Inuyasha, Kagome interferes the battle, allowing Ryūra to escape.
Ai brings the group to a village where they meet the children and learn that Asagi will sacrifice herself to the Cauldron of Resonance, arguing that her death will allow the others to live a little longer. They all follow Asagi to the Cauldron, which Inuyasha and Asagi are pulled into after he attempts to destroy it. On the outside, the rest of the gang and the children try to open the doors while Inuyasha meets Lady Kanade, a priestess who fought the War Gods 50 years ago. She explains how she attempted to destroy them by taking their power spheres with her into the Cauldron at the cost of her life, only for the Gods to resort to sacrificing half-demons to the Cauldron so they could slowly regain their power. She gives Inuyasha a box containing the four power spheres and her remaining strength in exchange for her destroying the Cauldron and saving the children.
Inuyasha and Asagi free themselves and destroy the Cauldron, the damage of which breaks Kagome's bow and arrow set. Inuyasha is then attacked by the Kikyō look-alike after it exits the orb, stealing the power spheres and releasing them to the Four War Gods. The group then splits up; Inuyasha faces off against Kikyō's doppelg?nger, Miroku and Sango fly on Kirara to battle Jūra and Gōra, and Kagome, Shippo, and the children attempt to make a raft for everyone to escape the island, only to be confronted by Ryūra. Meanwhile, Sesshomaru defeats Kyōra, leaving the others to deal with the remaining War Gods. Inuyasha is saved by the real Kikyō after she destroys her doppelg?nger, and she leaves behind her bow and arrow.
Inuyasha returns to the shore to kill Ryūra. After Miroku, Sango and Kirara destroy Jūra, they help Inuyasha defeat Gōra. However, back on shore, the power spheres combine to form a new War God, with the only way to defeat it being a combination of Kagome's sacred arrow and Inuyasha's Backlash Wave attack. After one of the children, Shion, is guided to find Kikyō's arrow by the island's fireflies containing the spirits of those who were sacrificed, Kagome and Inuyasha use their powers to destroy the final War God once and for all, removing the four scars from those who were marked with them. They all escape the island's destruction on the raft, putting its myth to rest. The children, after residing temporarily at Kaede's village, bid farewell to Inuyasha and his friends to pursue their freedom.
","When people said this movie was just filler and unneeded, I was expecting just another okay Inuyasha movie. I didn't get that. Instead I got what came out as my second favourite Inuyasha movie. I don't like to think of it as filler, as pretty much all the Inuyasha movies are ""filler"". I really enjoyed this movie. It was way better than the first two and I thought it was a great end to the Inuyasha anime for me, because the second the movie ended, I'd seen everything Inuyasha. It left me pretty satisfied and yet still wanting more Inuyasha movies. The action was amazing, not as good as the third one, but heaps better than the first two. One thing I'm sick and tied of is the soundtrack.. STOP IT! There was one original remix that I noticed (that had the tune from the tv series) but I didn't notice anything different about the soundtrack. I listened to the soundtrack throughout the whole anime series. So why did I need to hear the same damn thing in the movies? I mean come on. We need some originals people. Anyways, I liked this movie and I don't really know what everyone was talking about, this is a FANTASTIC movie. I loved it.

          
 
       Helpful This is the fourth and last of the Inu Yasha movies, taking place towards the end of the first series. Up to now it was sort of a strategy to tribute each new sword technique with a movie but at this point no new moves were introduced and thus the scriptwriter simply invented one just for this filler mission. 
 
The scenario is very weak and most unimpressive even for the tv standards. So far they had being fighting top level demons who could take over the world, control time, and even raise hell. Now they deal with… four convicts??? Surely, where is the excitement in that? Four nobody demons that are trapped on an island and just lure other demons in order to eat them and stay alive. Another annoying feature is the little kids in this movie. You would expect token kids begging for the shounen hero to save them in a Naruto or a One Piece film, but in Inu Yasha it just feels stupid. I guess so many years past that by now the franchise had turned to just another silly show about teenagers saving kids. 
 
The plot is not something great either. All they do is fighting one demon at a time before the last one fuses with the rest to form a last moment big boss. That’s it, nothing more. The previous movies had the decency to try to deal with some sort of drama or romance from the various themes of the main story. This one here does absolutely NOTHING! You could replace the characters with those from any other shounen show and you wouldn’t even know the difference. 
 
Not even the action is something good, since by now Inu Yasha had enough firepower to take on the Devil himself and the enemy demons were just generic bad guys without any backdrop or interesting battle strategies. Not even the setting is good either. It is just a sort of tropical island that appeared on the sea; nothing nightmarish or complicating. 
 
In all, this is a completely pointless movie that has no point in existing. I don’t recommend it one bit.

          
 
       Helpful fire on the mystic island, the fourth and last inuyasha movie to date. well, seeing that this one has no reviews on it, i will do the honors of writing it one. as an inuyasha movie, this one had some of the typical characteristic aspects to it as such: fighting demons, romance, jokes/humor, an event that happened in the past brought back, and the group coming to the rescue once again. this one played more on mythology that i found to be enjoyable and expanded on the half demon relationship with the world. it had a suiting story line to carry on like that of the first and second movies. the one big thing i noticed about this movie was how similar the art was to the anime itself. it seems that from the first movie that was different, they slowly made their way back to this point where the fourth one is almost the same but not quite. i found that to be very appealing on the eyes and familiar as an inuyasha fan. the music in this movie was was beautiful and fitting to me. it sounded like something that belonged with an inuyasha movie and was rather beautiful. oh and don't forget that the english voices that gave the characters their personality, despite others ripping on the english dubs, are all back in action. this movie kept my attention with some of the cuter points in it and the back story to it i found enjoyable/fitting of an inuyasha movie. overall, i found it to be a good movie and i would re watch it anytime. i'm just sad that the movies are over now xD i want more!

","Story:5/10 The story is a typical reverse harem, where 5 boys are the guardians of the lead heroin Tamaki. The story starts pretty slowly and often repeats itself for the first few episodes, but by the end, it was somewhat captivating. 
 
Art: 5/10 For a anime that was made in 2012, it's art style was old and didn't really stand out, nothing special. That being said, it didn't bother me or take away from the story. 
 
Characters: 6/10 They are kinda cliche characters, but do have some unique elements. There's nothing that really stood out to me. 
 
Enjoyment/overall: 6/10 Although at times, I didn't think the story was going to go anywhere, by the last episode I did want to see what would happen next. I enjoyed that by the end at least some of the characters were explained and built more depth then they previously had in the beginning. There is a second season, so maybe giving it a chance will show a more interesting story...

          
 
       Helpful Utter waste of time. It’s like someone just wanted to make an anime without caring about plot, character development, or..well…anything. The ending is absolutely disappointing and reveals nothing. What little story there is builds up to what is expected to be a spectacular ending. They throw hints of mystery and character ties that never get answered. The main characters are constantly complaining about their lives. The heroine is annoying. The characters are forgettable. There isn’t a single redeeming factor about this anime. I give it a 4/10, and that is being extremely forgiving.

          
 
       Helpful First review... 
Story:  
Great storyline, poor execution; it would've had more potential if the writers focused on like actual soul searching/demon hunting rather than trying to pair the main girl up with every guy there. 
Art:  
For an anime made in 2012, it looked early 2000s. I get that they were trying to follow the game  style but visually, it didn't stand out much. 
Sound: Appropriate OST and sound FX, but not worth looking up any particular song. 
Characters:  
teenaged girl visits/moves in with her Grandmother only to find out that she's a princess with hidden magical powers and has hot bodyguards but in typical anime fashion, she's kind of clueless and gullible but nonetheless we're supposed to believe that she can save the world or something. The villains don't really have a purpose other than to annoy the mains, I didn't care much for them. Grandma gets 0 points, she wasn't useless to the story but she wasn't exactly helpful either. 
Enjoyment:  
Found myself wanting to skip episodes but somehow managed to get through it because, well, i was more than halfway done and had all of the episodes downloaded already.  
Overall: 
I'd recommend this to the younger generation, like 10-14 yr olds to be quite honest. I had never heard of it before but I was really into reverse harem and this was at the top of everyone's list and I'm not sure why. It's a bit predictable/cliché and after about 8 episodes I found myself skimming the episodes instead of watching them all the way through just to finish it and by the end of it, I didn't even want to start season 2.  
Would I watch it again? No.

An organization called GIRLS has formed to collect them. The story focuses on the GIRLS rookie members, Agira, Miclas and Windom in their misadventures.
","Ever wished Godzilla was a cute girl? No, neither have I, but someone clearly did... 
 
STORY 
As you'd imagine from an ONA, plot and story development are pretty light in Kaiju Girls. That's not to say there's none, but what is here is fairly shallow. Characters are generally pretty one dimensional, but that's fine. The main three girls have enough personality that each episode is interesting enough just seeing them interact with each other. Nothing's all that serious but the show is aware of that, even the climactic finale is little more than an ""Oh no maybe this is a little trouble"" moment, but it's cute and that's kinda what matters in this series. 
 
ART 
Do you like chibi? If you answered no then turn away now (though you could probably tell that by the image above). This series is very, very chibi. And I think that's actually kinda to it's detriment. One of the main points of Kaiju Girls is that each girl transforms into wearing a costume that looks like a Kaiju (most are vague references to popular Kaiju but nothing specific enough that it's obvious). My issue with this is that the characters have such small bodies in comparison to their heads, and their costumes are so detailed and intricate, that overall most of the girls seem to be wearing costumes that look way too busy and over-designed. This is a personal gripe, and obviously it's true for all chibi anime, but I found it a shame that this is the format they chose. However everything is very bright and colourful, kinda making up for some of this. 
Animation is also standard. There are a few kinda neat scenes but for the most part it's what you'd expect from an average Flash animation. It's passable.  
 
SOUND 
The music, for the most part, is fairly standard. There are light, twinkly tracks for the light hearted scenes and more intense tracks for the action scenes, though none really stick out. The opening theme and closing theme are both, as you'd expect, very upbeat and cute and, honestly, both were pretty catchy (the ending song Kaiju Heart in particular) though just generic enough that you'll probably forget them within a month.  
The voice acting was pretty standard. No role really stood out, though Pigmon's VA did a great job of being very cute so I guess props to her. 
 
CHARACTER 
As stated above, the whole point of this is to be cute and occasionally referential to Kaiju movies, with a hint of idol anime thrown in. The cute part it delivers in spades, the Kaiju part vaguely now and then and the idol parts is where it oddly shines. If you like seeing girls striving to be better at something and achieving it with hard work and spirit then you'll probably appreciate this anime.  
 
ENJOYMENT 
Looking back on the series while writing this I realise that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I did once I'd finished watching it. There were a couple funny moments, and a few cute ones, but to say I enjoyed it may be a little much. I liked it, but that's about it.  
 
OVERALL 
Overall it was an okay ONA, and at 5 minutes per episode it's not like it wasted my time or anything, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend it really. It wasn't bad by any means, but it did nothing to stand out either. For that reason I find that 6 is the right score. If you're interested I guess give the first episode a try but don't expect anything too memorable.

          
 
       Helpful Art/Animation 
First of all, I have never hated an anime this much. I saw the art style of this show and was interested as to how they could fit it in to an anime that seems to be about fighting. They did it horribly. The animation is horrific in its best moments, and they seem to reuse the exact same stock image of each character. The background seems to be made of cardboard and was drawn by a 5 year old, and is quite inconsistent. The animation seems like they spent none of the budget on it whatsoever, as if it were leading up to some intense sakuga or something, and then it doesn't have anything special, just the same sprites moving around with a little movement of eyes and mouths here and there. (Maybe even legs if we're lucky!) However, even after all this, I'm saying that the animation was the best part of this. Not to give it praise, but because they at least drew something. I can't say they actually did much anywhere else. 
 
Sound 
Nothing much to say here, except the fact that they have few and far between sound effects, no ambient sounds, the music is trash but they at least recorded the voices on a good microphone and I didn't feel like someone was pouring bleach down my ears (for the majority of the time anyway) 
 
Character 
Every person lacks motivation, there is no reason for anything to happen other than ""Oh, that just happened I guess. Let's be friends and punch things!"" the animators and script writers put no sort of effort whatsoever into this, and it really shows. 
 
Something else 
why is every episode 5 minutes long? This includes the OP and the ED. They have a 12 episode anime with every episode being 5 minutes. This means they only have to make about half an hour of stuff at most, most of which is just animation that looks like it was done in microsoft powerpoint. 
 
Story 
This is the most appalling story I've ever seen. It consists of 3 people going to a building because ""I must be special"" and then they just become best of friends. No buildup, no tension, just ""hey we're friends now."" Every character arc is completed in the span of one 5 minute episode each, where they spend no time going through the person, just going about showing their idols and then saying ""Woops you found your power now! Hooray!"" No one shows any normal human emotion, I just watched the entire show in the span of yesterday and I still can't remember the story. I'm pretty sure there was something about monsters from the shadow realm, and that's it. 
 
Conclusion 
I hated this show, I wouldn't recommend anybody watch it, even though the whole season will waste no more than an hour of your time. The art and sound hit the bare minimum, of being recorded on an alright microphone, and having actual characters drawn. Although nothing else looks good, and they mostly look too busy EVEN THOUGH THEY BARELY MOVE. I hate it. 0/10. I'm now changing the meaning of ""Kaijuu"" in my vocabulary to ""pile of shit"" 
 
SPOILERS FROM HERE, IF YOU PLAN ON WATCHING THE SHOW, AVOID READING HERE. 
I just want to talk about the last fight scene. I believe it is absolutely appalling. It begins with them fighting a couple of shadow monsters, then decide they need to take out the hive, when they recieve a text because their friend already did it off camera, to save time, effort, and money so they didn't have to make arguably the only important scene that could be in this show. Then comes a bug thing, which apparently regenerates after they defeat it the first time, but after that we NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. WE NEVER SEE THE THING THAT REGENERATED. Everyone gets caught up in fighting a dinosaur all of a sudden, then they jump off a building to hit its eye, which makes a crack, then they just shoot a laser at it and it dies. Magically nobody gets hurt in  this, and after the dinosaur dies, everything is just magically fixed. EVEN THE BLOODY GIANT BUG THAT APPARENTLY CAN'T DIE JUST DISAPPEARS.

This Anime is your typical 80's sc-ifi filled with campy pervert humor decent and unique alien characters and a good soundtrack. I'm unsure if this show was made to support the Sega game of the same title, or if the game was made in response to the shows popularity at the time. But Sega's influence can been seen all over the show including OPA OPA.  
 
If you remember what a Sega Master system is and you want to feel nostalgic for the 80's this show is for you! If your looking for a complex story instead of a action shoot em up then move along because you won't enjoy this show.

The only interesting things about it is that there's a couple of Sega Master System games based on it, the show has cameos of Opa Opa from Fantasy Zone, the design of the Sega Light Phaser Gun for the Master System was based on the pistol from this show and the soundtrack is BLOODY AMAZING! 
 
But other than that, well, I suppose the art is well-made... But the show itself is pretty 'meh...

","BLADE is probably is one of those mundane Vampire-hunter story Anime's that's been roaming media as of now, but one good thing in here is that its the 1st Anime that I have watched that has a setting in the Philippines. To use the Philippine Folklore's Manananggal ang MAndurugo and to introduce some people in Mindanao is an honor for the other country to understand Philippine folks. 
Though the dub should've been a Filipino language instead of Nihonggo. The graphics is great since its a mixed of Marvel so dont expect to see some Moe characters on to these one. Still music is lacking since its only like the same other Marvel to Anime series which only use some rocking guitar sounds. For me its still a series worth watching and recommended probably by the adult ones

          
 
       Helpful Marvels try to get a chip in the anime genre is entertaining and amusing at best. 
Preset old characters, giving nothing new to the serie, and only thing new in the serie is introduction of different world type vampires. Gargoyles, lamieres, gorgons... All the same, Vampires. As with this ""upgrade"" Eric is not fighting ""humanid"" creatures anylonger, ofc there are those pureblood classic vampires, but on the same time blade is fighting with demons and mutants. 
 
Sure, as a blade believer, this series is definetly worth watching, but it brings nothing new to the genre, instead it is using every single mannover there is on the genre. But with anime clash, they added more of the bushido and samurai style to the blades fighting. 
 
And if were mentioning mutants in this, were not again talking about those regular ones, were talking about the marvels supermutant ones. There is serious, unshamefull attempt to bring more mutants to the anime genre so they too could be made for anime series.  
 
If you like monstertype vampire, blade and longed out conversations and dwelling to the characters past lifes made onto continous series, you will probably like the new serie.

          
 
       Helpful (I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road) 
 
Marvel dipping their hand in the anime field. This anime is mediocre with no real jaw dropping moments. We all no the Blade story he hunts vampires end of story. I feel like they should have added a little more extremeness to make more then someone just slashing  a sword a vampires for their own personal reason. 
 
1. Blood Shed their is a lot of blood to go around for every. 
2. Action a good amount of fighting (gotta work out some how right) 
3. No Romance (who got time for love when their vamps taking over the world) 
4. Predictable (um some what) 
5. Supernatural yes vampires duh and different kind of species to who new. 
 
 
 
Overall 15+ should watch this anime. Not really a main anime to spend a whole lot of time. BASICS OF THE BASICS

","I've forgotten how I stumbled upon this film, but I was very surprised by what I saw. It lacks in many ways. Story, sound, character. It's a basic retelling of the mythos of Susano'o. Although, making him a more likable character. But the art!  
 
Oh my, the art!  
 
It's absolutely beautiful. I love animation of all kinds. I don't care where it's from, I love animation. The techniques, the history. I see on Wikipedia that when this first came out it made quite the splash in animation circles and I can see why! The scene with the dancer luring Amaterasu out of her cave, and of Orochi drinking the sake. And the fight with Orochi was truly something to behold!  
 
For anyone on their own journey into a love of animation I would highly recommend this film.

","This is a mecha oriented adventure story. A mischievious boy of 12 years age accidentally finds a giant robot ( shadow warrior) and uses it to fight against shadow warriors sent by Dark lord Tsukiyomi. Tsukiyomi sents a girl named oto as an undercover spy to steal dragon essence from Takeru, who has just started his journey. Meanwhile he learns from an old perverted sage Ma horoba that to defeat tsukiyomi takeru must gather 7 celestial essence. This is the gist of the entire 'yamato takeru' series. 
 
Charcters: Roko, friend of Takeru was the only strong and purposeful character in the series. Takeru's parents were more responsible and give him the correct suggestions which are useful for many. For instance, Takeru's mother caution him that ""fighting is not the only way to show courage' and his father instructs him not to get controlled by his rage. Some characters change from bad to good like hayamika and kiriomi. 
 
Art: Art gets deteriorated after 13 episodes. You can see the drawing lines on the characters ears, tea shirts (observe oto and Takeru).  
 
Enjoyment : The whole series is nothing but an adventure with mecha which some times feel like boring. But the story compensates it and makes us to go through the end.  So one can see it when there are no other anime available.

12,36816,82,6.320414181,Story between god and human,Godzilla 2: Kessen Kidou Zoushoku Toshi,"By the advent of the 21st century, much of humanity was dead, having been trampled over by a new master, Godzilla. A select few among mankind took to the stars in a spacefaring vessel called the Aratrum in search of ""the promised land,"" the planet Tau-e that could sustain human life. But the migration plan fails, and the remnants of the human race decide to return to Earth. But the distortions in space-time and the distance traveled means that mankind is returning to a completely changed Earth some 20,000 years later. The returnees, led by hero Haruo, prepare to take the fight to Godzilla based on a strategy that has been 20 years in the making. Carried out with the help of two alien species, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, the humans succeed in defeating Godzilla in a costly battle to the death. 
 
But the victory is short-lived. Rising from the depths of the planet is a new breed of monster, dubbed ""Godzilla Earth."" Evolving for 20,000 years, the creature stands 300 meters high, weighs over 100,000 tons and wields such overwhelmingly destructive power that Haruo and company have no choice but to run for their lives. 
 
Coming to Haruo's rescue, however, is Miana, a member of an aboriginal tribe called the Houtua. They are the first humanoid people the returnees have encountered. Could they descend from humans? ""Our tribal god was destroyed by Godzilla. All that we have left are these eggs. Anyone who has tried to fight or resist him has been drowned in fire,"" the tribespeople say to Haruo, who responds with: ""This is our last hope of recovering our home."" 
 
Meanwhile, Bilusaludo commander, Galu-gu is elated to discover that the Houtua tribe's arrowheads are made of a nanometal or a self-sustaining metal. It had been developed in the 21st century as an ""anti-Godzilla"" killer weapon deployed at their decisive battle fought at the foot of Mt. Fuji, but had been destroyed before it could be activated in the form of a ""Mecha-Godzilla."" The nanometal was its base substance, and proof that the manufacturing plant can still be used. 
 
(Source: Official site)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","Following the events of Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters, the Aratrum is unable to contact Haruo and the rest after their encounter with the original Godzilla. The Captain orders the Aratrum's withdrawal if drones fail to find survivors within 48 hours. Haruo Sakaki is revealed to have been rescued by a native girl named Miana, who treated his wound with a strange powder. Haruo reunites with some of his teammates while they were confronted by who they later learned to be Miana's twin sister Maina before being captured by the latter's hunting party. The group are reunited with Martin Lazzari whose platoon have been healed by the twins' people who are known as the ""Houtua"", surviving descendants of humans who remained on Earth and safeguard the egg of their fallen deity.
The group are telepathically questioned by the twins and the Houtua leaders over why they burned their lands, letting them go once Haruo explains they were only attacking Godzilla. Accompanied by Miana and Maina as their protective guides and observers, the twins revealing they can also speak verbally, Haruo's group reunites with Metphies and the other survivors during an encounter with the Servum. During the fight, Galu-Gu realizes that the twins' arrowheads are laced with ""nanometal"", the nanotechnology used to create Mechagodzilla. Galu-Gu explains that the nanometal somehow survived and expanded itself over the past 20 millennia. Haruo is convinced by Galu-Gu to remain on Earth and resume the plan to kill Godzilla, sending a few crew members back to the Aratrum. The group trace the energy signature to the rebuilt facility that held Mechagodzilla, which Galu-Gu christens ""Mechagodzilla City"". The twins part ways with the group while warning Haruo that the nanometal is poisonous; the Bilusaludo assuring the group that the technology is only harmful to Godzilla.
The team soon finds that the surviving half of Mechagodzilla's head is the source of the nanometal as Galu-Gu accesses Mechagodzilla's brain to construct all necessary materials to trap Godzilla within the city and cover it with nanometal to finish it off with EMP harpoons. While overseeing the construction, her mech suit modified into one of three Vulture exo-armors, Yuko confesses her feelings for Haruo and kisses him. Feeling slightly ill since entering the city like some of the others, Haruo finds Metphies working in a cave to repair an item with some of Galu-Gu's technology. Metphies cryptically hints the Bilusaludo's motives of becoming monsters themselves due to their obsession with logic, confiding to Haruo the name of a greater terror than Godzilla that destroyed his homeworld: ""Ghidorah"".
As Godzilla awakens, most of the human members are horrified to learn that most of the Bilusaludo had willingly allowed themselves to be assimilated into Mechagodzilla City to further fortify it. Godzilla's quick advance on the city forces Galu-Gu to sacrifice the city's defenses in order to divert power to finish the harpoon while Haruo, Yuko and Belu-be use the Vultures to slow Godzilla down. Though the trio managed to hold Godzilla for the plan to go underway, Godzilla survives the trap and proceeds to overheat the facility. This forces a defiant Galu-Gu to fuse with the nanometal as the humans escape the city. Galu-Gu then has the Vultures absorb their pilots to use as sacrificial spears to kill Godzilla.
Haruo is unaffected while Yuko is being slowly converted against her will. Metphies warns a conflicted Haruo that Mechagodzilla City will consume Earth if not stopped and that its destruction could save Yuko, Galu-Gu arguing that transcending their humanity is the only way to kill Godzilla. Haruo ultimately decides to fight Godzilla with his humanity intact, the destruction of Galu-Gu and the command center rendering the nanometal inert as Godzilla frees itself and destroys the city. Haruo tends to Yuko, who is unable to wake from her comatose state, while the surviving humans hide in a cave with Metphies as everything burns around them.
","In Japan, radiation creates monsters (Godzilla). In America, radiation creates superheroes. It's almost like Japan and America have very different narratives surrounding nuclear fallout. If we think really really hard, we might know why this is.  
 
Anyway, this animated Gojira 2nd movie is better than Marvel's Avengers and you should feel bad for not being weeb enough to realize its superiority. We have better written story, superior storytelling, way less CGI, characters who serve other purposes beyond being marketing baits, and most importantly, we are not watching pg13 rated shonen movie which Marvel Cinematic Universe represents with its content. Ask yourself the question ""Why would I choose superhero over super awesome?"" 
 
If the first movie didn't impress you with its best scenes such as the one where man saw a flower and burst into tears because mother nature has not abandon humanity, or the scene where dude said ""keikaku doori"" (all according to the plan) followed by everything falling apart 2 minutes later, or the rampage of flying mini-godzillas -- worry not! This time the man himself is here and he is not just your normal Godzilla. No! He is Mecha Godzilla (pronounced megagodzilla)! This is seriously the funniest thing I have seen since the laser-sharks scene from The Lego Movie (2014). 
 
Not only that, we have biblical references, tanned tattoo waifus (p l u r a l), gun mags that always have one more shot left, Lara Croft's bow-wielding abo cousin, dudes who accept their destiny in 3 seconds like waddup I was born in the tunnels bby, person named Belu-Be, tentacles, nanometals (the worst of all metals!), epic time skips and nice technologies (EMP harpoons, meta missiles and whatnot), electro panic (that song at 42 minute mark), very own me2 campaign, and dialog about Godzilla's effect on ecosystem followed by more tentacles. Seriously, that timing, bro. This is the type of greatness that keeps on giving and rewarding those who pay attention. Hanazawa Kana is also there because most people wouldn't even consider this anime otherwise.  
 
The art and animation follow the same idea as the last one. Meaning this is Netflix's own idea of nu-anime, spiced with some Berserk 2017 art design. I would complain, but since the creatures are monsters, I have had a blast calling Godzilla a CGI-Monster instead. The sound directing is from the Hollywood. Meaning keeping your bass at anime settings is not the best idea. I wasn't prepared, left a class of water on the table and the Jurassic Park effect hit it pretty hard. If you're into that sorta things, then this is a treat for you. It's almost like our CGI-Monster is walking at your very yard.  
 
When it comes to the characters, we have a squad nearly as colorful as in Mars of Destruction. After 2 movies, I am still quite unsure which one of them is the real main character, but that's hardly the point of this movie. Basically this movie is Japan's animated take on the chaos movie boom which was started by Sharknado in 2013. As a person who has seen all 5 Sharknado movies (yes there are 5 already, 6th coming this year) I have to recommend this Godzilla movie series to each and every anime viewer who have been blessed with the ability of enjoying purposely done bad more than things which tried to be good but weren't.  

          
 
       Helpful The story is fine. I still wish this could've been a full anime series instead of three movies because there is a lot of world-building without fully using it. Things are brought up without needing those new elements in the story. If it were a full anime series, we could spend more time with those things rather than using a tiny bit of them as plot devices. I also disliked the main character. I dislike main characters that are emotional and value their own things over the things of other people. I feel like this movie has the main character do the opposite of growth. He actually becomes more immature compared to the last movie, which is saying something.

          
 
       Helpful (This review is valid for the entire Godzilla trilogy, with some slight changes at the end of each one, for each respective film) 
So much potential out of the window, the premise of a Godzilla movie / anime does not have to be complex to be good, after all, what we want to see are giant monsters fighting, that's something cool, remembering, It's GODZILLA, do not confuse like reflective works like Monster, Shigatsu, Code Geas, right then. To summarize the story revolves around our planet earth having been dominated by Godzilla, causing humans to be forced to flee into space, and accompanying the attempt to retake the planet through the destruction of Gozilla, are also shown some other races, which are basically humans who have evolved in other ways, films also deal with religious beliefs and fanaticism, in a slightly generic and weak way, but they treat, the central protagonist is very simple, those protagonists who are decisive, optimistic and with a sense of justice and duty, the rest of the cast of characters has no muuuuita relevance, of course, they have, mainly, the blond / white guy Metphies, and the twin sisters who actually live in the land, well, at least he has good soundtracks, some I just hope that being a CGI anime would have more action scenes, after all, it's the studio that made Knights of Sydonia, but it was not what happened, unfortunate mind. My real problem here is: The planet, seriously, as soon as they arrive all the fauna and flora has changed, everything is new and harmful, from animals (like dragons) to the environment (water attacks the characters) and all this is derived from Godzilla, and yet there were people living there (or at least one kind of mutation). A unique part of ""Godzilla 2: Kessen Kidou Zoushoku Toshi"", I hoped that in this movie they would show the characters interacting more with the habitat and the people of planet earth, but that's not what happened, a romance begins to form between the protagonist and another character, which made me happy, I like novels, and what better place for it than where the most powerful being lives? But coming back to the film, it was clear that they could try to learn about the place and try to figure out better ways to confront Godzilla so powerful, so why the hell did they do that in the face of a suicide attack that was obviously going to go wrong? Even using the city ""Anti-Godzilla"", with her friends who went crazy and wanted to merge the city, the protagonist ends up giving up, I do not know, he wanted to save the woman he loved? I found this movie worse than the other because they did not take advantage of it as a line-up to make the third movie great, in which humans would actually be struggling. (I apologize for my spelling mistakes) 
 
(PT-Br) (Essa review vale para toda a trilogia de Godzilla, com algumas leves mudan?as no fim de cada uma, para cada respectivo filme) 
Tanto potencial jogado fora, pela janela, a premissa de um filme/anime de Godzilla n?o precisa ser complexa para ser boa, afinal, o que queremos ver s?o monstros gigantes lutando, isso sim é algo legal, lembrando, ? GODZILLA, n?o confunda como obras com cunho reflexivo como Monster, Shigatsu, Code Geas, certo ent?o. Para resumir a história gira sobre nosso planeta terra ter sido dominado pelo Godzilla, fazendo com que os humanos fossem obrigados a fugir para o espa?o, e acompanhos a tentativa de retomada do planeta através da destrui??o do Gozilla, também s?o mostrados algumas outras ra?as, que s?o basicamente humanos que evoluíram de outras formas, os filmes também tratam sobre cren?as e fanatismo religioso, de uma forma levemente genérica e fraca, mas tratam, a protagonista central é bem simples, daquelas protagonistas que s?o decididas, otimistas e com um senso de justi?a e dever enorme, o resto do cast de personagens n?o tem muuuuita relev?ncia, claro, eles tem, principalmente, o cara loiro/branco Metphies, e as irm?s gêmeas que vivem de fato na terra, bom, pelo menos ele tem boas soundtracks, algumas te passam tens?o, só esperava que por ser um anime em CGI teriam mais cenas de a??o, afinal, é o estúdio que fez Knights of Sydonia, mas n?o foi o que aconteceu, infelizmente. O meu real problema aqui é: O planeta, sério, logo quando eles chegam toda a fauna e flora mudou, tudo é novo e nocivo, desde animais (como drag?es) ao ambiente (a água ataca as personagens) e tudo isso se derivou do Godzilla, e ainda assim haviam pessoas vivendo lá (ou pelo menos um tipo de muta??o). Parte única para ""Godzilla 2: Kessen Kidou Zoushoku Toshi"", eu esperava que nesse filme eles mostrassem as personagens interagindo mais com o habitat e as pessoas do planeta terra, mas n?o foi isso que aconteceu, come?a a se formar um romance entre a protagonista e outra personagem, o que me deixou feliz, eu gosto de romances, e que lugar melhor para isso do que em local em que vive o ser mais poderoso de todos? Mas voltando ao filme, ficou claro que eles podiam tentar aprender sobre o lugar e tentar descobrir formas melhores de enfrentar o t?o poderoso Godzilla, ent?o por que diabos ao inés de fazerem isso eles foram em dire??o a um ataque suicida que obviamente iria dar errado? Mesmo usando a tal cidade ""Anti-Godzilla"", com os seus amigos que ficaram loucos e queriam se fundir a cidade, a protagonista acaba desistindo por, sei lá, ele queria salvar a mulher que ele amava? Eu achei esse filme pior que o outro por n?o terem aproveitado ele como uma escala??o para fazer o terceiro filme ser grandioso, em que os humanos estariam de fato lutando.

12,1726,83,6.291320198,Story between god and human,Devil May Cry,"Devil May Cry follows the story of the demon hunter known as Dante. As a half demon, half human, he uses his trusty sword Rebellion and his two guns Ebony and Ivory to take on missions. Dante owns and runs ""Devil May Cry,"" a business that specializes in hunting and killing demon-related problems. 
 
Based on the video game series ""Devil May Cry.""","['Action', 'Demons', 'Fantasy']","The series begins two millennia before the first game with the demon Sparda, the Black Knight, defeating Demon World ruler Mundus. Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing several Hellgates and Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a human priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil.
The plot begins with Devil May Cry 3, a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil. A large tower erupts from the ground near the shop, and Dante interprets it as a challenge from Vergil. Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by Lady, who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge. Dante and Vergil defeat him, and resume battling each other. The portal begins to close, and Vergil approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before the portal closes. Vergil is tested and encounters Mundus, his mother's killer. When Lady returns to the human world, she coins the phrase ""devil may cry""; Dante uses it for the shop.Dante is confronted in Devil May Cry by Trish, who reveals that Mundus is planning to return and only a descendant of Sparda can defeat him. He explores Mallet Island (where Mundus is set to return), encountering demons which include Mundus' general: the undead Vergil, Nelo Angelo. As Dante approaches Mundus, he falls into a trap which reveals that Trish is the demon's agent; he saves her, however, because she resembles his mother. Trish saves Dante from Mundus, and Dante realizes his father's power. Dante defeats Mundus when Trish helps him return Mundus to the Demon World. Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses and work together in the Devil Never Cry shop.
In the Devil May Cry: The Animated Series anime, Trish is a demon hunter; Dante is the bodyguard of Patty, a young heiress who becomes obsessed with him. Patty's mother is descended from a sorcerer who sealed the power of Abigail, an ancient devil lord. Patty is targeted by Sid, a demon seeking Abigail's power. Lady and Trish fight demons summoned by Sid, and Dante kills him.
Dante is invited by Lucia in Devil May Cry 2 to meet her mother, Matier. Dante learns that Arius is collecting artifacts (Arcana) to summon the demon lord Argosax. Dante flips a coin, and decides to help. Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that he created her. Lucia gives Dante the last of the Arcana before facing Arius alone. Dante encounters Matier, who asks him to take the Arcana to save Lucia from Arius. Lucia attacks Arius, but he captures her. Dante arrives, trades the Arcana for Lucia, and attacks Arius (who escapes). A stream of energy strikes the Ouroboros tower, and a portal to the demon world opens. Dante and Lucia argue about who will enter, and Dante determines that he will go. After Dante leaves, Arius returns to the human world and Lucia defeats him.In Devil May Cry 4, Dante and Trish discover foul play within the Order of the Sword and investigate while learning its religious leader's scheme to conquer the world using demonic power. Dante seemingly assassinates the Sanctus, only to face a young holy knight named Nero, who awakened his demonic forces as a descendant of Sparda. Nero quests to capture Dante while gaining Yamato, only to learn the Order's dark secrets before being captured by Sanctus through his girlfriend. Dante manages to cripple Sanctus's plans before freeing Nero to finish the job. The two part ways on good terms with Nero allowed keeping Yamato.
In Devil May Cry 5, set several years after Devil May Cry 4, Nero runs a mobile branch of Dante's Devil May Cry business. He befriends Nico, a weapons artist and descendant of the gunsmith who crafted Dante's Ebony and Ivory handguns. Nero's Devil Bringer arm from Devil May Cry 4 is stolen; armed with a prosthetic Devil Breaker created by Nico, he leaves with Dante and the demon hunter V to face their ""strongest foe yet"".Although the series' timeline had placed Devil May Cry 4 before Devil May Cry 2, it was retconned with the release of Devil May Cry 5. DmC: Devil May Cry, developed by Ninja Theory, is not part of the timeline and takes place in an alternate universe from the main series. It moves away from the gothic look of the previous games to a more contemporary setting with some social commentary on mass media and culture.

But maybe some game like Lord of the Ring or maybe the recent Wolverine game for the PC is good. Speaking of game, now i going comment a anime that was base from one of the best game from Capcom call 'Devil May Cry' (wahhhhh.....), and how that i think about it; well, let's find out! 
 
DMC, when it say it going to become an anime; i like any other DMC player are jump for joy for it adaption. But after going through all the 12 episode of DMC, i like any other DMC player are down with sorrow and anger that what the hell the director has done on DMC. 
 
The story in this anime are all episodic, each episode are stand alone story until episode 9 or 10 where the real plot has finally started. And each episode are all the same:  
 
1,there is a demon case 
2,Dante sitting around and do nothing (or maybe try to annoy Patty stupid problem) until Morrison say 'get your ass up! We got work to do, blah blah blah....' 
3,He goes to work, have some help from Lady and Trish 
4,He blew the work, mission accomplish and his debt is increase. The End! 
 
That it! Nothing new, no plot that connected to other plot, zero! Until episode 9 or 10. 
 
Sure you have character like Dante, Lady, and Trish to be animated here, and you do have character only for this anime, like Patty, she has been on the series since episode only has 'finally' been serve as a important character on episode 9 or 10, for the rest of the episode she just serve as a annoying brat! And Morrison, Dante agent always try to bring him a good job but end getting mess up by Dante. 
 
For Dante, Lady, and Trish (i still want make a comment on them!), Dante still Dante, like pizza and strawberry, and weild Ebony & Ivory and Rebellion to fight off demon. And the funny thing is, he use his gun more than his sword! Even the director finally let him use it, the sword battle are just temporary! But Trish and Lady still play their role where they supposed to be, to support Dante and take Dante credit! 
 
Animation is good, no less. The shading and everything was good. Even the bike scene in episode 2 are well done. Plus the OP of the series was nice, able to blend in the series as well. But the ED (though i didn't listen that often) was smooth and relax. 
 
What is the credit for us finishing DMC anime? Zero! 
What is the credit for them finishing DMC anime?Promoting DMC4! 
What is the credit for us buying DMC anime DVD?More DMC4 bonus! 
 
And in my opinion, this bonus are come to nothing and pointless after the real thing is out. The anime just bring down Dante good point and completely destroy the DMC atmosphere. And DMC is not the only one being anime, other like 'Tales of...', '.Hack' did make the series well and on going. And heck, even the live action Resident Evil movie was better than this! 
 
That why product movie, animation, comic or anything that is base on something are mostly not a good thing!

Title: Devil May Cry: The Animated Series 
 
A/M: Anime 
 
Synopsis: Half demon, half human hunter, Dante owns a business that takes care of all your pesky demon problems. Spanning across 12 missions, Dante helps humans who are plagued with demonic murders find peace...for a fee. 
 
Pros: 
-Episode 5 breaks from the mold in an interesting and comical way 
-Each episode being essentially self-contained as it’s a different job for Dante each time is an obvious and unoriginal choice but serves the DMC universe well given Dante’s profession  
 
Cons: 
-Chooses to borrow from successful anime that came before it rather than try to carve a style all its own 
-While the source material is poking fun at itself, the animated series takes itself much more seriously than the games ever intended and thus the anime ends up full simply following suit to every other mature action show 
-An excess of reoccurring characters that don’t push or further the story or the characters in any way 
 
Rating: 5/10 
 
What did you rate Devil May Cry?

          
 
       Helpful Devil May Cry includes humor, excellent fight scenes, originality and  wondrous character design and story lines.  
sadly,  I don't think the anime stood up to the game very well.  
 
The main character Dante, i thought was brillant and was easily the awesome focus point of the anime just like the game. Although if the anime really wanted to be classed on the same level of the game it probably should have been longer, included a more daring and exciting story line and brought foreward a villain that outlines Dante and shapes the anime.  
 
Despite that, it had brilliant humor and fantastic little details. For example, they included Dantes pizza and Ice cream addiction, and created a wonderful charcter by the name of patty. A fun and demanding little girl who makes a strange bond with the main character. 
 
I think it would help with playing the games first and then watching the anime, otherwise i don't think you'll truly grasp the art and exquisive ways of this series.

12,20053,84,6.291320198,Story between god and human,Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil,"The story takes place in Tokyo in 2018, where normal humans and those who can use magic coexist. As a result, there are laws against using magic, and a ""magic courtroom"" exists to preside over lawsuits regarding magic use. In these cases, ""Benmashi"" or wizard barristers defend those who use magic. The anime follows Cecil, the youngest Benmashi in history, and her associates as they defend clients in these cases. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Police', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","In 2018, humans and wizards live together in Tokyo. Police continue to protect order in society, but wizards known as Wud are tried according to magical law via Magic Prohibition Law, in special courts defended by wizard barristers via the Court for Magic. Half-Japanese, half-Canadian Cecile Sudo has just become the youngest wizard barrister and begins work at the Butterfly Law Office. While she has not realized it yet, she has tremendous magical potential.
","This series is somewhat of an enigma. The concept of Wizards defending Wizards in a Magic Court was a very unique idea and plot. Sudo Cecil is your lead character, who happens to be a ""Wizard Barrister"" working for Butterfly Law Office. She is looking for answers about her past  and discovers not only the truth, but is thrown into many difficult, dangerous situations. The characters development in the series is extremely well done. As is the relationship development between them. You get a clear idea of the relationship each character has to each other. With a few exceptions of course. Each episode takes you on its own journey, while keeping its own place in the main storyline. The characters were unique in design and animated extremely well. There was also instances of comedic perversion/fanservice that had me laughing on frequent occasions, but wasn't something that was being pushed on fans.  
 
The negatives I have are why the overall rating isn't higher. First, the story tends to drift at times which causes some confusion, for me at least, at times. Also, though beautifully animated, a few episodes seemed to be very choppy and did not transition well between scenes. Finally, I feel as if there are more episodes (a 2nd season) there will be ample times for better closure and for the storyline to mature and develop much more.  
 
This series has great potential, especially with the unique premise for the series. But, as it stands, it doesn't live up to that potential. At least not yet.

          
 
       Helpful I haven’t done a review in almost a year. So, you would think Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil is ‘that’ special. Let me tell you why it ‘almost’ was. 
 
First, the concept. You could more likely compare Wizard Barristers into being a legal representative of Wuds (people who possess magical powers) in Tokyo Year 2018. Cecil Sudou, being the youngest ever Wizard Barrister, tries to make use of her knowledge to ‘defend’ Wuds and give them an unprejudiced trial.  
 
However, being involved with strange people along the way, she discovers more about her past, and something about herself. 
 
Story: (3/10) 
Don’t get me wrong. I would say that the story is ‘quite’ original as I haven’t really watched a lot of animes that involved Law in them. Or, maybe because I haven’t encountered those kind of animes, so I don’t really have a standard.  
 
A story combining law and magic? I mean, who wouldn’t love that? And they even made a separate law, called the Magic Probihition Law, which Wuds are subject to. That really got me, especially when the protagonists casually say it just to make a statement. 
 
Now, I was thrilled as I typed those from above, and then I thought: What made Wizard Barristers suck? Easy. That would be the story in totality. I love the law-plus-magic idea as much as the next guy, but this was not implemented well with the whole series. The story gets you thinking, “Is this even going anywhere?” Sure, the story was fluid. Sure, the story had continuity. But, for what? For Wuds to have to have a fair trial? That doesn’t really apply when you could see there is already an over-complexity between the characters themselves, which makes a case insignificant all the way.  
 
Then, a question again popped in my head. “What made Wizard Barristers TOTALLY suck?” That, my friend, would be the pace of the story. It goes from one scene to another, having no proper transition at all. And don’t even get me started on the eye-catches. 
 
Art: (4/10) 
‘Colorful’ would be the first word to say of Wizard Barristers. The anime had vibrant colors that are such a sight. And the neon-glowing ‘circle’ thingies really add effect to the spells they use. And the CGI for the Metamoloids are relatively superb. 
 
I think no one would disagree that the opening animation of the anime was splendid. But, like they say, you should never judge an anime with its opening animation (and theme). Really. Unfortunately, Sentai Filmworks did a terrible job with the animation itself. A lot of inconsistencies would be seen in it. Strange movements (and etc.) made the anime unpleasant to watch. I think it would’ve been better to just put your earphones on and just turn off the monitor.  
 
There is also that one episode that looked like it was a Microsoft Powerpoint Slideshow of still pictures, with dialogue. What? The producers are getting lazy because they already knew that it sucked that they got tired of ‘actually’ doing the movements?  
 
Also, maybe it’s just me, but it had that Saber Marionette J-type of feel. 
 
Sound: (8/10) 
For a reason that I don’t know, Lia’s themes strike me in the heart. Angel Beats! And Clannad would second that. That Lia opening was just amazing. The ending theme was also good. But the producer of the song Rui Tanabe sang didn’t get you that I-have-to-watch-the-next-episode-but-I-need-to-listen-to-this-first kind of feeling. 
 
I think I should give praise to the soundtrack itself, as it gave suitable ambiance for most scenes, like when trials are about to start, or when the employees from Butterfly Law Offices are just slacking off. Voice actors were also good. Most notable would be Wataru Takagi, voice of Seseri Chono, which gave justice to the character himself. 
 
Character: (5/10) 
Character development was good, but it wasn’t great at the same time. There were still characters that have the right to have more background stories. There were also no explanations to how one possesses magic, or how they got this specific type of power. 
 
And although it wasn’t clear, at least these characters are likeable. Especially Cecil who, at the same time, was the center of humor in the entire show.  
 
There were 2 major discrepancies on it though. Who is Moyo Tento? I certainly don’t want to end the anime without having to get to know her first. And the other: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE USELESS FAMILIARS?  
 
Enjoyment: (6/10) 
Something to look forward to in this anime would be the action. As a fan of magic-related animes (like To Aru Majutsu No Index and Alice Academy), I definitely can’t get enough of those kind of action. They were spectacular. Too bad there wasn’t much of it. Even the trials, which are something that would interest a viewer, didn’t last long enough for it to actually be considered a ‘proper’ hearing. 
 
They just weren’t enough. That aside, they were still awesome.  
 
Overall: (5/10) 
Should I recommend this to you, reader of my review?  
 
If you want magic and action, combined with wacky (and some, cold) characters, with Law (just an amount) being the underplot, and Lia having an opening theme, then yes.  
 
If you want to watch an anime that is fully detailed, does not miss facts and provides broad character development with great animation, I suggest you watch something else. 
 
All in all, Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil would have been a great anime. Really. Maybe it was just the number of episodes. Or, it just lacked that ‘total feel’ which most viewers would think so, too.

          
 
       Helpful Well, this was wasted potential. On paper, Wizard Barristers had a potentially interesting premise with its law office perspective on a world where wizards face discrimination and get wrongly prosecuted for crimes due to a flawed and sometimes prejudiced judicial system. The show starts off as an episodic look at cases such as this where the Butterfly Law Office try to defend their clients on cases and the series exploring a number of the flaws that the judicial system in Wizard Barristers has when it comes to defending wizards, a major aspect of this shown through Cecil's efforts to try proving her mother's innocence for a crime she was framed for. The second half of the series hints to a secret wizard cult desiring Cecil for mysterious reasons and the Butterfly Law Office getting entangled in things as they come to realize that events with Cecil and her family are connected to the cult's activities. 
 
It is the second half of the series that leads to much of the show's downfall. While it does allow Cecil's character to be more fleshed out with her connections to the mentioned cult, this comes at the cost of the world exploration that the first half had with exploring human and wizard tensions through the judicial system of Wizard Barristers. The reasons that the cult have for needing Cecil are rather cliched (world domination for wizards -yawn-) and build up to a rather underwhelming and rushed conclusion that felt like somewhat of a cop-out when it looks like things are about to get worst for the good guys, yet conveniences in plot prevent things from getting too dire. 
 
The second half developments aren't the only things that cripple Wizard Barristers. Beyond Cecil, most of the other characters get limited to no fleshing out of their characters that leave you little reason to care for any connection they have to Cecil. Also for a show that is supposed to seem serious with its premise, the comedy and random ecchi bits peppered in at points within the show felt really out of place for this series, notably scenes where Nanagenie attempts perverted acts on Cecil and a hostage episode where Cecil and one of her pals dress up in corny sentai hero costumes. Then again considering Studio Arms and Yasuomi Umetsu are involved in making this series, I should have expected these bits to be included with the series in some form. 
 
About the only genuine praise I can give this series is for its visual presentation. It's easily among the best animated titles this season with highly detailed scenery shots and character designs, plus having plenty of fluid movement and nicely-rendered CG animation for the show's elaborate action sequences with wizards squaring off against one another with their magic, especially when they create giant robots (this I'm not kidding about) for a clash. Only sore point with visuals was the rather limited animation seen in a decent chunk of the televised airing of episode 11, though I imagine this will be improved on for the title's video release. 
 
Praises aside for visuals though, Wizards Barristers had wasted potential as a series thanks to its focus shift in later episodes, out-of-place ecchi and comedy bits, underdeveloped characters and a sloppy resolution when everything is settled. This is certainly among one of the year's underwhelming titles that I've seen thus far.

He does battle with it in a prideful battle of revenge. This Special is actually a flashback of previous episodes in Bleach. After the ending credits, a short plays showing Shinigami and their Zanpakutos to ""Number One"" from the Bleach Soundtrack.

In Karakura Town, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki becomes a substitute Soul Reaper (死神, Shinigami, literally, ""Death God""), when Rukia Kuchiki risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although initially reluctant to accept their responsibility, he takes her place, and during this time they discover that a few classmates are spiritually aware and have their own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses spiritual particles, Orihime Inoue has a group of protective spirits called Shun Shun Rikka and Yasutora Sado (""Chad"") has strength equal to the Hollows encased in his arm.
When Rukia is sentenced to death for transgressions in the human world and sent to the Soul Society, Ichigo meets Kisuke Urahara and Yoruichi Shihōin, who unbeknownst to him are two exiled Soul Reapers, to allow himself and his friends to save Rukia. After this, it is revealed that ex-squad captain Sōsuke Aizen framed Rukia for the crime and has been illegally experimenting on Soul Reapers and Hollows. Aizen plans to conquer the Soul Society by using the Hōgyoku, a legendary powerful substance turning Hollows into half Soul Reapers. After faking his death and his reappearance caused a fight with some people, Aizen escapes into Hueco Mundo, the realm of Hollows, and later kidnaps Orihime as she is instrumental in creating the Oken, a power that will allow him to kill the Soul King, the ruler of the Soul Society.

Along with Aizen, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, the Espada as a group possess comparable strength to Soul Reaper captains. After rescuing Orihime, Aizen reveals her kidnapping was a distraction to allow him to take Karakura Town, as its spiritual energy is what is needed for the Oken. After being trained by his father Isshin, another exiled Soul Reaper, Ichigo sacrifices his power to seal Aizen away when the Hōgyoku rejects its master, and the Soul Reapers defeat the Espadas. Months later, Chad and the members reveal themselves as Fullbringers in a group called Xcution. They can give up their powers to restore other ones and they plan on doing so for Ichigo, who uses the power of Fullbringer. However, it is all a ruse by their leader Kugo Ginjo, a Fullbringer and former Substitute Soul Reaper, to extract his powers and empower all of them. Ichigo has his Soul Reaper powers restored, when he gains his trust from the Soul Society. After helping other Soul Reapers defeat Ginjo's team, Ichigo resumes his duty as a Substitute Soul Reaper.

He attempts to fuse with Nozomi Kujō into an original being ?ko Yushima. However, Nozomi sacrifices herself to defeat Inaba and Ichigo loses his power.
","I voted everything a 4. 
 
I gave it a 4 because this was pointless and don't eve waste your time watching it. This part is just in the anime and it beats me why I wasted 20 minutes watching something i've already seen in the anime. Some OVA. 
 
In the anime and manga though this part gets a 10. 
 
Bleach rocks, so i'll give it a 6.

          
 
       Helpful This review is going to be a little different then my other ones. If one is looking for a completle remake of the original, this isn't it. This has only a few minor changes and a few minor additions. There was a little more character development and it focused more on a small plot line. One HAS to watch it to figure out if they like it or not really, but hopefully what I've said above will help make up ones mind to watch it or not.

          
 
       Helpful Well First off i'm gonna say that this OVA: Memories in the Rain was made as a pilot before bleach was ever aired. It comprises of parts from episodes 7, 8 and 9 with alterations of course, it's more true to the manga which is a plus. 
 
So don't get it into your head like some of the other reviewers that this is an addition to the main series of Bleach. 
 
The art and sound are a step up from the series which is good to note; nice background music and clearer and more defined animation. 
 
Also the seiyuu of Kon is Tite Kubo the creator of Bleach and the ending theme 'Memories in the Rain' is sung by the seiyuu's of Ichigo and Rukia. 
 
Their is more emphasis on the story line and character development than usual which is probably due to the 3 episodes condensed into one slightly longer episode which in my opinion was a good idea. 
 
I enjoyed this OVA and prefer it to eps 7, 8 and 9 as quality over quantity is what i like in anime.

Overall: I love Akikan and watching the OVA after I watched the show about a year ago makes me feel a little nostalgic so it was good to reminisce in a lil :)

          
 
       Helpful First of all - this is an OVA of the series Akikan! It takes place after the main series, though there is little content so that barely matters other than for knowing who the characters are. I suggest watching the TV series before the OVA. 
 
Second, I am not particularly fond of fanservice, so consider my review in that light. If you like fanservice in general, you may enjoy this a lot more than I did. (I find that fanservice usually detracts from the characters/story). 
 
This is your typical hot springs episode. All of the important characters make appearances, but there's virtually no story or character-driven content whatsoever. To make a fairer comparison - the pool episode in the TV series had fanservice, but also some plot as well, whereas this OVA lacks any semblance of plot or interesting character interactions. To me, it felt artificial and contrived. There are still a couple of amusing parts, but nothing had quite the same special cheesy-to-the-point-of-actually-funny that the TV series did. 
 
If you liked Akikan, the OVA is a ~little~ something extra. If you're really into fanservice stuff, you'll probably like it too, but there aren't any nipples, so don't get your hopes (or anything else) up. 
 
Oh, and if you do watch it, there's also an extra 15 seconds or so after the credits.

          
 
       Helpful The Akikan! OVA takes place right after the events of the first one. That's the first thing I'm going to point out. 
 
Since it's comedy, why not add a Hot Spring episode? That's what one might be thinking. I'm not one for fan service so that might explain why the scores are kind of low. 
 
I guess here's the break down: 
 
Story: 6 
Art: 6 
Sound: 6 
Character: 6 
Enjoyment: 5 
Overall: 6 
 
Typical Hot Spring episode, with the fan service of the girls of the anime. It might just be me, but it was too focused on the fan service. Kakeru barely got any screen time in this episode if any of you are wondering. But it is just is a little extra from the anime, so one might like it if one watched the anime.

However, darkness lurks underneath the seemingly idyllic life they lead.  
 
As the village prepares for its annual festival, Keiichi learns about the local legends surrounding it. To his horror, he discovers that there have been several murders and disappearances in the village in the recent years, and that they all seem to be connected to the festival and the village's patron god, Oyashiro. Keiichi tries to ask his new friends about these incidents, but they are suspiciously silent and refuse to give him the answers he needs. As more and more bizarre events occur, he wonders just what else his friends might be keeping from him, and if he can even trust them at all. 
 
When madness and paranoia begin taking root in Keiichi's heart, he will stumble straight into the mysteries at work in  Higurashi no Naku Koro ni , a story that is told across multiple arcs. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Dementia', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In June 1983, Keiichi Maebara moves to the village of Hinamizawa (雛見沢) and befriends classmates Mion Sonozaki, her twin sister Shion, Rena Ryūgū, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hōjō. Keiichi soon learns of the village's annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration dedicated to the local deity Oyashiro. Hinamizawa initially seems calm and peaceful, but shortly before the festival, Keiichi learns that for four years in a row, murders and disappearances have been taking place on the day the festival. This chain of incidents remains unsolved and has come to be known as the ""Oyashiro Curse"" by the superstitious villagers. The day after this year's festival, police discover the corpse of visiting freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, who appears to have torn his throat out with his bare hands, and the charred body of Miyo Takano, a nurse in the village clinic. In most chapters of the game, Keiichi or one of his friends attempts to investigate the mysteries of Hinamizawa and the Oyashiro Curse, only to succumb to paranoia and homicidal rage. A few days after the festival, Rika's body is found in the family shrine dedicated to Oyashiro. On the same day, a cataclysm befalls the village and wipes out the population, which is explained by the media as a release of swamp gas.
The answer arcs reveal that each preceding arc is an alternate reality in which Rika tried and failed to save herself and her friends. As a priestess of the Furude Shrine, Rika can communicate with the spirit Hanyū, who served as the basis for Oyashiro and is the ancestress of the Furude clan. Each time Rika died, Hanyū would move her to another reality; however, the very ending of Rika's life is not retained in her memories when she transfers, obstructing her from knowing the cause of her death. In the final two chapters, it is revealed that the village's local clinic is secretly a government institute investigating a mysterious parasite in the village that causes Hinamizawa Syndrome; a disease that induces paranoia, delusion, and homicidal rage in its victims before pushing them to tear out their own throats. This disease is responsible for instigating the characters to commit murders in the previous arcs, and some of the incidents in the earlier years were caused by it. The rest of the incidents were caused by Miyo, who had killed Tomitake and faked her death, using the Oyashiro Curse as a cover. Hinamizawa Syndrome manifests in those experiencing extreme stress or those who move a distance away from the ""Infection Queen"", who releases a pheromone that prevents the aggravation of the villagers' condition. The women of the Furude clan have all acted as Infection Queens, and Rika is the sole remaining member of the line after the death of her parents in the 1981's incident.
The theory by Miyo's adoptive grandfather, Hifumi Takano, is that if there is no Infection Queen, all villagers will succumb to the syndrome, and a mass outbreak of violence will occur. In some of the realities, Shion, succumbing to Hinamizawa Syndrome, kills Rika; however, life in Hinamizawa goes on, showing that Hifumi's theories have been exaggerated. In most of the realities, Miyo kills Rika, and the threat of the mass outbreak convinces the government to massacre the village, with the release of swamp gas being a cover story. Miyo's motive is to vindicate the work of Hifumi and force his work to be recognized after he was mocked and shamed by the government and scientific community for his thesis about the disease.
After several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes either vividly or subconsciously aware of the previous realities, allowing him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyū to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance and all of the knowledge and allies they have formed along the way, they thwart Miyo's plan and go on to live happy lives afterward. In the secret ending, Rika travels back to the past to prevent Miyo's suffering from the traumatic childhood that led her to become who she was.
","This is a very unique anime that i have to literally rewatch 3 times to understand the story as well as  whats going on. the story may be complex at times but if you have played the visual novel before then you can understand it pretty easily. The anime very much shows all the endings from the visual novel and did a pretty good job on adapting it. 
 
although it is listed as horror i don't find this anime scary at all, the amount of gore in this anime is nothing compared to real gore anime. the story can get pretty interesting from episode 1 to end, it is recommended you watch both seasons or else you will not understand what the heck is going on. 
 
This anime has inspired many other series such as madoka magica of the reborn concept. While watching this anime you should try your best to look at every bit of detail and try to understand it or else it will turn into a mind-fuck fest. 
 
the anime might seem to be quite old now but overall its still pretty enjoyable. this is the sort of anime that act like innocent at start then it becomes dark afterwards.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is about a group of crazy demented lolis that secretly rule a town out in the country. In the cover of this anime it shows 4 of the girls secretly planning to torture you, light you on fire, leave you naked and bloody on the ground dead, hanging you, pushing you off a cliff, smiling creepily at you till you start to go insane and kill people, and a number of things. Anyways lets get to the actual opening of this review. 
 
This anime is a horror and a mystery. It has multiple arcs in it that eventually intertwine with each other. You will get multiple perspectives as each arc goes to a different loli and boy. The story goes that the town has a curse and that curse is enacted once a year during the festival.  I mainly want to talk about the characters because thats the best part, but I'll do this review in order anyway. 
 
STORY 7/10 
The story is a great setting for the arcs. The story in general is not all that creepy on the outside, but the more in-depth that you get, the more you want to wet your pants. 
 
ART 7/10 
The humor in this show is mainly done by the art. The funny faces along with the voices really make this show hilarious (when it is not being creepy loli mode) The fact that the girls change from funny loli to I'm going to kill everyone loli is quite breathtaking. 
 
SOUND 10/10 
I can't think of a single bad thing about the sound. The opening really sets the mood. All the other music helps establish the atmosphere well. It would not be a very good anime without this ost. The sound effects and the voices are well done as well: from laughing to laughing dementedly as you slash into someones arm. 
 
(Oh boy here it comes!) 
 
THE CHARACTERS!!! 10/10!!!!!!! 
Ok where to I begin, I suppose I will list them in the order in which this site has them listed in the ""Characters & Staff"" tab. 
 
Rika Furude 
 
-Probably the youngest loli (idk they all seem the same age minus body type) 
She cries niipah! When she is about to kill. Its a battle cry that causes you to lower your defences so she can attack. She is subtle in her approaches though because she doesn't have secret torture chambers, or hidden baseball bats to kill with. 
 
Satoko Houjou! 
 
-Perhaps the most annoying loli? 
-She cries on her freetime when she isn't trying to kill. She enjoys trapping humans and eating them for breakfast and then using the bones from them to make more traps and then eat them again. Its a never ending process. 
Pranking is another hobby of hers where she likes to taunt poor Keiichi until he comes at her with a baseball bat. She also likes to make Shion angry, she gets off when she is kicked alot. She has a special relationship with her brother that borders on the erotic. (just like all the other lolis apparently.) 
 
Keiichi Maebara 
 
-You can consider him the pimp of this loli town. 
-He spends his time prancing around in a maid costume and on some days he wears makeup. Usually in the form of cat whiskers, and eye shadow, but when he uses eye shadow he often gets confused and it becomes a mess. (watch first episode around 18:20 to 19:25) 
-Hes got some balls too. Keiichi is just something else. I think there is something wrong with him since it fails to realize the dangers that he puts himself in until its to late. Moving on: 
 
Rena Ryuuguu 
 
-Rena stands on telephone polls looking for something cute. When she shes something cute she screams KAWAIIIIIIIIII as she swoops down and picks it up, taking it home to her bus with her. 
-The creepiest thing about this girl is the way she views things that are cute, she automatically thinks she owns them and starts screaming, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME. Whenever I see this I'm like ""Can't you see shes a crazy loli!! run you stupid idiot! don't let her get you!!!"" But anyway, Rena is amazing because she lives in a bus in the dump. There she collects kawaii things that she gathers and puts them on display in her bus. In her bus she rocks back and forth in the fetal position screaming KAWAIIIIII while looking at her cute stolen objects. She is also very skilled with sharp blades. Moving on. 
 
Shion Sonozaki 
 
-She the one without the ponytail! 
-I figured that out about halfway in the show and it cleared alot of things up xD. Only to make it more confusing though, since the twins like to switch position with each other, anyway. 
-As far as hobbies go, she enjoys extreme manicures and torturing. By extreme I mean she polishes those things until they are gone (if you have seen the anime.... you know) By torturing I mean torturing herself and others. She is not very good with the elderly since she tends to ""accidentally"" kill them every time she gets her hands on them. This is a hard character to describe without spoiling things, but she might be the craziest loli. 
 
Mion Sonozaki 
 
-She is the other twin. 
 
Mamoru Akasaka 
 
-He is a legend since he is one of the few people to actually meet the lolis and live. He spends his days talking to little girls. 
 
Chie Rumiko 
 
-Who knows how many blind eyes this teacher has turned. 
 
Satoshi Houjou 
 
-The Nii-Nii of satoko. This young man hates his relatives and goes out of his way to either kill them or drive them crazy. He has a baseball bat license, which means he can buy various types of baseball bats to either crush, smash, or clobber people with. Its ok, hes licensed. He keeps this baseball bat at the school since he needs loli insurance. 
 
Teppei Houjou 
 
-He has good fashion sense 
 
Toshiki Inukai 
 
-He is in episode 14 
 
Irie Kyousuke 
 
-The doctor of the village. He has a crazy loli fetish for Satoko and takes pictures of her. Him and Rena would get along if they tried. 
 
Kasai Tatsuyoshi 
 
-This action hero is the James Bond of the village. He creeps around at night in his black suit and wear-all-the-time sunglasses to spy on the little girls. This would explain his extensive knowledge of each loli's lifestyle. He spends his free time watching Shion sleep. 
 
Kimiyoshi Kiishirou 
 
-He is actually asleep for the entirety of the anime. He fools people because he sleep talks and walks. You never see him open his eyes. 
 
Rina Mamiya 
 
-Poor lady gets herself involved with lolis 
 
Ooishi Kuraudo 
 
-This overweight police officer spends most of his time in the car eating. Since he is the oldest male that is not a geezer, it is safe to assume that his diet consists of the secret ingredient found in the people that are killed by lolis that keep you from reaching an age in which you start losing your fat. 
-The only reason he is named Ooishi is because he makes an Ooooo noise when he moves outside his car because he hates leaving his car (his food is in the car) and he hates the heat (because he has to much insulation). 
-His hobbies include talking to little girls and little boys, eating, introducing himself to Keiichi, and looking at dead bodies. 
 
Oryou Sonozaki 
 
-Gravity has been cruel to this poor woman's face. She worships demons at night and earth's gravity during the day. This why she is called Oni-baba (demon hag) 
 
Sonozaki Mom 
 
-She is the mother of the twins and perhaps the least interesting character in the show. 
 
Miyo Takano 
 
-She lights herself on fire on her free time. She also has a conspiracy complex in which she believes irrational theories are being plot against her. She lists them in her journal. 
 
Last but definitely not least there is Jirou Tomitake 
 
-This guy is my favorite character of all time. He has more deaths than Krillin and Yamcha combined. The first thing he does when he gets to the village is die. 
-As soon as I see him come on screen theres in a voice in my head screaming, run Jirou! you're going to be first! 
-Half way through the anime I find him quite comical, his lack of screentime and immediate death I think were meant to replace the lack of comedy later in the series, as things got really serious. 
-No one cares when he dies except for Keiichi, but Keiichi is paranoid and wears makeup and sometimes dresses as a maid, who cares what he thinks. 
-He dies alot. 
-He is listed in my favorite characters list because he is such a trooper. No matter how many times he dies, he will come back and try to take pictures again, making is feeble existence seem even more pathetic. He is also Ooishi's main diet since he dies first and Ooish needs food. 
 
ENJOYMENT 9/10 
 
It was crazy loli fun. 
 
OVERALL 8/10 
 
If you like a good horror, but do not mind the switching of arcs (because it can get kind of uninteresting seeing things repeated) this is an amazing anime for you. You do not know the definition of crazy loli until you watch this. 


          
 
       Helpful There are very few Anime Series I rate a 10. But this is one that I rate a +10. I absolutely adored this Series. It was 100% one of a kind. Blending Ultra-violence, Harem, Moe, Comedy, and other elements to make this one of the greatest Anime series ever made. There was NOTHING to complain about through this entire show. Yes there is Gore everywhere, but nonetheless.  This is a series I recommended watching before we die. OOOAAA!

12,304,88,6.201031035,Story between god and human,Aa! Megami-sama! Movie,"For centuries, a god named Celestin has been imprisoned on the moon for betraying the kingdom of Yggdrasil. Released by the fairy Morgan Le Fey, Celestin travels to Earth to reunite with his former pupil, the goddess Belldandy. Things go awry as Celestin erases Belldandy's memories of her boyfriend Keiichi and uses her as a catalyst to wreak havoc on Earth and Yggdrasil.  
","['Comedy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural']","The story takes place during the third spring since Belldandy's arrival. Celestin, a former mentor of Belldandy, is released by Morgan Le Fay, and erases all memories of Keiichi from Belldandy to use her as a virus to hack the Yggdrasil computer in the heavens.
Morgan le Fay heads to the Lunar Prison on the Moon and releases the seal. She is able to make contact with a small mask that reveals that they must unite for their common goal.
On Earth, it is the start of the New Year at Nekomi Institute of Technology, and various clubs seek to recruit new members. The Motor Club is one of them, and tries to lure new applicants with a display of the vehicles they race with, including the new two-seater Keiichi Morisato and Belldandy will be using in an upcoming race. Many new members initially join, including Morgan in human form. However, most of them are scared away by Toraichi Tamiya and Otaki Aoyama.
That night, while the club members celebrate, Keiichi inadvertently finds himself in a compromising situation with club member Hasegawa. Belldandy runs outside, with Keiichi in pursuit. When Keiichi catches up to her, she apologizes; Keiichi simply smiles and comments upon the arrival of spring. Comforted, Belldandy smiles back and tells him in a flurry of cherry blossoms that she hopes she can spend all of her springs with him. Celestin, a former mentor of Belldandy, then appears. Urd flies in and angrily orders Celestin to step away from Belldandy. Refusing to step away, he turns Belldandy around and gives her a kiss on the lips, whereupon Belldandy collapses, much to everyone's shock. Urd then attacks him with a lightning bolt, but he has disappeared. At the temple, Urd finds out that Belldandy has been infected with a virus. Peorth calls to inform Urd that Yggdrasil has also been compromised by the virus, and isolates The Heavens from Earth as a security measure until it is stopped, meaning that Belldandy cannot receive treatment until the matter is resolved.
When she finally regains consciousness, Belldandy can not recall memories of Keiichi, even though she can identify Skuld and Urd immediately. Urd recognizes the symptoms as selective amnesia and informs Keiichi that all of Belldandy's memories after their first encounter must have been sealed. Proving Urd's speculation, Belldandy informs Keiichi that she may grant him one wish. After Skuld reprimands him, Keiichi craftily wishes that Belldandy's memories be restored, but as Yggdrasil is down, Belldandy finds that she cannot process the request. Skuld attempts to restore Belldandy's memory with a number of inventions, but the most they do is remind Belldandy to give Keiichi her business card. Unable to find an immediate solution, Keiichi decides to accept the current situation for the moment, and try to live as normally as possible.
When the Motor Club is told about Belldandy's condition, they are shocked, but also concerned about their upcoming race; the competition is a mixed-gender race. When Sora declines the opportunity, Morgan offers to take Belldandy's place. Unsure about her skill, the club gives her a trial-run with Keiichi; seeing them ride the bike causes some traces of memory to return to Belldandy.
Up to this point, Keiichi has managed to remain surprisingly stoic despite Belldandy's condition. However, as he drives back to the temple that night at dangerously high speeds, he is so immersed in his troubles that he subconsciously expects Belldandy to aid him in making a sharp turn, without realizing that those memories remain locked and this almost causes an accident. Realizing Keiichi's guilt stirs something in Belldandy's heart, perhaps a faint reminder of the love they once shared.
When Belldandy accidentally uncovers a photo album filled with pictures of the two at the temple, she realizes just how deeply her amnesia has affected Keiichi. Realizing the recent emptiness in his smiles inspires Belldandy to get to know him better, starting by opting to remain as Keiichi's partner in the upcoming race despite her amnesia. When an irritated Morgan hears about Belldandy's renewed resolve, she challenges Keiichi and Belldandy to a race, teaming up with Megumi at Keiichi's request. Despite Morgan's best efforts however, they are no match for the two, and what's more, the experience apparently unlocks more of Belldandy's memories.
That night, Belldandy accidentally overhears a discussion between Keiichi and her sisters regarding Celestine's role in the current crisis. Realizing that Celestine erased her memories and inserted the virus, Belldandy stumbles out into the night, shocked and confused. Taking advantage of the situation, Celestine lures Belldandy away and when Urd arrives, he uses the virus to turn Belldandy against her elder sister in combat. Keiichi and Skuld's arrival causes a massive amount of uncontrollable energy from Belldandy as she struggles to reaffirm her sense of self, knocking out everyone in the vicinity. Successfully finding the side of her that she hid away after Celestine's betrayal allows her to safely dissipate the energy, though she faints in the process. Skuld wakes up to find the locality ravaged in the aftermath of the battlefield. When she spots Celestine calmly stepping down the stairs, she summons Noble Scarlet and angrily knocks Celestine with a thunderbolt into a screen, causing water to flood. Keiichi awakens just in time to notice the oncoming wave, and rushes to cover Belldandy, so that he will take the brunt of the blow for her. Belldandy awakens to find Keiichi comatose on the ground and hysterically tries to revive him.
Back at the temple, Belldandy comes to her senses, but her heart is uneasy and believes that she has only served to bring suffering to Keiichi. Skuld assures her that, regardless of present circumstances, in all of the friends they have made and all the experiences they have been through, Keiichi and Belldandy have weathered all with smiles. Reassured, Belldandy falls into Skuld's lap, sparking concern from her, but Urd assures her that Belldandy is merely exhausted from the battle.
When Keiichi walks into the empty Motor Club clubhouse alone the next morning, he finds Morgan bleeding on the stairway from the battle. Disregarding her attempts to decline, Keiichi insists that she come with him to the hospital wing. While he treats the wound on her arm, Morgan cryptically asks him whether he could love her, telling him that in the world that is coming Belldandy will belong to Celestine. Before he can reply, she forcibly kisses him; unbeknownst to them, Belldandy sees them through the door. Due in part to her upset over this (seeing Morgan and Keiichi kissing) Belldandy prepares herself to accept the vaccine, which will destroy the virus in her, at the risk of erasing all her memories. In coordination with Heaven, the ceremony of administering the vaccine commences, but something goes wrong.
The virus inside Belldandy has been using her as a Trojan horse; since Goddesses are connected to Yggdrasil, it was able to infect the main system through her, although without direct access it was only able to make slow progress. The Heavens made direct access with Belldandy to administer the vaccine, unwittingly allowing it even deeper into the system. More seriously, while usurping this direct link, the virus rewrites itself using the vaccine, turning itself into a program that bypasses all of Yggdrasil's security measures. Exploiting the direct link between Belldandy and Yggdrasill, Celestin hacks deep into the system mainframe, accessing an enigmatic program that to this point is referred to only as top-secret. He possesses Keiichi and pulls the program through Belldandy, incorporating it into the vaccine mandala. This creates an enormous magical field that swallows the temple and the surrounding forest. Three enormous tree trunks spiral from the ground into the sky, and a gargantuan being slowly materialized.
In Belldandy's past, Celestin, concerned that the Gods were not listening to the suffering of those of the lower worlds, tried to rise up against them, first by destroying the Gate of Judgment. Heaven's agents are sent against him, but Belldandy manages to stop them, protecting her mentor. More people are sent, and both are restrained. Celestin was sentenced to eternity in the Lunar Prison, while Belldandy's memories of the events were to be erased by Urd.
If Celestin destroys Yggdrasil and the entire Earth, a new Earth, free of suffering, will have to be created. The three Goddesses stand united against Celestin and Morgan, trying to stop them. Back in the Heavens, Peorth authorizes the use of Gungnir to stop Celestin. She launches the attack, but Belldandy manages to protect him at the last minute: they may be attacking Celestin, but it is Keiichi that would be killed. Keiichi then helps Belldandy block the attack by borrowing Celestin's power (with his permission). Realizing he was wrong, Celestin finally concedes, and releases Keiichi from his body.
Soon after, Belldandy, Keiichi and Morgan are transported to the Gate of Judgement. Having once lost her love when trying to pass this test of the Gods, Morgan warns the two to not pass through it, but they move forward, with complete confidence they will pass through safely and not be separated. Upon stepping through the gate, they return to Earth. As they return, Morgan tells them that she will stay and tell couples who come in the future the story of how they passed the test. The two return, but back in the Heavens, Yggdrasil is critically damaged. The three goddesses and their angels come together to sing and rapidly restore The World Tree, before dematerializing it. Finally by herself, Belldandy informs Keiichi that the virus deleted Yggdrasil's records, meaning that he is once again free to ask for any wish. Smiling softly, he replies, ""That's easy,"" sparking their love for one another once more. Up on a tree, Skuld wistfully wishes that she too will one day fall in love, just like Belldandy, only for Urd to state that she is a hundred years (then a million years, then a day) too young.
","As another installation to the Goddess's series, this film pulls off a lighthearted watching with some intriguing highlights. 
 
The Story::.. 
 
The film begins off the bat and I initially thought I was watching some visuals from Millennium Actress as a figure skitters across the moon's surface.  What an opening!  We see the usual characters and these are introduced very quickly before the main story gains momentum.  The first half seems to introduce a tangent universe where things between Keiichi and Belldandy might develop differently but despite the possibility of these two forging a new relationship, it focuses more on the detrimental effect of Belldandy's lost memories.  Ongoing persistence is gold dust though, for their relationship is well and truly addressed by the end of the film in a manner resembling the bitter sweetness of an age old fable of star crossed lovers. 
 
As the plot breaks loose we get to witness the symbiotic relationship between Yggdrasil and our world.  But it is also worth mentioning that a surprising working concept comes to light regarding the existence and inner workings of the Gods and Goddesses themselves, it's worth observing these nuances when they come and go. 
 
Art::.. 
 
Again you may be struck by the moon scene.  The film also gives us numerous chances to explore the scenery of the Gods' realm which is often strikingly beautiful in its magnificence and scale.  You will also find scenes involving intricate runes as well as some nicely integrated animation of the inner workings of Yggdrasil. 
 
Sound::.. 
 
I recall some aptly placed classical style music which lends this film some strength.  The music resembles that of much of the series without anything that stands apart. 
 
Character::.. 
 
A lot of credit goes to Celestin for providing a more Miyazaki-type villain, he tends towards both hero and villain, swinging often between the two.  He forms an interesting focal point for Belldandy's lack of resolve and raises some more interesting facets in Belldandy's personality.  We get to see a significant recount of Belldandy's past and learn of repressed memories which contrast with Belldandy's serene exterior.  Keiichi is agitated over Belldandy's state throughout but continues to show his best and most loved aspects.  Supporting from the sidelines, Urd and even Skuld get to flamboyantly show off great magical power in a couple of scenes.  Peorth shows sharp responses and leadership in an otherwise hopeless situation.  And the fact that the figure skittering across the lunar surface is from yet another realm shows that there is more to the series than simply Gods and Demons... 
 
Enjoyment::.. 
 
For experienced anime viewers you may well come across references and concepts which give this film some greater fascination than you'd otherwise expect.  For instance the Evangelion-esque monolith near the end resembling Sachiel serves its purpose well if you're familiar with that specific franchise.  This film combines the most enjoyable elements of the series; overdrive-magic, a variety of costumes, Tamiya and Otaki in questionable garments, romance and adventure spanning the two (three?) worlds. 
 
Overall::.. 
 
It's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the series and are particularly struck by the fated and star crossed love between Keiichi and Belldandy.  As it develops their relationship on a strong and colossal theme, this hints at a tale not merely confined to fantasy.  Man meets Goddess is what you see on the front cover.  What's weaved within?  A tale of love enduring for all time.

          
 
       Helpful My goodness, what an unfabulous piece of crap this was! This movie stunk, and I advise anyone with sense to avoid it.  
 
The romance is awfully cheesy and harem-y.  
 
The characters are bland and one-dimensional and totally predictable, especially those too brown-haired losers who are the so-called protagonists, t 
 
The sound was unimpressive, and the animation was average. It played out to me as one extensive episode, not a movie. Movies have a certain feel to them, and it was severely lacking in this so-called &quot;movie&quot;. 
 
It just wasn't exactly easy to follow if you hadn't seen the series, but you would get it immediately that the two main characters are in love, everyone else are side-kicks. That doesn't say much about how they work out the plot or anything about subtle nuances. Most of the drama was shoved in your face, and I can't say I enjoy anime that do that.  
 
One of the dumbest anime I ever had the misfortune of seeing; I was screaming, 'Ah! My poor brain!!' after watching it. 

          
 
       Helpful First off let's start with this. AMAZING movie! One of the best movies EVER! EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now that THAT'S outta the way, let's get on to my review :) 
 
Story: 
On a scale of 1-5, I give this a 10. Seriously. The story was so thought-out and well planned that you don't get bored for a second. It is always moving and you can't wait to find out what happens next. 
 
Art: 
This was made in 2000 so of course the art isn't going to be like what we see now-a-days in anime. The art looked like it was a mix between between the tv series and the OVAs. I give this a 7. 
 
Sound: 
I kinda wish they would've had a better background score for this. The background selections were nice to listen to, but I wouldn't listen to them without the movie. The ending song that the Goddesses sang wasn't that good and the ending theme wasn't all that amazing either. But they did pay a lot of attention to sound effects. 8 
 
Character: 
If you haven't seen at least the OVA or the first season, you will be uterly confused. Seriously. If you have though, then you are in for a treat. All of your favorite characters are back and get further developed and then the new characters come in and they get developed fully. 10 
 
Enjoyment: 
As I said earlier, I wasn't bored for a second of this.Well maybe a second every now and then, but not a lot. I give enjoyment a 10 
 
Overall: 
9. If the art and sound was better this would've gotten a perfect 10 from me, but really what anime does have a perfect 10? If you are familiar with the Ah! My Goddess franchise, or if you want a really good movie to watch, pick Ah! My Goddess: The Movie! It will NOT be a waste of your time ;)

One day she meets Buccha the talking cat, who says that she's Venus Pink, warrior of the goddess Aphrodite. Along with four other girls she has to fight with perverted Necros and four lords of Inma Empire, who want to revive the god of lust, Apollo, and turn the world into a sex pit. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Parody', 'Super Power', 'Hentai']",none,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW TOUCHES UPON STUFF THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18. 
 
For my first review of 2018, I shall touch upon Sailor Senshi Venus Five, or Venus 5...good fucking God. This 2 episode hentai OVA by Daiei is a shitty parody/rip-off of Sailor Moon, my favorite anime of all time (though I can recognize it's not perfect), though even on its own this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen, and it comes from Central Park Media, the company infamous for releasing a catalogue of shitty anime. Why, should you wonder? Well, since I'd like to get this over as quick as possible, I'll explain why, though it was really painful to watch. 
 
Story (2/10): The plot is basically five girls are summoned by a talking cat (been there, done that) to fight against an evil empire known as the Inma Empire, and they fight for the Goddess Aphrodite. What are the dastardly evil deeds that the Inma plan to do? Turn into the world....into a place for orgies, yes. Believe it or not, that's really all there is for the story, and if you've seen one episode, you've seen the other. They may have some plot points like trying to find the golden statue of Apollo or something but really, the only thing there really is to this is lots of sex and...rape. Is your stomach churning yet? This already sounds like a bad fanfiction from a fetish crazed basement dweller with no way to get a job or make a living. 
 
That's a problem I have with hentai stuff and such from what I've glimpsed of the genre: it's just sexual stuff over and over again and they don't add much of plots or anything to garner interest at all.  I'm not really a fan of hentai (I used to look at it sometimes but not anymore and nowadays sans looking at ""THE GREATEST ENGLISH DUB EVER"" parodying horrible hentai dubs, I think the genre itself is very bad, and I feel it could unwantingly distort perceptions of characters people may like), but if I had to do one I'd try to have it mostly be story driven with an actual story and tone down the naughtiness, but I digress, the story sucks, moving on. 
 
Art/Animation (2/10): The art and animation are piss poor for a 1994 OVA. The art style is very rough looking, proportions are slightly off, the character designs are rip-offs/uninspired copies of the Sailor Moon characters: Venus Pink/Hikari is Usagi/Sailor Moon, Venus Blue/Kiyomi is Ami/Sailor Mercury, Venus Red/Moyu is Rei/Sailor Mars, etc. Aphrodite and the other characters look uninspired and like they were taken from other fantasy anime. The animation, with the exception of the first set of transformations, is stiff, choppy and jerky, relies on speed line backgrounds, and they clearly cut corners when they could considering a lot of the movements don't look believable and clunky, and some action scenes/movement (like the Venus Crash kick) are just a single non-moving cell over speed lines, clearly budget saving costs. The Inma aliens/monsters for most of the villains are poorly designed, truly hideous and look like they were taken from a poorly done bootleg or Go Nagai wannabe anime rather than stuff like this. The backgrounds are noting to write home about, the colors are all washed out and faded the art/animation are just pathetic for an OVA. Sailor Moon S was out the same year as this, was a TV anime, and it looked hundreds of times better than this, along with Shin Cutey Honey, which was also an OVA and was amazingly animated too (plus it didn't rely on the below all the time). Oh My Goddess came out the year before and was spectacular looking too. 
 
If you love fanservice/porn, you're gonna LOVE it here. Everywhere there's naked bodies with full detail, nipples and genitals and sex scenes and body fluids galore, nude transformations that are inferior in terms of quality to Sailor Moon's and rip-offs (water/fire forming suits, Hikari getting butterfly wings). However, none of this is attractive looking because most of it just involves schoolgirls and young women getting raped by monsters, even the Venus 5, who are all 18/19(?

And one of the worst parts is, for a parody anime that's based on Sailor Moon, an anime which had excellent action scenes, there's literally only about 1-2% action in here, all of the fight scenes in both episodes are poorly animated, over in under five minutes total and not very exciting or engaging at all.

The animators clearly had too many fetishes to count. 
 
And they also tried to add in some annoying ""pause at the right moments"" thing in between certain scenes (explosions). 
 
In conclusion, you may need a bottle of Clorox Bleach when watching this. The only reason I have given it a 2/10 is because after all that, this STILL looks better than Sailor Moon Crystal, but that's not really saying much. At all. 
 
Sound (3/10): The voice performances are weak in both the Japanese and English version, no one's voice sounds like they suit the character (mostly with the Venus Five). Junko Asami (Sayako from the Oh My Goddess OVA, and the only recognizable VA here), who seems to be a well known hentai actress, is wasted as Hikari, and doesn't sound like she's into the role, like the other VAs (though I can't blame them). The English dub is like a lot of dubs, particularly hentai ones: cheap, horrible Japanese name pronunciations, stilted, awkward performances, though the actors were given shitty material to work with but entirely laughable and able to give a few chuckles. The music is forgettable and the ending song is mediocre. 
 
Character (2/10): I couldn't care about any of the characters here because the anime didn't give me a reason to. Most of them were just parodies/rip-offs of their Sailor Moon counterparts anyways, the only one I almost liked was Aphrodite but she still failed to convince me as likable. 
 
Enjoyment (1/10): I couldn't even watch both episodes all the way because I was so disgusted and sick by a lot of the content of what is going on. I am not a feminist, but there is something I will say once, but not again: RAPE IS NOT ATTRACTIVE NOR SEXY. That is the biggest thing that turned me off (and I'm sure a lot of others) of this, stuff like that is Dormcat, the Encyclopedia editor of Anime News Network, was right in what he said, if you're going to do any adult anime like this, like he said, quote, sex should be an enjoyable experience, not meaningless raping. Doing the latter just makes it look immature, childish, tasteless, offensive and repulsive, no matter what the gender, and it makes the director look immature and tasteless. The only people who would probably enjoy this would be repulsive sick in the mentally ill head scumbags who enjoy seeing girls/women get violated by weird crazy ass beasts, and probably wanna touch some women wrongly themselves, go to a shrink to fix your fucked up heads. 
 
Not to mention, a lot of the other humor in the show just is not funny at all. I didn't even crack a smile nor giggle at anything I saw, and I'm usually an easy/nervous laugher. And when you've got an unfunny anime that has no likable characters, bad art/animation, nonexistent story, and you're wondering what you're doing with time you'll never get back and wish you would have done something else. While there are horrid anime out there you'd want to finish no matter, what, this is an example of an anime that makes you wish you NEVER saw an anime in your life at all... 
 
Overall (1/10): Venus 5 is a dismal, abysmal, unattractive, repulsive, MISERABLE anime. All I'm going to say is, unless you have biastophilia or you need to see anything that parodies or resembles/rips off Sailor Moon, avoid, avoid, and avoid!! 
 
Good night, and let's hope I don't have to review any other anime like this...

          
 
       Helpful WARNING: THIS REVIEW TOUCHES UPON STUFF THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18. 
 
For my first review of 2018, I shall touch upon Sailor Senshi Venus Five, or Venus 5...good fucking God. This 2 episode hentai OVA by Daiei is a shitty parody/rip-off of Sailor Moon, my favorite anime of all time (though I can recognize it's not perfect), though even on its own this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen, and it comes from Central Park Media, the company infamous for releasing a catalogue of shitty anime. Why, should you wonder? Well, since I'd like to get this over as quick as possible, I'll explain why, though it was really painful to watch. 
 
Story (2/10): The plot is basically five girls are summoned by a talking cat (been there, done that) to fight against an evil empire known as the Inma Empire, and they fight for the Goddess Aphrodite. What are the dastardly evil deeds that the Inma plan to do? Turn into the world....into a place for orgies, yes. Believe it or not, that's really all there is for the story, and if you've seen one episode, you've seen the other. They may have some plot points like trying to find the golden statue of Apollo or something but really, the only thing there really is to this is lots of sex and...rape. Is your stomach churning yet? This already sounds like a bad fanfiction from a fetish crazed basement dweller with no way to get a job or make a living. 
 
That's a problem I have with hentai stuff and such from what I've glimpsed of the genre: it's just sexual stuff over and over again and they don't add much of plots or anything to garner interest at all.  I'm not really a fan of hentai (I used to look at it sometimes but not anymore and nowadays sans looking at ""THE GREATEST ENGLISH DUB EVER"" parodying horrible hentai dubs, I think the genre itself is very bad, and I feel it could unwantingly distort perceptions of characters people may like), but if I had to do one I'd try to have it mostly be story driven with an actual story and tone down the naughtiness, but I digress, the story sucks, moving on. 
 
Art/Animation (2/10): The art and animation are piss poor for a 1994 OVA. The art style is very rough looking, proportions are slightly off, the character designs are rip-offs/uninspired copies of the Sailor Moon characters: Venus Pink/Hikari is Usagi/Sailor Moon, Venus Blue/Kiyomi is Ami/Sailor Mercury, Venus Red/Moyu is Rei/Sailor Mars, etc. Aphrodite and the other characters look uninspired and like they were taken from other fantasy anime. The animation, with the exception of the first set of transformations, is stiff, choppy and jerky, relies on speed line backgrounds, and they clearly cut corners when they could considering a lot of the movements don't look believable and clunky, and some action scenes/movement (like the Venus Crash kick) are just a single non-moving cell over speed lines, clearly budget saving costs. The Inma aliens/monsters for most of the villains are poorly designed, truly hideous and look like they were taken from a poorly done bootleg or Go Nagai wannabe anime rather than stuff like this. The backgrounds are noting to write home about, the colors are all washed out and faded the art/animation are just pathetic for an OVA. Sailor Moon S was out the same year as this, was a TV anime, and it looked hundreds of times better than this, along with Shin Cutey Honey, which was also an OVA and was amazingly animated too (plus it didn't rely on the below all the time). Oh My Goddess came out the year before and was spectacular looking too. 
 
If you love fanservice/porn, you're gonna LOVE it here. Everywhere there's naked bodies with full detail, nipples and genitals and sex scenes and body fluids galore, nude transformations that are inferior in terms of quality to Sailor Moon's and rip-offs (water/fire forming suits, Hikari getting butterfly wings). However, none of this is attractive looking because most of it just involves schoolgirls and young women getting raped by monsters, even the Venus 5, who are all 18/19(? I'm guessing 18 as 19 year old college students do not wear seifuku uniforms), end up getting stripped against their will, ending up in all sorts of BDSM situations or sexually assaulted. Ugh. I like fanart of naked women but not when they end up like this, the Atari 2600 porn games (minus a certain one) looked more appealing to the eyes.

12,2321,90,6.136208905,Story between god and human,Giant Robo the Animation: Chikyuu ga Seishi Suru Hi,"In a future to come humanity enjoys a new age of prosperity thanks to Dr. Shizuma's invention of a revolutionary renewable energy source: the Shizuma Drive. But this peace is threatened by Big Fire, a cabal seeking world domination. Against Big Fire the International Police Organisation dispatches a collection of superpowered warriors and martial artists, together with Daisaku Kusama, inheritor and master of Earth's most powerful robot, Giant Robo.  
 
By capturing an abnormal Shizuma Drive which is essential to Big Fire's plans the IPO ignites a desperate conflict between the two groups. The coming battle will test Daisaku's resolve to the utmost, reveal the ghastly truth behind the creation of the Shizuma Drive, and bring human civilization to its knees! 
 
Giant Robo is a character-driven adventure in a retro-futuristic setting, drawing on influences from opera, kung-fu cinema, wuxia stories and classic mecha anime. It incorporates characters from the works of the manga author Mitsuteru Yokoyama but it is designed to be a stand-alone story.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","
","Story - 10/10 
The events take place in the near future, ten years after the advent of the Shizuma Drive triggers the third energy revolution. The series follows the master of the titular Robo, Daisaku Kusama, and the Experts of Justice, an international police organization locked in battle with the Big Fire (BF) Group, a secret society hell-bent on world domination. 
 
Art/Animation - 10/10 
Started in 1992 and finished in 1998, Giant Robo's animation is just absolutely amazing. For being made in the 1990's, it felt like it was made just in the last year. It's some of the most beautiful and clean animation I've ever seen from the 1990's.  
 
Sound - 10/10 
Giant Robo's music/sound was composed, arranged and conducted by Japanese Academy Award nominee Masamichi Amano and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir. The music ranges from grand pieces to more light-hearted tracks. The music of Giant Robo has been called one of animation's crowning achievements. 
 
Character - 10/10 
You'll fall in love, I guarantee it, with many of the characters and the noble heroism they bring to Giant Robo. You'll fall in love with the heroes of the Experts of Justice or the villains of the Big Fire Organization. All of them are likable. Giant Robo is considered to be a character drama, as each episode passes, you'll fall deeper and deeper into the character's depth. 
 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
Giant Robo is considered one of the true classics of anime. With each episode varied in time(35-60 minutes each), each episode is like a movie, it sounds and feels like one. It's over-the-top action and adventure will leaving you grinning cheek to cheek. It was so over-the-top, those who watch the last episode after watching the first six, have known to spontaneously combust - it's that good and enjoyable! 
 
Overall, I give this a 10/10. This is a must-own to any and all anime fans. Truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 

          
 
       Helpful I remember watching the first episode of the OVA back when I was a kid, and I always wanted to finish the special but never had a chance to up until now. Giant robo is a special kind of anime that is like no other because it's based off of a 60's manga. This klind of classic doesn't get the attention it deserves so I intend to share my experience with others in hopes of having more people recognize this great anime. 
 
Story: The anime shoves it's plot down your throat consistently throughout the entire anime, which is sort of a bad thing. While the story is epic in proportions and has a drama and intensity of greek theater, the plot is riddled with holes and inconsistencies that plague the anime from about the middle to the end. What's charming is that it never fails to make the audience want to care and understand the world in which the protagonists and antagonists live in; and because of this it keeps the story enjoyable because it's bad plot doesn't take away from the story told. 
 
Art & Sound: By far the strongest aspect of the anime. It's production value is INSANELY high. The original score is absolutely fantastic  and the animation is top notch. The art style is much like astro boy or the more recent kikaider with an older, more traditional anime character design as in the 60's and 70's manga and animation. It's a nice change of pace from the huge eyes and pointy colorful hair. Also, the English dub is AWESOME. The quality of the English dubs in this OVA were spectacular! Never were there lines lost in translation and nothing sounded off and strange, it was just perfectly suiting for the anime. The main characters had a great cast that had enthusiasm and voices to match their respective characters. 
 
Overall: While the anime struggles to deliver a good plot for the audience, it doesn't fail to present to us a beautiful story told with great animation, sound, and character design. While it has many flaws, there was never a dull moment watching this long OVA. Every minute you spend, regardless the good or the bad were enjoyed because the anime is incredibly enjoyable to watch. 
 
It's a flawed masterpiece.

          
 
       Helpful A great tribute for the late Mitsuteru Yokoyama, Giant Robo is a show that revives classic characters and puts them in an interesting storyline that includes elements of science fiction and even fantasy. 
 
The animation in Giant Robo is gorgeous, which is expected from its production values. Anyone who enjoys good old fashioned cel animation can expect some of the highest quality. 
 
The sound and music department is another element where the series excels. Classical styled music and even a little opera are used to fill up you with excitement or pull out tears from your eyes during its dramatic moments. 
 
The story is an epic and coming of age tale of its main character, Daisaku. However, one can become overwhelmed by the number of characters and their involvement in the plot as well as the many mysteries that are slowly resolved or dragged on through the story. Its also inconclusive as the project for the series could not be sustaind any further, ending it abruptly. 
 
Given opportunity, Giant Robo can be a highly enjoyable experience. Especially for fans of the mecha and scienfe fiction genres as well as seasoned manga readers who may recognize elements that inspired this project.

12,10259,91,6.126742445,Story between god and human,Da Yu Hai Tang (Movie),"In an old mythical world, there reside spirit-like beings who oversee the natural order of the mortal realm. One of them, a young girl named Chun, has just come of age and must undergo her rite of passage by experiencing the human world for herself. While there, she gets caught in a fishing net during a storm and is rescued by a human boy. 
 
However, the boy ends up drowning during the incident, and Chun returns to her realm full of guilt. Afterwards, she meets the Soul Keeper and decides to revive the boy in exchange for a part of her lifespan. Little does she know, meddling with the natural order of the world has severe consequences. 
 
 Da Yu Hai Tang  is a story about sacrifice and redemption as Chun comes to terms with the limitations of her powers and deals with death, love, and her own emotions. She must decide if she will sacrifice everything to save the human boy or forsake her moral obligation for the order of the world. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Romance']","In a mystical realm that exists beneath the human world, populated by magical-powered beings, a girl named Chun participates in a coming-of-age ritual where she is transported through a portal of water to experience the human world in the form of a red dolphin. There, she encounters a human boy who lives by the sea and reveres aquatic creatures. During a storm, Chun is tangled in a fishing net near the boy's house, and the boy drowns while freeing her from the net. Chun returns to her world, taking the boy's ocarina with her.
Chun bargains with the Soul Keeper, a resident of her world who collects virtuous departed souls from the human world, to return the boy to life. The Soul Keeper takes half of her lifespan in exchange for giving her the boy's soul, which has manifested in this world in the form of a baby dolphin. She advises her that she must nurture the dolphin to adulthood in order to return the boy's soul to the human world. Qiu, Chun's childhood friend, discovers her undertaking; since beings from the human world are forbidden, he promises to help her keep her task secret. Together, they name the dolphin Kun, after a massive fish of legend.
Chun's mother soon finds Kun and throws him into the sewer. While searching for Kun, Chun and Qiu meet the rat matron, who collects the souls of sinners from the human world, which manifest in the form of rats. She takes an interest in the dolphin and summons her rats to recover him from the sewer.
Later, Chun and Qiu manage to take Kun away before he is narrowly discovered by the villagers. In their search for a new home for the dolphin, Qiu is bitten by a two-headed snake. Chun's grandfather draws the venom into his own body to save Qiu's life. Before succumbing to the venom, he confides in her that he will support her in her task even in death. After his passing, his soul manifests in the form of a begonia tree.
As Chun's world begins to experience unnatural torrential rains and snowfall, her family and the local elders realize that Kun's continued presence has caused these phenomena. One night, after Chun confesses to Qiu that she traded away half her lifespan, Qiu receives a warning from the rat matron to hide Kun. He puts Kun in a frozen lake in order to save Chun from further persecution, but Chun dives in after Kun. The rat matron summons her rats to recover Chun and Kun from the icy water, and takes the ocarina from Chun, planning to use it to secure her own passage to the human world.
As Chun continues to watch over Kun, Qiu visits the Soul Keeper to bargain his own life for the return of Chun's. The Soul Keeper demands his entire lifespan as payment, while warning that Chun will still die regardless when Kun returns to the human world. The Soul Keeper reveals to Qiu how to save Chun from this fate.
The residents of Chun's world gather to kill Kun and avert further calamity. Qiu arrives and performs the ritual to open a portal to the human world, but Kun is unable to swim through it, while the rat matron arrives and uses the ocarina to pass through the portal. Holes in the sky begin to open uncontrollably, flooding Chun's world with sea water from the human world.
Chun is reminded that her actions to save Kun are dooming the people of her own world; she tries to help them evacuate from the flood, but is spurned by all, including her mother. As a last resort, Chun sacrifices herself, merging her body with her grandfather's begonia tree to grow it to colossal proportions, plugging the holes in the sky and saving everyone from the flood.
Kun breaks a branch off the begonia tree and brings it to the Soul Keeper, who restores Chun to life from it. She sets her on a pilgrimage to return Kun to his world; along the way, they find Qiu, who joins them. Qiu asks her whether she would like to live in the human world herself, but, overwhelmed with regret in knowing they are spending their last night together, is unable to express his feelings for her.
The next day, Chun bids Kun farewell as Qiu opens one last portal for his return. At the same time, Qiu, following the Soul Keeper's instructions, casts a spell that will send Chun to the human world while killing him by setting him on magical fire. As Qiu burns away, he tells Chun to think of him whenever she sees the wind and rain and he'll be with her always. Chun is transformed into a red dolphin, allowing her to follow Kun through the portal.
On a seashore in the human world, Kun and Chun wash ashore in their human forms. As Kun regains consciousness, he sees Chun holding out her hand to him.
In a mid-credits scene, the Soul Keeper restores Qiu to life from his ashes and declares Qiu her successor, revealing the true cost of Qiu's sacrifice for Chun.
","Overall, I found the movie to be a bit slow and boring, and I was more sold on the b-plot than the main story. Conflicts/plot points could've been brought out more, as the viewer I felt very little suspense. 
 
The visuals and sound fell flat for me too. I sorta felt like I was just floating through, not really engaged. I really can not find any artistic value in this. 
 
For me, what I enjoyed about the movie was the believable characters and the moral/thematic takeaways. I'll be forgetting everything else. The story overall and the ending stood out, but the experience could've been made a lot better.

          
 
       Helpful It took me almost a year to realize that this title is not Japanese but Chinese. The realization hit me just when I was preparing to watch it. I thought,""A Chinese anime movie? Why not! This is gonna be interesting."" I had my doubts. I also had my hopes. But it all stabilized when the story ha started. Trust me! This movie is worth it. 
 
     For all the lovers of mythical worlds and magic, this is a very good choice. It's not even on earth to begin with. It's about sacrifice and noble feelings. The magnificence of the animation adds to the story. It's this kind of movie that sweeps you off your feet and flies away. Epic, that's the word. 
 
     I'm not gonna say anything about the story. I will leave that to you. I'm gonna speak about the art. It's modern art but not that kind of modern that leaves you the anime was made in the 90s. It's something like Kotonoha no Niwa and Kimi no Na wa, so the colors are vibrant and the movement is smooth. To complete the legendary image, the music comes to support the scenes with the right tunes. 
 
It's a shame that this movie isn't popular, so give it a try and invite others to watch it. Enjoy.

       Helpful The first thing I should mention about BIG FISH AND BEGONIA is that it is visually stunning. I do not recall seeing many Chinese animated productions (although I wouldn't be surprised if I had inadvertently stumbled upon one without realizing it), but this is one of the most visually impressive I've seen from the country. Like a magnet, it seduces you from the first frame and keeps you entranced for all 100 minutes. In a way, this film reminded me a bit of Laika's recent KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS. That film, while not a tightly plotted story, was nonetheless so visually stimulating that one could not help but be glued to their seats throughout. BIG FISH is the same way. 
 
Describing the plot, it's sort of a mixing pot of THE LITTLE MERMAID with shades of SPIRITED AWAY and Chinese mythology. Basically, this film imagines an ""alternate world"" way beneath the ocean -- a sort of mythological Chinese flavored kingdom whose inhabitants are some sort of humanoid ""spirits"" with powers who are responsible for guarding the balance of nature. One of its residents, 16-year-old Chun, participates in a sort of ""coming of age"" ceremony, in which she is transformed into a crimson colored dolphin and swims to the surface world. Here she comes face to face with a human boy and his little sister. But the visit turns tragic when she is trapped in a fisherman's net. The boy courageously rescues her, only to drown. Feeling responsible, Chun travels beyond the boundaries of her village to some sort of one-eyed demon (Lingpo, the Lady of Souls), where she strikes a Faustian bargain. The boy will be reborn as a dolphin, whom she will have to tame and grow until he is old enough to return to hid world. But the price is two-fold. First, she must give up half of her life force to revive the boy in question (whom she names Kun), and whatever pain he receives, she'll receive too. The second and more dangerous outcome involves unnatural disasters such as rainstorms, maelstroms, and even snow which threaten to destroy her world's existence. Only her closest friend Qiu, who secretly harbors a crush on her, might be able to set things right. 
 
As mentioned, BIG FISH AND BEGONIA is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The film is also rich with metaphorical imagery, particularly when talking about matters such as life and death. In one scene, for instance, when an old man dies, he is reborn as a tree. His similarly deceased wife, incidentally, is some sort of peacock who comes to rest on the tree in question. In terms of character development, BIG FISH AND BEGONIA isn't very heavy on it, but Qiu, oddly enough, emerges as the most interesting of the characters. When we first meet him he appears to be somewhat mischievous and playful. But he also has a very serious dedicated side to him, and ultimately goes to great lengths to help the person dearest to him. The rest of the cast don't stand out as much, but with the possible exception of one fairly negligible potential baddie (who lives in a rat-infested sewer), nobody comes across as truly unsympathetic. Only issue is that there are a plethora of minor characters who only have about five minutes of screentime, to the point where we don't get to know them as well, but that's my only issue. 
 
The dub by Studiopolis is well done for the most part, with no noticeably bad performances, although I DID detect some mistimed lines at least in the first half hour -- I do find it jarring to see a character's mouth start flapping only for no sound to come out until the second one, and this unfortunately sometimes happens in the beginning. Thankfully, this problem disappears in the second half, and other than that, as mentioned, everyone plays their roles well. Stephanie Sheh and Johnny Yong Bosch, in particular, do great turns as the lead characters, Chun and Qiu, respectively. 
 
Perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it is more visual poetry rather than a cohesive plot, but it also offers a sincere heart that somehow manages to win the viewer over. The ending is also bittersweet and will surely wrench tears. (I know I was crying toward the end!) Directors Lian Xuan and Zhang Chun spent more than 12 years(!) working on this film, most of it being a series of starts and stops. According to the making-of-featurette, this film started off as a wildly successful 7 minute short made in Flash, but acquiring funds for expanding it into a feature proved problematic, and nearly disbanded the animation studio B & J. So what saved the day? Crowdfunding, that's what. The amount of interest from said crowdfunds prompted a Chinese distributor to take a chance and fund the film. Xuan and Chun's lengthy labor of love was greatly rewarded: the film was a smash hit in China, the second most successful animated film over there 
 
I wouldn't say this movie reaches the echelons of say, Studio Ghibil, but it doesn't have to. If you're an animation fan and want to see something this breathtaking and emotional, you can't go wrong with this one. Every second of it will have you nailed to your seat.

","Well, this is my first review so please bear with me.  
First, I must say i wasn't expecting much of this series, because i read some reviews and it seemed so-so. However I still decided to give it a try, and i must say i was kinda disappointed. Not because the series is totally bad, but after watching the first episode i was kinda hopeful that it could turn into an interesting story, however that's it.  
 
STORY (5/10)  
The story itself is not bad, it had a lot of potential, its a shame it wasn't take advantage of. It all starts with a girl and her two male friends being taken to another land/world. Nothing new in this kind of series really. A demon summoned her, and the world was in danger of being destroyed. Good vs Evil ...  
The story starts with a good pace, in the first couple of episodes you kinda enjoy it and wanna see what happens next. But along the way, it all blows up. The ups and downs are all very predictable, there's a lot of things which are not explained and dont make sense, at all. It just turn into a cliche plot. They rush everything... 
 
Art (7/10)  
This is actually one of the good points of the show. Having in account the year it was made it has nice and clear animation and art. Lots of colour and different faces. And the boys, one or two kinda remember girls sometimes. 
 
Sound ( 7/10)  
Another good thing. I actually enjoyed this. You see, for me a great part of liking series is about the sound and how it connects us with the moments and the characters. It kinda helps us understand what they feel.  And in this, there's no fail. Good soundtracks that go well this each moment, both happy and sad. Challenging or wtv. 
 
Characters (6/10) 
Its not bad, but it could be better. Like i said before, they rush with the story... The bonds and feelings of the characters could be well developed but they didnt really bother... Its true that they take some time to show and talk about the past of some of them, but its unbalanced. Some have more references than others. And the connections between them, just seem so shalow sometimes. For example, Akane and the other 8. So many interaction between some and the others are just left out. And Shimon and Tenma. They are supposed to be the closest to her, but Shimon is always hidden and Tenma is doing god knows what. And Akane, no missing home, family, friends... like wtf? She's taken to another world against her own will and doesn't even bother thinking how other people might be. She falls in love with the demon that summoned her basically at first sight... and attention. She didnt even saw his face.  
 
Enjoyment  (6/10)  
Once again, not good not bad. Could have enjoyed a lot more, but the plot itself wasnt original. Too similar to Fushigi Yuugi, and i love FY so it makes it kinda hard. Too rushed, lacks deepness. 
 
Overall ( 6/10)  
Just because i didnt adore it, doesnt mean that you guys wont. It is worth a try... If you want something too pass time and you may be willing to watch this series.  


          
 
       Helpful Harukanaru Toki takes place in a capital called Kyou - it is of another dimension and 3 teenagers from the present are summoned there.  One of them is a girl named Akane who is the dragon priestess and basically the storyline focuses on her fighting the demons with the aid of the Hachiyou - 8 sworn protectors of the priestess - to save the world. 
 
I have to admit, I started watching this because I loved Saiunkoku Monogatari and someone said that this one was similar.  At first, the story wasn\'t that engaging and seemed to be a hodgepodge of different anime stories, characters and plots.  However, the music is absolutely amazing so I kept on watching and AM I GLAD THAT I DID.   
 
As the story progresses and characters are discovered, it becomes absolutely engaging.  The initial efforts to discover the Hachiyou was good but the development of the Hachiyou - heaven and earth of the four divinations - is super fantastic.  The anime slowly and surely builds up momentum.  If you can hold yourself through the first couple episodes, it will definitely be worth it!!

          
 
       Helpful -INTRODUCTION- 
 
The very first time I encountered the world of HaruToki was when I saw the live performance of one of Akuram's character songs (Nisshoku no Kagiana), performed by his seiyuu Okiayu Ry?tar?. I became curious and researched Akuram, but sadly could not find any pictures of him without the mask. After many days of searching, I finally found a scan that showed his face, and was awed to say the least. That eventually led me to become even more interested in the anime, and even though I only heard rather bad things about it, I will never regret that I watched it and I'll make sure to watch it again. 
 
-STORY- 7/10 
 
""No matter how beautiful or kind, you must never let a demon into your heart."" 
 
This is definitely not the most original plotline. A normal high school girl gets pulled into a different world, and has to fight the evil while being surrounded by a male harem... at first, sounds very familiar to many other plots. The reason is that HaruToki is based on a dating game, and this fact cannot be disregarded when judging the anime. Personally, I don't think I can name more than a couple romantic simulators with a strong plot. In fact, a romantic simulator has no need for a deep plot. Because its true strength lies in a different category -- the characters. 
 
-CHARACTERS- 10/10 
 
Romantic simulators (and anything based on them) are all about characters; if it doesn't get full marks in this category, it immediately fails in this genre. However, HaruToki does not fail, in fact it passes with flying colors. It is a collection of many unique individuals, each with their own inner troubles, dreams, reasons, and weaknesses. Each of the Hachiyou get an episode or two to themselves, to let the viewer look a little deeper into their past and their hearts, to understand them better. Not only the eight guardians. The Oni leader Akuram with his eternal hatred toward humans, as well as his loyal subordinates; the seemingly strong yet vulnerable princess Fuji; the proud little Tengu of the North Mountains... There is not a single dull personality in this anime; if there is anything I enjoyed the most while watching it, then it definitely is the variety of characters. 
 
-ART/ANIMATION- 9/10 
 
The original characters designs are amazing, all of them. You might have expected the creators to focus mostly on the eight guardiands, HaruToki being a dating game for girls and all, but this is not the case. Each design is unique and beautiful, for both main and minor characters. The clothes designs are especially lovely. 
 
The transition into anime was good too, but somehow did not deliver that same feeling of being completely in awe before something truly beautiful. It's understandable that the anime version had to be modified and maybe simplified to an extent, but I still believe that there is room for improvement. However, that does not change the fact that the anime adaptation was nontheless great, and some of the scenes were truly stunning. 
 
-SOUND- 10/10 
 
My personal opinion is that HaruToki has one of the best soundtracks ever. There is probably not a single scene in this series that is not accompanied by music. Not just any music, but beautiful music that greatly increases the emotional level of the overall situation. Even while listening to the soundtrack separately, it's impossible not to recall the events that went with it. 
 
Aside from the instrumental pieces, there are also many character songs -- songs performed from the characters' point of view by their respective seiyuu. Usually, these are released outside of the anime as separate singles or albums. In the case of HaruToki, however, those songs were a moderate part of the story. They appeared during the most crucial moments of the anime to intensify the atmosphere, and most of them talked about the characters' inner thoughts and feelings that would have been left unspoken otherwise. 
 
--- 
 
This is the kind of anime that you must really judge as something individual. If you plan to compare and contrast HaruToki with other reverse harem series, then I suggest you walk away from it right now -- chances are, you simply won't enjoy it.

(Source: MU)","['Mystery', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']",none,"I was originally going to write a review after it had finished but seeing such low ratings i decided to write one now. 
 
Every season there is an anime that is completely underrated and gets ignored by majority of the viewers. for me Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin is that show for this season. 
 
STORY/Charachters: 8 
The story has been pretty interesting so far, i cant really think of anything too negative about it. Every episode the crew has a new challenge/Adventure to deal with, The characters alone are all pretty interesting and unique. Every new episode a new character is introduced which is equally as interesting as the rest. So far its been a perfect balance of both seriousness and comedy. The mood is pretty light and does get intense sometimes.The story isn't really that intense or serious (atleast so far) since there are lot of things we still are not aware of which i hope we learn about in the upcoming episodes, such as the back stories of each character. Seeing Arata learn more and more about his ancestor and meet old Anothers that knew Seimei is pretty interesting.  
 
ART/Sound: 10 
Both the OP and ED are nice and somewhat catchy. The BGM though, is completely in sync with every scene. Each scene is perfectly represented by the music that suits it the most. The character designs are also done pretty nicely and each character is designed to loom unique in their own way. 
 
Overall: 9 
Honestly, the show isn't bad at all. I am actually a bit surprised as to why is has such a low rating. I would say its definitely worth the watch.

          
 
       Helpful With the abysmal number of people watching this series, it's SOOO easy to forget that this anime ever existed in the eyes of potent men, at least it was for me anyways. I really also find it hard to understand why this series GOT a green light, because, more than the manga (translated) adaptation that doesn't exist (as of this review and probably forever), I hardly doubt that even the Japanese people watching this would be happy about this. 
 
However and anywho, the crux to this series is about a new working-adult recruit called Miyako Arata. He is assigned to the Nighttime Regional Relations Department squad in Shinjuku, of which, each of Tokyo's 23 wards has departments like this, founded to mitigate paranormal and occult-related events. Unbeknownst to anyone, Arata's special skill is the Ears of Sand, which translates to the understanding of non-human speech, and through mythical Yokai creatures, many say that Arata is the Heian-era exorcist, Abe no Seimei, resurrected in spirit. 
 
And that's the story overall, because we only get to watch and listen Arata's special skills as one that we wished to have if we could have a superpower of sorts. Plus, his interaction with the Shinjuku crew and the never-ending groups of Yokai that revere the Seimei spirit into reconciliation, just like a Yokai councilor. Needless to say, you can easily pass by the episodes with a nap, as it doesn't really try to engage with the audience well with its overarching episodic story lines. 
 
The character count doesn't pay too well-off either. Seo Himezuka and Kyouichi Sakaki, the 2-man crew that has been in the job more than Arata doesn't strike off as redundant or useful (depending on their help to Miyako), but foremostly being assistants to helping solve daily crimes that involve Yokai, and often the 3-man crew are able to get by nicely. Even through the progression in this series of Arata meeting the mischievous Aztec god Huehuecoyotl and working together with misunderstanding colleagues from the various wards, and Sakaki saving his family member, that ""meh"" experience stays stagnant, as if there isn't any story nor character development to try to take advantage of to establish a base to the anime. Nein, I say. 
 
Liden Films' art and animation is getting much worse, but thankfully it doesn't detract from the watching experience that is this and last season's Mahou Shoujo Tokushusen Asuka, which is plenty fine for its target demographics. Trying to play on the available budget offered is a good advantage, but if this is all it has to offer, I would still gladly watch it. 
 
Musicality-wise, Evan Call is back to do the music for this series, and I can only really say it's one of the more mellow music soundtracks (as opposed to Violet Evergarden), but more action-y type of music. Both the OP and ED, performed by the characters themselves (Arata for the OP and Huehuecoyotl for the ED) fit the premise for the occult-feelings of the anime to a T. Not the greatest sounding, but not bad either. 
 
Overall, this anime just reeks stagnancy for me. All the while I try to watch this with an open mind that it will eventually get better, it instead went onto an entirely different route that hopes the aesthetics will somehow make up the difference in viewership. And it honestly never did. 
And I'm finally done watching this show, on with the OVAs later in the year!

          
 
       Helpful I think that this anime is underaprraciated. I sort of understand why. No heavy drama, no quick action, no dire danger, meaning: no shonen elements. It is the only one that I know, that very vividly tried to create shojo out of shonen material (theme/subject, location, characters are good for police/shonen/action genre). And they suceeded. The story is whimsical, a bit emotion driven, a bit dreamy and romantic in a sense, although you will not find romance in here (phew, I hate romance). It also concerns the matter of interpersonal connection  
I would say that this has something in common with youkai apartment. You will see a group of characters dealing with supernatural beings in realistic way - meaning - not blasting them into smithreens, (so far) not war zone story, but confirming that the youkai/demon/devil/whatever is behind a case. And what do you do with devil/angel and other beings? Put them in prison? Get them on trial? No, you do exactly what you would do in this situation: get back the loot/kidnapped person, convince or ditrsct the culprit nad go your own way.  Story does have subtle undercurrent of danger, becouse we are dealing with  beings on different level, without common ground as far as common sense goes. And ones that can do anything to you. 
There is no war between human and supernatural world.

","The first thing you need to know, a lot of filler episodes. I could see a lot of people dropping the anime after about 10 episodes, but the story offers something very new and refreshing which is odd given the year it was made. I honestly saw myself dropping the series maybe midway through, but you have to stay into it! The art is okay, the anime was made at the turn of the millenium give it a break. People that are very particullar about artwork might want to stay away from this anime. Moving on to the sound, the opening/closing themes are both repetitive and aren't anything to write home about. I couldn't tell you the difference between sounds of arms and regular guns, and the voice acting is pretty close to horrible. Still yet, I can't give it lower than a 6 because of the sound effects. The sound effects made my day! The characters aren't anything special. They serve their purposes and don't really develop until later on in the story. But as the story and fillers progress, you start to find affection, humor, and curiosity for all of the characters.  
 
Basically, here is what it comes down to. 
-You HAVE to wait for the story to develop, slow down and enjoy it.  
-This is an anime for people willing to look past the art, and more into the meaning and depth of the story.  
-Skip the ending song. 
 
In conclusion, I find the anime to be amazing in terms of story, but the amount of fillers really made the score suffer for me. You should be able to find it for cheap anywhere, and I truly recommend picking it up if you can. Give it a chance! Thanks for reading!

","The first season of this show is one of my favorites of all time. The wild and crazy antics that Leo goes through on top of a deeply connected story was amazing so I had high hopes coming into this. The story is basically about the aftermath of a fallout which connected new york to another world to state it quickly. This season lacks the continuity that the first season had. It is more like a series of OVAs so far. The show also feels toned down compared to the first season the antics aren't as frequent or heavy but they are still there and just as enjoyable.  
 
The art is also really good. It is one of the staples of this show for me since anything can happen at any time. The show doesn't limit itself so, the art supports it very well because it has to. The characters designs and when people use their powers are enough to get you to watch the show on their own if you didn't much for anything else. 
 
The first season's music was amazing all the way through. I spam the soundtrack in the car all the time and this season doesn't fall far behind in quality but it isn't as good and that's not saying a lot. Every song you hear makes you happy and fits the scenes well. 
 
This season focuses less on Leo and more on the side characters so far giving everyone their own episodes and I love it. Chain is laid back and good for parties despite are ultimate badassness, Zapp is as stupid as always and etc. you can't help but love everyone and it's nice getting to know them more as the main plot of this story ended last season and this whole show could have stopped there and left you satisfied. It makes you wonder if we do get to an actual story or stick to this OVA like format. 
 
I enjoy the crap out of this show and am never disappointed as we move on.   Overall I give it a 8 because as much as love this I admit it's not perfect. It might make bring more score up if we get that serious side back but for now... You should watch this if you loved the first season you will enjoy this too but don't start here you won't get into it.

          
 
       Helpful I really love the first season and thought it did everything right! it is of one my favorites but Beyond felt boring at times! It felt very dull and while there were great moments overall it was a very dreadful experience! it was a let down considering the excitement that was building! The Animation and Music were amazing as everyone expected but story wise it felt very stale and the main villain was introduced too late unlike the king of despair which they built to the entire first season! It felt way too laid back and did get me to care! Everyone was back and they didn't really good on the character stuff! They developed characters who really needed it (Like Chain and Zed) and did a fantastic job with Leo where he shines once again as a fun likable main character! The last two episodes are amazing and build great suspense which I think is what the rest season was lacking

          
 
       Helpful I wasn't intending to watch it... I didn't watch first season, so I just wanted to take a look at episode 1 of this 2nd, to see if it was worth go fot the 1st... 
 
...and then, that ""Fake Town, baby"" OP got me from the throat and brains and now I'm here. 
I saw the entire ""& Beyond"" season before even a glimpse of season 1 or mangas. 
 
... so, my opinion is based almost entirely on Season 2 itself. I'm barely reachin' ep. 3 at Se01, by now. 
 
And here it is: 
 
 
Nightow is a genius. 
Nightow is nuts. 
 
I didn't think so in Trigun ( I haven't watched Gungrave) ... here he has made that very clear to me. 
 
HellSalem's Lot is the most absurdly immersive city than I have experienced in an Anime exceptis excipiendis Otomo's Neo-Tokyo; practically another character of the plot with a greater weight than most of the human/demoniac ones. 
 
This serie is like a Garage Rock song performed by the London Philharmonic under a bipolar Bushman producer ... 
... and I'm falling short... 
 
He managed to integrate 3D in a way more subtle fashion he did at 1st season (so far I saw it) and worked on light and environments 'til obsessive levels. 
There are scenes I must replay 'cause I was so caught up in the ambients I barely knew what the characters were doing 
 
The endless mix of multicultural meta-references permeating art, music, dialogues and even ""extras"" walking the streets is soooo exhausting ... I am unable to follow them all or remember them all ... my poor wits utterly fail. 
 
In addition; dude enjoys getting the audience into rhythm and emotion roller coasters using  narrative ways odder and weirder than a purple dog with Balrog horns. 
 
In the 1st season looks like everything was more linear; here we got a bunch of autoconclusive OVAs, alternatively starred by each one of the Libra (including the butler and some-guy-that-happens-he-was-around-there-for-no-reason). 
Not too clear where anything is goin' on; more alike the original manga, I've been told. 
 
The polyglot battle techniques (originally spelled in Japanese, English, German and Spanish)... they are perhaps what I like the least ... my bad; action is dynamic and spreads adrenaline until splashing the 4th wall. 
 
OST easily into my Top-3 of the Year: 
Each song and theme has been specifically composed, played and delivered just for a precise moment of the show. 
Each song and theme goes from ""More than Average"" to ""Great!"" 
 
Bizarre, asymmetric, chaotic, plain,  lisergic, delicate, raw, world-wider, stupid, genious... 
 
Say more; you'll probably be right whathever the adjective you choose. 
 
I could go on for several more pages, but I am a compassionate man and we are at Christmas Times. 
 
So Happy New Year to all of you.

There are also rare cases when a youmu and a human mate may produce an offspring, which is called Half-Youmu (半妖, Han-Yō, ""Half-Shade""). Most youmu are relatively docile and coexist with humans without them even being aware of their presence. However, there are times when a youmu's behavior upsets the balance, so the Spirit World Warriors are sent in to kill them. Upon death, a youmu produces a Youmu Stone (妖夢石, Yōmu Ishi, alt.

","This OVA was definitely something I didn't know I needed until it was given to me. It's action-packed, serious, with the occasional ""onii-chan!"" to fill the empty spaces. It feels like the first arch of the anime all over again, lacking the unneeded fanservice that accompanied the episodes after the Hollow Shadow. I myself, was ecstatic.  
The OVA really delves into Akihito's past before the series, making up for the backstory that he had, but never touched on, in the anime. But what it really revolves around is Akihito's dream in the beginning of episode 2 of the anime, tying itself in at that point. While the OVA is told from Hiromi's perspective, it does include almost all the main characters of the anime, with the infamous Izumi-Miroku rooftop battles, and even a debut of our bespectacled beauty.  
The only odd thing about this episode was its title, ""Shinonome."" It differs from the rest of the episodes, whose titles revolve colors, ie: ""Moonlight Purple, Bitter Orange"", Shinonome means ""early dawn,"" meaning when the eastern sky begins to show light before the sun appears. This may have to do with colors if you look at it the right way, but while we're being straightforwards, it does not have much to do with colors.  
All in all, this OVA was outstanding. The topic of the OVA was something many people longed for during the series, the anticipation of the story somehow tying in an explanation finally taking form.

The OVA really delves into Akihito's past before the series, making up for the backstory that he had, but never touched on, in the anime. But what it really revolves around is Akihito's dream in the beginning of episode 2 of the anime, tying itself in at that point. While the OVA is told from Hiromi's perspective, it does include almost all the main characters of the anime, with the infamous Izumi-Miroku rooftop battles, and even a debut of our bespectacled beauty.  
The only odd thing about this episode was its title, ""Shinonome."" It differs from the rest of the episodes, whose titles revolve colors, ie: ""Moonlight Purple, Bitter Orange"", Shinonome means ""early dawn,"" meaning when the eastern sky begins to show light before the sun appears. This may have to do with colors if you look at it the right way, but while we're being straightforwards, it does not have much to do with colors.  
All in all, this OVA was outstanding. The topic of the OVA was something many people longed for during the series, the anticipation of the story somehow tying in an explanation finally taking form. It's definitely a must see for all fans of the show, and really brings you back to the original storytelling of Kyoukai no Kanata.

Elc gets caught up in this mess when he rescues a young female beast tamer from the corporation. Her name is Lieza. Together with Shu and the rest of their companions, they fight to save a corrupt world.
","Arc the Lad, the adventure show that's just a touch darker then others of its type.  
 
Story  
 
The story follows a young hunter named Elk and his quest for revenge against the infamous Arc. Although it starts off simply, things gradually grow more complex as soon as our so called antagonist enter the picture. Still the main point of this series is to show the growth of Elk and the heroine Lieza as characters. What can revenge do to a person, what can being overwhelmed by hatred hope to accomplish? Though these may be questions that other shows have presented as well, it's executed well here because Elk never comes across as insincere or forceful in his emotions. Deep down, he's a nice kid, he's just troubled with how he should handle himself. Some of the more traumatic events that happen certainly don't help things.  
 
Characters 
 
There is a lot of characters, too many in fact. Now this is based on a video game, so obviously it tried to incorporate everyone from the game, however it does leave a lot underdeveloped or underused due to the series's short length.  
 
Fortunately the characters are never annoying or terribly stereotypical, so the ones that do get used are executed in a fairly decent matter. The main focus is of course on Elk and Lieza as said before. Thankfully both get appropriate growth and bonding time, while the other characters mainly act as support or a moral compass for them. Elk isn't just a guy where revenge is everything to him and Lieza isn't just a hopeless damsel in distress thankfully. Maybe they aren't the most original characters in the world, but they aren't poorly written by any means. 
 
Art/Animation/Sound 
 
All are fairly standard for the time. Nothing terribly impressive or original. The character designs are cool, but the animation is semi-lackluster which hurts the impact of some of the fight scenes. 
 
Enjoyment. 
 
Actually fairly enjoyable for an adventure show. It might start semi-slow but I can't say the show is ever that boring. Once the plot gets rolling it actually gets pretty exciting if you ask me. Some of the traumatic events that happen are kind of gut-wrenching, which I personally didn't expect from this show so kudos for the surprise. I enjoyed this adaption a lot more then game story if that says anything.  
 
Overall.  
 
It's nice to get a more mature adventure show every once in awhile. I really think with a tighter cast and a higher budget this could have been something a little more special. Regardless it's an enjoyable watch and I can recommend it to anyone who likes adventure shows.

","I am not a professional reviewer, and to be honest I'm not sure if I can even call this a review, but I've got to say something and I hope it will be useful. First of all I'd like to note: 
 
El Hazard OVA 1 ≠ El Hazard OVA 2 
 
I only could stand one episode, but that was enough to make this conclusion. I was really disappointed to see another failed sequel which I wish was never made. Why? OK, let's dig deeper. 
 
First, OVA 2 focuses TOO MUCH on character relationships, which are so typical that while I was watching I wondered whether it's really the sequel of El Hazard or some mainstream harem anime! And there follows the second complaint - the characters. What happened with their behaviors? Why Mr.Fujisawa is a chicken? Why Fatora is a perverted crosdresser? Miz? What's up with her? And third thing... production quality. Art work is definitely worse (excluding the backrounds, which seem to be copied from OVA 1), and I feel seiyu were slacking. However, let's talk about the story. Well, the magic feeling of an unknown world is no more, OVA 2 starts where OVA 1 ends. And there's not really much new to see, we already know everything - Eye Of God, Priestesses, princesses... No intrigue whatsoever. 
 
Before I finish, I'd like to add - if you're new to El Hazard, start with OVA 1 and forget OVA 2 even exists. 
 
And so, I finish my 'review' and put ""El Hazard 2: The Magnificent World"" to ""Dropped"" with a score of 5. Sad story, but it's over.

       Helpful I'll try my best to justify this rating without spoiling the show. 
 
If you're viewing reviews for the second season of Phi Brain, chances are that you've seen the first season. So, you know what it's all about. 
 
Puzzles. 
 
Yes, there is a lot of puzzle-related stuff going on in the series and, to a degree, it's like Yu-Gi-Oh when it comes to puzzles. 
 
Season One stands to reinforce that statement 
 
However, while the 2nd Season could stand to do the same, it also negates it. 
 
The second season IS better than the first. Heck, the main antagonist is even a better villain than Rook was. Kaito is seriously challenged in this season and there are quite a few moments in the show that I would define as epic and just straight badass. 
 
There's also better character development in the Second Season as well. A lot of characters are given more backstory. And the backstories aren't too bad. 
 
The damning quality of this entire season is simply that it's about puzzles. Take away the puzzles and the story is actually capable of being ten-worthy. After all, Phi Brain in general was a story about people trying to become God. Though, the puzzles themselves aren't too bad either, it's just hard to believe a bunch of teens being so interested in solving puzzles for fun. Harder to believe that people would just set up a bunch of death puzzles. 
 
Still, it's a great series. And, from time to time, I have a little fun trying to solve puzzles too. At the least, if you've watched the first season and liked it, I suggest you try this one. If you watched the first season and disliked it, I suggest that you try this one. It's a redeemer by some stretches.

          
 
       Helpful Let's play up, Ok so I've just finish this 25 episode season 2, so far as to how it fared up well.......I think we need to do a kind of puzzle before I go on.Ok so it might no be a puzzle, but then again it is no different than solving a puzzle co'z whether you answer a puzzle or a quiz  they all have one thing in common- you use your brain, so let's see how good is your phi brain:

The rules:  
 
As a boatman it is your job to carry 1 item each across Riverbank 2, however you can't leave the Chicken with the Fox because the Fox will eat the chicken and you can't leave the Chicken with the sack of corn on  co'z the chicken will eat it, so in what order will you transport each item across Riverbank 2 so that you don't leave the chicken with the fox or leave the sack of corn with the chicken? 
 
 
Ok enough of that, so what we have here is more like a season 2 where the protagonist is up against a group of puzzle freaks only this time them puzzle freaks want to unlock mankind's hidden potential, but it still maintains that usual Kaito being challenge again and it also has that usual childhood flash back from Crossfield Academy where Kaito once studied. Unfortunately the plot is still the same as it looks more like a remake of some sorts that anything  else, only the antagonist and the addition of the POG as Kaito's allies have change.  But still there is that thing where you'll be wanting to see Kaito kick them Orpheus Order's ass. So for the story I'll give a ""Fair"" number 6, because one might wanna screw the story and just get on with solving the puzzle and make Kaito win. 
 
Art: Poor 3. 
 
 
This is because, I'm not getting the idea of as to why  Kaito, Gammon, Ana and Cubic are not in their proper school uniform. I really don't like the way Kaito dresses up, co'z he kinda looks like a dorky gangbanger whose style fits those of  geeky hippies who hasn't taken a bath for a long time. Gammon, looks like a typical biker gang who is into S and M, as for Ana, I'd wish the author has made him a girl than a cross dress fag who dresses like your typical grandmother and as for Cubic, he'll be better off just ditching the white robe for a Root Academy's school uniform. For Nonoha, I really like her better with her hair down. 
 
 
Sound: Mediocre 5. 
 
I just like the ending theme. 
 
Characters, enjoyment and overall: Fair 6. 
 
So far what keeps me from dropping this season 2 is the challenge in which one would empathize with the characters, unlike the 1st season where Kaito is all alone this time he has friends and acquires new allies. However I really hate it when Kaito who's seemly oblivious to Nonoha's feelings, it cannot be establish if he is protecting her or was he gay, co'z the thing about this anime is that it has this yaoi innuendo where the main villain seems to have that kind of desire of that of a woman who is obsess with a man, and in this case it is with Kaito. Then again I really do admire Nonoha, co'z she kinda serves as a mother figure to Kaito and it is nice that at the last episode of the anime Kaito wants her to be part of his puzzle solving quest. In the upcoming season 3, it is gonna be obvious that the Orpheus order would be part of Kaito and the gang's allies, so far thought this anime's overall should get a higher score, it simply doesn't deserve such high score co'z of the predictability and it woun't be a surprise if the upcoming season 3 will also used the same route as the 1st season only with some slight difference. But it was enjoyable enough to see as to how the big antagonist get's beaten by a bigger antagonist and I'm referring to the Freecell woopping Klondike's ass in which klondike's ass big time and seeing Melancholy acting like a kid being bullied thought I was kinda hoping that Kaito would have been the one to do that.

12,489,100,5.989980398,Story between god and human,Kamichu!,"Yurie Hitotsubashi was just an average middle school student living in the city of Onomichi on Japan's inland sea in the easygoing times of the 1980s. She spent her days worrying about exams and trying to get Kenji, the clueless boy she likes, to notice her. Then during lunch one day she suddenly announces to her friend Mitsue that the night before she had become a goddess. Their classmate Matsuri quickly latches on to Yurie's newfound divinity as a way to promote her family's bankrupt Shinto shrine. She hopes that replacing their hapless local god, Yashima-sama, with Yurie will make the shrine more popular (and profitable). Now, with Matsuri as her manager, Yurie has to grant wishes, cure curses, meet aliens, and attend god conventions. All the while attending school and working-up the courage to confess to Kenji. 
 
The DVD/BD box set includes the  Kamichu! Specials  episodes. For a complete list of episodes and the order they're included in the box set, see the  More Info  tab.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Yurie is a shy and otherwise ordinary middle school girl who suddenly discovers that, overnight, she has become a kami, a goddess in the Shinto sense. She has no idea what sort of goddess she is or what her powers are. Her friends give her the nickname Kamichu, a portmanteau of kami (神, ""god"") and chūgakusei (中学生, ""middle school student""). In her journey she meets many other divinities and spirits, and learns the ways of the gods in order to become a great goddess herself. During the course of the series, Yurie grows more in being both a better goddess and as a person.
Kamichu! is set in the Spring of 1983 to the Spring of 1984, in the city of Onomichi, Hiroshima prefecture, on the shores of Japan's Inland Sea. Many of the temples and landmarks shown in the anime are real locations in and around the city, faithfully depicted.
","Anyone who has watched anime for long enough appreciated the importance of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli in the industry, regardless of how you feel about them. They set high standards with their production, seiyuus and stories. The question has always been posed – is it possible to create a Ghibli-like feel within a TV series? The notion sounds almost absurd when you consider that a Ghibli movie budget in recent times comes at around the $10 million mark, whereas a TV series gets about $120k per episode, equating to about $1.5 million for one season, on average. There are certainly plenty of TV titles made on much less. 
 
Let me throw you another question. Is it possible for a person to suddenly gain the powers of a god/goddess and not abuse it, while also not being bland enough in the first place for it to be a non-issue? Light from Death Note let power go to his head and then some. Haruhi was effectively the goddess of her world (despite being none the wiser) but was hardly a glowing example. Belldandy from Ah! My Goddess was pretty soft and more of a harem device than a real goddess. 
 
Well, it may surprise you that in 2005, there was a show made by Brains Base that did meet those criteria – Kamichu!, adapted from the manga by Mucho Besame. Middle-schooler Yurie seems like any other girl her age, until one day she is visited by spiritual deities and informed she is to become a god. Now it is important to note that Yurie doesn’t become a god of everything. In the world of Kamichu, there are millions of gods, reflecting a more Shinto-oriented approach to religion and the universe. Beaches, soba noodles, rain – you name it, it has a god to represent it. But in the opening moments of the show, it’s clear that Yurie doesn’t know what she is a god of. School friends that run the local shrine are keen to have Yurie act as a face to bring back favour to the shrine within the local coastal town. Throw in Ken, an aspiring writer around Yurie’s age who is somewhat cold and dense, being Yurie’s love interest – life becomes pretty hectic for young Yurie as she adjusts to become the centre of attention and taking her new powers in her stride, which is why I consider her precocious in a way, since Yurie takes this all in with rare maturity. 
 
It wouldn’t be much of a stretch to compare Kamichu to some Ghibli titles in style, particularly Spirited Away. Rural setting, spirit entities living alongside people, a very relaxed mood with a young female protagonist as the lead character. But there are a few differences that allow Kamichu to retain its own identity. Yurie effectively carries the series by herself, the animation style falls somewhere halfway between Ghibli’s round, gentle style and the exaggerated cuteness of moe, but most of all it’s quite a pure story. It doesn’t have any of the continual preaching that sometimes hamper Miyazaki titles; there is no war/apocalypse. Yurie simply does what is needed when the need arises – from the quite bizarre to helping out a friend in need. Yurie’s humility and resilience are key to her appeal and form the basis for the show to draw from. 
 
And I’m not kidding when I say Yurie carries the series. She is the only character with a good deal of air-time. Any secondary characters mainly serve as a source of motivation or direction whenever Yurie is struggling. To prevent the lack of character development becoming an issue, there is an emphasis on taking a very laid-back, parody-oriented approach to the whole scenario of Yurie being a god. Yurie’s little trio of assistants that appear from Episode 4 onwards make for good comic relief. One scene where Yurie talks down an entire platoon of soldiers into standing aside while she can barely contain her nerves is just priceless. It has been said numerous times that power corrupts all. Well, not everyone – Yurie is so pure of heart that she always strives to do the right thing and resolve a situation in the best interests of all parties concerned with minimal conflict. Another essential component is the animation – it’s gorgeous. There’s a rustic romance to the setting of Kamichu! with some degree of moe but not to the point it will leave your stomach in throes a few hours later. Singer Mako precisely conveys Yurie’s personality and is a standout seiyuu choice. The production quality is a rare example where you can say a restricted budget was well executed throughout the series. The opening and ending themes reflect the gentle, warm feel of summer that are prominent vibes throughout the series. In terms of aesthetics and Yurie’s ability to light up the screen, Kamichu! excels in those qualities. 
 
However, those said qualities also impose restrictions which considerably limit where the show can go. The pace of the show is slow overall and some are slower than others – I did find myself struggling to keep focused during a couple of episodes. Very little changes by the end of the series and one really doesn’t get to learn much about the characters at all due to the episodic nature of the show. It would have been nice for an episode or two to show more about Yurie’s friends, maybe, to help build a connection to the cast beyond Yurie. In the case of Yurie, since she was simple to begin with and remains so, although she is more confident and self-reliant by the end. There is a strong focus on simple values like friendship and memories, which again impose their own restrictions and occasionally material seems a bit repetitive. It’s never made clear whether Yurie has a specific type of power/assignment, which ends up leaving a convenient way of Yurie being able to do anything under the sun. And every young male in the show is rather cold, which is somewhat perplexing. Yes, the focus of the series is more on the girls – no surprise for a series with some moe elements. But having the guys be almost glacial in nature doesn’t really serve much of a purpose. In a sense it’s almost the opposite characterisation of Natsume Yujinchou, which placed focus on males, bishounen qualities/art-style,  rare appearances by females but similar content regarding spiritual entities and a relaxing mood. 
 
All in all, Kamichu! was a series I felt fortunate to have been able to seen. It’s a charming series that chugs along at its own gentle pace, not being deceiving about what it’s going to offer you. Yurie is the star of the show and carries it from start to finish. One liking the show is reliant on liking Yurie but since she’s a well constructed character full stop, that should be possible for a lot of people. If you’re looking for a title that is cute without the sickly sweet aftershock, Kamichu! will probably fit the bill nicely. Don’t disregard it because it aired before the moe craze truly took off in 2006.

          
 
       Helpful The slice-of-life genre has been done to death in anime. Even the most unique of premises have been turned into mundane school yard comedies that squander their potential. Kamichu is a refreshing difference from this. While it does does share the same settings and many characteristic as the typical slice-of-life, it uses its unique premise to set a Ghibli-esque sense of wonder and imagination; tapping into some of the untouched potential of the genre. 
 
The story follows Yurie, a clumsy space-case middle school girl, who one night becomes a god. This however doesn't make her life any easier, as she knows nothing of what being a god entails, and still has to deal with the issues of a regular middle school student even as she takes up the responsibilities of a god. The mere premise and how it is handled is a reminder of what makes anime special; let's face it, if this premise was used in an American cartoon it would likely be a satire of religion centered around a middle-age man, which would include a lot of pop culture jokes and run so long that it loses sight of its original intent. 
 
Of course, if the show went down the tired old route most slice-of-life anime do, it might have not been any better. What makes Kamichu special is the way it uses its premise to show Yurie grow as a person. Yurie knows nothing about being a god, and is pretty clueless in human affairs as well. Instead of just using this as a springboard for gags, the show pushes Yurie into situations in which she has to take action and make decisions, and thus learning and growing. The imaginative world that Yurie inhabits ties into this, with Yurie's experiences having a whimsical charm to them, whether it be rising the spirit of a sunken ship or attending a god convention, they are pleasant to watch. 
 
Another big thing Kamichu has going for it is its likable cast of cast of characters. First and foremost are Yurie's two friends, Matsuri and Mitsue. The two are polar opposites, with Matsuri being outspoken and charismatic; while Mitsue is more reserved and cynical. The only common bond between them is their friendship with Yurie, which makes for some interesting and fun dynamic between the three. Then there are Matsuri's quiet younger sister, who can see spirits and gods (most people can't see gods other than Yurie, whom they can only see because she is also human); and Yurie's younger brother, who is similar to Mitsue in his cynicism. The rest of the cast consists of a wide array of humans, spirits, and gods including Kenji, Yurie's calligraphy-obsessed classmate and crush; and a poverty god residing in Yurie's cat, Tama. All are charming in their own way... and though they might wear down on some viewers' patience, as overly cutesy characters often do, it is a gripe overshadowed by their general likability. 
 
On the technical side, Kamichu is really very nice. The character designs are generally adorable, especially those of Yurie, Matsuri, Mitsue, and of course Tama the cat; tough each in their own way. Sometimes the spirits and gods might look more weird than cute, but in an endearing way, kind of like in studio Ghibli's films. Actually, the visuals as a whole have a Ghibli-like spirit, though obviously not as polished as a big budget Ghibli film. That hardly matters though, few TV anime look as good as this. The music equally as beautiful, and really adds to the magic. There are some beautifully orchestrated pieces here that will have you feeling all warm inside as you gush about how cute the characters are. 
 
Now, this all may sound like the show has nary a flaw, but actually it has a few very big ones. For as likable as the cast is, and how much time we spend with them, characters other than Yurie don't get a lot of development themselves. Sure, characters have their moments and those are wholesome on their own right, but they are dwarfed by the time the show spends on Yurie, or just being cute. That's another thing, for as wonderfully imaginative the show is, it does get too caught up in its whimsy and cuteness. It doesn't really dangle the cuteness in your face like lesser slice-of-life might, but it is distracting enough to take you out of the story more often than it should; like the alien scenario of episode three (with the alien being super adorable, of course). These are pretty big blows to the show, and take away from its overall quality of the story being told. 
 
Though not without some major flaws, Kamichu is an enjoyable experience. It does what many slice-of-life anime fail to, tells a heart warming coming of age story. A story filled with likable characters and boundless imagination.  More than anything, this is a good reminder of what the slice of life genre can be. 

          
 
       Helpful This is basicly not a review, just my thought on the show. 
 
Well so i am a die hard slice of life fan who watched many titles with in the gerne. And for a slice of life show, Kamichu! is surely a unique one. 
 
So why? Beside being a typical shy normal middle school girl (pretty typical right?), somehow she's a goddest. So how to make a everyday life story when she's also a god, well this show has absolutely delivered it. Such a relaxing hearth warming story, im glad i got to see it. 
 
The only problem i had with the show is its bad animation, sometimes the scene is badly drawn. I would enjoy more if it's a bit lighter but that's just my opion. The music a somewhat average too. 
 
So will u want to watch it? If you're a slice of life fan like me, this is a must watch, an excellent show condider all story it contained. But if you're looking for something dramatic, it's not recommended for you.

In the course of preparing for the play, they are suddenly sucked into a strange Picture Book Tower, where Ayayam tells them that they will be characters in her new book – a new and exciting version of the well-known fairy tale ""Sunflower Taro"". You can tell that things are getting off to an interesting start – as they always do when the Ham-Hams are involved!!

I loved the concept for this story. Hamtaro and his friends are getting really into a picture book that ends too suddenly for them, so they decide to act out the rest of the story.  
 
Meanwhile, the author who is frantically trying to finish the story sees them through a portal and decides to enlist their help whether they like it or not.  
 
Hamtaro and his friends are thrown into the world of the story and become the character within.  
 
Very fast paced and very non-sensical. This is not the kind of story you should go into planning to take seriously. There are times in this movies that it feels like an acid trip. Things go by so fast, some of the most random things you can think of pop up and are gone before you know it. 
 
This movie is anything but predictable. 
 
It was a joy ride on the dorkiest roller coaster that ever lived.  
 
Art: 10 
The animators did a stellar job making every thing seem so big and grand. The characters are cute, their movements are fluid, the magic done in this world all look big and impressive.  
 
I have to imagine the people making this movie had a fun time making this film and it shows through the animation.  
 
Character: 7 
 
As always Hamtaro is just the best thing ever. I loved every moment with him on screen. I gave a rather low score for character for the last movie I reviewed for this franchise.  
 
The rest of the main cast just sort of followed Hamtaro around like a crew of robots with not much personality to them. It was much better in this film and more personalities were able to shine through... Though at the same time I can't help but feel it could have been a bit better for the rest of the cast. Especially when a major theme of this movie was friendship. 
 
The new characters were fun. I wonder if they ever show up again because I'd love to see more of them.  
 
 
Enjoyment: 10  
 
There wasn't a single point in this movie where I felt bored or thought the movie was dragging. Partly thanks to the fast pacing. I had some laughs, I had some WTF moments.  
 
It was an all around good time. Would most certainly watch again.

In order to protect Japan from the Unknown emerging from the Tokyo Bay gate, the boys and girls wage battles for the defense of the cities in the Kantō region (Tokyo, Yokohama (Kanagawa), and Chiba).
","Qualidea Code is about a post-apocalyptic Japan that was attacked by creatures called Unknown. The majority of adults were killed off, but, in order to protect future generations, the government forced the world's children into deep sleep. When the children (now teenagers) awoke many years later, they had strange powers called ""World"" and most of civilization was gone. Using their powers, the children fight against the Unknown and help administrate the new military system that was created by the remaining adults.  
 
This concept sounds entertaining by itself, but it is also one of the problems with this show. There are so many anime where creatures attack, a large portion of the population or world are destroyed, and then the youth need to save the world. It isn't a bad concept, but it's getting old. I want to point out that this anime does have a certain twist to it, which makes things interesting, but the many flaws of the anime eclipse the show's positive elements. The thing that hurt this show so much was the characters. 
 
I need to point out that most- if not all- of the characters had some kind of trope or stereotype with their personality (i.e. Canaria being a klutz). While tropes in themselves aren’t a bad thing, the problem is that these tropes took over the characters’ personalities made them seem very one-dimensional. While some of the characters are great (like Maihime in my opinion), there was one character that more or less ruined the series. 
 
And that would be Suzaku Ichiya, the protagonist. In anime, there are a lot of main characters that start out as an insensitive tool and then slowly develop compassion or other positive character traits. But Suzaku Ichiya was on a whole other level. To put it simply, he was deplorable. He was arrogant, rude, and reckless. Even after he went through some character development and realized he was being too pretentious, he still isn't very likable. At one point, he kind of drifts out of the spotlight and I honestly completely forgot about him for a while. That's how forgettable he is as a character. 
 
As I mentioned earlier, the twist in the story was very interesting, but it was overshadowed by all the series' writing issues. In the first half of the series, the battle scenes were dragged out. Other times the characters had long, pointless conversations that didn't contribute much to the story. Instead of such long battles or unnecessary scenes, I would have focused more on the plot. There were parts that included some background information and character development. However, the emotional scenes sometimes felt over-exaggerated, melodramatic, or prolonged. And even with the backstories, there was lot of information missing from the anime. For example, the backstories of Yuunami Airi and Asanagi Gutoku, two adult military officers, were basically nonexistent. 
About half way through the series, the story started to pick up pace and get exciting. However, toward the end things seemed rushed. The interesting twist was never really explained. What would have been a really interesting part of the story wasn't revealed in enough detail. How did the world get into the state it was in? How did the enemy infiltrate and evolve? None of this was really explored. Because of the abruptness and the plot holes, when the series ended, I didn't feel satisfied.  
 
Perhaps if there is a second season, it will all be explained. There are manga and light novel adaptions of the series, and, if I am not mistaken, I think this series is a sequel to Qualidea of Scum and Gold, a light novel. Perhaps these mediums are more detailed and fill in the missing information.  
 
As the series goes on, the animation gets considerably worse and it wasn't the best to begin with. I felt like the audio was off at times too. It's a shame. The creators probably didn't have enough time or money to make the overall quality better. Maybe if they had postponed the release date, they could have improved the animation and sound. They could have also worked on the story, shortening unneeded parts and expanding the plot.   
 
With some changes and improvements, this show could have been really great. However, its flaws overshadow all of the anime's good aspects. Overall, I would give this show a 6 out of 10. I am hoping the anime can redeem itself with another season or with the series' other mediums.

          
 
       Helpful I've stated this on other reviews and I'll say it again, ""I don't give a shit about cliches/tropes and you can tell by some of ratings for other shows (please don't look just to have an excuse to write comments).  To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan  of this show in the beginning; it was still a 7/10 for me because I was enjoying it, but it took a while to grow on me.  If your opinion was similiar to mine at the start, finish it before making a final judgment.   
 
I don't remember what episode it was when the plot took a total 180 and became exciting; I think it was episode 7 or something.  The plot twist is what made this so much better.  A show that was good, but wasn't the best, became so much more.  So many aspects of the story that you knew completely change.  I want to say how the world itself changes, but it may ruin the story for some.  In the end, the characters fit their roles very nicely and I really liked most of them, the action is really good when it wants to be but it's good other times, the sound is really good, I really like both opening themes , and the show becomes really enjoyable.  If you're willing to give what seems to be an average show a chance, you'll likely realize that it becomes a little more than that.  I cannot make you watch it though, so it's your choice. After how much the show improved mid-way through, a 9/10 seems very fair to me anyway.

Story: 7 
It has a good start, a good half and a good finish. The story catches anyone who at least dedicates about 4 episodes. 
 
Art: 6 
In most cases, the animation is quite good. But it decays too much in certain animations, for example, of the face of the characters. 
 
Sound: 7 
The music is very good, especially when you sing Canaria, that is perhaps the most outstanding in terms of sound. the rest as well as the opening and ending and others seem good but improved.

Acceptable development of the characters, the typical, I have a flashback and story as it was, with whom I lived, etc. Well developed, after all, that is the goal. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
As I said before, Qualidea Code does not hook you if not after dedicating 4 or 5 episodes as a minimum. After that you want to see how it ends, at least, that happened to me. 
 
Overall: 6 
If you have nothing outstanding, or nothing better to do, I think that qualidea code will give you much entertainment. He did not become the best anime of the season for a reason: It is an anime more casual than anything else. 
 
Personally I really enjoyed watching this anime, even with its shortcomings entertain quite. Recommended if you want to de-stress.

","You need to understand something about Ninja Slayer, before even WATCHING it, or you WILL get the wrong idea! 
 
A lot of you seems to be very confused, as to why some scenes are animated and some scenes are powerpoint. ""Why are they doing this?"" I hear you say. 
Let me explain. 
 
A couple of Japanese translators said over social media, (this is a while ago) that they were going to translate a ""light novel"" that a couple of american weeaboos had made. The american weeaboos made THE most stereotypical light novel that they could think off. (Ninjas, Hidden power, revenge) Basically Ninja Slayer in a nutshell. (Or literally) 
 
Now here's the twist. The american weeaboos didn't exist in the first place! 
 
The people who wrote the light novel made it up. They wanted to make a light novel, based on how weeaboos thought anime/manga was back in the 80's and 90's. 
 
So they made Ninja Slayer. Have this in mind when watching this. It makes it SO much better. It's not supposed to be good. Imagine a couple of american weeaboos, sitting together and writing a novel, based on their brief knowledge on japan, (That came from watching anime.) and THIS is what you get. 
 
It's not taking itself seriously and the animation is supposed to be ""bad."" How else would you explain it being in 4:3 format like on old TV and the scenes that are actually animated, versus the ones that have Southpark level animation. 
 
Now for the actual review. 
 
I say this without a single gram of sarcasm. 
Ninja Slayer is a masterpiece. 
 
This is not a troll review, giving it 10/10, just because ""lol"". This is my honest opinion about Ninja Slayer that has brought me to give this a 10/10. 
 
There are few times when any type of entertainment, be it games, manga, music or in this case anime, can make me yell ""YEEEEAAAAAARRRRRRRTTTHHH"" UNIRONICALLY and without feeling shame afterwards. Ninja Slayer is incredibly stupid, incredibly funny and in-fucking-credibly entertaining. 
 
I find it hard to put into words how amazed i am by this show. I sincerely feel sad about the people who dropped it on the first episode, or failed to correct their expectations of this show. 
The entire point behind Ninja Slayer is showing what animefans/weeaboos thought anime was back in the late 80th, early 90th. The dialogue is cheesy, the art is flashy and very neon colored. Hacking into things solves everything and every female ninja is skimpily clothed. 
 
There's a certain feeling that i'm sure everyone on earth knows what is. You can't explain it, you don't know how to evoke it but you are 100% sure what it is when you feel it. 
THAT'S Ninja Slayer. I get ""that"" feeling when watching it. 
 
Ninja Slayer isn't just anime. It's art. 
I'm not being sarcastic.

          
 
       Helpful It can't be said that I haven't skimmed the negatives reviews, long or short. But, what I did read was mostly bafun. Most I purport are written by adolescents who are struggling to take apart and put back together the, from their perspective, separate worlds of children and adults. The hypothesis I proffer to you is that the show is best enjoyed by adults and children. 
 
People talk about context being the key to either understanding or appreciating this anime and maybe that's true on some level. However, I don't think that the context of the show is actually necessary to enjoy it. Instead, the only real requirement is the ability to not take yourself or the world around you too seriously. Almost everything is beautiful if you look at it from the right angle and finding that angle is easiest through a playful attitude. For a child this comes naturally. Playing is how children explore the world. They don't actively try to categorize meta behaviors like what constitutes intelligence or what might make you seem erudite or cool. Instead, the world seems to be taken in by them with a kind of wondrous sincerity. 
 
For adolescents everything changes. Expectations. Strong emotions. Desires. An ego begins to grow. They're not so much caught between the aforementioned two worlds but rather living in a kaleidoscope constructed from the shards of shattered and shattering images of their reality. Life isn't play anymore, it's work. And what confusing work it is when you're confronted with an anime like Ninja Slayer From Animation that does the one thing a teen doesn't want to happen anymore: it subverts conventional anime with a continuous, sometimes jarring, onslaught of sincere cliches. It doesn't just subvert anime, it obverts it. Bad is good, good is bad, quality is bad, shit is good. 
 
The adult has transitioned, perhaps somewhat unknowingly, from childlike sincerity through a whirlwind of emotion and angst, only to come out on the other side often lacking the ability to play the way she did before. But with enough anime like NSFA she can find that place again. 
 
That finally said, here's the numbers. 
 
* Story 
 
9/10 -- The show has a simple and concise story lovingly cribbed from every anime in the 80s and 90s. However, if you really think about it and can see through the humor it's actually quite a sad story despite it presenting itself consistently as just funny and generally badass. 
 
* Art 
 
10/10 -- The throwback 5:4 aspect ratio art swings wildly from absurd south-park-esque flash animation, through colorful and gorgeous pans and scans of cityscapes and characters, to gloriously epic BUDGET animation. 
 
* Sound 
 
10/10 -- The sound, from the bgm to the sfx to the 26 fantastic ED songs, is nothing but perfect.  
 
* Character 
 
9/10 -- The characters are, as with the rest of the show, homages to anime's 80s and 90s heritage. They're chock full of all of the fun cliches that make anime the cultural powerhouse it is. And yet, if you're like me, you're gonna find yourself empathizing and (metaphorically or literally) fist pumping with the characters.  
 
* Enjoyment 
 
10/10 -- The enjoyment. For someone who has watched not only a lot of anime, but a lot of very diverse anime, feeling nostalgic while watching a show that reminds you of another can be somewhat bittersweet. You're reminded of what was and what cannot be again. With NSFA you get slapped by nostalgia with the right and slapped by youthful enthusiasm with the left. The effect is better than nostalgia, it's life. You know that feeling you had when you watched cartoons as a kid? That's what you get with NSFA.  
 
So there you go.  
 
I gave NSFA an unironic 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Well, Trigger. What can I say? You guys did it again. You guys created another fucking masterpiece.  
 
Note: This is honestly more of a ""Thoughts on"" than a review, but hush, let's just go with it.  
 
Trigger is a pretty weird studio. They first pull out shit like Inferno Cop, then they actually try a bit harder (not hard enough) and end up with Kill la Kill. Well, Ninja Slayer is in the middle of those two. It doesn't have the low budget that Inferno Cop had (pretty close, though), but it didn't look better than Kill la Kill.  
 
Ninja Slayer is basically yet another parody by this studio. It's kind of like poking fun at 90's anime, and ninja shit, or so I've heard. Right from the start, you're in for a show that you're not supposed to take seriously at all, it's simply a joke poking fun at other things. Much like Kill la Kill and Inferno Cop, both have shitty writing, but they do entertain a shit ton of people. I personally didn't enjoy Kill la Kill, but whatever. Ninja Slayer TRIES to have those laughable scenes like in Inferno Cop where the animation is complete horse shit. It also has its Kill la Kill fanservice and animation. It switches from those two. 
 
Here's the problem: 
 
It fails at it. The reason why Inferno Cop's animation was laughable was because it was shit throughout the whole show and we got used to it, here Ninja Slayer, it changes from Inferno Cop's style animation to Kill la Kill's  animation. It honestly just feels like they're not focused on what they want to go with.  
 
A lot of it isn't even funny after the first few episodes. The whole ""yeaaart!!"" joke thing gets old really fast. Also, I was very entertained by Inferno Cop's use of swear words, which is barely in Ninja Slayer.  
 
That's one thing, the dub is good. A bit too good for this anime. It's a lot more fun to watch dub and easier to binge, if you for whatever reason feel like binge watching this.... 
 
Ahem, if you're wondering why I haven't gotten to the story yet, it's because it's complete shit. This wouldn't be an issue if Ninja Slayer kept it cheesy and simple, but halfway through the show, it tries to build up a plot and actually TRIES to not be shit. It's extremely uninteresting. There are episodes that drag. Hell, this whole show drags. 26 episodes? Wayyy too much. 
 
By the end of this show, I was very confused on what to think about it. I did enjoy it at times, but I was very uninterested on a lot of what was happening as well. It tries to have fights to be slightly more entertaining like Kill la Kill, but it's just not fun to watch because of its animation. Sure, some scenes are laughable, and that IS Ninja Slayer's goal, but it misses more than it hits.  
 
The only thing that I absolutely loved about this show was the ost. Holy fuck, was the ost great. The ED songs change a lot of the time, and they're always great. Sometimes, that's all I look forward while playing an episode. 
 
Overall, Ninja Slayer FAILED at being laughable and entertaining throughout the whole show. It drags, it tries to be serious at times and just fails completely. 3/10.

Thanks to some outrageous miracle, the Shadow Angels went dormant, and humanity was able to live another 12,000 years without fearing their presence. But 11 years after a catastrophe dubbed the  Holy Genesis  brought ruin to the Earth, the Shadow Angels were stirred from their slumber and resumed the attacks once more. 
 
To give humanity somewhat of a chance, an organization known as DEAVA was formed, and use of a robotic weapon named Aquarion has been authorized. In order for the Aquarion to be brought to full power, three pilots must combine their hearts, bodies, and souls into one—a feat few can hope to accomplish. Thus, the search for so-called 'Element Users' was prioritised, hoping to ensure humanity's future. 
 
 Sousei no Aquarion  follows the story of Apollo, a near-feral young man brought up in poverty, who is believed to be a legendary hero reincarnated. After his best friend is taken by the Shadow Angels, Apollo chooses to become an Aquarion pilot. Will he be able to turn the tides of the war, and free humanity from the threat of the Shadow Angels for once and for all?","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Romance', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Sci-Fi']","Twelve thousand years in the past, mankind was at mercy of the mythical creatures known as Shadow Angels (堕天翅, Datenshi), immortal winged beings with overwhelming powers and technology. That is, until one of their kind, Apollonius, fell in love with a female human warrior, Seliane. Apollonius joins forces with the humans to free mankind from oppression, by using the legendary giant fighting robot Aquarion (アクエリオン, Akuerion).
Eleven years prior to the story, in a disaster referred to as the ""Great Catastrophe"" Earth's magnetic field shifted devastating significant parts of the world and killing off many of its inhabitants. Along with the disaster came the return of the Shadow Angels who had been in slumber in their city of Atlantia (アトランディア, Atorandia) since their battle with Apolonius. The Shadow Angels began invading human cites to harvest human beings, dubbing them ""the wingless ones"", like cattle, to extract prana (プラーナ, purāna, life force) from the captured humans. Their prana serves as energy and nutrition not only to the Shadow Angels, but also to the legendary Tree of Life (生命の樹, Seimei no Ki). The Shadow Angels facilitate their harvesting via giant, floating harvesting machines called harvest beasts (収穫獣, shūkakujū) which are guarded by giant mecha called Cherubim Soldiers (ケルビム兵, Kerubimu Hei). They are sentient machines, yet there are times when they are piloted by Shadow Angels.
Ordinary weapons prove ineffective against the Cherubim, and rings of projectors around the remaining cities, tapping into Earth's strata to project a quantum shield to keep Shadow Angels from entering or materializing in them, provide only limited protection. However a human expedition under the leadership of Gen Fudo excavates three very technologically advanced fighter planes, and an organization called DEAVA (ディーバ, Dība, Division of EArth Vitalization Advancement) takes over the research of these planes, called Vectors (ベクター, Bekutā), trying to identify how to use them. The three Vectors, colored mostly in white, are identified as the green Vector Luna (ベクタールナ, Bekutā Runa), the blue Vector Mars (ベクターマーズ, Bekutā Māzu), and the red Vector Sol (ベクターソル, Bekutā Soru). DEAVA discovers only people with special powers, called Elements (エレメント, Eremento), can use the Vectors and the three Vectors are in fact the pieces of Aquarion, the same robot used to fight the Shadow Angels twelve millennia before. They also discover the Elements can ultimately unite the Vectors into one of three formations of the giant robot in battle, and can use it to fight and defeat the Cherubim.
During the Elements' first sortie against the Cherubim by uniting the Vectors into a formation of Aquarion, they stumble on 13-year-old Apollo, who seems to be the reincarnation of Apollonius. They become convinced of this when he single-handedly takes control of the Vector Sol, unites the Vectors into the Solar Aquarion formation and defeats the enemy, thus causing him to be recruited by DEAVA to join their ranks.
","Well I just finished watching this, and it was a great watch. 
 
Here we are. Your typical Mecha/Romance~ 
 
It starts off (of course) being in the future and Giant robots fighting to save the Earth. With the twist of the pilots being element users (In which they each have their own special ability). We follow our hilarious, weird, quirky, disgusting, idiotic main character: Apollo. 
 
Apollo. He's an orphan. His life => A living hell. No parents, no home, just him and his fellow orphaned friends. 2 ppl appear (Silva and Pierre) in search of the reincarnated Solar Wing~. For a scanner lead them towards the area (and to Apollo). Then the creatures bent on harvesting humans to help with their plot on returning the world back to how it was...Ruled by ANGELS! These ""shadow angels"" abduct human to feed to the Tree of Life to aid them in creating a new world for angels! So a ""shadow angel"" is beginning to harvest humans in the area, and the human fight back using their Vector ships (which when the 3 combine form a giant Mecha). They are used to fight off the angels and save the Earth. During the battle, the angel begins to abduct Apollo's friends, they are all taken by it, except Apollo! Why wasn't he pulled in? Watching his friends being taken away, he is greatly saddened and angry! Something awakens in him! Apollo is the SOLAR WING (APOLLONIUS!!!!). He takes control of the Vector Robot and defeats the Angels lackies, saving the humans from being taken away. 
 
So, now that they know he is the reincarnation of Apollonius (yes, ironic naming eh? Well that explains itself later) they take him back to their headquaters in hope of him aiding them to save the world! 
 
We follow along with him on his journey to save the earth from the Shadow Angels. 
 
This was a great watch. I'd reccommend this anytime. Good Mecha show~ 
 


          
 
       Helpful Let me start by saying that I only watched this season because I was interested after getting caught up with EVOL (Aquarion season 2). I thoroughly enjoyed this season for the most part. The music was great, scenes were touching, the whole shabang. But like every show, it had it's cons.  
 
In this case I couldn't stand the fact that it took 24 episodes for Apollo + Silvia to embrace each other and show any sort of outward feelings for each other. We are talking 7/8 of the series deep into the story and now they start saying how much the other means to them (and not even deep stuff either, this is like a 10 sec thing). The fact that they were forbidden lovers in the past and the fact that they both acknowledged the fact that they were lovers in their former lives AND they both have the memories of their former lives really irked me. They are destined to fall in love over and over again yet nothing of the sort actually transpired throughout the series. 
 
Not only did the lack of ""romance"" when everything has been laid out on the table for them BUT this chick has the nerve to reject her brothers invite to join him in his quest for a better world saying how she wants to protect those dearest to her... don't get me wrong, I thought this moment was the moment when the panties were coming off and apollo + silvia were gonna get all lovey dovey... no... of course things dont work out that way for me... ever... literally 3 min later this chick is depressed in a corner smelling her brothers picture frame saying oniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... do you know how annoying that was? for 26 episodes 90% of what came out of her mouth was ""onisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" over and over... and over again... 
 
oh well enough ranting. 
 
Story: I felt like it was a great story. Forbidden lovers in the past reunited 12000 years later destined to love each other again. A gay dude that wants his gay partner back... mechas... good shit right? well no... please if you didnt read the rant above go read it. Pretty much sums up why story isn't a 10/10. 
 
Art: This was like 2004-2005 when this show was out so it's not as good as EVOL (it's successor) but I still enjoyed the artwork. It was nice. Kinda reminded me of Macross Frontier. Also the episode where they get trapped in some fantasy world or whatever scared me shitless. Since that episode had a new OP I thought the artwork had changed and I was like ""fuck this show... this artwork blows"", but I was wrong thank goodness. 
 
Sound: Pretty good.Dunno bout the OP ED but the melodies they play for the ""important"" important scenes were powerful. Really brought out the flavor of the moment. 
 
Characters: I liked Apollo. He had a good personality. Strong Brave Doesn't give a fuck... etc etc. I couldn't stand Tsugumi (especially during her 20 min cry session... yes she literally spends 20 of the 23 min of the episode crying like a bitch when everyone is going to perish because she feels like a little bitch) and uhhh the brother. Clearly he is no Taiyou No Tsubasa, not even a hint of it but he has to be big shot sexy rich boy and pretend like hes hot shit. 
 
Enjoyment: good show. I personally prefer the sequel since Zessica Wong is da shiet but they're bother strong pieces. 
 
Hope you enjoyed my review. It's a bit late so my review is a little juvenile if you couldn't tell but it's all my personal beliefs. I just hope my colorful language doesn't offend any 10 year old readers who have journeyed onto MAL looking for hentai reviews.

       Helpful In two words, wasted potential. This show has an interesting world and fun fights, but failed to truly develop the characters and story in favor of a lesson-of-the day (90% of the time that lesson is teamwork or confidence) episode format. Every episode starts by presenting a character flaw or emotional challenge for the heroes. As they struggle and fail, an alarm sounds, interrupting their efforts with an incoming attack. Coincidentally, the enemy is uniquely designed to be unbeatable based upon the specific challenge shown earlier in the episode. After a few fight scenes, one character will have an epiphany allowing the team to discover how to launch an attack that will destroy the enemy. 
 
The true flaw in the show is that the characters promptly forget all of the lessons they have learned by the next episode. It is a bit hard to believe that after 20+ episodes learning the importance of teamwork, trust, friendship and overcoming jealousy, the characters still act as if they are unloved and alone.  
 
Further, the sudden enemy attack often  interrupts what was an interesting story of character development. Had the writers abandoned the episode formula and allowed a story to develop over 2-3 episodes, then this show could have had a compelling story and character to complement its action scenes. As is, it is disjointed. 
 
Watch episodes 1-3, 5, 12-13 and 19-26 and you can get the whole story while saving a bunch of time.

In order to adapt to the environment in space and deal with the hostile aliens in Jupiter, genetically engineered children called ""Princes"" are artificially raised and trained to be pilots of armed robots ""AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device). This is a story about one of the teenage ""Princes,"" Hitachi O Izuru, who studies in an academic city Grandzehle. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Mecha', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen', 'Space']","In the year 2110, humanity has expanded its frontier into space in its drive for new resources. Advances in genetic engineering research led to the establishment of the MJP (Military Junior Pre-Academy) project, which saw the creation of genetically enhanced humans known as the Evolved Children, developed with the intention of allowing humans to adapt to the new frontier. However, when Earth finds itself under threat by an alien race called the Wulgaru, human forces decide to have the evolved children deployed as soldiers to fight on the front lines.
Team Rabbits, a quintet of evolved children whose troubling lack of teamwork and common sense prevents them from reaching their true potential, are selected as test pilots of cutting edge mobile battle suits called AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device), powered by the Juria System, a cutting edge technology whose effectiveness in combat is increased according to the survival instincts of whoever uses it.Ep. 4 As they join forces to overcome their personal weaknesses and achieve their true potential, the members of Team Rabbits (nicknamed Majestic Princes because of their association with MJPEp. 2) eventually assume a key role in mankind's effort to thwart the alien invasion of Earth.
","I ought to have already learnt not to judge an anime by its name. ""Majestic Prince"" just does a good job of bringing that point home. Honestly, who'd take something with that kind of title seriously? It hardly has anything to do with the plot and as such, once disregarded, this show is immensely enjoyable. It's about space, robots and the survival of the human race - which, I don't know about you, but those themes are fun. 
 
The story itself isn't anything spectacular. Aliens are attempting to take over the solar system and humans must defend Earth in a pitiably one-sided war. To counter this, authorities have genetically altered some teenagers and developed some cutting edge robots for them to fight with. On top of this, the government has decided to advertise them as heroes turning the tide in the war - all to reassure the public that they're doing something, regardless of the real nature of things. Team Rabbits, our group of protagonists are far from effectively perfect. 
 
Team Rabbits, commonly dubbed The Fail Five at school, are a diverse cast of interesting personalities - ranging from the idiotically outspoken, to the reserved introverts. Essentially, they're all unique - although some a more faceted than others, the dynamic is better than one might imagine. Everyone gets on, relatively so. The dialogue is hilarious to witness. And what's more, we see them grow over the course of the show. 
 
The side characters were generally, fairly good. It varied, depending on their role, but I've seen much worse.  
 
The art was pleasantly nostalgic, a throwback to Gundam Seed and Fafner, the character designs were done by the same person. Do not worry though, their fashion sense has vastly improved in regard to those two aired a decade earlier. Probably. Most of the time they're in uniforms, so you'd hardly notice. The sound is gorgeous. Really polished feeling, it suited the atmosphere well. I never skipped the opening or ending themes, they were beautiful. 
 
The pacing felt right. Not too slow, not too fast. Of course, there are differing opinions out there, but it kept me hooked and still allowed for details to be explored. Recently, I've been dropping shows around the halfway mark, even those that are one-cour, purely because they kind of... outstay their welcome. But this show was pleasant all the way through, it wasn't too intellectually demanding, but it didn't take the viewers for idiots either. And to top it all off, the action was enjoyably suspenseful - it was the antagonists with superior technology, and the protagonists had both victories, losses and arguable draws.  
 
It was a load of fun. If you're hesitating, I highly recommend it. Give ""Majestic Prince"" a shot and you'll very well be surprised.

          
 
       Helpful This review is written in hindsight, but I cannot LOVE  this series anymore. The enemy is far from complex. There is virtually no character development, but it’s not completely nonexistent either. The characters are one dimensional and you know what: I DON'T CARE! I am here for the hot mech on mech action. Like Argevollen, nothing anyone could say or do could change my mind about this series. I am the target audience: cool character designs, cool mecha, and a story of how they are part of a much larger conflict. I’m tired of the mecha genre trying too hard to find deeper meaning in a series that’s about giant robots battling one another. Or focusing on the emotions of the pilot. Mecha show aren’t about an emotional journey. They’re about firepower. I don't like to throw out tens like they are Mardi Gras beads, but this series renewed my faith in the mecha genre, especially after Gunam Seed. No one is whining or crying over their fate. They have a purpose and they fulfill it. They’re soldiers first, kids second. Plus it’s a visual treat, it’s very pretty to look at even if certain animations are repeated. Plus I love the fact that it’s co-ed (something I wish more anime were) the girls and boys serve equally in all areas. If you’re a fan of the mecha genre then I highly recommend this series. 

          
 
       Helpful Okay, I'm reviewing this show for anyone who hsn't watched it. I advise you to give it a try. 
 
From a prospective view it is kinda predictable story wise. If you have seen this type of show before, you'll know the story  
 
The characters are good in their depth but are the same old same old.  
 
The art in this show is awesome, the mecha's background's so well detailed.  
 
The sounds are awesome and enjoyable, they give you the sense they put there time into them to make it sound right.  
 
Enjoyment: you will enjoy it, maybe not towards the end of the series but it depends on the person  
 
Overall I would say watch it, but there is very little innovation, it is more a blend of multiple genres it isn't the standard mecha.

12,1258,106,5.895252297,Story between god and human,Saint Seiya: Kamigami no Atsuki Tatakai,"In northern Europe, the reincarnation of Odin, Dolbar, rules supreme. One day, Hyoga rescues a man in Siberia so warns him about trouble in the Asgard. Athena goes out to investigate and sends Hyoga in advance but when she and the others arrive at the Asgard, Hyoga is nowhere to be found. When Dolbar captures Athena to take control of the sanctuary, the bronze saints try to help her but are attacked by the God Warriors. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']",none,"This is the 2nd film of the Saint Seiya series which contains much more physical combat, but feels very much like the 1st movie. 
 
The story starts off with Hyoga rescuing a person in need who is then defeated by the movie villains. Afterwards, Athena & the Bronze Saints rendezvous in Asgard where the God Warriors reside in. While it does have similar concepts of the much later Asgard filler arc, the stories & characters are vastly different. In this feature, the God Warriors simply wish for divine conquest & not much of their character are explored with the exception of Frey who could've been the primary focus of the movie due to certain Norse mythology.  
 
In terms of visuals, The Heated Battle of Gods maintains the same creativity as the Eris film while placing more emphasis on the characters' hair as various scenes depict strong winds in combat. Another visual feature is Dolbar's Odin Shield which causes the background to change color on a repetitive basis but pleasing to the eyes. 
 
One of the stylish choices of Saint Seiya is the usage of projectile based fighting, however the film decided to go with more physical hand-to- hand combat. Much of the fight scenes benefited from this use but sadly contains the same flaws as the first movie; the battles ending very quickly. While there  was a movie highlight being a fight between Hyoga & Shiryu, it leaves fans wanting for more. One of the benefits of this movie is the villain Dolbar who actually battles in this movie who unlike Eris in her film didn't display any intimidating prowess. Lastly, the music in this film stands out more than the previous one with the signature theme being played via harmonica. 
 
Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of Gods is a quick but pleasing movie displaying the good attributes of the Saint Seiya series. My personal cons to the film were the lack of more character traits as the Bronze Saints don't really express much personality in these feature films. Also, there wasn't enough scenes featuring Phoenix Ikki. Good movie with great visuals & a very atmospheric music score.

Greetings!  
Stay a while and listen! (Or read... yea, read is better). 
This is the second Saint Seiya movie: The Heated War of the Gods. This one is loosely based in a side story published in the 13 manga volume: Nastassja from the Land of Ice (the Asgard saga is based on this too, obviously). 
 
Story: something wrong is happening in the north, and since Hyoga is the only one who works fine in the snow, he try to investigate. Since he doesn't come back, Athena and her Saints start to worry, and finally decide to find him. In Asgard, Dolbar, Valhalla leader, told the saints that he has no idea where the heck Hyoga is, but he will send a search party. Of course, that's just a lot of crap, and Dolbar promptly kidnap Athena with the intention of takeover not only Asgard, but the Sanctuary as well. So, Seiya, Shiryu and Shun (Ikki will come mid-movie) will fight the god warriors: Loki (Megrez Alberich look alike), Ull (waaaaaaaaay similar to Aliotho Phenril), Rung (Phecta Tholl's prototype, apparently) and Midgar (he kinda reminds me Merak Hagen), not only for saving Athena this time, but to find were the hell is the Cygnus saint. 
 
Animation: Like the TV series. This was made back in 87, so if you are used only to new stuff, you may think is old and primitive (or, in a more polite way, classic). If you started back in the 80/90, then is pretty good. Back then, it was f*cking awesome. 
 
Sound: The music is epic, as always. The voices... well, since you are reading the engrish version of this review, that means you aren't from Latin America or Spain. I assume that you are going to watch the japanese dub. It's pretty awesome, you may know the seiyūs from the Hades: Chapter Santuary (In Inferno and Elysion Toei change all the voices). Soooo, good voice acting. 
 
Verdict: the movie is fine, but it resemble the Asgard saga too much. Or, Asgard saga resemble this movie a lot (since it came first)... whatever, is a bit redundant (more than usual, actually). But the plot is better set than in the Eris movie (plus, Athena is not the only source of problems here, which is kinda refreshing). The fights are well done, but there isn't a lot of time to make them fluid or more... complex, let’s say.  
So, all in all, if you liked Saint Seiya, this movie will entertain (the third one is way better, though).

Buenas! 
Esta es la segunda película de Saint Seiya: La Batalla de los dioses. Esta ligeramente basada en una historia aparte que se publico en el tomo 13 del manga: Natassia en el país de los hielos (de acá también salió, obviamente, la saga de Asgard). 
 
Historia: algo raro anda pasado en el norte, y como Hyoga es el único que se maneja bien en la nieve, va a investigar. Como no vuelve, Athena y sus santos empiezan a preocuparse, y terminan yendo a buscarlo. Ya en Asgard, Dolbar, el líder del Valhalla, le dice a los caballeros que no tiene ni idea de quién es Hyoga, pero que se queden a pasar la noche, mientras el manda gente a buscarlo. Por supuesto, esto es una trampa, y Dolbar captura a Athena con las obvias intenciones de dominar tanto Asgard como el Santuario. De esta forma, Seiya, Shiryu y Shun (Ikki llega más tarde) deben enfrentarse a los dioses guerreros: Loki (tiene un aire a Alberich de Megrez), Ull (muuuuuy parecido a Phenril de Aliotho), Rung (parecido a Tholl de Phecta) y Midgar (me recuerda a Hagen de Merak), al mismo tiempo que intentan averiguar donde se metió el caballero del Cisne. 
 
Animación: La misma de la serie. Tengamos en cuenta que esto fue en el 88, por lo que si uno está acostumbrado a lo actual, por supuesto que Saint Seiya puede parecer primitivo, o al menos, “clásica”. Para los que arrancamos en los 90, la animación es muy buena, correcta, y todo eso (COPIADO DE MI REVIEW DE LA PELICULA DE ERIS... que quieren, técnicamente es igual). 
 
Sonido: La música, épica, como siempre. En cuanto a las voces, depende de la versión que viste: la versión espa?ola es correcta para los espa?oles, supongo. Pero el consenso americano general es que las voces de Espa?a apestan. Después, esta la versión remasterizada mexicana, en la que Jesús Barrero y compa?ía están presentes :D. O al menos, los caballeros de bronce, con la excepción de Shiryu (la vos de Shun puede sonar distinta, pero es el original... solo que con más a?os. Los más jóvenes tal vez lo reconozcan por su trabajo como Neji Hyuga). Los actores de doblaje hacen un trabajo notable, y la calidad de sonido es muy buena (COPIADO DE MI REVIEW DE LA PELICULA DE ERIS... lo mismo que con la animación, de una película a otra no varía). 
 
Veredicto: La película no está mal, pero se parece demasiado a la Saga de Asgard. O mejor dicho, la saga de Asgard se parece mucho a esta película... Como sea, tiende a ser un poco más redundante de lo habitual. Sin embargo, la trama me parece mejor planteada que en la película de Eris (y que Athena no sea la única fuente de problemas es muy original en esta serie). De nuevo, las peleas está bien hechas, pero hay muy poco tiempo como para que la acción se desarrolle. En resumen, si te gusta Saint Seiya, La Batalla de los dioses va a entretenerte.

While he was investigating the murder case of his colleague when he had been an officer, he was pressured to stop it by the police executives. However, he continue investigating, and he lost his left eye. When he was about to be killed, a mysterious group helped him and transplant an artificial eye. The eye was a super technological device that connected to the whole computer network in the world, and enabled him to control any computers. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Seinen']",none,"This two-part OVA series from 1989 is adapted from the manga by Buichi Terasawa, whose work, I must confess, I'm not terribly familiar with.  But I have seen the Space Adventure Cobra movie, and between that and what I've heard, I gather his stories typically feature two elements: manly men and shapely women.  The first episode of Goku: Midnight Eye, you'll be pleased to hear (or not), has both. 
 
Let's get this out of the way: Goku is a standard action movie, albeit one that has all the style and flair you'd expect from director Yoshiaki Kawajiri.  If you go into it expecting any more, you'll be disappointed. There are no thought provoking themes or deep characterization here.  But despite that, Goku manages to tell an entertaining story.  Which I will now spoil, for this is the only way to convey its greatness. 
 
An investigation is being conducted into the activities of a businessman the police suspect of being an arms dealer.  But one by one the officers involved in the surveillance operation are taking their own lives.  Enter Goku Furinji, a wisecracking private detective with terrible dress sense. A tie draped over his bare chest, he positively exudes manliness.  As an ex-cop who was friends with the dead men, Goku takes a personal interest in the case, despite warnings from his old boss to keep out of it. 
 
Goku is, of course, far too manly too manly to be deterred, and decides to take matters into his own hands.  After a brief encounter with a naked female android who shoots a laser from her mouth and has motorcycle handlebars mounted on her back, he faces a naked woman with a plume of hypnotic feathers and ends up with no choice but to stab his own left eye in order to save his life.  Then he drives into a river.  What a man. 
 
If you're not yet having trouble suspending your disbelief, keep reading.  
 
Duing a dream sequence, a booming voice informs a Goku that he has been given a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost.  He wakes up, inexplicably, on a park bench and soon realizes that it wasn't a dream.  The eye is, quite frankly, shit-hot.  Not only can it access any computer in the world, it can CONTROL them.  Suddenly, Goku is practically invincible.   
 
Why was he given this eye?  Who gave it to him?  Where did the technology come from?  Pfft.  If you're the kind of viewer who gives a crap about these kind of details, you probably wouldn't be watching this show in the first place.  Suffice it to say, he wants revenge, and goes about it in the most manly way possible: by jumping from a helicopter and using his infinitely extendable staff to pole-vault through a window several thousand (possibly) floors high. 
 
I'm a huge fan of Kawajiri and his unique style is evident throughout Goku: Midnight Eye.  Like his earlier Wicked City, the show takes full advantage of his ability to create a dark, oppressive, gothic urban environment, and it's populated with a cast of elegantly designed characters.  The animation is similarly impressive, with fluid action scenes and minimal reliance on shortcuts.  The cheesy 80s synth music, however, does little but ratchet up the camp factor, which may or may not be a good thing.  I can't quite decide. 
 
So what do we have?  A stoic, indestructible hero.  Unspeakably evil bad guys. Plenty of random nudity.  Gorgeous design.  Yep, it's an 80s OVA, it's great fun,  and it's the kind of show that doesn't get made any more.  And I think that's a real shame.

          
 
       Helpful Well, after this I could say that Yoshiaki Kawajiri is confirmed as possibly my favorite director of Japanese animated movies in terms of style. What I have watched of him are not necessarily masterpieces like those of others, but I love his style. Unimportant scripts and situations, but an aesthetic that is a fucking blast with a visual mastery, way of ""shooting"" and editing that are solid gold. 
 
His films have charm and sparkle, 80s tacky elegance, always developing during nights, in hotels, pubs, discos and strip clubs. With sports cars, top cars, guns, sexy women, sex, sentimental music, neon lights, office lights, highway lights, lights everywhere, that's the charm of the night, its city lights.

          
 
       Helpful This is a true gem in the heydays of cyberpunk anime ova?s, so goes for part 2, anyway i really am SOO distressed that there is no plans to revive or continue this one, with REAL potential that is left unfinished. The storyline starts a bit predictable but evolves into further dark background and some very mysterious charac., villians with some that are introduced fast while others have a more bigger role. the main person in here is definetly no wimp, and it proves it by the fightingstyle,  so is the more marure animation with some good late 80?s sketches, i really was totally into the story at loads of scene?s , with ofc enjoyable music.

Sometime in future Japan, androids have been involved in every aspect of people's lives. One day, upon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the ""people"" in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?"". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, ""The Time of Eve"". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.
The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.
","We humans are in fact similar to androids in many aspects. We are programmed in our genes and minds to feel emotions, love, and apprehension. If our amygdalas, the parts of our brains responsible for emotions, were removed, our behavior would be along the lines of an android with a ring on its head in Eve no Jikan. As we saw in Eve no Jikan, the androids, when given the chance, will show human-like emotions and feelings for those around them. With the added fact that the androids look and act identical to humans, we must ask ourselves: in the future, will there be any differences between humans and androids? 
 
Eve no Jikan had a very ""contemporary modern"" feel with the cafe, artwork, androids, and soundtrack. What is known as pop culture today is not evident in Eve no Jikan; instead, the setting had a very tranquil and creative mood.  
 
Eve no Jikan's artwork was very unique in that scenes were shown in more of a fixed camera point of view as opposed to the point of view of the characters. The artwork was very consistent and devoid of blemishes. The voice acting and soundtrack were also very considerable. The influence of the piano in both the plot and the soundtrack is very creative; the piano is not only a symbol of an ultramodern theme but also a symbol of emotion. 
 
Eve no Jikan was a very engaging anime that had a lot of big ideas incorporated into its plot. The ultimate questions regarding the relationships between humans and robotic humans are presented in a very discussable and arguable manner.  
 
Please refer to other peer reviews if you are looking for a plot summary.

The Time of Eve is a café hidden well beneath the towering skyscrapers of Japan in the near future. As the customer opens the door to the café, a bell rings signaling their arrival. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy save for a little girl running around and calling herself a cat. A couple cuddles with each other and whispers sweet nothings into each other's ears. A man is sitting on a couch reading a book. With a bright smile, a woman greets the customer and welcomes the customer into their second home. With an order, the customer asks for a coffee to be brought at their table. It is warm, fragrant, and sweet. Before the café owner leaves, she asks that the customer treats every as equal. Of course, the customer would be happy to oblige...but for some, this is easier said than done, especially when that customer lives in a world where he or she is taught that humans will always be superior to robots. 
 
This is Time of Eve: The Movie, a film that rightfully deserves more recognition as one of the more superior anime films based on pre-existing TV anime and/or OVAs. The way the café is portrayed in the film could be an appropriate metaphor for the film as a whole. It's a quiet movie that slid under the radar of most anime fans, but through the help of some outside sources, my interest in the movie was piqued. Keep in mind that I did not watch the Time of Eve OVAs prior to watching this film, so whatever knowledge I have of the series is solely based on the film. 
 
One of the greatest achievements of the movie's story is that it makes the viewer grow along with the protagonists. I noticed myself warming up to the androids as much as the main characters did and felt a brief, small sense of betrayal when I found out which characters were androids. I think that that is part of a test that the movie is trying to bring upon the viewers as well as the two main characters, Rikuo and Masaki: try to get to know a person not by what they are, but who they are. The fact that this mirrors the way judgement is clouded in the real world by racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice is almost chilling. The robots even have rings over their heads so humans can identify them as such. If those rings were to be eliminated, no one could tell one from the other. The movie takes most, if not all of its time to make the main duo divert from the public norm and start embracing these robots as their companions rather than furniture. 
 
Another thing about the movie that caught my eye is that there are prevalent occurrences of television advertisements in the movie as distributed by the ""Ethics Committee"" that keeps a strict watch on all robot activity. The Committee airs these advertisements in an attempt to drill into people's heads that robots are machines and nothing more. This sort of ""Big Brother"" influence that the Committee has in the movie gives the world it takes place in an almost dystopian feel, making the secluded café a more precious setting than one should expect. 
 
As for the main characters themselves, Rikuo's development into his final opinion on the robots is more or less straight-forward, making him a sort of bland character, but Masaki proves to be the one to have more difficulty handling the situation, making him the more complex character between the two. The different levels of development eventually balance the two out, giving them enough chemistry to add dramatic flair to some of the film's more heart-wrenching scenes. The moral conflicts between the two, in addition to the other characters' moral support, make for a story that's just as touching as it is introspective. 
 
For an anime film that was released only a year ago, the animation isn't astoundingly beautiful, but there are some parts of the film that are nice to look at, like some of the computers when put into use and the inside of some of the buildings in the city. Some pieces of the café are rendered in CGI, which doesn't look bad when placed next to the 2D characters and makes for some interesting camera angles, but it's pretty obvious that those pieces are done in CG. The fact that the film is colored in an almost monochromatic tone makes for some slightly uninteresting animation. The animation isn't bad; it's just a little bland. This is a movie that you should try to watch for the story more than the art. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by the voice acting in this movie. Half the cast doesn't sound all that anime-esque, which made the performances all the more believable. The right voices were chosen for each of the androids in the movie, down to some of the older models that were featured. It made the older robots sound human, but detached enough to make them sound like they don't know how to carry on a conversation with another being. There's more of a layer of realism in that than the newer, more human-looking androids. Some of the more comedic scenes have some of the most rapid-fire conversation I've ever heard in an anime. It was almost like the characters were having a tennis match with their words. Speaking of which, the scene where Akiko is introduced is something that must be seen to be believed. While the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is distractingly unbalanced. Some of it is good, but the synth in it is so blatant that it tries to make some of the most touching moments seem melodramatic. Fortunately, the ending theme is performed by Kalafina, who are also known for performing the theme songs to the Kara no Kyoukai films and both seasons of Kuroshitsuji. The song is rather pleasant and the lyrics tie in to the main theme of the film well. If it weren't for the soundtrack, the audio would have been ranked a point higher. 
 
I really want to give this film a 9, but i can't seem to find it in my heart to do so. Looking back at this film, I know I'm going to remember it, but not well enough to make me say, ""Wow, was that a great film,"". Even though this is cliché, to answer the film's eponymous question, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?""... 
 
Yes, yes I did, but it don't think I'll be coming back for a while. Maybe I'll like it more when I do decide to visit it again. Only time will tell.

          
 
       Helpful When thinking of science fiction concepts, images of futuristic technology and the vast frontier of space are the first things that comes to mind. Arguably the most popular item in the former category is that of the robot. A machine that exists to serve a person or perform a designated function is nothing short of useful and can almost be seen as necessary depending on the setting of the story. Upping the ante are androids, ""advanced"" versions of robots that take on a human-like appearance. Though they have an advanced AI system and they can look as real as you or me, they are still machines bound by the 3 Laws of Robotics (not harming a human, obey human orders, protect its own existence). But how well defined are the 3 Laws? That's what Time of Eve wishes to explore over the course of its run time. 
 
Time of Eve is a film that, like the androids of the movie, masquerades its depth early on. In a ""not too distant future"", androids are seen serving humans in daily tasks and treated no different than any other kind of machine one would use. Adding to this is the propaganda created by the Ethics Committee, a group that has roots in radical anti-robot activities. Serving as a stark contrast to the outside world is the cafe known as the Time of Eve, a hidden location where these androids meet to talk and have coffee. In the outside world, androids have to have a pink halo above their heads constantly to let the world know they are robots. The cafe's golden rule goes against this, saying that all androids must turn off their halo as to not form any discrimination.  You would think that even with the halos off, identifying androids would still be quite easy due to robot mannerisms. However, the androids themselves change quite a bit when in the cafe, with personalities and behavior that strikes closer to being made of flesh than metal. It becomes a guessing game observing each customer, wondering who is real and who isn't.  
 
This is what ultimately makes Time of Eve so interesting to watch. The androids of the future aren't a weapon of mass destruction or some perfect human - rather, they are robots that use this independence as a way of better serving their designated master. They learn by observing others and they too have things that make them happy or sad. Just look at the bizarre love triangle of Koji and Rina or the absolutely heartbreaking story of Katoran. Though it is sci-fi on the outside, it's a slice of life at heart - personal stories are shared amidst coffee and the atmosphere of the cafe. Despite the laid back tone it sets, the film is not free from conflict. The main characters Rikuo and Masaki both have had their share of robot problems in the past, planting seeds of jealousy and distrust in their minds. Coupled with a society that condemns humans for seeing androids as more than mindless servants, they can't be blamed for their suspicion of this grey area. It takes the efforts of bartender Nagi and the histories of the customers to sway their opinion. 
 
What makes this film enjoyable stems from how the minds of the androids work. The androids are still bound by the three Laws of Robotics, but they try to grasp as much they can from around these laws. Lying, for instance, doesn't fall under this rule. Yet with all these nifty loopholes the androids have found, they use this towards better providing service to their owners/masters. It forms a strangely heartwarming experience, seeing how these robots wish to be seen as caring loving people instead of emotionless distant machines. With every law examined, it brings up questions of ethics not just for the characters but for the viewer. Is it OK to lie now if it brings something better in the future? Can you follow an order at the cost of hurting another? What appears as a basic human rights campaign is actually that of philosophy. 
 
The film is also a joy to watch due to its excellent pacing. It is told in a series of vignettes, and when director Yasuhiro Yoshiura feels a scene is over, he smartly cuts away or lets it fade into the next one. With a lot of ground to cover in just an hour and 40 minutes, we are given just enough to feel the impact of the characters without them growing tiresome. By the time the movie ended, it left me wanting even more and even feeling a bit upset there was no Season 2 or continuation. As quickly as I learned about this futuristic world, I left it with just as many questions as I started with. Even if there never will be a follow up, Time of Eve exists comfortably in its own world and can work just fine standing alone. 
 
A few problems do impact this film. A little bit of suspension of belief is needed to get into its world setting. I don't think that a future like this with near-human androids would be met with such backlash. Additionally, as human as the androids act, they are still programmable and as complex as the feelings that these robots show, they are still ultimately artificial. Yoshiura's directing style can also be yay or nay with some. His camera angles shift between first and third person quite often and frequently use a motion blur effect. Though it makes scenes more dynamic (I personally loved it), its alternative style can be distasteful to some (and could possibly invoke motion sickness)!  
 
The art style is a mix of 2D and 3D. This can usually be disastrous, but with a smart director (and a decent movie-sized budget), it gives the scenes more depth. In Time of Eve, there's no clash in these styles and things lay naturally in space. I like the character designs in particular - they're not particularly ""loud"" with huge expressions and distorted features but not plain enough to make it seem like a forgettable mid-2000's title. Outside of the typical ""anime feature"" of highly detailed eyes, I could probably see these character models as real people, from their noses to their hairstyles. The movie does fair audio-wise. Aside from the pleasing credits song ""I have a dream"", the soundtrack is more or less sound effects and short pieces to enhance a mood. The voice actors also did a good job in this film, in particular the main characters with a down to earth and realistic tone (though the mania that Yukana gives Akiko is loved as well). 
 
With this in mine, I give Time of Eve a 7/10. I admit that I was a bit skeptical on starting the movie, thinking it was going to be one of ""robot rebellion"" or overtly preachy. What I got was a mature film that was as welcoming and relaxed as the atmosphere in Nagi's cafe. Fans of shows like Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou will adore this movie, as well as sci-fi fans who are looking for something different than a thriller. On every object in the cafe, it asks if ""you are enjoying the Time of Eve?"" I certainly can say I did. 
 
Do you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review. 
 
Thanks for reading and have a blessed day!

12,28497,109,5.867488493,Story between god and human,Rokka no Yuusha,"An ancient legend states that with the revival of the Demon God, six heroes—the Braves of the Six Flowers—will be chosen by the Goddess of Fate, granting them power to rise up against the fiends attempting to turn the world into a living hell. Adlet Mayer, self-proclaimed ""Strongest Man in the World,"" has arrived at the continent of Piena in hopes of becoming a Brave. Although it doesn't go as smoothly as he had planned, Adlet is ultimately chosen as one of the six heroes shortly after being greeted by Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra, crown princess and fellow Brave. 
 
 Rokka no Yuusha  follows the two as they embark upon their destined journey to fight the Demon God, intending to meet up with their fellow heroes at a small temple outside of the Land of the Howling Demons, the fiends' domain. However, when they finally unite, seven heroes are present, and soon the others begin to suspect Adlet to be a fraud. Now on the run, Adlet must utilize his unique skill set and wit in a fight for his life to identify which member of the group is the true impostor before it's too late! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Mystery']","Six people called the Braves of the Six Flowers are chosen by the Goddess of Fate to defeat the Demon God (魔神, Majin). However, when they gather, there are seven heroes present, leading them to believe that one is an impostor and on the side of the Demon God. The landscape, architecture, and written language portrayed is very similar to Mesoamerican Maya or Aztec peoples.
","(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
 
[Synopsis]: A thousand years ago the demon god appeared and began to take over the continent however was stopped by the legendary Saint of the Single Flower. After driving the demon god into a deep slumber she foretold that it would awaken again one day and that six heroes bearing her power would rise to defeat it and once again drive it into dormancy. Cycles of these Braves appeared to face the demon god every several hundred years after the Saint's disappearance and were all successful and now the demon god will soon rise again and so too must six new heroes. Adlet Mayer (Saito, Soma), the self-professed strongest man in the world, is chosen to become one of these heroes. After congregating with the other Braves it is discovered that they number as seven rather than six and the task of discerning the impostor sets them all at odds as each member grows more suspicious of the other and the demon gods awakening approaches. 
 
[Characters]: 
 
The cast of Rokka no Yuusha is fairly small as the story is heavily focuses upon Adlet and the six other Braves however this allows for the show to investigate each of the characters to a great extent in the absence of a larger number of characters. Adlet is certainly the character most worth talking about as he stands out distinctly even amongst the other Braves. On the surface is resembles a somewhat typical adventure fantasy protagonist - he is incredibly strong-willed, sincere, and quite ordinary in ability-set in comparison to his fellow Braves. That being said, he is highly perceptive and intelligent in how he fights and problem-solves - both traits lend themselves incredibly well to the story which at a basic level is a mystery. His fighting style is unique and his utilization of traps, crude sciences, and the environment sets him apart from most other characters, especially so from the other Braves most of whom wield powerful magics such as the conjuration and manipulation of swords, gunpowder. 
 
Refreshingly, Adlet is by no means the only intelligent character within the Braves and each member has a strong sense of agency within the plot with perhaps the exception of Goldof. Despite the characters being perceptive and rational, each of them continuously arrive at different opinions concerning the seventh Brave and impostor and what makes them so compelling is that each of their conclusions are legitimized and well-founded. While their character designs are a bit outlandish at first glance they fit well within the aesthetic of the world and I found that I got used to them quite quickly. Rokka no Yuusha is one of the few shows that I can say kept me on my toes as far as which character I put my faith in and trusted as the dynamic of the group and the personality of each character all meshed differently as the plot developed and new information came to light.  
 
The show takes the time to get to know each character and their reasoning both stays consistent with the characterization presented while also evolving as they do throughout the story which added a strong feeling of consistency to the show's underlying logic. The show is hardly all cold-logic and there are plenty are plenty of emotional characters like Fremy who keep the show engaging in that regard as well. I also can't underplay the uniqueness of each of the Braves in relation to each other as, beyond what they believe, they each come from vastly different walks of life, have distinct mannerisms and speech patterns, and interact with each other in different ways.  
 
These traits and differences exhibited by each character account for my reasoning that their presence is definitely a strong-point of the show and its focus on character drama and interaction is well founded. 
 
[Art/Animation]: 
 
The art and animation was at first a pretty significant concern for me when the show started out however by the end I was quite happy with how it improved and ultimately handled itself. The initial 3 or 4 episodes suffer a bit from poor character designs and mediocre CG work on the part of the Fiends however after that point the show picks up consistency-wise a great deal - the character designs are far better represented and their animations as well as the movement of the camera become a great deal more smooth and dynamic as opposed to what was initially presented. Baring the first few episodes, the show is strong aesthetically in this area and though it falters at times I would say that animation shouldn't be a concern going in. 
 
One thing that immediately caught my eye that I found interesting all throughout the series was the world and setting established which felt highly influenced by Aztec structures and buildings. It was an aesthetic I had not seen before in anime and Rokka no Yuusha did a great job bringing it to life. The influence present in the setting can also be found in the character designs which accounts for some of their flamboyant appearances however this too I found to be quite interesting and fun after a turn. The vibrant designs of the other Braves further set Adlet apart who's design is more typical and muted both alienating him on an aesthetic and often a cognitive level while also adding a unique flavor and style to the show that I can't claim to have seen elsewhere. 
The show doesn't boast terribly great CG and the Fiends are both bizarre in appearance and execution however luckily we don't see them all that often after the central drama of the story begins and their later appearances in the show are handled slightly better. That being said the poor use of CG was one of my initial concerns with the show but luckily Rokka no Yuusha improved dramatically as time went on and while I would not list the visuals necessarily as a strength of the show, I would say so of the unique designs and aesthetic. 
 
[Story]: 
 
As I mentioned earlier, the first 3 or so episodes of the show came up a bit short and the actual premise of the story doesn't arrive until the 4th episode however I wouldn't say that it's plot was terrible beforehand. Rokka no Yuusha doddled a bit before arriving at its premise however once getting to that point it changed dramatically and what I first hard dismissed as a vanilla, demon-killing, action show turned into a mystery-centric, battle of both logic and physical prowess as the Braves clashed with one another. The early episodes also differ noticeably in terms of pacing and the show slows down a great deal for a few episodes midway as it unpacks the logic and implications of the Braves' dilemma however I found this to be far more engaging than what was present prior and the methodical pacing in the mid and latter parts of the show was highly enjoyable. The show does an amazing job juggling suspicion from what character to the next and I, as a viewer, found the way in which Rokka no Yuusha approached the mystery genre to be highly compelling in its presentation of developments and perceived facts. 
 
Perhaps the strongest point of the story outside of the plot itself was its ability to first evolve into something far more cerebral than what was first laid out but also its ability to maintain the action and adventure feel established early on while evolving immensely elsewhere was impressive. Perhaps even more impressively - it never felt like the latter action was happening for action's-sake but rather it occurred quite naturally within the context of the situation and the intelligence exhibited by the characters and plot felt present within the action sequences as well through their strategic progression and execution.  
 
The story is quite slow in how it unfolds as it is almost entirely focused upon its premise of there being seven Braves and one impostor and so it may disappoint those who were more interested in the premise in its entirety and its conflict with the demon god and the role of the six heroes. Hopefully the show receives a future installment however the point at which it ends gives a full and pleasurable conclusion to the events at hand, resolving both the mystery and conflict while remaining open. 
 
[Music]: 
 
The music was good all throughout and the soundtrack had a handful of  memorable songs. The area where I felt Rokka no Yuusha succeed the most in a musical sense was in how its songs were diverse to the point that they lent themselves well to the heroic, action adventure setting present in the premise of the story while also presenting an apt selection of music to support the show's mystery themes and the many high-tension moments therein. The music matched the tone of the show well in each of it's endeavors and intricacies and was certainly one of the points of success attributing to the show's overall enjoyability.  
 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
 
Rokka no Yuusha surprised me, plain and simple. What initially felt like one of the seasonal action shows where stereotypical heroes run around and combat monsters rendered in poor CG rapidly became something extremely engaging and special. It has its fair share of problems such as its lackluster animation and art early on and occasional quality drops throughout however these negative elements pale in comparison to the areas in which the show triumphed.  
 
Rating: 8 
 
I gave Rokka no Yuusha an 8 because of its compelling and self-involved cast of characters, its unique aesthetic and combat feel, and the intelligent nature with which it explored its own evolving plot in dynamic and rational ways. The missteps in the art and animation department hinder it from scoring any higher for me and some of the character interactions were not as convincing and well-conceived as others however  the end-product of these things was nothing less than enjoyable.  
 
[Recommendations]: 
 
Anyone who finds themselves classically interested in show's that come off as well-figured, logical, or rational would like the manner in which Rokka no Yuusha plays out as the characters provide compelling reasons for why they think what they do and act accordingly. For the same reason I would recommend it to any purveyor of the mystery genre as it presents an engaging plot in this regard and the manner in which the show allows you to postulate yourself rather than keeping the viewer purposefully in the dark was a strong point of the show. The show has good action and should attract those interested in the more tactical side of combat however those interested in this category will have to find enjoyment in the rest of the show as the fighting intermittently takes a backseat as the show unfolds. To those who look into the show, I do highly suggest reaching at least episodes 4 or 5 before deciding to drop as that is where the show is most transformative. 

          
 
       Helpful The quickest way to pique my curiosity is with the ‘mystery’ tag. It often has me dusting off the magnifying glass and getting set to put my perception to the test. Rokka no Yuusha stepped up to the plate this season and its plot summary had me interested: A show where six heroes try to fight off a great demon but seven show up for the job instead. One character gets picked on early as the infiltrator and it’s up to him to prove his innocence. Rokka no Yuusha didn’t end up testing my intelligence though. Instead, it decided to insult it.  
 
If there’s one big tip you could give to anyone writing a classic ‘whodunnit’ tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the ‘extra’. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That’s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it’s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons. 
 
I can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there’s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you’re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode. 
 
The story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed ‘strongest man in the world’. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the ‘extra’ person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn’t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party’s motives and their background. It’s such a pity that this sort of development couldn’t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It’s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that’s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don’t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it’s making progress when it’s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another. 
 
Given my sentiments at the start of this review, I’d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast. What I can say is that it’s an eclectic bunch of characters who each bring a different ability and personality to the table. Some feel like they’re playing an active role in the story while others just feel like they’re there to make up the numbers. Some character dynamics exist but there aren’t enough connections established between the cast early on to keep me interested in the big reveal that lays ahead. As previously mentioned, you can feel that certain characters being named the seventh would be too underwhelming. Too much of the cast fit this bill. 
 
Animation is a rollercoaster in the quality department. The show looks average as a whole but the early episodes certainly look the part. In fact, the first episode probably set the bar too high, especially with one scene which looks excellent. The variety in environments from the early episodes get lost as the show goes on and that’s a real shame. The story lends itself to this fact but a lot could still have been done to breathe a bit more life into the areas where the bulk of the series takes place. A lot of the CG also is jarring when placed next to the traditional animation (what a surprise). 
 
Rokka no Yuusha treads this bizarre line between being an action and a mystery show and fails at succeeding in either genre. Tension in fights doesn’t exist because the show doesn’t give me a chance to empathise with or understand the majority of the cast. It makes the show very difficult to recommend. If you’re after a satisfying mystery, forget it. If you’re after some action, perhaps. Me? I put the magnifying glass away early on. 


          
 
       Helpful Story: 2/5 
 
Alright so Aztec themed story where six chosen ones are out to defeat the evil demon lord in twelve episodes. It should be fast paced and awesome.............WRONG! They spend half the series in one location blaming one another over and over as the seventh Brave. The theories are very stupid and it literally goes no where. 
 
Art: 3/5 
 
The art is very appealing and the characters very well drawn. It is easily the best part about the series. 
 
Characters: 3/5 
 
Each has their backstory but you only ever get to see the main character Adlets and told about Flamies. There is not a lot of build up into their backstories. No flash backs for any other character and nothing but constant infighting.  
 
 
Overall: 2/5 
 
The way the story was done just killed it. I started off enjoying it and found myself stupidly frustrated ten fold by the time the last episode played. It looked forced and the writing was jumbled and all over the place. It ruined the whole series. If they decide to continue it which I pray they won't I won't watch it because it wasn't even worth the wasted hours I put into it. I want my life back now. Please and thank you!

Don't get me wrong, it's not like the other characters are totally uninteresting, but his Lelouch-like rants and megalomania (even as an AI) single-handedly raise the score of this show by a full point. 
 
Don't watch this if you're looking for a lot of plot intricacy or subtlety, I found that the pacing can be a little ADD-mode sometimes. Then again that might be exactly what you're looking for. 
 
This series has been somewhat episodic so far, though there is obviously some buildup for a larger underlying plot. In the most recent episodes it seems like we might be beginning to see the forming of something a little bigger. Despite being fairly light-hearted and silly so far, I'm inclined to think that things are going to get a little more serious eventually. 
 
In short, it's an entertaining show to watch, not exactly time for deep-thinking, and it's a great way to get a weekly dose of Lelouch. ;)

You know how you watch some shows for deep story, while other you watch it because of the interesting characters or just because it looks like a high quality product. To be frank, Sora Kake is neither of them. Yet, it is quality. Quality indeed, but on a very different department.  
 
One crucial thing that you must understand is that in Sora Kake things just happen. You don’t ponder about it and much less question it. It just is. The Girl who leapt through space is a show filled with idiocy and ridiculous situations leading to more ridiculous events ultimately leading to some conclusion. However, Sora Kake is a special case you see, because in here being that random it isn’t a bad thing after all.  You can say that it is one of those times that you may call a show stupid yet enjoyable.  
 
In Sora Kake we are presented with several anime references such a Code Geass, Gundam, Gainax to name a few. In addition, we can see anime cliché are all over the place for example: girl with superpowers, the chosen one, friends who later becomes foes, evil villain who wants to act as god, mentally disturbed teenagers, and even coming from the dead to list a few. Think back on those typical anime moments and slap them together into a typical mecha show in space featuring comedy, girls with tight suits, people with funky hair styles and deliberate use of English language which would make any non-Japanese feel uncomfortable. Mixed them all up add Jun Fukuyama and you get Sora Kake. That's exactly what Sora Kake is. But you know what? As weird as it may sound, it isn't such a bad thing.  
 
It should be clear that the major attraction of the show is a megalomaniac AI named Leopard (Lelouch). His innumerable rabid rants, rambling, delusions of grandeur and his epic Lelouch-like lines always makes the day. So don’t be misled by the title. The show is really about Leopard. He makes the show entirely, without him there is no Sora Kake.  
 
For obvious reasons Sora Kake is categorically a hit or miss. Simple as it sounds, you either like it or you don’t. The chances of you liking it will be slimmer if you aren’t a fan of randomness and close to zilch if you are unfamiliar with Code Geass which is a must before Sora Kake. If for some inexplicable reason you’re looking for something deep, amazing character development, and complex story in Sora Kake you aren’t watching this show correctly. You are looking in the wrong place and even the wrong planet or galaxy.  Thus I strongly recommend you stay far away from Sora Kake if you are unfamiliar with those titles because you just won’t’ be able to enjoy it at all. 
 
To be summarize, you’re watching Sora Kake for laughs, the randomness, fanservice and to see how far Sunrise can push it while keeping the show as amusing as they can. I believe that we should all deem Sora Kake Shoujo as a product built around absurdity and pure LULZ made only for that purpose. I, for one, enjoyed the ride.  


          
 
       Helpful I watched 4 eps of this series and start to understand my friend's feeling for  dropped this series right from ep 1 
 
While the art somewhat acceptable good, the ED is just average, and the OP of Ali Project just ruin my mood whenever i heard it. 
The story ,till episode 4 still very hard to grasp what going on and we only showed some nonsense crap. 
   Character is a bunch of idiots, it take a slowpoke like me till ep 4 to realize the main heroin is super MORON, thick-head, over-react,illogical. Truthfully, she and Luke from first part of Tale of Abyss can make a good pair.  
 
I swear the only thing keep me from drop this series coz His Majesty Lelouch's reincarnation : LEOPARD !! This brain colony always make me laugh when i see him, While still can't escape from moron trend of series, he somehow able to retain some of his previous life's qualify; hearing him yelling would be a good laugh.

However, Risky is magically joined with an apprentice angel, Safety, so Risky turns into Safety whenever someone says something nice. As an apprentice shinigami can only take someone's life when that person is really depressed, Risky has quite a problem taking Moe's soul, while dealing with Safety, who often cheers Moe up. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Shounen']",none,"Oh wow, this was really good.  Before I start a more in depth-review, I'll say this: if you have any emotions in you, go watch this.  Your emotions will thank you. 
 
Now then. 
 
Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they're in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point. 
 
So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it's like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that's not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you're going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have. 
 
Well, almost. 
 
The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end. 
 
This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it's not one of those...it's an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime. 
 
So let's go through these categories. 
 
Story: Some flaws, some times where I can't help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what's going on.  It's not like it's perfect, but it's beautiful how it works out despite the flaws. 
 
Art: I don't feel like I'm watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it. 
 
Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I'm impressed.  One thing this could've done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan's narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand. 
 
Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe's love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe's point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective. 
 
Enjoyment: I'm quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It's really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don't think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun). 
 
tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings. 
 
or a shinigami. 
 
or an angel.

12,543,112,5.843390333,Story between god and human,Vampire Hunter D (2000),"The story revolves around D, the infamous ""dunpeal"" (born of a vampire father and a human mother) outcast and renowned vampire hunter. His prowess at hunting the creatures of the night allowing his acceptance among humans, he is called upon to locate Charlotte Elbourne, the lovely daughter of an affluent family who has been mysteriously kidnapped. 
 
When the sun sets, the hunt goes on! Charlotte's father offers a rich bounty, be she dead or alive, a task D willingly accepts, even with notorious Markus brothers and their gang of bounty hunters seeking the prize as well. Amidst the chase and unknown to all lurks, a sinister evil which has been secretly manipulating their every move and has set a chilling trap that none will expect and few will survive. With the tables turned and the secrets revealed, the hunters could quickly become the hunted! 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy']","In the middle of the night, Charlotte Elbourne, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a vampire nobleman. Several days later, Charlotte's wealthy and wheelchair-bound father, John, hires D, a dhampir, to rescue her, dead or alive.
At the same time, Charlotte's older brother Adam hires the Marcus Brothers, composed of their leader Borgoff, the hulking Nolt, the blade master Kyle, the frail/physically bedridden psychic Grove, and Leila, a woman who holds a grudge towards vampires. D and the Marcus Brothers race after Meier, learning that Charlotte was not kidnapped but chose to accompany him out of love for the vampire.
Meier hires the mutant Barbarois to guard him, consisting of the shapeshifter Caroline, the shadow manipulator Benge, and the werewolf Machira. Nolt is killed by Benge, resulting in the brothers confronting the Barbarois in their home territory. At the same time, D visits them. Grove causes a large ruckus using his psychic powers, and D becomes trapped in a void that Benge creates. D escapes the void, and the Marcus Brothers avenge Nolt by killing Benge. They then travel to a nearby town, where Leila convinces the local sheriff to stop D. Fortunately, D is saved by an old man who recalls the dhampir rescuing him as a child.
Meier's carriage stops to rest during the daytime, and Charlotte wanders out, meeting D and Leila. The two fight against Caroline while Machira escapes with the carriage. D defeats Caroline but is forced to seek shelter after absorbing too much sunlight. Leila faces a revived Caroline and survives only by chance when lightning strikes the mutant, killing her instantly. She takes shelter with D after and reveals that a vampire back in her childhood kidnapped her mother. This resulted in her being stoned to death by the people of her hometown when she returned as a completely different person and killed her father. Leila joined the Marcus Brothers to avenge her parents' deaths. The two make a pact to visit each other's graves upon who dies first.
The Marcus Brothers trap Meier's carriage on a bridge by bombing it and carjacking Charlotte. However, their trap is foiled by Machira's enhanced senses, resulting in Kyle being killed and Borgoff falling off the bridge but surviving, losing an eye. Meier and Charlotte reach the Castle of Chaythe, where Countess Carmilla Elizabeth Bathory awaits them. Meanwhile, Machira stays behind to fight D, but the vampire hunter slays him.
It is then revealed that Meier and Charlotte had reached out to the Countess, hoping they could fly to the City of the Night, a vampire refuge located in space. However, Carmilla betrays the couple, temporarily slaying Meier and tricking Charlotte into being bitten. Revived by Charlotte's blood, she uses hallucinations to haunt D, Borgoff, and Leila. D is unaffected and saves Leila from her hallucinations depicting her tragic childhood, but Borgoff is tricked and turned. Grove reappears and saves Leila by blowing up the now vampiric Borgoff with an embrace. Grove then dies as a result. D confronts Carmilla and is able to destroy her spirit whilst a reawakened Meier destroys her physical body. D and Meier then clash for a final time, with D gaining the upper hand. During the fight, Charlotte dies from her wounds, with her ring tossed to D and Meier by Leila. D ultimately spares Meier's life and leaves the castle with Leila while taking Charlotte's ring as proof for her father and brother. As Meier uses the castle's ship to depart to the City of the Night, D and Leila look on, with Leila wishing the vampire success.
Years later, a funeral is held for Leila, with a large crowd attending. Among the crowd is Leila's granddaughter, who recognizes D from a distance and invites him to spend time with her family, but he kindly refuses. D reveals he is glad Leila was wrong about nobody being at her funeral and leaves contentedly.
","Bloodlust is a movie about a half vampire who hunts vampires. The basic setup is that a young woman from a wealthy family has been taken from her room by a vampire. The family responds by hiring vampire hunters to go after her. That's where D, a half vampire, enters the picture. The movie primarily focuses on D and a second group of vampire hunters going after the vampire and trying to bring the young woman back. It's pretty well constructed and there are a lot of references to traditional vampire lore. So it's pretty obvious that a good deal of research went into this. That being said, it does have a lot of original ideas and it's presented very creatively. The action scenes are very intense, although a few end very anti-climactically, and interesting to watch. My only issue with the story is that the beginning has an exposition dump that gives information that could have come out in the narrative, in fact, most of it does rendering that entire scene pointless. 
 
The characters really vary. D and Leila, one of the other hunters, are both really well developed and interesting but the rest of the characters are pretty flat. Their motivations make sense but they don't have a lot in the way of personality. The only reason it kind of works is because the focus stays mostly on D and Leila. 
 
The art is very nicely done, albeit a bit dated. The dark colours throughout most of the film set the tone well and the use of brighter colours for the ending is very symbolic. The only real issue I have with the art is that some of the monsters just look silly rather than intimidating, although there are only a few cases where that happens, like the werewolf inspired monster who just looks really ridiculous after he transforms.  
 
The voice work is spectacular. Tanaka Hideyuki and Hayashashibara Megumi both give really strong performances. The only real weakness of the voice acting is Nagai Ichirou who just sounds bored when he delivers his lines. The music is very sombre and suits the tone well. 
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. The female characters barely interact with each other and their interactions don't illustrate sexual tension.  
 
My final rating for Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is an 8/10. It has a few issues, but overall it's a very good film. If you're a fan of horror or you like vampires when they're done well you'll probably enjoy it. 


          
 
       Helpful For as long as the medium of visual storytelling has existed, vampires have continued to be a subject of interest for many artists for a seemingly infinite amount of reasons. Perhaps it’s the elegant and ethereal nature of aristocratic vampires, the ones who lure anyone who falls for them into their grasp, only to feast upon them when the time comes, or the more sub-human vampires who stalk the night as barbaric creatures looking for their next meal. Whatever the case, the subject of vampires has presented itself with a number of ways to reinterpret, and sometimes question, the mythos surrounding these characters, and anime is no exception. This is where Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust comes it. While it might not necessarily be the first anime to involve vampires, it certainly presents them in a light that, for its time, was incredibly intriguing, and presented a vampire anime experience unlike any other. 
 
The story for the film was based off of one of the original Vampire Hunter D light novels, which proved itself to be more character-based than narrative based. If there is one thing noticeable about the story from within the first couple of minutes, it’s that it seemed as though the film, for at least the first 40 minutes or so, was trying to be several different films at once. Is it a spaghetti western? A Ghostbusters-style supernatural comedy? A dark and dense vampire romance-drama? Although the film scrambled to find a solid identity while trying to tell a coherent story, it managed to figure out what it wanted to be by combining all the aforementioned story types and having them interact with each other. What results from that is a narrative that is fascinating to watch, as these story types are all different from each other, but does not prove itself to reach the full kind of potential that it should have. A little messy, a little clever, but ultimately satisfying. 
 
As I said before, this film is all about its characters, and fortunately for this film, all the central characters exude charm and style from beginning to end. The forerunner of all of this is is D himself, who is written with a stoic, almost Clint Eastwood-style of cool that makes him more and more of a mystery that the viewer tries to solve as the movie progresses. What is interesting about him is that he doesn’t take a single moment out of the film to explain his back story, yet has his past explained through interactions with a number of characters, allowing for the emotional resonance within those memories to cement its importance within the story. As an example, there’s a scene involving a shopkeeper that currently stands as my favorite scene in the film, primarily for how it’s written and how it explains a lot about the character without directly involving the character himself. D is an anti-hero that strongly represents the film as a whole: dark, mysterious, a puzzle, and fascinating to watch.  
 
The rest of the cast also has their own role in making this film a bit of a surprise upon first viewing, and that’s bringing about questions about the vampire genre through character development. While these characters start out as usual archetypes for the supernatural vampire/hunter genre (the loner, the gung-ho leader, the tortured soul, etc.), they somewhat break out of that mold by the time the film ends, but not too much that it provides answers to some of the questions that their roles pose within the genre: Why change a human into a vampire? Why turn your back on your own kind?, etc. What this film manages to successfully do with the characters, though, is to develop them beyond just walking tropes and provide them with strong-enough personalities that, once their task in the film is done, they have left a good-enough impression on the viewer. The only exception to this might be the parasite that resides in D’s left hand, whose catty remarks often lead me to believe that those lines were ad-libbed by the actor and were not part of the original script. 
 
And then there’s the art. My goodness, the art in this film. The entire style of the film was based on illustrator Yoshitaka Amano’s original art for the novels, which featured his trademark wispy ink work and androgynous individuals. Trying to adapt such a fluid art style may sound like a formidable task, but the animation studio Madhouse went above and beyond in allowing for his style to fit an animated format. As a result, the film is presented in a semi-realistic, but still characteristically anime style that has the potential to appeal to viewers who might not like anime, but enjoy horror and animation all the same. The character designs present the whole cast with distinct features without anyone looking out of place, all while putting them against lushly-detailed landscapes, both during the day and at night. There was one particular scene involving D, the hunter Leila, and a girl named Charlotte, that took place by a river near a forest that I wished could have lasted an extra 5 minutes just so I could look at the art a little more. If there is any reason for you to give this film a watch, it’s for the beautiful artwork and expertly-handled animation, some that I find to be vastly underrated amongst the pantheon of stand-alone anime films. 
 
If the animation is the most impressive part of the film, then the sound and voice acting would, while not being the exact opposite, have to be the area that would benefit from the most improvement. Much of the soundtrack composed in this film is a mixed bag as far as its overall enjoyment goes. Some of the music does its job in accenting the excitement of certain scenes and nothing more, while others can be grabbing in how sonically powerful they can be. The latter is especially true for the last quarter of the film, which features an ominous choir joined by a powerful and gothic lead organ. The rest of the music, however, is mainly synthesized, which strongly contrasted against the high quality of the film’s artwork. The voice acting itself, which I listened to in English, was passable for the dub of an anime, but nothing superlative. However, it was interesting to hear people in a film that, while they are considered industry veterans now, were only really beginning to dip their toes in the water as far as the voice acting game goes with this film. While the dub certainly isn’t the worst to come out of the anime boom of the noughties, it isn’t one that would certainly convince people who prefer their anime subtitled that dubs can have their merits as well.  
 
Despite its flaws, I ended up enjoying the movie a lot more than I thought I would. I first saw the trailer for this film over 10 years ago, and ever since then, I’d wanted to watch it because it intrigued me so much. When I finally sat down to watch it, I found that it was worth the wait, challenging my expectations with each scene and presenting me with some beautiful artwork to go along with it. This is a film that I don’t often hear in conversations about good anime films, but one that I wouldn’t immediately place on the same pedestal as anything Studio Ghibli has done. It’s a highly beautiful, but slightly indecisive, film where the strongest parts of the film have aged wonderfully and have made the film worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful So I was thinking about how in general I've seen anime and stuff that had kind of grimdark anti-heroic sort of characters and sometimes it works and sometimes not so much, Vampire Hunter D is the former category, and it's also named Evangelion and consequently people might be sort of less familiar with it.  
 
I saw it because a friend had it awhile ago and I believe it's technically Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, a movie which came out in 2000 which I'm pretty sure is this one so here's hoping..  
 
Anyway! Vampire Hunter D is about the Vampire Hunter D, who travels the kind of bleak post-apocalyptic world in search of treasure and in the back, revenge. It's not so much a startling sort of experience but there is something sort of charming about D, like something beneath the wide brim hat and this kind of introverted quiet sense that shows it isn't so much an anti-heroic character but more like a partially heroic one... 
 
So isn't so much a world and character without purpose or cause, but kind of just like a crooked moral compass, one that functions intermittently. He is sort of without purpose in the grander sense, why go and fight a revenge against this guy anyway, why not go a different direction, and yet there's something about all the staging and kind of theatrics that makes it sort of compelling anyway. It's kind of like watching Phantom of the Opera or something, it's just like this sort of stagey drama that is just kind of like a romp into the night or something, you know what to expect and kind of what you feel but you end up just sort of magnetized anyway.  
 
I couldn't give Vampire Hunter D a super high score,  because on the one hand he's really kind of a jerk at times, he's not really like a super good character, but at the same despite all those things it really is so much more compelling an anti-heroic (or as I say, partially heroic character) than so many other things like Yuno Gasai or whatever that girl's name was that are more like fake-dark type of characters. 
 
It's like, it's wrong and weird, and yet, it doesn't matter too much at the same time, because there's something about the whole aura and experience that is somewhat compelling.  
 
D himself like I'm saying.. just something about those brooding eyes and this like torturous sort of thing, like... it's like there is this constant sense of doing things that are kind of questionable along with a sort of awareness of that.  
 
Also, I'm not really a fan of AMVs but in this case I thought this was pretty well done and thought I'd put it here to generically primp the thing.  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybyU0pdIu4Y 
 
So yeah, I can't really give it a crazy high score because it is just kind of a messed up anime, but it's like the ""good"" kind of messed up, so I gave it an 8.  
 
That's kind of a weird way to summarize the situation, but I think what's what the grimdark antiheroism thing was all about in the first place, it's not a neat thing all together thing all the time, but it would be unwise not to pay it heed.

Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game.

You know that moment when you’re watching a series, and you find yourself watching the filler episode. You think to yourself, “...but, why?”. It’s like the producers wanted to make another season but instead took the script for a movie and have drawn it out for 13 episodes. Every week I go into the next episode thinking this is going to be the one that ties everything together and gives this season purpose. I’m stopping mid way through episode 10. Haven’t been this disappointed in a series since I heard Code Geass was getting a new season. If you realllllly like gaming then I’m sure you’ll enjoy it, but otherwise watch something else.

          
 
       Helpful Before I start off, I highly advise to not listen to the reviews that complain about something as if they’re expecting lots of action and/or overloaded focus on the MC. Trust me, those are not very helpful if you’re one that actually likes other equally important aspects of a series that focus more on the settings, story, and even development of supporting characters. 
 
There are mixed reactions of how the first Overlord season went: some were raving about how OPed Ainz is, as well as his servants/guardians, and watching him display such power all season...while others felt like it was the elephant in the room. So now, we jump into a second season that might offend ""Ainz devotees and fanatics"" because of how much more it dedicates itself to other characters. However, I don't particularly find any problems with it at all; while the first season is better in terms of visual appeal, the second season is better in terms of overall character development and story. In short, people shouldn't really overreact so negatively about how this series goes. 
 
STORY: I really like the fact that the series switches up from the previous season and focuses on the actual ""heroes"" within Ainz's universe. Be mindful....Ainz, while being the main protagonist, is also technically THE main villain, which would make sense considering his appearance as a Lich. The pacing of the story is also very good for an adaptation, imo, and it really lets us look into the lives of the characters who are trying to oppose Ainz, which include the likes of the Lizard Men tribes. The setups of each important event or plot point are also done very well, and are not bumrushed like in most other series of the same genre. Now before one complains that the arcs seem out of place with no siegeway in-between and just focuses on the characters important to that arc and feel all over the place....this is actually still a method of world-building, much like how Log Horizon did in both seasons, though not as substantially as this series. 
 
ART: While not exactly breathtaking or eye-popping, the animation style was as consistent as it was last season. Even the 3D animation wasn't really bad at all...it was actually very clean, even though the movements can get kinda choppy. The downside is that I wish they could've improved a little bit more on the overall style instead of staying the same. 
 
SOUND: When it comes to the tense moments, the soundtracks do their job VERY well. Additionally, the light-hearted moments are accompanied by equally light-hearted bg music as well. Not much else to say there. Overall, the sound gets an efficient grade. 
 
CHARACTER: This has been partially touched upon in the STORY section. The focus on other major characters, such as the Lizard Men, are really key to giving more structure to the overall story of Overlord. Despite what many people think, the series still gives an adequate amount of attention to Ainz and co...in particular, I benefited from learning interesting characteristics not previously touched on; for example, despite his intimidating looks, Coctyus is still a good person at heart for suggesting to spare the valiant members of Ainz's targets...I felt that important plot points like this give the already prevalent characters from the first season even more background and ""colorfulness"". In terms of my personal favorite character in this season, it would have to be Sebas, as his personality as well as capabilities are something I actually find as sort of an exaggerated but entertaining aspiration of a character. As for Ainz....he is just being Ainz as always...OPed, and very thoughtful in terms of military strategics and planning, and hilariously getting creeped out by the advances of the overly devoted Albedo (one of the most prevalent and lovable characters of this series). 
 
ENJOYMENT: For me, Overlord is always hype, whether I physically display my jokes out loud or keep it to myself while intently watching each episode. The 2nd season brought to me new perspectives that were already mentioned earlier. Additionally, for a guy like me who loves series where the main antagonist can be OR is the main villain, Overlord is like a ""godsent"" for me, and while it doesn't have the intense furious battles from stuff like the Fate series, the clashes are nonetheless quite the spectacles. 
 
OVERALL: Don't listen to people complaining about this season; they're most likely very impatient and may or may not quit on the show too early when it would still be in early story development. Also, many people have said they hated the Lizard Arc from the book series, and thus by default, hate this season as well. 
I advise one to watch it because I feel it's a refreshing break from a previous season where all we saw was just Ainz and his co, and not much anyone else. If you like more development with support characters, then it's all the more reason to watch it. 
In short, it's a good season that doesn't deserve so much early criticism.

          
 
       Helpful I will attempt to keep this review as short and to the point as MyAnimeList allows.   
 
Season 2 (especially the first half of the season) was considerably less enjoyable than the original season of Overlord.  One of the major issues with this season was terrible sense of pacing.  Each half of the season feels like it should have been expanded into their own seasons (though, given how unenjoyable the first half was... maybe it could have just been excluded).  The creators crammed too much into this season and did not properly develop ANY of it.  This left all the characters that didn't exist in the first season to be very forgettable (which is bad since there is VERY little focus on the previously established characters... which are the protagonists of the story... or are they antagonists?  I dunno).   
 
In summary, if you haven't watched this anime yet, you can easily skip the first 5 episodes of the season (and may be happier if you do) and not miss out on any important information.  And be prepared for they creators putting the pacing at ludicrous speed and leaving it there the full season.  This is still an enjoyable anime (or half of it is), just don't expect anything ground-breaking.

12,21939,114,5.813076201,Story between god and human,Mushishi Zoku Shou,"Perceived as strange and feared by man, over time the misshapen ones came to be known as Mushi. Although they harbor no ill intentions towards humans, many suffer from the side effects of their existence and strange nature; exploiting the Mushi without understanding them, even unintentionally, can lead to disaster and strife for any involved.  Mushishi Zoku Shou  continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi. 
 
During his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals—those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi—inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen. Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Slice of Life', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy', 'Seinen']","Mushishi is set in an imaginary time between the Edo and Meiji periods, featuring some 19th-century technology but with Japan still as a ""closed country"". The story features ubiquitous creatures called Mushi (蟲) that often display what appear as supernatural powers. It is implied that there are many more primitive lifeforms than ""normal"" living things such as animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria, and Mushi is the most primitive of all. Due to their ethereal nature, most humans are incapable of perceiving Mushi and are oblivious to their existence, but there are a few who possess the ability to see and interact with Mushi. One such person is Ginko (ギンコ), the main character of the series voiced by Yuto Nakano in the original version and by Travis Willingham in the English dub. He employs himself as a Mushi Master (蟲師, mushi-shi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.
The series is an episodic anthology with no overarching plotline in which the only common elements are Ginko and the Mushi. Ginko is a man with one green eye, who not only can see various types of mushi but also attracts them. Because of this ability, he is constantly wandering and smokes in order to keep the mushi away. He appears to have a generally laid back personality, however, he can be very serious and focused on his work when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He stresses that the mushi are not evil, but merely trying to survive like everyone else. A majority of the stories do not focus on Ginko but rely on him as a catalyst to move the story forward by diagnosing or curing mushi-related illnesses and phenomena.
","""Now make yourself comfortable and cosy, after 8 long years your beloved mushi master Ginko will take you to the mysterious world of mushi once again."" Or that I thought before watching the series. From the very beginning I had some vague feeling that something here isn't how it should be. I mean I know it isn't an action whatsoever, but don't you think 10 seconds of completely white screen in the opening is an oversimplification? Well, who needs the opening, one may say. That's true I was going to skip it anyway. But after watching several episodes you will notice that good art and nice music are the only things present in this show.  
Just think about it, you can completely delete main character from the series and nothing would change! NOTHING AT ALL! The main character isn't doing a simplest tiny bit of action not to mention other characters. They are there only to link together the art animators made for you. They have drown nice mountains? Fine, let there be a mountain village. Pretty ocean? Let there be a sailor. And so on. 
So, what was so charming about the original Mushishi series? Maybe the way the main character Ginko tried to explore some irrational stuff instead of wiping it out? Are you going to watch it to feel that atmosphere of mystery when humble folks got influenced by some mushi leading them to the final sometimes funny sometimes spooky? Then step aside you are not missing anything here. Or do you just want to relax watching nice art with good music? Then this show is for you.  
To summarize this series is OK as independent anime, but is a complete disaster as the continuation of the original Mushishi. 

          
 
       Helpful Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Ginko, a mushishi, which roughly equates to one part medicine man, one part paranormal expert. Mushi exist in a sort of gray area between living creatures and spiritual, other worldly beings.  
 
Mushishi's greatest strengths carry on into the second installment, beautiful artwork of natural landscapes and pre-industrial Japanese rural locations. It feels very authentic at every turn. The stories of what Ginko gets into during his travels are very easy to relate to, and I found myself caring about the characters involved even though most of the characters only appear in one episode given the nature of Ginko's travels.  
 
While each episode of Mushishi is a great piece of work in and of itself, beautiful and engaging as it is, there is criticism to be handed out to the series as a whole. Ultimately, almost every episode of Mushishi is based on a simple plot formula with little to no carry over or progression in an overall plot.  
 
Here's an episode in a nutshell. Ginko enters some beautiful majestic rural setting...the mountains, the forest, a small farming or fishing village. Ginko discovers Mushi causing some disturbance in people and/or the environment. Through a combination of paranormal knowledge, moral superiority, and his box of trinkets Ginko saves the day, or at least mitigates the problem, gets out alive, etc. The people are happier and better off for his coming, and Ginko wanders off into the wilderness to some other pristine local, never to meet any of the people he just helped again.  
 
Almost every episode of Mushishi follows this formula, and it creates really the only serious criticism I have of the series, if you've watched one episode of Mushishi you've basically watched all the episodes of Mushishi. Out of this latest set of new episodes, only 1 or 2 carried over to characters I recognized before and contributed to an overarching plot line. Technically, that episode (or two parter) is a special and listed under a different heading on Animelist so I could say none at all if I wanted to.  
 
Now none of this is to say you shouldn't watch Mushishi, you should. It's a great piece of anime. It just doesn't offer much in terms of plot development for this reason. For the most part, Mushishi is simply great single serving anime, which probably explains it's broad appeal, you don't have to marathon the entire series to enjoy it. I'm just left with the feeling that I'll have to read the manga if I want any closure when it comes to this story.

","This series started out strong in the first few episodes, but eventually fell wayside to mediocrity. I don't understand reviewers comparing this to Baccano! Yes, the story is told in an incoherent fashion like Baccano! but not for the same reasons. It's as if the writers weren't sure where they were going with the series. Well enough of my opinion, here is the short and simple. 
 
Pros: 
 
Original characters 
Humorous at times 
Original world/atmosphere 
Art is pretty good 
 
Cons: 
 
Too much comedy 
The ""main"" plot is mediocre at best 
Poor pacing

       Helpful Tenth Review - Kekkai Sensen! (or Blood Blockade Battlefront) 
 
This was a anime that looked pretty good to begin with - a city that exists with human and monsters together. The story revolving around this one lad with these cool looking eyes.  
 
At first it looked more like a comedy rather than a serious anime yet the more you watched it and let the story unfold you see that this is actually a well structured anime that has serious elements but also bonds together with humour in some areas.  
 
The story in my opinion at first was a bit rough round the edges and didn't take a major step in any direction, it was about this one kid and his awesome looking eyes but it was jumping from what the story really meant, was it his sister? the monsters? the magic? what? The story didn't really let you know what it's main focus was but slowly unravelled during the series. In all though the story was good in the end and how they portrayed the series to get to the story point was good.  
 
The art was my favourite in this anime, the art was magnificently done and was shown to be one of the key elements of Kekkai Sensen. When the opening picks up you can see the amount of design it took with the art and as the series goes on the art style is always tied together nicely, not one piece of scene was wasted on poor quality. If it's an anime where you love to watch them for art then this is one of them ones to watch.  
 
The characters during the series become very likeable, my favourite being the 'Invisible Wolf' Chain. The backgrounds of a few of the characters ain't picked up in the anime as much as the manga however you can still see their traits and characteristics. I love how it did show us the two main character stories of the main focusing characters though so that you wasn't confused, this was nicely done.  
 
All in all I actually liked Kekkai Sensen, it was a mix of ordinary meets the weird in a city where two have to coexist and live alongside each other in everyday life. It made me actually laugh in some eps when just some random rubbish will happen yet it provides you with more character development and story development in some ways.  
 
This is one of my favourites and I recommend it to anyone with a likeable side to the random, funny and magical elements to an anime.

       Helpful I’m not  going to go into depth on this anime, just share my opinion. 
 
Story: 5  
 
The story was rushed, and they threw in random events that don’t make sense. I felt as though they were trying to create the story as they made the anime or it just wasn’t well thought out. 
 
Art: 8 
 
I didn’t have a problem with the art style or animation besides the fact that I felt like they were trying to cut corners on some scenes by slapping characters in a bunch of random poses in a picture style instead of animating their movements. It doesn’t happen an extreme amount, but enough to make me wonder if it was laziness or style.  
 
 
Sound: 6 
 
I didn’t think the voice actor fit one of the characters in the anime, I slowly got use to it and by the last episode I didn’t really care (I won’t say who cause I don’t want to ruin anybodys Experience). I also thought that the whistling was really annoying and used way to frequently. However I enjoyed the intro and outro very much as well as the use of it in some of the scenes. 
 
 
Character: 4 
 
The characters were all thrown into your face and you didn’t know what to do with them. Some of the most important characters for the season were brushed aside for random content that wasn’t very realivent to the ending of the story.  
Personally I think characters make the plot, and if you have poor character development then you will have a poor story. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
 
I enjoyed I world, even if it wasn’t described much in detail. I would have loved for them to go into more depth on the creaters that were around and not just use them for background. I did enjoy the humor the show had, not all the time but more than I thought I would. I also enjoyed the last couple of episodes the most mainly because it had the most plot, however that is a double edged sword because it shouldn’t have taken all the way till episode 8 to actualy dive into it. 
 
Overall: 5  
 
I can’t see myself ever watching it again, nor do I see myself recommending it to somebody. It’s just not my cup of tea, but if you like wacky stuff in a slice of life, strange encounters, little bit of plot, fantasy kind of way then you might enjoy it more than myself.

","When one accurately thinks of a masterpiece, one can only think of Hand Shakers. This isn't just the best anime I've ever seen, this is the best anime of all time. 
 With stunning visuals, fluid animation, incredible character designs and depth, and an eargasmic soundtrack, topping this would undoubtedly be completely impossible. There is nothing about this anime I could critique. I could spend hours alone lost in Koyori's eyes, for in them you can see the universe itself. The fluidity of the animation meshes perfectly with the classic anime-style character designs, which, by the way, with their stunning colors and intricate details, simply could not be better. 
 This anime has stolen a piece of my heart, and without it, I would be incomplete.

          
 
       Helpful I really like writing, and when I review things on this site I normally take my time to discuss the show whether I liked it or not because I enjoy the process. This is not one of those occasions. I am only writing this review in an attempt to save someone the misery watching 4 episodes of this show has caused me. 
 
This show. Is terrible. 
 
Do not, under any circumstances, watch it.  
 
All I am going to say is that if you want to watch a prepubescent girl get molested while nothing else happens, this might be the show for you. I would rather not hang out with you, but you might have some fun watching this show. I personally found it to be two things in equal measure: fucking boring and disgustingly sexually exploitative.  
 
Avoid this show at all costs. Beside being not in the least bit entertaining, it is also gross. I don't want to watch a 12 year old borderline autistic girl get felt up for any length of time, much less for an entire season of anime.  
 
I would watch all of School Days twice before I watch another episode of this show once. 

          
 
       Helpful ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions"", as such is Production GoHands and Shingo Suzuki's motivations in making this travesty. 
 
LA wants you to to put your hand in front of your face...then start violently shaking it in front of you...yeah that dizziness and annoyance is Hand Shakers in a nutshell. 
 
Let's get on with this..... 
 
In terms of characters, Hand Shakers has a major problem with it's characters...as in their nothing but running gags with a body, let's start with the main duo, Koyori Akutagawa voiced by Sumire Morohoshi and Tazuna Takatsuki voiced by Soma Saito, Tazuna is a mechanic and has this schtick where he sees if a situation or problem is in a ""mesh"" or not, Koyori is probably the worst character for LA, merely because she hardly speaks thus giving us no personality either and she is a special case where she needs to always have her hands joined with Tazuna otherwise she dies...except when it doesn't and she can even stay far away from Tazuna for a vague ""limited amount of time?""...yeah LA is just as confused as you are, but the main duo characters have alot more problems but that a bit later on. So how about the rest of the Hand Shakers?, well Break voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Bind voiced by Yoko Hikasa are essentially the BDSM couple and LA hated both of them, one as a waste of Yoko Hikasa, second is that Break is a overly lunatic ""kill kill"" guy making him instantly unlikable and even worse what with his powers in physically abusing Bind. Lastly is that Bind essentially a moaning machine thus a waste of Yoko Hikasa...let's move on to Chizuru Misudera voiced by Sumire Uesaka and Hayate voiced by Kaito Ishikawa , their schtick is that due to how Chizuru looks like a little kid, they think that Hayate is the boss when really Chizuru is. That's it. Next are Masaru Honjou voiced by Ayumu Murase and Riri Honjou voiced by Ai Kayano and their schtick are cards, more respectively Masaru for a REAL LIFE card game by the name of Precious Memories and Riri with tarot cards, they were the ones LA was expecting them to be interesting....until Riri hit the incest bomb destroying any chance LA would care about them (and LA doesn't care about their backstory it's every abusive parent storyline and an even sloppier incest subplotline...LA could take Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! more seriously than this). Next are Kodama Awaza voiced by Mikako Komatsu and Hibiki voiced by Tomokazu Sugita who have the entire idol and her manager routine...it's just that Kodama has this schtick of quoting random people, Hibiki is just fast. Finally let's talk about Makihara voiced by Shoutaro Morikubo our primary repetitive exposition fairy and obviously yes...he gets annoying very quickly and just spouts off things about Hand Shakers, Nimrod and the Ziggarut...something he should have KNOWN and said to Tazuna and Koyori AGES AGO. -sigh- what can LA say...this character cast is ghastly horrible and at best stereotypically ""running gagged"" annoying. 
 
It does feel like the Hand Shakers' characters TRIES to look at certain genres from Bind and Break in an abusive relationship ""romance"" genre, Masaru and Riri's incest, Chizuru and Hayate for comedy and Kodama and Hibiki for the idol genre and seriously LA thinks that Kodama as a character is the closest character to have legitimate character development outside of trying to be a Hand Shaker through her being a ""fake idol"" or sorts...until she immediately retracts her statement and be her running gag persona again...-sigh-, however the biggest problem is that even with this in hand, they DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT and just use their wasted character potential as running gags and nothing more... 
 
Let's move to the element of Hand Shakers everyone is ""interested in""..*ahem*, in terms of animation, the animation done by Production GoHands, the animation is ""ambitious"" to say the least but comes with the territory of wrong execution in the process, what does LA mean by that?, well for the majority of the battles in Hand Shakers, it has the tendency to do ALOT of changing perspective with long panning shots of the fight, but the rapid perspective changes along with the twisty and turning battle flow makes you either disorientated from the experience or just plain confused of the battle itself all due to the speed, different animations perspectives and the spatial plane on during the battle makes it extremely hard to know what the hell is going on most of the time, outside of the battles, the animation has ""photorealistic"" backgrounding with the animation with the bright animation on the forefront (typical Production GoHands, which isn't a bad thing), on it's own, that is quite unique, but coupled with the bright characters and their designs makes the background standout even further and again MUCH worse when it comes to the battles as well. CGI was also used, mainly on the weapons and LA just could care less how ""cool"" the weapons look like as the CGI implemented into the battles clashed with the photorealistic environment only brings focus to the colorfully CGI weapons and the characters carrying them (in which it even gets infected to the background). LA started seeing repetitive ""stock footage"" previously shown in earlier episodes which also dampened the animation quality though LA does exactly think this one is something to rage about as LA was more annoyed and placed under headaching inducing moments with it's ambitious animation style more. LA ""gets"" it, Hand Shakers wanted to do something unique but was slightly too ambitious and wanted EVERY animation idea on the plate, instead of making a more cohesive animation style it just felt like a disorientated mess. 
 
In terms of voice acting, felt like it was where there would be some grace here and there and there is thankfully but that only makes the characters they voice all the more troublesome...it's not the voice cast's fault...it's their bland characters. LA will rapidfire all this soooo <LA breathes in>...Soma Saito was ok, Sumire Morohoshi got a VERY easy paycheck by essentially moaning and grunting all her lines and when Koyori FINALLY DOES starts to speak...she's ok at best but LA still has a problem with Koyori as a character and not because of Sumire's acceptably ok vocals, Yoko Hikasa was wasted on, Jun Fukuyama was annoying with him basically shouting all his lines, Ai Kayano and Sumire Uesaka were tolerable at best, Ayumu Murase was ok, Tomokazu Sugita, Shoutaro Morikubo and Mikako Komatsu talked far too much making them very annoying. -sigh- with this good of voice cast.....all LA can say to this is that it's a HUGE wasted potential on this voice cast. 
 
We haven't even gotten to the PLOT of Hand Shakers...well that's easy yet vague as hell enough...the concept of Hand Shakers is like a sanitized version of Mirai Nikki or Fate stay night, with no blood, no killings and with no solid reasoning as to why Hand Shakers are fighting each other (Yes, LA knows that they can get a wish or meet and become god? and everything, but even the wish-granting or meeting and becoming god is extremely vague.) Which breaks any sense of tension during the battles (unless you develop motion sickness first) as we KNOW all the characters aren't gonna die from the battles due to the rules of the Ziggurat allowing for fast regeneration after the battle and out into the real world. There is one major subplotline what with Tazuna and Koyori's ""romantic"" relationship but due to it being one-sided on Koyori's part and worse, but there's just no chemistry between Tazuna and Koyori and it just comes out a completely forced and manipulative, from their interactions to them as a fighting duo and LA entirely blame Koyori for this as she just doesn't emote and when she DOES starts emoting and speaking, her personality is as dull and bland as Tazuna is and probably even worse in the romantic standpoint as she only ever thinks and talks about Tazuna...this is our main love relationship people and even at it's best it's just cliche. Koyori maybe the one pushing the romantic relationship but LA still doesn't see the romance side of things as nothing more than the main characters faffing about before the next disorientating battle. 
 
The final arc of Hand Shakers does try to explain Koyori's backstory and the entire backstory to the major villain of Hand Shakers goal in fighting Koyori and Tazuna in all this and it's a grand effort just to explain, something LA greatly wanted after all the faffing about and lulling it did just to get to this point and fine, the final arc did salvage what lackluster plot it had it already had. The ending still didn't fix it's animation flaws to our main leads, Tazuna and Koyori (yes even Koyori's backstory didn't help her own character!, it just gave us more depth to the already blank slate Koyori...but nothing more and even WORSE on Mayumi's part). The final showdown overall had problems with spatial battle orientation due to how Tazuna and Koyori kept changing their battle area...and it ended -sigh- in an anti-climax with a rush character development job on Mayumi as well, ohh and the entire challenging God thing is only said in passing due to the resolution of the major villain in their final showdown with Tazuna and Koyori. Overall, LA felt rather mixed with this ending. 
 
Yes, Hand Shakers, LA is shaking LA's hands....in pure disappointing awe as to what you produced, fine you had the best of intentions, but LA mostly thinks that either you were too ambitious or you had no idea what the hell you were doing!, sure being ambitious is a double-edged sword, where if you put effort and KNOW what your doing, that ambition can bring about a great show, but in LA's eyes, that ambition can be corrupted if you don't know what the hell your doing and your overly ambitious to the point of just throwing everything at the wall and just seeing what sticks. Yes, at the start of this review, LA DID call Hand Shakers a travesty and on an animation standpoint, it's an experimental misguided travesty if to the point of headachy induced nausea, but what really broke the anime for LA was the lackluster and extremely lacking plot AND it's one-dimensional ""running gag"" characters and even lazier romance to our main protagonists. No, this isn't the worst anime LA seen, but it's one of the worst misguided animation experiments in quite a while... 
 
Icarus tried to fly to the Sun with wax wings and in his hubris fell on melted wings... 
 
Production GoHands tried to make a great anime with Hand Shakers with it's disorientating animation and even lazier plot as it's wings and in Shingo Suzuki's hubris fell into LA's WORST anime of Winter 2017.

Pai travelled to Tokyo searching for the artifact, but shortly after she arrived, a thief snatched her backpack and cane from her. A teenage lad, Yakumo, tackled the crook and managed to get the pack back for her, though the thief escaped with the cane. Yakumo took her to his work, where Pai was able to get cleaned up, and where she discovered that he was the son of Professor Fujii, an archaeologist she had met in Tibet four years prior. The Professor had been researching the legends of the Sanjiyans and had befriended her and offered to help her find the Ningen, only to fall ill and die.

Their discussion was interrupted by news reports of a giant monster flying over the city. Pai recognised the creature as her pet Takuhi, who must have been released from his home in Pai's cane by the thief, and who was now looking for her. Pai set out to retrieve him, with Yakumo close behind. However when Yakumo saw Takuhi fly towards Pai, the lad mistook the beast's welcome for an attack, and shoved Pai out the way; immediately Takuhi ripped into the

","As of writing this review, I've yet to see the other OVA in this series so it may be updated. What you need to know is that this is a great story for any fan of paranormal thriller series, and that despite it's age both the graphics and audio hold up very well, but that's about where it falls off. 
 
     A great story with likable characters and a great sense of actual character development despite the shows length, but that's the issue. From what I understand, this was a fairly large manga and the story should not have been adapted into so few episodes. It's so rushed it doesn't really hook the viewer and watching it felt forced at parts, but it's definitely worth it at the end.  
 
     When I heard about this I really wanted to give it a higher rating, and I feel that my bias towards the genre and older anime in general might be half of why I'm giving it a 7 so take my rating with a grain of salt. 

          
 
       Helpful My first question after I finished this anime was,""Why isnt this anime longer?"" The manga stretches on for over 40 volumes and they only went up to volume five. 
 
All that aside, this anime is first rate. Yuzo Takada Sensei claims this series to be his masterpiece. Those of you eager enough to watch this anime, but can't stand bad animation, I beg of you, power through the first 4 episodes. The real treat is the second part. Quailty animation awaits. More than that is the story. 3x3 Eyes has one of the best plots in any anime. Also, the character development is beyond words. The hero, Yakumo, changes dramatically to the point of wondering if this is really the same person. In the good way of course.  
 
Overall I gave it a 9. I don't give 9s, they are earned.   

          
 
       Helpful 3x3 eyes is a hit written by Takada Yuzo. During its time it had a huge impact, getting several video games and a couple OVAs This one from Toei animation. The second from Studio Junio. It would have even had a full tv series but that was prevented by censorship laws, which may be a good illustration to my ""censorship is evil"" belief but it's been largely forgotten with the passage of time. The question is, why was it so big and does it hold up today? 
 
3x3 Eyes is the story of a three eyed demon named Pai who comes to Japan to find Fuji Yakumo, the son of a professor who promised her that his son would help make her human in his place. To save his life she turns him into an immortal demon, which is lucky for him since he takes damage that should kill him a lot, and the two head to Hong Kong to find the Statue of Humanity. The story is nicely put together with a lot of epic action sequences and good suspense. It's heavily influenced by Hindu mythos which leads to some interesting moments. However, it does have issues. The biggest one is the romance. It feels really rushed, unnatural and sappy. The other issues are that, like Battle Angel, the story is incomplete, and there's a tonal shift in the third episode that's just jarring. 
 
The characters are mostly pretty well done, although the only thing that keeps Pai from being annoying is the fact that she has two personalities and her demon personality is very interesting. The way Yakumo's friends react to him when he tells them he's an immortal demon vs. when they see proof is very nicely done and has a lot of realism. Even the minor characters are pretty interesting and there's no named character who doesn't have an impact on the plot.  
 
The art is dated, but is pretty good regardless. The monster, set and costume designs are all very detailed. The Hindu influence on the monster design is very strong and creates a very stylised feel.   
 
The voice work is excellent. Hayashibara Megumi uses a completely different tone for both of Pai's personalities which really helps illustrate their differences while simultaneously acknowledging their similarities. Tsujitani Kouji, Ootsuka Akio, Tanaka Mayumi and Orikasa Ai all do fantastic jobs as well. The music is spectacular. It suits the atmosphere perfectly and sounds very polished and epic. The only issue is that the sound quality suffers in a few scenes. 
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. This is another series where the female characters don't interact with each other much.  
 
My final rating for 3x3 eyes is a 7/10. While it has some problems, it's easy to see why it was such a big hit. If you're trying to figure out whether or not to read the manga watching this is a pretty good way of telling whether or not you'd like it. Even if you've already read the manga it's nice to see the opening events animated and the art, voice acting and music are all good enough to merit checking out.

12,10578,118,5.684035596,Story between god and human,C?,"From the light novel series written by Minase Hazuki, comes a story of love, action, and comedy. Yachi Haruaki is a high school boy who is naturally resistant to curses. After his father sends him a mysterious black cube, Haruaki awakes to find a nude girl named Fear standing in his kitchen. She’s the human form of the cursed black cube – and an instrument of torture! Utilizing her special abilities, Fear fights alongside Haruaki to defeat other cursed instruments and their owners. 
 
(Source: FUNimation)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Supernatural']","The story begins with high-school student Yachi Haruaki receiving a mysterious super-heavy black cube from his overseas archaeologist father. That night, Haruaki wakes to a suspicious noise in the kitchen and discovers a stark-naked young girl with blue hair stealing rice crackers. The girl introduces herself as ""Fear"" (pronounced ""Fia"" in Japanese), and Haruaki comes to the conclusion that she is the cube that his father had sent. Fear explains that she is a Cursed Tool, objects which were used in the past by humans to fill out their evil desires. Over time they began to possess human attributes at a great price which include gaining human emotions, and hurting others without control. Haruaki assures her that he is immune to any curse that she might give him, and vows to help out by getting rid of her curse. Allied with next-door neighbour Konoha Muramasa and the strict class representative Kirika Ueno, they try to help her remove her curse, but in the process gets involved in many dangerous organisations, and other Cursed Tool incidents.
","Anime was pretty good at the start, it had a dark feel and there was a fair bit of action. After that it wasn't as good, the dark feel at the start of the series wasn't there anymore and there was less action as well.  Honestly, the action isn't too important to me, but it was pretty good at the start. Although the fact that there was less of a dark atmosphere later on in the series kinda made it less enjoyable, as that was what I came for. 
 
Anyway, the best part of the series was at the start. It goes a bit downhill later. The later parts of the anime felt a bit rushed as well, which may have been why it not seem as good...

          
 
       Helpful CUBED X CURSED X CURIOUS REVIEW: 
 
MINDSET: 
You should already know what's coming Your way once You see, “Light Novel Adaptation” popping up the back of Your hand, its either from the Cows Buttocks, or average stones. 
 
SYNOPSIS: 
C3 starts out in regular modern day Japan with our generic protagonist Haruaki, at one day he soon finds a  mythically giant black cube posted by Your local mail man, soon he notices that the giant cube can transform into female loli known as “Fear”. It was then found out that her cube can not only resize into the palm of her hand for plot convenience, but it can also be used as a tool of 100 torture devices. (BDSM style! Yay, kids!) 
 
 
REVIEW: 
We all know that light novel adaptations are always aiming for “Mass Appeal” since that is the one thing that always tend to sell! (AKA: The casual audience) Consequently, C3   slightly “Differs” from this case as it is surprisingly good on paper. However, for me to summarise such issues, the show is also trying to also be ecchi, which has the tendency to break a show if it has a more mature, interesting and serious nature. This is no exception. 
 
Don't expect deep and complex villains. They are all completely lacking in depth, and are often just one liner character. Like is it ever in any way, shape or form that the first villain is just this random axe wielding  psychopath who keeps crying out “Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” Every 5 seconds when she's fighting a woman will equal character depth and complexity? No! 
 
Tropes are a thousand times more overused, and replicated. So (obvious fact) the light novel adaptation tends to carry: One dimensional villains? Check! Character Archetypes? Check! Tsunderes? Check! Fan Service? Check! Endings that leave one or more plot holes? Damn hell & Check! And  this is the biggest issue to be summarised with this show here, it feels far too much like a light novel adaptation, yet it has an interesting premise and a fairly good amount of potential to be a “Good Light Novel, with the Adaptation” Buuuut Your run of the mil light novel is bound to fail. 
 
Speaking of fanservice, there is a bit too much fanservice to take this show onto more serious and mature levels. The fact that Kirka wears permanent bondage under her clothes will not mean as a symbolic reference of her sexual suffering and how she is trapped in pain unless if the show shuts up the fanservice, takes a serious look on the audience, and respects it like an actual man! 
 
These kinds of concepts may look very nice on both paper, and in action if done in properly mature manner. However, its is simply lazy to take the risk, and create a potentially good and interesting show! For goodness sakes! The show is not even trying to make these concepts as interesting and thought provoking as it is meant to be, leaving it into Ecchi abyss... 
 
Silver Link doesn’t have many renowned or popular works, but its safe to say that the budget will remain very consistent for these 12 episode series, and C3 tends to have pretty above average Animation, the action scenes and cool powers they use create some pretty energetic looking battles. The colours they use all have a nice shiny finish to them so everything is all nice and colourful. The character designs aren’t anything to be especially proud of, since there quite generic and only the female designs only stand out. 
 
Though I think Silver Link is trying to copy SHAFT STYLE at certain points, but I don't really think its ever overused as much as Shafts own work. Though I don't think it really ever gives out extra points for that since those moments are kind of sparse, but not elusive.  
 
OST is again is just as above average as the Animation, with only one note worthy song that seems to stick around Your mind, and the rest fitting in with the mood, with Your usual pianos, trumpets, drums etc. Though it seems to be quite a large OST for 12 good songs that seem fairly on par with the Animation. OP is above average and fairly catchy, while its rather advisable to skip the ED. 
 
LEGACY: 
Such an Underrated show that never really managed to be seen upon masses. Season two is bound to never be released because Silver Link can't profit enough milk from it, but I suppose I'll remember this Light Novel Adaptation though failing and hitting its face on a wall, for having a bit more ambition than something like Mahouka which aims too much for MASS APPEAL. 
 
SCORES: 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL CHARACTERS SUCK. (cool ideas though) 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL PLOTS SUCK. (though some decent foreshadowing at times BTW) 
6.5/10- Well made and brightly coloured pieces of imagery but note bing too Shafty, but good Animation is good Animation. 
7/10- Mainly for 12 good songs on par with the Animation. 
3/10- Lacking enjoyability because it does'nt take good advantage of its potential, and fanservice. 
 
FINALE: 4.5/10 it has cool ideas and the budget to go with it, but fails in the long run. Because of fan service and the attempt of MASS APPEAL.

          
 
       Helpful I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character's hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. ** 
 
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the 'cube'. Kubrick being 'Cube' and 'Brick'.. get it? Get it?! :D 
 
'Yachi Haruaki', the main male protagonist in the story. ""Yachi"" in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I'd have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever. 
 
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing 'torture' machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical 'Swordfight' anime or 'Trigger-happy' anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations. 
 
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, 'Muramasa' until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) 'big-breasted' friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from 'Shakugan no Shana', and Siesta from 'Zero no Tsukaima'). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is 'Muramasa'. 
 
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear's dance really cute and charming. 
 
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10 
 
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear's hair shines rainbow. It's very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion. 
 
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier. 
 
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

12,2559,119,5.681591661,Story between god and human,Romeo no Aoi Sora,"Romeo is a kindhearted and courageous boy living with his family in a small village in Switzerland. Unfortunately, Romeo becomes the interest of a man named Luini, known as ""The God of Death,"" who is infamous for buying children and selling them as chimney sweeps in Milan. While visiting the village, Luini burns down Romeo's family cornfield in an attempt to have Romeo as his own. With the cornfield gone and his father sustaining a head injury trying to put out the fire, Romeo bravely sells himself to the God of Death in order to help his family afford a doctor.  
 
On his way to Milan, Romeo meets a boy named Alfredo Martini and they quickly become friends. Just as Alfredo is sold to a different master, the two boys swear eternal friendship and vow to meet again. As a chimney sweep, Romeo faces many hardships and abuse, especially from his master's family and a gang known as the Wolf Pack. But after reuniting with Alfredo, the two form a fraternity of chimney sweeps called ""The Black Brothers,"" who will learn to fight against the Wolf Pack and help each other in times of need. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","In the second half of the 19th century, in 1875, a young boy named Romeo lives in small Swiss village called Sonogno. The village is suffering due to a long drought, and Romeo's family is hit by it the worst, as they are also under debt. Meanwhile, Luini, a dismal man with the nickname ""The God of Death"", arrives in the village. Luini has his eyes on Romeo and plans to buy him from his parents to work as a chimney sweeper. Luini asks Romeo's father Roberto to sell him Romeo, but Roberto refused. In order to bind Romeo under a contract, Luini burns the remaining cornfield that belongs to Romeo's family. During this tragedy, Romeo's father receives a head injury which causes blindness. Romeo's family cannot afford to get a doctor for Roberto, as they have lost their livelihood. The doctor's fee is very expensive, as he has to come from a neighbouring village. Romeo decides to sell himself into slavery for 25 francs, and signs a contract to work in Milan for 6 months. Once Roberto has been treated, it is time for Romeo to leave, but just as he leaves he is told that none of the kids ever come back to the village, probably because they succumb to the harsh work conditions. He nonetheless has no choice, and leaves the same day. Along the way he meets a mysterious boy who is unwilling to reveal anything apart from his name, which is Alfredo. They both earn each other's mutual trust and respect after helping each other out. This is also where they meet another boy named Dante. Soon they are taken into a tavern and thrown into the basement where the other kids are kept, Dante included. A few of them try to escape, but in vain. Luini decides that they must be sold as soon as possible before they try to escape again, so he forces the children to cross the lake to Milan by boat in the middle of a storm. Their boat capsizes, but Romeo and Alfredo manage to survive, and everyone else is presumed to be dead. They see Luini drowning, but Romeo's good values do not allow him to let the man sink and he saves him, as he believes that is what his father would do.
Upon arrival in Milan, Romeo and Alfredo are separated and sold to two chimney sweeps, but not before Romeo and Alfredo swear eternal friendship. Romeo is bought by Marcello Rossi. Rossi is thoroughly manipulated by his wife who hates Romeo because of the cost that had to be paid for him, but is actually kind at heart. During one of their routine cleaning days, Romeo meets professor Casella who teaches him how to read. Although Romeo is denied food by Rossi's wife, their ill daughter Angeletta, who Romeo refers to as ""the angel"", helps him by sharing her food with him. Soon, Anzelmo, Rossi's son and a member of a street gang called the Wolf Pack, tricks Romeo into being friends so that he could steal the letter that Angeletta had written for him, but turns out the letter was actually a page from her diary, where she detailed all the lies said by Anzelmo. When the Wolf Pack read it, they mercilessly beat Anzelmo up for lying to them. Anzelmo, hurt badly, swears revenge against Romeo. He blames his wounds on Romeo, knowing that his mother would believe him no matter what, and accuses Romeo of stealing money from the Rossis and they call the police. Angeletta witnesses Anzelmo slipping their parents money into Romeo's bag, but faints due to her serious heart illness before she could reveal the truth. Romeo  manages to escape from the police just in the nick of time but is cornered by the Wolf Pack. Dante appears from nowhere and saves Romeo, who is thrilled to see that Dante is still alive. Meanwhile, Angeletta regains consciousness and reveals the truth to her parents, but Rossi's wife still wants Romeo imprisoned and forbids Rossi to say anything to the police. Dante also urges Romeo to leave the city as he is wanted by the police and helps him get onto a cart he believes is going to Venice. However, Nikita informs Dante that the cart is actually going to the prison, and is driven by criminals who plan to blow up the prison to free one of their own. The criminals lock Romeo up but he manages to escape and warn the police officers and Rossi just in the nick of time and ends up badly injuring himself. Rossi, moved by the act, decides to stand up to his wife and reveals that Angeletta had seen the real thief and he is none other than Anzelmo. After this, Rossi warms up to Romeo much more and greatly improves his living conditions, and learns to stand up to his wife's manipulations. Romeo finally meets Alfredo again, and they grab all the chimney sweepers to form an alliance called the Black Brothers to combat the Wolf Pack. They challenge the Wolf Pack to a bout and win. Giovanni, the leader, returns from a winning fight with the Scorpion gang (who disband to join the Wolf Pack after their defeat), and is outraged to hear that the Wolf Pack had lost to the Black Brothers. In retaliation, he orders his gang to kidnap a boy from the Black Brothers named Michaelo and demand to be handed Alfredo in exchange. When Alfredo refuses to kneel down in front of Giovanni, the latter proposes a battle at dawn. Initially they all fight (except Alfredo), but seeing as no one is able to gain the upper hand, Alfredo asks them to stop. Giovanni agrees and decides to make it a one-on-one fight. Tachioni volunteers to fight from the Wolf Pack and Romeo from the Black Brothers. However, midway Tachioni draws out a blade in spite of Giovanni's instructions to use only fists, luckily the reflection from Romeo's charm blinds Tachioni and he is able to defeat him. Giovanni accepts defeat and praises Alfredo for having good friends, but tells him that they will get even some day. 
Later, Dante and the Wolf Pack begin to notice that Angeletta's mannerism is totally different from the rest of her family, which leads to suspicions of her being adopted. Dante manages to extract part of the truth from his master (who is a close friend of Rossi). Romeo overhears a conversation between Rossi and Angeletta and decides to follow Rossi to a mansion, where it turns out that Angeletta is in fact the granddaughter of lady Isabella, a countess. Isabella's son, Adolfo, fell in love with a poor woman named Giovanna. However, Isabella did not approve of the difference in social status and thus the young couple left after they bore a child. Sadly, the parents passed away due to an illness and Isabella passed on the child to Rossi who was her childhood friend. Isabella is unwilling to let Angeletta into the mansion as she believes the latter is only after her wealth, and Romeo is willing to wager his life to prove her otherwise. Angeletta's condition worsens and she wishes to see her grandmother once before she dies. They sneak into the mansion and Angeletta gets to see her grandmother, but she coldly tells her to go back home. Angeletta, however thanks Isabella for allowing her to meet her and goes to the church to pray. She collapses in between, and goes into a coma. Dr. Casella says the only way to save her would be to take her to his acquaintance in Paris, who is a heart specialist. Romeo, the rest of the Black Brothers and Rossi try their best to convince Isabella, and she finally agrees after being moved by Romeo's devotion and friendship. She meets Angeletta and promises to take care of her in whatever way possible, and the next day, after a farewell, they leave for Paris by train.
In the following days, Romeo notices a huge crowd gathering outside a palace, and it turns out it is the grand wedding of the Duke of Milan. Romeo is called to clean the chimney of the hotel where all the invited nobles and royalties are staying. There, he finds Alfredo's younger sister, Bianca, staying along with her uncle and aunt. She runs away hoping to find her brother and Romeo along with Alfredo begin to search for her. Alfredo is visibly unwell, this could be attributed to the abuse he regularly went through at the hands of his master Citron, a cruel, vile man who spent all his money on drinking and gambling and thus Alfredo often went hungry and beat. Alfredo tells the story of how he and Bianca were the children of the aristocratic Martini family, Vittorio and Fatricia Martini, and how their father's younger brother Mauricio was extremely jealous of his success and wealth. Along with his wife, Grazela, they burn the house which kills Alfredo and Bianca's parents, but not before they hand them the precious treasure of the Martini family, a medal. Alfredo and Bianca flee the burning mansion and their uncle and aunt frame them for the fire in hopes of capturing them and ultimately retrieving the medal. Alfredo and Bianca run for days until they are taken in by a couple, who they beg to let them stay. The God of Death makes his way to the village, and Alfredo willingly sells himself into slavery to provide the family with enough funds to raise Bianca. However, Bianca is captured by their relatives soon after Alfredo sold himself.
Back in the present, Bianca is unable find Alfredo and Mauricio captures her, takes her back to the hotel and ties her up. Luckily, Nikita witnesses Bianca's capture and alerts Romeo and Alfredo. The Black Brothers come through, free her and tie up Bianca's aunt. Mauricio makes his way to the church as he heard that Alfredo was there, but Alfredo creates a distraction and with the help of Nikita, he escapes. Alfredo is re-united with his sister, but collapses and coughs blood. He is taken to professor Casella, who is worried that Alfredo's illness is terminal. Alfredo, however says that he cannot stay any longer and has to go back to his master as his contract is not over yet. Alfredo assures his friends that it was nothing serious and he just had a cold, and the reason he was coughing blood was because he had bit his tongue. Meanwhile, Mauricio orders for a fake medal to be made in order to prove his and Grazela's royalty to the king, while Alfredo and Bianca along with the Black Brothers devise a plan to sneak inside the castle to tell the king the truth. In the background Giovanni watches them, planning to confront Alfredo once and for all. Alfredo has a talk with Romeo and heads home. He is first stopped by Nikita, who is presumably waiting for him. As they talk, though, Alfredo begins to cough blood, while Nikita watches in horror. Alfredo begs her to keep it a secret, as he does not want to worry his friends. As he moves along, he is stopped again by Giovanni, but before the latter could finish the fight, he notices Alfredo's bad coughing and stops right in his tracks. Alfredo thanks him and leaves, making Giovanni uncomfortable. The rest of the Wolf Pack decide on their own to capture Alfredo on the same day he was supposed to meet the king. After trapping Alfredo inside a basement under the bridge, the pack run to Giovanni, who is enraged at their actions. Romeo, meanwhile is able to locate Alfredo as Mr Rossi had seen him go under the bridge. Romeo asks Alfredo to escape while he would stay back to stall the pack. When the pack reaches him, Giovanni is astonished at how dedicated and loyal Romeo is towards Alfredo. Nikita, no longer able to hold back, tells them that Alfredo is dying due to an illness, which happens to be the same illness that killed Giovanni's father, and this is not known to Romeo either. Giovanni decides to help Romeo and his group for the night. 
With the help of the Wolf Pack, they make their way through the castle, defeating Mauricio's bodyguards who try to kill Alfredo and Bianca. Meanwhile, Lady Isabella arrives back in Milan and sees Michaelo, who explains everything to her. Just as Alfredo and Bianca are about to meet the king, Mauricio takes Bianca as hostage, and before he could finish her off Nikita creates a distraction, due to which Alfredo and Romeo fall over the wall into the castle garden, but survive. They are successfully able to make it into the mansion, however the bodyguards capture the children. Luckily for them, Lady Isabella comes through revealing the identities of Alfredo and Bianca to everybody else and asks the bodyguards to leave the kids alone. When they refuse, she orders the king's guards to take them away, saving Alfredo and Bianca's lives. As Mauricio and Grazela are about to present the medal to the king, Alfredo pronounces the medal a fake, and claims he has the real medal. The king allows both parties to narrate their stories and Mauricio attempts to trap Alfredo and Bianca with his evil lies, but Mauricio is not aware of the fact that the king's father had marked something on the real medal- the mark of benediction, to honor the Martini family for showing true bravery in saving his life in war, which was missing from Mauricio's copy, and hence Alfredo and Bianca's names are cleared and their evil relatives are taken away. The Black Brothers celebrate their success before everyone leaves, except Alfredo and Romeo, who go to church, where they remember the moment they first met. Romeo thanks Alfredo for bringing hope into his life. Alfredo smiles, and says it wasn't him who was the ray of hope, but Romeo himself, and he thanks Romeo for bringing courage and hope into his life. Alfredo begins to succumb to his illness, he reminds Romeo of the oath they made- they would always be together, no matter how far away they are from each other, asks Romeo to fulfil the dreams he would not be able to achieve, and asks him to take care of Bianca. And with that, Alfredo peacefully passes away in Romeo's arms, leaving a heartbroken Romeo behind, crying for his dear friend.
Romeo can hardly concentrate on any of his day-to-day activities or work, and this angers the rest of the Black Brothers and Bianca. His refusal to accept Alfredo's death puts a strain on their relations. The Wolf Pack gang, particularly Nikita, were also saddened by Alfredo's death. To get Romeo back into his spirits, the Black Brothers organise a fight, where should he lose, he would be cast out. Romeo makes his way to the fight, and after taking a few punches and listening to Bianca and Dante's pleas, he finally snaps out of his trance, and finally realises what his late best friend had told him. He decides to go around town asking for donations for Alfredo's funeral. At his funeral, they sing the Black Brothers song in honour of Alfredo.
As the new leader of the group, he is presented with a challenge: to gather 20 lira, as they all want to watch the new circus that is in town. Romeo finds an old broken house that needed heavy fixes and repairs. Romeo volunteers to clean and repair the house, and seeing his dedication, the others along with Bianca pitch in too. On the day before the circus leaves, Romeo is unable to complete cleaning the second floor, but the woman is pleased with his efforts and pays him 20 lira anyway. However, Michaelo accidentally breaks a vase, which angers the shopkeeper and he takes Michaelo's pendent which was a gift from his mother. Romeo finds out, and without a moment's hesitation, trades the money for the pendent, a decision everyone agrees and praises him for. Happily, they all sit and share stories from their hometowns till the evening ends. While working one day, Romeo falls from a chimney. Dr. Casella agrees to have him and Bianca at his place until his leg heals. The doctor interests them both in many subjects, and Bianca begins to see Dr. Casella as a father. They help children at an orphanage as well. As a thank-you present, they hold a puppet show for Dr. Casella, where Bianca reveals that she wishes to stay with the doctor and become his nurse, while Romeo wishes to keep studying and become a teacher to educate and help others like Dr. Casella.
In 1876, when spring falls, the time has finally come for Romeo to return home in Sonogno, as his contract is over. Some of the boys have already left and some of them have a while still. Romeo takes his time to wish everyone goodbye, and although Mrs Rossi does not like to admit it, she does miss Romeo. Mr Rossi says that he would probably never get a helper like Romeo again, and Romeo thanks him and calls him his second father. As they are making their way, they see The Reaper with a new batch of kids. They visit Alfredo's grave one last time, where they finally make truce with the Wolf Pack, and Nikita promises to take care of Alfredo's grave. Dr. Casella drives them halfway to their home towns along with Bianca, and they all wish each other goodbyes and best of luck. Romeo returns to Sonogno and re-unites with his family, and 10 years later, in 1886, thanks to his hard work, he becomes a teacher and marries Bianca, and they name their child Alfredo. With that, the anime concludes.
","Romeo's Blue Skies is one of the shorter and more recent additions to the collection of World Masterpiece Theatre series produced and animated by Nippon Animation. Once again it is an adaption of a work of literature originating from Europe, this time based on the novel ""Die schwarzen Brüder"" written by Lisa Tetzner. 
 
 It tells the story of a young boy sold into slavery and bought into a world that he must survive that is far more desolate than that he had ever experienced in the past. It is a look into the life of the poor and oppressed in the face of an unfair society. Showing us the hardships that children sold into slavery and forced to work in far away cities experience, unaware of the inhabitants they will find; but most of important of all this show elaborates on the repercussions of being forced apart from your family.  
 This thematic concern is implemented into the story structure of Romeo's Blue Skies. The show is essentially divided into three distinct arcs and are developed with an epic sense of storytelling where the events of one arc ultimately contribute and effect the events of the next until the story reaches its ultimate conclusion. Throughout these arcs, the underlying theme and tone is always about the repercussions of being forced apart from those who you love. To keep this from becoming a thematically repetitive bore-fest the series does the liberty of investigating and exploring different concerns that can directly correlate to that of the main theme and it achieves this with almost perfect fluidity. Concerns for child abuse, theft, justice, gangs, backstabbing and betrayal all carry the show and make it very engaging. These aspects that are shown are given plenty of attention without ever feeling rushed nor feeling painfully slow, also the transitions between events and these concepts do not seem jarring and have without fail received proper explanation and development each and every time. 
If there was one particular thing I had to complain about it would be some of the narration which at times can be criticized for not leaving enough to one's own interpretation, falling into the trap of telling rather than showing, but these moments are few and far between and I have seen cases of it elsewhere that are far worst. 
 
The characters for the most part each receive good development and are often realistic character types without any notable genre cliche's dominating a characters personality which works in the shows favor. Building on this, the show makes use of this fact by making the characters varied: some being mature, some being downright brats, other's are just living life finding out how to get another penny in their pockets, this makes for a diverse cast and what makes it splendid is that even if two particular characters share a similar objective they are not just simple copycats of one another, each character has their own personal issues and identifiable traits (aside from appearance) that separate them from the others. 
 The show adopts a bildungsroman approach to storytelling developing Romeo's own self-awareness as a character supported strongly by surrounding characters especially that of Alfredo and in the mid-section of the series Angeletta. Romeo has a flexible personality and is able to adopt to the conditions of the environment he is in, allowing him to be able to progress around the hardships that take place. This is shown extremely well and is a most noteworthy effort, he is a complex character who has brilliant chemistry with his surroundings and this is established without ever being forceful. 
 Some complaints can go towards some of the side characters and even some of the older characters for being fairly simple and having only some depth, but nothing too much to complain about here as none of the side characters can be called poorly written and fleshed out as their actions are still grounded and remain reasonable in the context of the situation that the show presents. To give clarification on this without giving away important spoilers, there was one scene in the series that focused on the life of an elderly man and his attitude towards his son receiving a proper education. The son in question wished to become a doctor, much to the disbelief of his father and his father wished to put an end to his son's supposedly foolish aspirations. I thought about this for a bit and whilst it may seem stupid to prevent someone from aspiring to such a career. It can make sense from an economic and social standpoint from the position of the characters. The amount of time that would have to be sacrificed by these individuals who were living in poverty it may seem almost impossible, and the pre-established attitude towards that of doctors for the period would be one thing to consider as well. Doctors cost money to ask for an appointment and that brings about a defeatist pretext to the whole situation where if the man's son were to become a doctor, he would be just like all other doctors, being inaccessible to those who are poor, to those can't afford to have a family member treated for an illness etc etc... 
 There were some other questionable actions by some characters as well throughout the series but nothing so illogical or stupid that drives the whole series under. Outside of these small complaints the writing is consistently high in quality, with fleshed out characters and considerable attention to the detail of the theme's that the show explores. 
 
 Romeo's Blue Skies breaks more of the traditions that are prevalent in many of the WMT series, especially the traditions that were prevalent in the older works of the genre. Probably because of the shortened air time and condensing of the events. Of course some traits still remain, the main characters are young children no older than 12 and are living in a period of struggle (this case slavery and poverty), it is an adventure series despite the location for the most part being the same and last of all there is always a cute little animal on Romeo's shoulder half the time. I want to make a criticism of the last genre trait and how it is used in this particular show, keeping this particular trait is both a detriment and occasionally a strength to the series. It is especially a detriment in the later half. In other WMT series, the animal that usually accompanies the child tends to have a larger role to play and are far more crucial to the operations of the plot. In Romeo's Blue Skies, the fun little side character looses most of his importance early on in the series. Though the animal still come's to aid the plot later on in the series he/she isn't made as effective use of as a plot device. I can appreciate a little animal being there to release some of the tensions seen between characters later in the series because hey this show is for little kids after all, though this may have been the intention it was relatively unsuccessful however as the little animal hardly dampens the mood. 
 
As usual from Nippon Animation, the art is top notch and attractive even by today's standards. The character designs maybe a little flat but that is more of a product of its time, what really shines in the animation depart is the background illustrations. Where the city-scapes are beautiful to be hold. I wish to make mention of a particular scene where you are witnessing a setting sun and this setting sun captures the outline of a church and it's many spires. It is absolutely gorgeous art and can still be appreciated by today's standard of art. As for animation, the series has fluid animation, though some shortcuts were made here and there but for the most part are hard to notice. A couple of complaints can be made though with some notable scenes where the amount of frames per second were seen to be slightly reduced in contrast with some other scenes, but altogether though. It is very well done for hand-drawn animation. With notable attention to background details throughout the most of the series which is a feat considering the time that the show was made. 
The soundtrack is definitely commendable as well, with many orchestral pieces setting the scene beautifully and never feeling inappropriate, most especially helping to drive those feelings home when a scene was particular emotional or on the occasion when a scene was frightening. Ranging from calm and serene to exciting and adrenaline-pumping. On top of this, the voice acting was all top-notch and a characters line's were always in sync with the animation. 
 From a production standpoint, Romeo's Blue Skies is phenomenal the amount of effort that went into the technical aspects of this show is simply awe-inspiring, I couldn't imagine if this was a movie. It would have been better animated then Ghost in the Shell and Akira were. 
 
As a children's show, the show has many excellent moral messages for children showing the importance of education, encouraging and enforcing an understanding and immersion of works of literature and the operations of the way of the world. Teaching how to appreciate the lessons that you learn from your life experiences, be they sad and heartbreaking or pleasant and heartwarming, as one emotion cannot exist without knowledge of the other. To be prepared for your departures from the good and if you aspire to a goal and confront the ways of the world that wish to prevent these goals from ever coming to pass and most of all embracing the warm ending after many turmoils. 
 
This show is a classic series in every sense of the word. Strong storytelling from the first frame to the last and many great, relatable, inspiring characters dominating the screen, it is a great edition to the WMT franchises by Nippon Animation (though for me it is not the best) and Romeo's Blue Skies would be an excellent work for a newcomer to these classic works to experience.

          
 
       Helpful this anime is one of the first series that I have ever watched (that was like 13 years ago) and is undeniably the first to made me cry like a brat kid in a department store (wasn't lying tho haha bc Alfred huhuhu) 
 
The storyline itself is a kickstart, and will make you cringe everytime whenever tragedy occurs (which is very prevalent in the show I must say) but is actually a reality in life. The storyline just keeps on progressing. 
 
The art is outstanding with regards to its background and scenery, not much far from the real terrain of the story (I think it was based from a European story) esp the mountain ranges thingy. The art style for the characters were simple, yet you'll be able to comprehend each and everyone's differences. 
 
The theme song  is very tear jerking, I always wanna grab some tissues when the opening song is playing (very exagerrated tho haha) but no, really, it gives me goosebumps everytime. You might wanna play it over the youtube sometime. I don't know it just brings back memories from childhood bc of its theme. 
 
As for the characters, they were very realistic esp the meanness of the antagonist in the series. You just wanna punch them in the face. The children (protagonist in the series) were very well characterized. 
 
To be honest I really didn't enjoyed it that much bc of too much sad scenes and happenings in the storyline. Again, i always get this feeling to punch the villains in the face. For this show, however, hope is always around the corner which will make you enjoy it eitherway. Sacrificial moments are around the corner, too.  
 
Overall this series is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (prepare some tissues tho) 
You'll enjoy the series, however bc of certain happenings, it will leave some blank space in your heart. Enjoy :) 


          
 
       Helpful I'm watching anime for more than 20 years. I'm a bit picky, which means that I tend to choose certain genres, art styles, plots and all that. Yet, I often watch anime of a kind that would appeal to much younger myself.  
 
Sometimes, I bump into series or movies that I missed earlier. Romeo no Aoi Sora is one of those. 
 
What can I say... Probably, had I have an opportunity to watch that when I was of appropriate age (that was slightly before it appeared, or maybe during the actual first airing) it would greatly influence me in a positive way, as intended. 
 
Of course, you should not judge that series at the same level as complex seinen stuff, not even Hunter×Hunter 2011 that starts like an easygoing motivational thing for middle-schoolers but develops into something way more serious and deep than that. Romeo no Aoi Sora was intended for younger audience, 11–13 yo boys, was kept in line with that targeting and produced much earlier. You should also forgive less-than-realistic depiction of 1860s Italy and Switzerland in terms of muddy streets and dimly lit interiors (for that, go watch 2013 Swiss/German movie Die Schwarzen Bruder based on the same book — that I would like to translate into Russian if I manage to get my hands on an English edition), as well as some “deus ex machina” moments and plot shortcuts. Yet, I could barely stop myself from watching all 33 episodes in one go, stretching the process for three days. I imagine how restless I would become if that series would air in 1990s Russia and I would face a probability of missing an episode (and, well, to wait for a week for the next episode would be a torture). 
 
There are very few titles (and books in general) that are equally appropriate for boys of said age... And for many adults. This is a must-watch. I can't wait for my nephews to grow up to show them this thing (among others). 
 
Why a must-watch? Values. Friendship, trust, good-natured stubbornness, kindness, openness, fair judgement —?things that our real world woefully lacks throughout all its history.  
 
Also, sheer emotional power: even being closer to 40 than to 30 and witness to too many things I would rather not even know about, I could barely contain tears during certain moments (call that sentimentality of an aged boy or whatever, but...). I think that a twelve-year-old myself would weep and wail, despite that even then a book, a movie or an animation had to be much more than a melodrama to get that kind of compassion from me towards characters.  
 
Bottom line. If you want to watch an anime that can make you better as a person, this is the right thing. If you have a cynical young teen (or a tween that can become one) at your hands, make him watch it.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"SHORT 1 - Final Flight of Osiris (dir. Andy Jones and prod. SQUARE USA) 
So, this short only really exists to set up Matrix Reloaded as well as Enter the Matrix (greeeaaaattt), and in spite of a well choreographed opening fight scene, it quickly devolves into gray mush with muzzle flashes. It suffers slightly from Star Wars prequel-itis, yes it is tying directly into events of the film I like and yes I do recognise the iconography, but the reason these shorts exist is to expand the universe beyond what was seen before. FFoO meanwhile does very little to expand the universe, stylistically ressembles a Matrix themed Second Life server, and is a boring slog to begin with. This short should've been called The Blue Pill because it sure as hell put me to sleep. 
2/10 
 
SHORT 2 - The Second Renaissance Parts 1 & 2 (dir. Mahir Maeda and prod. Studio4oC) 
Now this is where we should have started, detailing the conception and subsequent rise of machines, it's an interesting expansion of this world. The visuals are interesting with overall fine designs, the main focus are the machines and they look great, but the humans all look very bland bar a few close up shots with some interesting shots with a portrayal of them being extremely animalistic. It's also one of the more intense and mature execution of the robot uprising idea, with neither the message of ""human bad"" nor ""technology bad"" it shows the conflict without bias with both sides being given a part to flesh (or metal) out their motives. 
7/10 
 
SHORT 3 - Kid's Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oc) 
Whilst The Second Renaissance showed a larger conflict as whole, this short shows the personal stakes of a Neo-like character living in the Matrix whilst questioning his reality. The sketchy visuals with the fluid almost jittery movements is an amazing portrayal of the characters perception of the Matrix. Although an extremely simple short it's effective in its execution with a brilliant soundtrack to couple some interesting animation and it really does a good job at justifying this collection's existence as a whole since it and the previous short have already displayed the diversity of Matrix as an IP. 
9/10 
 
SHORT 4 - Program (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse) 
Kid's Story was more about animation in motion, meanwhile Program is extremely picturesque and beautiful with a further exploration of small scale conflicts found within the resistance groups, it was extremely effective in both tying familiar iconography with unique ideas, the use  of paper doors as an obstacle was a cool moment, the simulations bleeding code was very nice, and overall the samurai setting is a brilliant set up that gives this short its own identity. 
8/10 
 
SHORT 5 - World Record (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse) 
And it's a sports anime now, no but seriously as expected from Madhouse it's got some amazing animation, my main description would be ""Redline - except my car broke down"" and you can really see those aesthetics in this short almost 4 years prior. It's an interesting addition to this collection and also a very unique spin on a sports story like this, I probably would've preferred if Matrix Reloaded was about this guy instead. My only real complaint is it's placement, we just got a Kawajiri/ Madhouse short, so it somewhat nullifies the complete variety displayed prior, that being said the style is still different enough with more exaggerated faces as well as a larger emphasis on  movement and a more naturalistic environment that breaks into some unique visuals in the sequence with the Smiths (Agents, not Morissey). 
7/10 
 
SHORT 6 - Beyond (dir. Kouji Morimoto and prod. Studio4oC) 
It wasn't at all surprising when I checked Morimoto's page and spotted Tekkon Kinkreet inhabiting his body of work, this is definitely my second favourite stylistically and in motion it's an absolute treat. I see why Thor: Dark World directly ripped this scene into their movie (yeah Marvel, I fucking noticed). There isn't really much else to analyse with this short, I adore the aesthetic, it fully utilises it's format as a short to tell a concise yet realised story. 
10/10 
 
SHORT 7 - A Detective Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oC) 
Watanabe is back and hey look, it's my favourite! I love how it blends the Matrix universe with a film noir/ manga aesthetic, it was definitely a smart choice putting this towards the end seeing as it seems to tie directly into the films somewhat with the appearance of main character (okay, yeah Neo and Trinity showed up in Kid's Story, but Trinity is like the central focus). The writing is sharp, the soundtrack is amazing and the mystery while small is still very fun. My only complaint is it seems t be cut a tad short, but when my complaint is that I want more, that's not really a complaint. I would love to see Watanabe do a detective series sometime since this style very much suits him. 
10/10 
 
SHORT 8 -Matriculated (dir. Peter Chung and prod. DNA) 
I was awaiting a short to explore the spirituality of Matrix, sadly they saved it for last, conceptually the short has interesting themes with the humans somewhat reprogramming a machine by making it feel like a human almost. Aesthetically in its backgrounds it is gorgeous and the sequence wherein they explore this weird space within the machine is rife with Buddhist imagery and interesting ways of bending the reality. Aside from that, this short is ugly as sin, the awful proportions, the nauseating use of CGI that just doesn't meld well with the rest of the scene and good lord the outside world is so mind-numbingly dull, sadly we visit there often. 
5/10 
 
IN CONCLUSION: If the first and last shorts were cut, this would be amazing, but with those two bad apples I would say this is just pretty great, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to just about anyone, but not without a ""skip the first short and the last short, they kinda suck"" prefacing it. Definitely a perfect companion for the Matrix and a much preferable addition to the series than Reloaded or Revolution.

          
 
       Helpful I’m not a big fan of The Matrix trilogy, one of the more mainstream science fiction spectacles of the past twenty years. When I was a kid, I loved it. It was my first R-rated movie, it was dark and edgy like any kid is bound to like, and it had neat martial arts action. But as I grew older I finally watched the second and third films and began to hate the series. Anymore, probably thirteen or so years after watching The Matrix for the first time, I think it’s overrated and I can’t see the appeal. It hasn’t aged well and that, on top of pretty bad storytelling as the movies continued, led me to neglect the series for years… 
 
Until now. I never watched the Animatrix, I don’t think I had any intention to after Revolutions. So now, years later, allow me to break down the pieces that comprise the Animatrix and tell you which are good and which are bad. 
 
Final Flight of the Osiris-Written by the Wachowski brothers and animated by Square, this nine minute segment looks like the opening cutscene of a PS2 game. It starts with an entirely pointless fight where two characters cut the clothes off each other. They are suddenly pulled out of the simulation as Sentinels are chasing down their ship in the real world. What follows is a six minute sequence ending in a climax that isn’t satisfying, nor really matters. This entire short is nothing more than an introduction to the style of The Matrix rather than pulling us in early on. The writing is lame, the CG is very dated, and you’ll find nothing of value here. 
 
The Second Renaissance Part I-The second short details events before The Matrix, namely the divide between humans and machines. What you’ll find here is an interesting background story about humans and machines having a schism that leads to animosity and violence. The machines build their own nation, wind up creating better technologies and having more valuable currency, which doesn’t make humanity happy at all. This is all visualized stunningly, with many disturbing images as well as copies of real life historical moments such as the tank running a robot down a la Tienanmen Square. A fan of the movies will enjoy this history lesson. 
 
The Second Renaissance Part II-While containing some of the fantastic visuals of part one, part two is a lot less compelling. The humans put a dome around the Earth so the machines can’t operate on solar power leading to a war that ends with the machines realizing they can harvest energy from human brains. Thus the Matrix was born. This part was pretty stupid. While the first part set up the idea of a smart science fiction story, the second reveals how ridiculous the plot of the series really is and how much the Wachowski’s love to ruin good ideas with nonsense. If you watched the first part, watch the second, but be forewarned, it’s stupid. 
 
Kid’s Story-The first visually appealing short from an artistic standpoint, Kid’s Story is directed by my biggest adversary in the directing world, Shinichiro Watanabe. A high school kid realizes he’s inside of the Matrix, leading to agents coming after him while Neo guides him toward escape. While not the most impressive in plot, the animation is gorgeous. For style alone, I’d suggest this segment. It’s the best of the bunch. 
 
Program-A shorter piece, this one is another visual feast that concentrates on two people fighting over ideologies in a feudal Japanese setting. The action here is crisp, the dialogue is pretty smart, but it, penultimately, doesn’t matter. I feel that to have a good short here, you need a beginning, middle, and end, not just a singular idea that doesn’t go anywhere. Program is nice, but I still don’t see how this is enriching me any further in the world of The Matrix. 
 
World Record-Here is the story of an Olympic racer who runs so fast he breaks the Matrix while some agents go after him to keep him locked within the program. That’s it. The animation isn’t that great, the story isn’t exciting, and I think this may have been the weakest segment so far. 
 
Beyond-A pretty good short about a group of kids discovering a glitchy area in their town and exploiting the glitches for fun. While again not telling a compelling story this one does give us an idea of the process that is gone through to repair problems in the Matrix. It has good animation and ideas, but it’s an otherwise unremarkable piece. 
 
A Detective Story-Another piece from Shinichiro Watanabe, this one is a noir adventure about a detective who is recruited to track down the hacker known as Trinity. From the outset you can see and hear the style (of course, very typical of Watanabe). This one’s a good short with an actual plot, neat design, and it ties into the movies, making it feel more relevant. 
 
Natriculated-This one is made by the people who gave us Aeon Flux and is another eh on my part. It’s got the trademark style of Flux but I wasn’t impressed by the story nor did I find it to be exciting in any regard. As a finale, it’s weak. 
 
The Animatrix is a very mixed bag. There are a couple of notable segments but it’s just about as underwhelming as the actual Matrix movies. If you’re a fan of the movie series, then you’ll find some enjoyment here, but if not it’s an  lame grab bag of great talents producing mostly half-assed shorts.

          
 
       Helpful The first Matrix is in my opinion one of the best science fiction films ever made and a real masterpiece. The follow up Reloaded is very flawed but still enjoyable. Revolutions on the other hand is just an awful ending to the trilogy. After watching the trilogy again I decided it was finally time to watch The Animatrix which I had heard very positive things about. The Animatrix consists of nine different shorts set in the Matrix universe (two of which are a two part story) the rest are not related. They are done by different directors and studios which gives all the shorts their own unique feel. The first short ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is CG and the rest are traditional animation. The directors who were involved are: Andy Jones, Mahiro Maeda, Shinichirō Watanabe, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Kōji Morimoto and Peter Chung. While all the short films are not on the same level of quality I will say there was not one that I found I didn't enjoy. The first short was perhaps my least favorite and even it was okay. What I love about these shorts is how they add and expand upon the ideas of the Matrix universe. The two part short The Second Renaissance Part details how exactly the world became taken over by machines and why it is in the state it is in the Matrix films. Another short details how Kid from The Matrix Reloaded was brought out of the Matrix. Grading individual categories for this would be difficult as the shorts are all in different styles but I will say I really enjoyed all of them. The Animatrix isn't perfect however and there are some issues I had with it. The first short could've been expanded upon a bit more so it didn't feel like filler. Also some of the characters could've been fleshed out a bit more even though these are all shorts some definitely had better characters than others. There is also the short called Program which started out excellent but the ending ruined the themes of it for me.  
 
Overall as a fan of The Matrix I really enjoyed this film and felt it had a great place in the universe. I do however recommend watching the Matrix trilogy before this as it you'll be able to see the ties this has to it.

Only when he has found the Kingdom of Hades will his crew be free of their curse and he will be able to return to Earth and to his beloved Penelope. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","Narrator: It is the 31st century, Ulysses killed the giant cyclops when he rescued the children and his son Telemachus. But the ancient gods of Olympus are angry and threatened a terrible revenge.
Zeus: Mortals, you defy the gods? I sentence you to travel among unknown stars. Until you find the Kingdom of Hades, your bodies will stay as lifeless as stone!
Shirka: Ulysses, the way back to earth has been wiped from my memory!
Telemachus: Father, oh, father!

Ulysses: You are alive my son!
The series (made by the French Jean Chalopin) follows the struggles of Ulysses and his crew against the divine entities that rule the universe, the ancient gods from Greek mythology. The Gods of Olympus are angered when Ulysses, commander of the giant spaceship Odyssey, kills the giant Cyclops to save a group of enslaved children, including his son. Zeus sentences Ulysses to travel the universe with his crew frozen until he finds the Kingdom of Hades, at which point his crew will be revived and he will be able to return to Earth. Along the way they encounter numerous other famous figures from Greek mythology who have been given a futuristic twist.
","Ulysse 31 illustrates perfectly the idea that combining different cultures expertise may lead to a wonderful result as this anime is a Japanese French production involving artists from both countries. It was made at a time Producers not only want to entertain children but also educate them (in this case about Greek Mythology) in the framework of an anime with a good artistic value. Other examples of such policies are Les mysterieuses cites d’or (The mysterious cities of Gold) and il etait une fois l’homme (once upon a time..man). 
 
  Ulysse 31, as you have understood,is a futuristic transposition of the Odyssey epic poem and the scene takes place just after the war of Trojan. We follow the adventures and ordeals of Ulysses, young Telemachus and the mysterious Themis throughout their galactic voyage. 
 
The story is based (faithfully or loosely depending on the episode) on the Odyssey and each episode unravels a new mystery that Ulysses have to discover, a new charismatic character that Ulysses have to confront with or a new barrier that the Gods have set for Ulysses. Will he finally reach the Kingdom of Hades and return to the warm heart of his Beloved Penelope? 
 
 The story is simply excellent and raises several concepts and ideas such as love, tyranny, religion, fate,drugs, the redundancy of human life... an excellent mean to stimulate a child curiosity and mind as this anime was aim for children. Moreover and this is quite bold, there is not always a happy ending for each episodes : some are tragic, a reminder that life can be harsh sometime... Thanks to the work of Jean Chalopin and Nina Wolmark (Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea : les mondes engloutis). 
 
 Art and animation are surprinsigly good for an anime of that period even by Today's Standards.  This is mainly due to the  famous duo of Shingo Araki / Michi Himeno's Work (Goldorak/Grendizer, cat's eyes, Lady Oscar, Saint Seiya...) and the technical mecha design of Manchu (AKA Philippe Bouchet).  
 
Music score is nice to listen to and match the anime ambiance by its synthpop features.  
 
Most Characters are well conceived and they have their own development. It is easy to identify with them and feel some empathy towards their ordeals. 
 
The French dubbing had involved professional Dramatic Art Theater actors voices (especially Jean Topar) and are consequently very enjoyable. The English Dubbing seems well made as well. 
 
 Overall no matter how old you are, this is truly a must see masterpiece and a good introduction to Greek Mythology in general. 
 
 
 
 
 
  

          
 
       Helpful The tale of Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin) and his many struggles and trials by the Gods as he quests to get back to his beloved Penelope, is the purest definition of a classic. Indeed being one of the earliest existent works of Western literature yet still read and well known tells a far greater tale of its epicness that any words I can offer ever will. So it should come as no surprise then that it has had many retellings, adaptations and allusions over the years, one only has to read James Joyce's famous novel aptly named Ulysses for a perfect example of a modern retelling. With that said it was rather inevitable that such a classic would get an animated adaption, and who better suited to undertake this Odyssey (eh! eh! Get it…)  than Jean Chalopin, creator of such classics as Mysterious cities of Gold, another delightful pseudo historical adventure series.  
 
Created in the wonderfully bizarre world that was the 80s, Ulysses 31 incorporates everything one would expect from such an endeavour, complete with a classic soundtrack, abstract visuals and a crazy future sci-fi setting, Ulysses 31 can really only be summed up in one sentence, ""Only in the 80s…"" 
 
As previously mentioned the story is loosely based on The Odyssey by Homer, except set in space… please take as long as you need to allow the full weight of that sentence to sink in…  
 
For those not familiar with this tale (please leave your caves and take your heads out of your …) the  basic story is that of Odysseus/Ulysses journey home from the Trojan war to Greece. However he angers the Gods by killing their cyclops and so most partake in many challenges and trials in order to return home to his beloved wife Penelope. Ulysses 31 takes the basic premise of this but changes several things, such as having his son Telacmacus with him rather than at home, being set space, etc. It  also incorporates many other classic greek and roman myths, with a futuristic twist of course. Such as the tale of Sisyphus cursed by the gods to roll a bolder up a hill only to have it roll back down every time, (almost as painfully futile as reading many a youtube comment), or crossing paths with such famous deities as the Sphinx or Chronos the God of time. All of this gives the series one of its greatest strengths, its educational value, imparting ancient tales and moral lessons all the while being exciting and and abstractly bizarre, the series really succeeds in what few series even bother to try anymore, to make enlightening entertainment.  
 
Mostly told through episodic stories, Ulysses 31 largely involves Ulysses searching for the route back to earth while trying to escape the many traps set for him by the Gods or help others who are also under the omnipotently oppressive thumb of Zeus. An episodic style like this can often present frustration to the viewer by potentially becoming repetitive or lacking in consequence, however Ulysses 31 manages to find a good balance, incorporating all the individual stories fluently into the main quest of returning home without it becoming cyclical. However some may feel that the story would have been better severed with one or two story arch's, particularly with regard to the end, however this is a small nitpick. For the most part it all works like a swiss clock, granted some episodes are better than others, the adaptation of the story of Calypso being a good example of one of the better episodes, but even the less memorable ones are more than made up for with their visuals and music. 
 
On the topic of the visuals and music, their probably the most endearing aspect of the show, despite being over 30 years old, enough time for any series to lose its lustier, it still looks topnotch. Any fan of hand drawn animation will be pleasantly rewarded for viewing this series. Add to that the fanatically unique and ostentatiously 80s depiction of future space, complete with huge starships, monsters, aliens, weird planets, laser swords (and shields), robots, cyborgs and everything that one has come to expect from sci-fi space adventures and you get a memorable experience to say the least. They say the mark of  a good show is whether or not it stays with you, and thanks to some imagination, stark visuals and creative artistry, Ulysses 31 won't  soon fall into the void of nothingness where so many bland shows ultimately gather.  
 
The soundtrack to Ulysses 31's is again topnotch and like so much of this show, very much a product of its time. From its kickass opening ""Galactic Legend Odyssey"" to the awesomely 80s style action music to the quieter more sombre pieces the series really is worth watching for the soundtrack alone, in fact its worth it  just to hear that opening 26 times…  
Jean Chalopin really is a master of using music to elevate the emotions of his series', something he outdid himself with in Mysterious Cities of Gold but even here we can see the master at work, knowing exactly what to play where and when to bring out the full potential of his creation. They say sound is 60% of any movie or series and thats very much true with regards to Ulysses 31. However listening to some parts of the music one feels that the show  was vey much inspired by (blatantly ripped off) the original star wars soundtracks, in fact one can even see this with regard to the visuals (laser swords/lightsaber etc) and some of the nosies the robots make sound very similar (are exactly the same) to R2-D2's famous beep noises. I believe this even led to the series being sued by Lucas Film at one point... C'est la vie. 
 
 
With all that said however, probably the weakest aspect of the series is its characters, this is an inevitable consequence of the episodic nature of Ulysses 31 but there are also more substantial reasons for it. Ulysses 31 is at its core an adventure series, its not really driven by its characters so much as it is driven by the action and the feeling of a grand quest. In this way the characters are sort of set pieces that never really change or evolve, Ulysses is calm, knowledgeable and badass, he  will never lose hope or abandon his friends, he was like that at the beginning and remains so at the end. Interestingly Ulysses greatest weakness from the original Odyssey, his arrogance, is missing from this adaption, 'tis a shame…  
The other characters are also pretty much just one trick ponies, Telamacus simply wants to returns to return home and doesn't  shut up about it, Yumi simply wants her brother back and doesn't shut up about it, while Nono their robot companion is your standard mildly annoying comic relief that all shows back then were required by international law to have for some unknown reason. Ulysses himself is interesting and awesome enough to enjoy despite the lack of any real growth or interesting faults that would make him relatable but like i said the focus of the series is really on the individual adventures rather than on the characters and in that regard the show works quite well.  
 
To culminate, Ulysses 31 is an fascinating travel through time, ironically not forwards but backwards, to an age when shows were not aimed at any particular age or audience and everyone could come away having enjoyed something from it, to a period when you could make a series that was not only awesome but be a retelling of a 3000 year old Ancient greek poem. Despite its age, or rather thanks to it, the series manages to take its place among some of the best animated classics of the 80s, up there with Mysterious cities of gold, TMNT etc. It has its faults to be sure, but with its creative visuals, funky music and timeless story its one voyage thats earned its tittle as a true odyssey.

","Edens Bowy was one of those anime i glanced at and thought it would be rather dry and sad in comparison to other anime of its time, i was wrong. I found great enjoyment when watching this anime, it seemed a lot more mature than it looked and used a lot of themes that a mature audience may appreciate more. 
 
Visually Edens Bowy is great in most aspects, i think they made the female lead very badly with her gigantic elf ears and pulled back hair. It makes her look more like a alien than anything else. I consider this a major problem since its hard to for me to see past her design even her colors kinda throw me off cause it goes /brown/off pink/puke green as you scan down her body. She reminds me of a really  distance cousin of one of the girls from Oh My Goddess with her forehead symbols and such.The main lead resembles quite a few male leads from the early 90s to 80s with his red hair, blue clothes and largely over sized sword.   
 
I felt some of the best art was in the villains and landscapes/city's. I think the Gods themselves set themselves a huge distance away from anything else in the show visually and i liked that cause it gave them a very strong presence and serious tension when they appear. I also liked the backgrounds and general artistry of the the upper city, it reminds me a lot of a lot of other great anime of that time who used themes like past advanced civilizations and future technology existing in a small segment of the world. 
 
The characters of Edens Bowy feel very right for the plot in most instances, i feel like the main characters could have been a little older to make the show look a little more serious though. I also acknowledge the theme of using young characters is because they want to create a greater feeling of helplessness and fighting against fate and such. Having children face God,Creation and Existence itself is a heavy theme and tossed in with romance you can see them struggle harder and harder for a more triumphant outcome. 
 
Ultimately i think Edens Bowy is something i have truly and honestly enjoyed in its entirety. With a few improvements it could have been a highly acclaimed classic. I feel like if you have a interest in classic anime you should really give this a watch since it is a very forgotten yet enjoyable title. I can also see where other people would be critical of this anime but i think if you give it a honest chance you will walk away enjoying it.

          
 
       Helpful A really great series and you can find a dub version out there. I tried to watch this once and discarded it because it had an older artwork look. I came across it again and watched two episodes and was hooked. Not only does it have a great storyline, but it also has some comedy mixed in that makes you laugh. Not many anime actually humor me. 

          
 
       Helpful Eden’s Bowy made for a solid fantasy/ adventure series focused on the journey of Yorn, Elisiss and Ulger Dyne as they tried tracking down the whereabouts of Yorn’s father and dealt with hostilities they faced from those in the floating cities of Yulgaha and Yaunes. The series does a great job at fleshing out many of its prominent characters and exploring the world in which Eden’s Bowy takes place. Many of the characters that the series focuses on are involved with and have had tragic pasts and developments that they are trying to overcome while dealing with the hostilities from the actions of authority figures in both of the floating cities. The most interesting of these developments for me came from the story concerning Hairra’s origins which proves to be quite the tragic one and effects the developments of Fennis and Vito’s characters throughout the series as they handle her not so normal situation and being pawns of the crooked Yulgaha priests.  
 
The show also does a solid job at its world building to establish the different societies that those on the ground, Yulgaha and Yaunes have. Yulgaha and Yaunes are seen as very sophisticated societies in the future setting of Eden’s Bowy which shows itself rather well with the seemingly modern city landscape of Yulgaha and the futuristic like environment of Yaunes. This is considerably different compared to the barbaric and feudal lifestyles and clothing that those on the surface experience and dress in on a regular basis. The series does resort to the typical “science vs religion” clash between Yaunes and Yulgaha as their societies are governed by both respectively (Yaunes uses mecha, Yulgaha having six magical priests) and use them as their primary means of combat. 
 
In terms of plotting, Eden’s Bowy switches its focus between the differing factions and characters seen throughout the series with Yorn’s group, the six Yulgaha priests, Hairra and her group, Yaunes leader Nyako and her two incompetent cohorts and Yorn’s rival Spike Randit. The series takes its time unraveling the true nature and goals of these various characters and factions with the first half mostly focused on exploring its world and the situations faced by its characters yet dropping hints of tensions developing between the factions and motives of the characters. The second half is when the plot starts to escalate when Yulgaha and Yaunes finally go at each other’s throats, some characters come to terms with the problems they have faced throughout the show and we come to learn more of the mysteries surrounding a few key characters alluded to from earlier episodes. The show reasonably explores its world and develops both its plot and characters within its 26 episodes without leaving behind too many loose ends. 
 
If there is one major problem I had with Eden’s Bowy, it would have to be that those within Yaunes are quite underdeveloped compared to what we see of Yorn’s group, Spike and characters within Yulgaha. For the most part, characters in Yaunes seemed to be used as some form of comic relief throughout the series, especially in the case with Nyako’s two incompetent cohorts she sends to capture Yorn. While comedic moments with these characters were effective for the most part and didn’t do too much in killing the more serious mood of Eden’s Bowy in later episodes, it would have been nice if these characters were given more serious moments for me to connect with them, especially as the only Yaunes character with any reasonable development was Nyako’s niece/ second-in-command. 
 
In terms of presentation, Eden’s Bowy does have a solid visual presentation with clean details and good color shading with its settings and character designs. It does a good job at showing detail and vastness with a diverse number of environments such as a desert, mountain areas and the city environments of both Yaunes and Yulgaha. Character designs have a decent amount of detail applied to them and are appealing on the eyes as well. The show does usually resort to animation shortcuts such as reused and still frames, but the quality does improve in later episodes and has its moments during battle scenes.  
 
Eden’s Bowy did a solid job in keeping me entertained throughout its 26-episode run. The series did a good job at developing and exploring its world and characters, as well as slowly building up its plot while adding in the occasional comedy moments with the characters to ease the mood from tense developments or a couple filler episodes. This is a definite watch if you are looking for a good fantasy/ adventure anime to get into, especially as this title seems to be fairly obscure to most anime fans.

Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris (アメストリス, Amesutorisu). In this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who work for the government are known as State Alchemists (国家錬金術師, Kokka Renkinjutsushi) and are automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by Truth (真理, Shinri), a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.
Attemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the Gate of Truth (真理の扉, Shinri no Tobira), where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis, heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosopher's Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones are used to create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins; Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other, and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.
There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of Central City (セントラルシティ, Sentoraru Shiti), along with other military cities such as the northern city of Briggs (ブリッグズ, Burigguzu). Towns featured include Resembool (リゼンブール, Rizenbūru), the rural hometown of the Elrics; Liore (リオール, Riōru), a city tricked into following a cult; Rush Valley (ラッシュバレー, Rasshu Barē), a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and Ishbal, a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is Xing. Heavily reminiscent of China, Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris's government-controlled election of a Führer. It also has its own system of alchemy, called alkahestry (錬丹術, rentanjutsu), which is more medical and can be bi-located using kunai; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.
Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter having left without reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. But the transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.
The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar, who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people's genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward's limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, Winry Rockbell, the Elrics meet Dr. Marcoh, who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher's Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang's friend Maes Hughes continues the Elrics' research and finds out about a government conspiracy, but is killed by the homunculus Envy. The Elrics learn that Izumi also performed human transmutation, having attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Greed, but is rescued by Amestris' leader King Bradley. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi's creator, Father. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 
After meeting the Xingese prince Lin Yao, who seeks a Philosopher's Stone to cement his position as heir to his country's throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes's murder. Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes' murder, so Mustang fakes Ross's death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills Lust. Lin captures Gluttony, who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony's stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father's plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as ""human sacrifices"". Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess May Chang, fires the corrupt official Yoki, and kidnaps Dr. Marcoh.
The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General Olivier Armstrong. They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher's Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the ""Promised Day"". Forced to work with Solf Kimblee, a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee's chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Riza Hawkeye discovers that King Bradley's son Selim is the homunculus Pride. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an immortal when Father arranged the fall of Cselkcess four centuries ago and had been working since then to stop Father.
The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an eclipse and ‘human sacrifices’ — alchemists who have performed human transmutation — to trigger the transmutation, with Wrath and Pride forcing Mustang to perform human transmutation to make him a sacrifice. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father's minions, with Kimblee and almost all of the Homunculi dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle and absorbs the superior being. Hohenheim and Scar activate countermeasures, draining much of Father's absorbed souls, and rendering him unstable. The Elrics and their comrades face Father in a final battle, in which Greed sacrifices himself to protect Lin. Alphonse, his armor almost destroyed, sacrifices his soul to restore Edward's right arm. Edward defeats Father, who is dragged into the Gate of Truth, from which he was created. Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to fully restore Alphonse from an impressed Truth, while Lin receives a Philosopher's Stone. Hohenheim goes to visit Trisha's grave, where he dies peacefully.
The Elrics return home and separate two years later to further research alchemy. Years later, Edward and Winry marry and have two children.

Fullmetal Alchemist is a mega success, specially the Brotherhood anime. Proof of that is the fact that it's ranked number 2 in this page, since who knows how many months. And, as with any successful product, OVA, specials and movies are created. Unfortunately, in most cases, these products tend to be mediocre at best, therefore, prudent consumers often face these creations with skepticism, or directly not expecting much. So, i watched Brotherhood's special with the intention of having fun, but not expecting anything great or mind blowing. I mean, four fifteen minutes long self conclusive episodes? What could you get of that?. A lot. This is one of the few cases in wich the product took me by surprise. Let's see why... 
 
Like I said, there are four episodes, each with a different story. 
The first episode, ""The Blind Alchemist"", shows us the Elric brothers arriving to a mansion, attracted by a strange rumor about Jude, the blind alchemist. Like the brothers, he also broke the taboo and tried to revive someone... but unlike Ed and Al, he was more successful... 
 
The second episode, ""Simple People"", is about how Ed want to give a present to Winry, so she doesn't get too mad (and by mad, I mean wrench assault) for his usual automail wrecking. So, the brothers try to buy her forgiveness with some earrings. 
 
The third episode, ""Tales of the Master"", is about the training of an 18 years old Izumi in Briggs. Maybe less experienced than in her adulthood, but healthier, and badass as usual, we'll see how exactly she became a legend/nightmare for the soldiers of that place.  
 
The fourth and final episode, ""Yet Another Man's Battlefield"", is the Mustang chapter (because, come on, could you imagine a special creation of FMA without him? That would be a commercial suicide!). Not the adult, full prepared Flame alchemist, but the 18 years old student in the military academy. We'll see his studies, his problems, and his rivalry with an equally young Maes Hughes. 
 
The interesting thing about these stories is that are so very well written, that they could be a part of the manga (or the Brotherhood anime). Episodes 2 and 3 have lots of comedic and touching moments, while 1 and 4 are more dramatic and serious. I want to highlight the first episode (my personal favorite, by the way), which touches the reason that motivates the Elrics to do what they do (you know... try to recover their bodies without dying). 
 
The animation is superb, as in the main series. The character design is excellent, changing from ""normal"" to ""SD"" in a totally normal, funny way (specially noted with Ed, Al, Winry and Izumi). The alchemy is colorful (with bolts of electricity flying in all directions, buildings structures that changes, or are directly destroyed), and the landscapes are equally beautiful and colorful (especially Risembool, with the fields, prairies and all that... Ishval, on the other hand, is quite brown, which according to the current cultural parameters, means that it's very realistic xD). 
 
The voices are the same form the Brotherhood anime, so good job there. As for the new characters the more destacable is Jude seiyuu: Show Hayami (Aizen in Bleach, Devilman in Devilman, Zarbon in Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka in Fate/Zero, Archer in the first FMA series, and a long etc). The music is also the typical in FMA, although there is no opening nor ending. For any of the episodes. That's weird... but hey, not that serious (although, it would have been awesome if Yui, Asian Kung-fu Generation or L'Arc~en~Ciel were involved in this project...). 
 
So... what do we have here? A surprise and a very nice one. The episodes are truly in the league of the original creation. I cannot imagine a greater compliment. In four chapters we have comedy, action, drama, alchemy and lots of emotion (and sadly, nothing of Armstrong...). As I said before, this really looks like a part of the series, especially Izumi's training (which is mentioned in the manga) and Mustang's education. 
This is not recommended, this is mandatory for any fan of Brotherhood (and seeing the ranking of this page, there are a lot of them n_n). Watch this and enjoy, since high quality specials/OVAS are not that abundant... 
-------- 
Fullmetal Alchemist es un mega éxito, eso es innegable. Prueba de ello es que en esta misma pag esta rankeada número 2 desde quien sabe cuánto tiempo. Y como con todo producto exitoso, se crean OVAS, especiales y películas. Desafortunadamente, en la mayoría de los casos, estos productos suelen ser inferiores a la obra original, por lo que, los consumidores prudentes suelen verlas con cierto escepticismo, o no esperando gran cosa. Yo encare los especiales de Brotherhood de esa forma: esperaba divertirme un rato, pero no imaginaba que fuera nada del otro mundo. O sea, 4 capítulos auto conclusivos de solo 15 minutos? Que se puede esperar de tan poco?. Mucho. Este es uno de los pocos casos en el que el producto me tomo por sorpresa. Veamos por que... 
 
Como dije, hay cuatro capítulos, cada uno con una historia diferente.  
El primer capítulo, “El alquimista ciego”, nos muestra a los hermanos Elric arribando a una mansión, atraídos por un extra?o rumor acerca de Jude, el alquimista ciego. Al igual que los hermanos, el también intento revivir a alguien... pero a diferencia de Ed y Al, el tubo más éxito. 
 
El segundo capítulo, “Gente común”, trata de cómo temiendo por las represalias de Winry por haber roto su brazo tan rápido, Ed y Al deciden comprarle a su mejor amiga unos aros, con la esperanza de apaciguar su ira (que usualmente involucra agresiones con llaves inglesas). 
 
El tercer capítulo, “Cuentos de la maestra” es sobre el entrenamiento de Izumi (de solo 18 a?os) en Briggs, y como fue exactamente que se convirtió en una leyenda/pesadilla para los soldados del lugar. 
 
El cuarto y último capítulo, Yet Another Man's Battlefield, es sobre los días de Mustang (personaje que no podía quedarse afuera de estos especiales, o varias cabezas hubieran rodado :P) en la academia militar, sus estudios, y su rivalidad con Maes Hughes.  
 
Lo interesante de estas historias es que no solo están muy bien escritas, si no que tranquilamente podrían ser parte del manga. Los capítulos 2 y 3 tienen sus momentos cómicos y conmovedores, mientras que el 1 y el 4 son bastante serios, sin llegar a ser dramáticos al nivel del primer anime. Particularmente quería destacar el primer capítulo, que toca de lleno la motivación de los Elric para hacer lo que hacen. 
 
El apartado técnico es impecable. La animación es soberbia, al igual que en la serie. El dise?o de personajes es excelente, rotando de forma esporádica entre “normales” y chibi de forma totalmente natural. La alquimia es vistosa  (con rayos de electricidad volando para todos lados, edificios que ven sus estructuras modificadas o directamente destruidos) y los paisajes son hermosos y muy coloridos (especialmente Risembool, con sus campos, praderas y todo eso... Ishval es bien marrón, lo que según los parámetros culturales actuales, significa que es realista xD). 
 
Las voces son las mismas de la serie, y cumplen de la forma que ya sabemos todos. En cuanto a los nuevos personajes, destaco a Jude, cuyo seiyuu es Show Hayami (Aizen en Bleach, Devilman en Devilman, Zabon en Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka en Fate/Zero, Archer en la primer serie de FMA, más un largo etcétera). La música es también la usual de FMA, aunque no hay ni opening ni ending. Para ninguno de los capítulos. Eso es raro... pero bueno, tampoco es un problema. 
 
Así que, para redondear, que es lo que tenemos acá? Una sorpresa, y una muy agradable. Realmente estos especiales están a la altura del anime. No se me ocurre un mayor halago. A lo largo de cuatro episodios tenemos comedia, acción, drama, alquimia y mucha emoción (y, tristemente, nada de Armstrong...). Como ya dije antes, realmente parecen una parte más de la serie, especialmente el entrenamiento de Izumi (que es comentado en el manga) y la educación de Mustang. 
 
Esto no es recomendable, es obligatorio para cualquier fan de Brotherhood (y viendo el ranking de esta pag, son muchos). Véanlo y disfruten, dado que los buenos especiales/OVAS no son tan abundantes...

          
 
       Helpful Four espisodes are four different stories, that the reason why it is tought to rate all of them by one mark. The second story was quite boring to me, so was the third. However 1st and, especcialy, fouth were kind of a masterpiece. After watching all of them I was so confused that I was unable to give it any rate.  
The specials are great mean to meet our favurite characters one more time, also to learn new things about their history. Few scences where already shown in the core series, for me it is an advantage, as it allows to place a situation in the time frame, and it proves that this is not completely new story out of the blue. 
Art is the same, characters are the same, and sound is fine, so my enjoyment was pretty high. However it is not what I had expected from the story and it was not really interesting/intriguing for me. Not dropped after third only because there would be no sense in dropping last episode.  
I don't regret watching it and totally recommend you to watch these specials, but bear in your mind it is not a whole new story, just short pictures form the past. 

          
 
       Helpful The ovas had only 12/14 minutes (except the last one), and in my opinion, that went down very well! But although they were short, they were great. Except for the Winry episode, which was quite simple, but the part where Riza says, ""The reasons are quite simple because the world is simple, just shoot the trigger that the person dies,"" referring to the Ishval war, was the most worthwhile in my opinion. 
 
The blind man who claimed to have managed a human transmutation is also worth seeing! 
 
And who was never curious to see Izumi training in the Briggs Mountains? It was the perfect opportunity. Modesty aside, but she should have a movie of her own. hehe Unlike the Elric brothers, she never showed much compassion for the animals she ate. Still, she understood that it was just another small part of the flow of life. And to top it off, it became a legend that scared to everyone who lived in Briggs hahahaha 
 
Bump into senpai for being late for class, drop your books and fall in love with him? NO! 
 
Bump into senpai for wanting to return home after a month of surviving on Briggs Mountain, knocking down your bear and falling in love with him? YES, very romantic, baby. 
 
The most interesting of these specials, however, was clearly the episode that showed the young Mustang and Hughes fighting together! I was more a fan of Hughes than Mustang, but I think after that episode, I completely changed my mind. Should Hughes be cute to care about his wife more than any other life he murdered? Nah, I found it a little disgusting. He would definitely not be a good ruler, thankfully the one who had this dream was the Mustang, not him! 
 
I understand, it was his duty as a soldier to accomplish the mission, and he held on to his wife to move on. However, that's a lot of fun, isn't it? Hughes didn't care about the motive behind the war, and in the end, it was that motive that killed him. By the time he started caring about the country, it was too late.

But are they even willing to listen? And even if they are, can they stop fighting among one another to face the conflict they are now beset by before it's too late? 
 
Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner or Blue Comet SPT Layzner can be cleanly divided into two parts and since they are significantly different from one another I'll refer to them as Part 1 (Episodes 1-24) and Part 2 (Episode 26 onward) within this review (Note: Episode 25 is a recap). The first part feels almost like a love letter to the real robot genre which, by the time Layzner had aired in 1985, had managed to establish that it was here to stay. Layzner, in many instances, very clearly derives inspiration from its predecessors. A number of shout-outs are seemingly given to many of the series that helped in bringing this new era about, at least from what I can see. Don't believe me? Well, I'll point out a few of the most noticeable ones that can be found in the series. The name ""Blue Comet"" is almost definitely a reference of sorts to Char Aznable, whose moniker in Mobile Suit Gundam is the ""Red Comet,"" and the V-MAX system on the Layzner can boost its speed to three times its normal operating output which is highly probable to be another reference to the speed at which Char is said to move in his Mobile Suit. Interestingly, the V-MAX system also seems to have had a significant influence down the road itself as it appears to be very similar to the Trans Am system seen in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. There are certain mecha designs in Layzner that are reminiscent of the Variable Fighters from Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Several character designs and the personality traits of certain characters also seem to be derived from those in a number of prior real robot series as well. Gosterro's counterpart would likely be Quamzin Kravshera of Macross, possessing similar character designs, in addition to both being members of the military, as well as being killers of their own allies. Gresco is similar to Drake Luft from Aura Battler Dunbine, both in design, and in certain personality aspects, too. Eiji's character starts to physically resemble Chirico Cuvie from one of Ryousuke Takahashi's prior works, Armored Trooper Votoms, as the series progresses. Eiji's spacesuit also has a red left shoulder, probably a reference to the Red Shoulders of Votoms (the red is painted on the right side of the mechs in this series). Eiji shares the same voice actor (Kazuhiko Inoue) as the main character from another of Takahashi's prior series, Crinn Cashim from Fang of the Sun Dagram. Ahmos Gale resembles Jean Paul Rochina of Armored Trooper Votoms and serves a somewhat similar purpose to the main character in both series. That's just to name a few. Still, I found it pretty interesting and perhaps you may as well. Part 2 of Layzner, on the other hand, seems to have taken significant inspiration from several films. Perhaps most notable/likely to have influenced Layzner would be The Terminator and Star Wars. There are also very clear instances where it seems to have been influenced by Indiana Jones or horror movies as well. I could be wrong about this one, but the Death Demon Squad also seem to have certain scenes that are lightly reminiscent of elements from A Clockwork Orange. It seems Takahashi is quite the fan of many films as there are often numerous shout-outs to them in the series that he has worked on. Also, and since I haven't seen it I can't say with complete certainty, but based on my very limited knowledge of the series, Part 2 of Layzner may have been partially inspired by Fist of the North Star. 
 
Based on the alternate reality premise of the series one would probably be able to easily assume that there would a commentary on the Cold War within the show. Indeed, this is what is being criticized on the surface. However, Layzner is not only offering a critique of America and the Soviet Union's tension during this time (note as well that the Cold War was still ongoing in 1985 when the series was airing), but perhaps also Imperial Japan in some ways. However, back to the main theme of this show. At its core this series resolutely proclaims its support for mutual understanding and cooperation between all peoples and individuals. There should be no distinction of race (whether human or alien) or country and everyone should be able to help one another as fellow intelligent beings. Right off the bat, the Cold War tension between the two superpowers is immediately called into question when we learn that Eiji is of two different races yet still loves both Grados and the Earth. What it's attempting to say is that despite being of two different places he is still a person, just as even though two countries are two different places they are still all comprised of people, and all people deserve to be treated with respect. Early on, we learn that Eiji has been forced to make the difficult decision of making the trip to Earth, alone, away from his family, while being branded a traitor, to warn the blue planet of the impending crisis that they face.  
 
One of the big ideas in this series is that you should not base your opinion of person on your first impression alone. There is a lot more to them than meets the eye and it repeatedly turns your first impressions of a person around, sometimes multiple times with a single character. This idea applies for the both the characters within the series and for the viewer of the series as well. David's first impression of Eiji is not a positive one at all. It's kind of clever how they make him have a poor first impression of Eiji while simultaneously doing everything they can to try to make the viewer dislike him without leaving the realm of being realistic, only to completely change both impressions as the series progresses. Early in the series David will probably irritate the viewer, but at the same time you should keep in mind that he's young, and that he has just watched his best friend die right in front of him (I don't see people complaining about a character from a certain series that features giants who behaves in a very similar way). After he manages to get past this initial confrontational attitude with Eiji he will become one his most loyal friends, as he comes to understand that Eiji does in fact have the Earth's best interest at heart. After the two manage to come to an understanding their mutual trust in one another is unshakable which applies for the members of the Cosmic Culture Club as well. There is a really heartwarming moment at the end of Episode 26 where the viewer will come to understand just how far David has come as a character. Compare it with his initial behavior towards Eiji and you'd hardly think they were the same person. This scene effectively hammers in the thematic message of the show quite significantly too. With the massive development David undergoes he may actually be the best character of Layzner, only perhaps outmatched by Eiji himself. Another time where your initial perception of a character is likely to flipped over is the whole situation with Rowan. Other examples would include Lieutenant Commander Dannie, Julia, and Gale, to name a few others. Layzner works to show that these characters have more depth to them than being one-note or laden with tropes, and more often than not it succeeds.  
 
Eiji is a pacifist and he abhors killing. So, if you've got a problem with a protagonist like that you may not like him all that much, although I would suggest that you seriously re-evaluate your outlook on life if you think not wanting to take the life of another is a ""bad"" trait to possess. He is rather stoic (Seriously, Chirico, is that you?), and bottles up his feelings quite a bit, but despite this his love for people is undoubtedly one of his shining qualities. He has a pure and noble heart that values all life, and he manages to exemplify true heroism and self-sacrifice. Despite being quite stoic, his emotions do power through in certain scenes. Look at his face when he sees Earth from space for the time; he is visibly moved by the scene, quite possibly even more so than those of the Cosmic Culture Club who are finally within reach of their home. The Layzner machine has an AI installed on it, Rei, with another hidden AI as well, Phoron. Phoron is never referenced again after a certain point (this is different for the extended and somewhat alternate ending in Episode 3 of the OVA version). The AI installed on the Layzner is amoral which at times serves as a source of struggle for Eiji because he does not want to kill. There is a scene where Eiji debates with Phoron that also really helps the advancement of the themes at one point.  
 
As a result of what happens between Part 1 and Part 2 I can't give much of a review of Part 2 without spoiling something big from Part 1, so just be aware of that before proceeding. Part 2 begins after a three year time-skip from Part 1. Before discussing the second part I want to say something about the first part. Humanity, realizing how outmatched and outgunned they are by Grados finally unite as one to wage a battle against them and this can be very hard to take seriously. Even if they face a common enemy would they really be able to unite this easily to face them? Well, considering the thematic heart of the series it wants to believe so and it is probably necessary for this to happen as easily as it does to give those themes that much more power. However, I would have preferred a bit more effort with the writing during this point. It really declines in quality for about two or three episodes. The second part of this series gets really, really dark. Eiji, the members of the Cosmic Culture Club, and the people of Earth have failed to prevent the conquest of Earth by Grados resulting in the Earth being forced into a dystopian nightmare. Grados has culled the population of the Earth, reducing it to a mere fraction of what it once was. A Gradosian weapon capable of destroying the ozone layer leaves cities completely razed. Oppression by the Grados results in routine public executions (even children), torture, the destruction of anything that has to with Earth culture (books, art, film, etc.), brainwashing, forced labor, etc. The Gradosians, thinking themselves a superior entity, reign over the humans of Earth without mercy. A resistance group takes up arms in the hope of revolting against them. Among them are a now more mature David and Anna located in New York. Simone and Arthur are fighting battles in other locations in their own way before they reunite with the group in New York. Dr. Elizabeth is working with the Resistance underground, developing weapons to combat the Gradosians. Eiji finally reappears after three long years and joins the fight with the Resistance. But Rowan has decided to align himself with Grados. The second part of the series is mainly about toppling the Gradosian regime and continuing to advance the themes of the series forward. It also brings back a character who was very clearly dead (and probably should have remained that way) as a cyborg. The second part encounters a number of pacing issues and the production values also take a very noticeable hit at many points as well. Within this part there is some rather impressive depictions of outright insanity and madness though, notably for that cyborg character who I had initially considered to be pretty one-note, but as a result of the way the insanity was depicted it ended up improving my opinion of the quality of the character's writing somewhat. Despite this part being very dark it still has its fair share of heartwarming moments, and really pushes the themes of the series to new levels. 
 
As for the romance in the series, at the beginning I didn't care much for the way it was handled, but like this series has continually proven, I should not base my perception of something on my initial impression alone. There are two romances that are significantly built-up over the course of the series. (They aren't the only two romances though. They're just the ones the viewer would probably be the most ""familiar(?)"" with. (Although I'm not sure if familiar is the best word choice here.)) One of the ways it manages to pull this off is by having the last episode look back at some of the events that led to the conclusion of the series. It is here that the things that I initially thought weren't all that great in regards to the romance suddenly end up being quite a bit more meaningful. Both of the romances in the show have some heartwarming moments to them and by the end I was rather impressed with what one of them had managed to pull off. At one point, one of these characters narrates to another a story related to a flower about a maiden who waits for her lover to return to her for months, and then years. The series manages to pull this off with the time-skip from Part 1 to Part 2, and I was rather pleasantly surprised that it also had significance at another point aside from this one occasion.  
 
Here is some nitpicks that had no impact on my overall score of the series. A minor one I have would be that the language barrier is non-existent. Everyone is able to understand one another easily even though they should be speaking different languages in certain situations. I would assume that English is the language that is primarily spoken in most cases though. In Part 2 one of the characters is reading a book that is formatted right-to-left rather than left-to-right despite taking place in New York. Of course, they are trying to save all the books they can at this point, so I can easily toss this aside as completely insignificant. (I just felt like pointing it out.) Oddly enough, there is another scene where a book is formatted left-to-right, but more often than not they are formatted right-to-left in most scenes.  
 
The battles in the series, while not always being animated the best, are a bit different from what I've typically encountered in other mecha series. This is mainly for one reason only though: the SPTs frequently do these really flashy spins/flips. Additionally, the animation can be rather rigid on occasion or feature a noticeable drop in frame rate. The art utilizes these really vivid color choices. This can be seen pretty clearly on Mars with the red and orange hues of the planet being in the background of the bold, deep blue of the Layzner unit. The Layzner machine typically stands out quite a bit when it's in a scene due to its color, especially when the V-MAX system is activated at which point it effectively gives off the impression of a ""blue comet."" There are a number of cases where there are very obvious off-model drawings for the characters or the backgrounds. Oh, and the opening theme is probably one of the greatest opening themes ever. I can't forget to say that :D  
 
Layzner is quite the underappreciated hidden gem. While it was cancelled, resulting in a mad dash at the end to wrap things up, it is still rather impressive with what it managed to accomplish during the time that it did have. I do have some problems with how certain parts of the series played out, but overall it was handled exceptionally well and I am satisfied with the time I spent watching it. For fans of old real robot mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Votoms, Macross, and Dunbine I recommend giving Layzner a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised. Layzner, both as the series and as the machine itself, embarks on a journey for the day when all of humanity can reach a mutually beneficial and cooperative relationship with each other. Without a doubt, it's a series with an optimistic outlook, but it also comes across as a solemn prayer for humanity. And as it searches for that day when everyone can understand one another, 
 
The Blue Comet slowly bathes the sky with a glistening light—a light gently illuminated— 
 
—With hope.

12,22677,125,5.625947827,Story between god and human,Appleseed Alpha,"Set in a different series of events, this story does not follow the previous  Appleseed  movie canon (despite being directed by the same director of the previous movies); it is an alternate story to their beginnings. Briareos is already a cyborg and did not become separated from Deunan to be later reunited in Olympus to join ESWAT. 
 
 Appleseed Alpha  depicts the early days of Deunan Knute and Briareos in the 22nd century, as they embark on a journey throughout dystopic ruins of New York in search of the city of Olympus. They are hired by Two Horns, the warlord of the ruined city, to eliminate bipedal combat machines. During the fight, they encounter Iris and Olson, both on a mission. Deunan and Briareos befriend them and decide to join their mission. 
 
Iris is tasked with preventing the malevolent cyborg Talos from capturing a secret weapon humans were building. Talos uses Iris to activate the gigantic war machine. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Police', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen']","In the 22nd century, after a devastating world war, veterans Deunan Knute and Briareos are living in the ruins of New York doing jobs for a cyborg despot named Two Horns, with Deunan hoping that once they've paid off their debt to him for fixing Briareos' war injuries, they can go find the legendary utopic city of Olympus, though Briareos is more pessimistic. However, whenever they are close to finishing a job, they are sabotaged, keeping them under Two Horns' thumb.
One day, while eliminating rogue combat drones, Deunan and Briareos meet Olson, a cybernetics-equipped soldier, and a young girl named Iris. Though reserved around each other, Olson discovers that Two Horns' mechanic Mattews has been deliberately crippling Briareos' systems. Soon after, two cyborgs named Talos and Nyx, who are trailing Olson and Iris, appear, forcing Deunan and Briareos to depart with their new friends. After questioning Two Horns, and then attempting to kill him, Talos puts Deunan and Briareos on his target list as well. After recovering, Two Horns follows them to capture Iris and use her as a bargaining chip against Talos.
As they travel together, Iris and Olson gradually reveal that they are from Olympus, on a mission to dispose of leftover weapons from the war. Talos is also an agent from Olympus who has developed a messiah complex and wants to use Iris to take control of these weapons. When Two Horns finds and attacks them, Iris and Olson are captured by Talos. After brutally extracting the location of a prototype superweapon from Olson's memories, Talos murders him and takes Iris with him. After finding Olson's body, Briareos and Deunan recover the information they need and follow Talos and Iris to the weapon's location.
In a secret underground bunker, Talos activates the superweapon - a giant, heavily armed mobile fortress - using Iris' retinal pattern. Deunan and Briareos fight their way into the complex, supported by Two Horns, who is now out for revenge against Talos, and Mattews, who presents Deunan with a power amor suit. Briareos duels and kills Nyx, but Deunan is too late to save Iris; the fortress makes its way to the surface, but instead of following Talos' commands, it is hardwired on a suicide bombing mission against New York. With Two Horns and Briareos' help, Deunan boards the super walker and kills Talos, but in order to destroy the weapon, Briareos must snipe its power core. To prevent countermeasures, Iris remains aboard and evicts Deunan from the fortress after revealing that she is merely a bioroid specifically created for this mission. Briareos takes the shot, destroying both the fortress and Iris inside it.
After regrouping, Deunan and Briareos depart for Olympus, with Two Horns absolving them of their debts and Mattews gifting them the restored exosuit. Unknown to them, they have been closely observed by Olympus Officer Hitomi, Iris' human template. When asked whether Deunan and Briareos should be brought to Olympus for their help, Hitomi explains instead: ""They're like apple seeds. Wherever they go, hope will sprout. Others who are worthy are sure to follow.""
","Appleseed Alpha is a action, explosions, gunshots adrenaline movie, if you want action with a easy to understand soft story you will like this movie, and sometimes is good to watch something were you don't have to think so much. 
 
Story- 7/10 
 
The plot of this movie is nothing to think about. You have seen it in one form or another a million times before, often better executed. Would've done nicely for a game though. It's the classic bad guy wants to destroy or govern the world so good guys need to stop him. 
 
Art-10/10 
 
i don't like CGI but yes BUT!! this movie was EPIC the artwork was so good that i really doubted in the beginning of the movie whether it was animation or live action. The ruins of New York look like a delight to wander around in and to just explore, the characters were so real, if only all CGI could be done like this. 
 
Sound- 7/10 
 
Sound wise i don't find it very fiting or ear anything amazing, it was a techno almost dubstep ost witch in my opinion didn't fit very well with the action but it's just my opinion. 
 
Overall- 8/10 
Alpha is a good movies to watch at night or when you don't have that much to do because it's a good watch, I can honestly say i watched this movie for the art, not the story but i did have a very good time watching it so even if it sounds like a boring movie it's not, the enjoyment level is high and i bet you will like it.

          
 
       Helpful I found about this franchise with the trailer of Appleseed Alfa post by IGN, “from the creator of Ghost in the Shell”, but is not recommendable to compare because after watching the four movies all i can thing of is “Transformers”, mediocre and disposable entertainment made for a wider audience. Don’t get wrong, the movies are not bad… just mediocre.  
Have you ever see a movie and something stupid happed; something that doesn’t make sense, you ask yourself why it happens and answer is “well, y it’s a movie”. You haven realize (or don’t want to accept it) but  suspension of disbelief has die in front of your eyes, in that moment, the  30-40 minutes that the movie has left  will be a tedious job ratter that an entertainment. Things like “my plan depend of this bottom, when I push it I win and you lose and … oh you fire at the bottom, now a will not be able to push it, now we will go with plan b that is the real climax of the movie”. This happens in the first movie (Appleseed 2004), without spoilers i will say that i didn’t care in what follow that scene. Every cliché of sci-fi, cyberpunk and action movies will be developed during the entire series. 
The original OVA of 1988 its the best movie, its mediocre, but mediocre 30 years ago, its a masterpiece, (adding that i watch this one  in third place), Deunan doesn’t fight between being a badass and a damsel  in distress for Briareos, they’re just a team , there is a debate of Olympus as a necessary evil ratter OUR ONLY HOPE, even the death of nameless characters matters more, because  are presented as uncontrollable casualties, and not the “people dying, shit gets serious” way. 
I guess I should talk about Alfa. It’s Metal Gear (Revengeance to be specific) direct by Michael Bay, its one hour dubstep video with a couple of cool designed characters (designed, not develop), and you can’t complain about dubstep,   the soundtrack of all four movies is nothing more that whatever people was hearing a that time (like I say entertainment for a wider audience). Appleseed isn’t bad, none of the for movie are bad, but don’t compare it with Ghost in the Shell, don’t compare the bioroids with the ones in Blade Runner (this ones are flat and un-dimensional, their emotions have being restricted so they have an excuse), don’t compare soundtrack, visuals, story, nothing with the big names of this genre, Appleseed will always lose, its not bad … Just Mediocre. 


          
 
       Helpful Appleseed Alpha, or Appleseed α is a computer-animated military science fiction cyberpunk movie. It had an advance digital release on July 15, 2014. The movie is set in different series of events, so you will not have to watch alternative versions of it, which aired a long time ago, only to understand it.  
 
Appleseed Alpha focuses on the early days of Deunan Knute and Briareos in the 22nd century, as they start their journey throughout the ruins of New York in search of the mysterious city called Olympus. Deunan Knute and Briareos are hired by criminals to help them deal with the robots that seem to hinder them a lot. On one of these missions, our duo encounters Iris and Olson, who are on a mission, too. It is later revealed that Iris and Olson’s mission is somehow connected with what Deunan and Briareos are looking for.  
 
Appleseed Alpha’s weakest part is, of course, its story-line. One can write a novel simply by listing things that the story-line of Appleseed Alpha does not explain. And believe me, there are many aspects this movie does not touch upon. Indeed, it has one of the worst story-lines you will ever find, but the good thing is that you will not have to watch prequels, read manga, or look for some additional information only to understand it. No. Appleseed Alpha relies only on a) animation and b) soundtrack.  
 
All in all, I would not argue that this movie has, perhaps, the most stunning animation I have ever seen in my life and that its soundtrack is amazing, too. But a better story-line is something this movie does not have. Of course, if animation is the only criterion you care about, you should definitely watch this movie. If not, do avoid it.  
 
By the way, this movie has superb English dubs.

","EDIT: People, people. I went and saw this in a movie theater. In real life. Please stop asking me where you can download it, because I don't know. Thank you! 
 
As perfect as they were, I almost regret giving the other two movies tens, for now I have no numerical way of showing that this one is far superior to even them. Spoilers for those movies, obviously. 
 
Anyone who's seen the main Monogatari series can tell you that the difference between pre-Kizu Araragi and post-Kizu Araragi is like night and day. The question, though, is this: what happened in Kizu to change him so dramatically? There were two catalysts: Hanekawa and Kissshot. In Nekketsu, we saw him learn the joy of true friendship when Hanekawa obstinately stuck by him where any sane human wouldn't have. In Reiketsu, we see the effect Kissshot had on him. This relied on buildup from the previous two movies - through them, the viewer and Araragi had to come to like Kissshot. But this is a review for Reiketsu, so I'll quickly move on to why that's important here and now. You know how Kizu has been devoid of the signature Araragi narration that pervades the main series? It comes back after a certain scene in this movie. My belief is that it's intended as a delineator between pre- and post-Kizu Araragi. ""This scene is where the transition was complete."" I don't want to go into further detail because I don't want to force my interpretation on you, but the takeaway from this paragraph is this: Araragi's character arc in Kizu is very cleverly done, making use of both female leads, who themselves have character arcs. 
 
Readers of the book know that there's a very long talk scene in this movie (after the one I was just alluding to), meaning that Shaft has to pull out all their Monogatari tricks to keep the viewer's eyes open. And they do it well. The tone shifts at a moment's notice, with the OST and the animation style as its indicators, keeping it from becoming monotonous. The comedic timing was brilliant, enhancing jokes to be even more funny. The symbolism is cheesy and heavy-handed - to comedic effect. It was clear that Shaft knew they were being ridiculous with the symbolism in this scene. 
 
This has nothing to do with Shaft, but the juxtaposition of the two talk scenes (both of which I talked about, believe it or not) really is brilliant. It's like a modified Hero's Journey template that has two Audience with the Father sections. It raises the stakes for the Ultimate Boon section. 
 
Speaking of which, let's talk about that, shall we? The fight scene in this movie was a lot longer and more action-packed than I remember it being in the novel. Frankly, it was amazing. Several parts of it were somehow silly and badass at the same time. The best part, though, was that we knew our characters. They were both unique, well-developed, and interesting. Think about - REALLY think about the climactic showdowns you've seen and name one that fits all three of those criteria. Ain't easy, is it? 
 
But as any reader of the novel knows, the real climax of this story is the very, very end. Remember that legendary narration from the last few paragraphs of the novel? They kept it. Every last word. A huge number of factors make it so that the end of the fight scene isn't also the end of the movie's tension. Your socks will be blown off. 
 
After writing so much about this movie, it made me realize why I consider it so much better than the first two, though they were perfect too: out of the three Kizu installments, this is the one that feels most like a standalone movie. Its tone shifts multiple times, its pacing is extremely varied, and it feels like it has a proper climax. What was Tekketsu's climax? ""Pleasure doin' business with you."" It was hard to say that that movie was anything more than set-up (albeit very good set-up) for the next two. What was Nekketsu's climax? ""I'm not a human anymore."" The story was quite obviously nowhere near any satisfying endpoint, and we had two character arcs very openly unresolved. It was, again, hard to argue that it had merit as a standalone movie. These problems were borne of Aniplex's decision to cut Kizu into three, which is why they didn't affect my scores for the movies themselves, but it's worth noting why Reiketsu is so much better than Tekketsu and Nekketsu. 
 
Now that I've talked at you for five friggin' hours, I'd like to end my review with this. Out of all the anime movies I've seen here in Japan so far (Kimi no Na wa, KnK, Nekketsu, Planetarian, Kagerou Daze, AC...), this is the only one where I've walked out of the theater and thought to myself, ""I want to see this again, right now."" 
 
Oh, and there's no post-credits scene. Sorry! No ""Owari S2 soon"" or ""Musubi in stores now"" or anything.

          
 
       Helpful Those who are still dwindling whether to watch this or not. Please do watch in a quiet place without interruption. This movie is truly a masterpiece. I believe it pushed the boundary of anime-world again like other Monogatari stories. 
 
The poetic way of telling stories with enticing art style will keep you glued to the screen until the last moment. All you need to do is to keep your mind wide open and try to grasp the real feelings of all the characters to enjoy this and find the hidden meaning that the tales express: ""We are all crooked inside in some way. Let's embrace this commonality and live together patting each other's back till the end.""

Character development and Story: 10/10 
 
From the giddiness of the ""romantic"" scenes between our main protagonist and Hanekawa to the existential crisis posed by the dilemma of immortality, I can say for certain that these 3 movies, especially this one, achieved its goal of strengthening the characters from the main anime story line. The center piece to all of this was Araragi and his character development. By being imperfect and making *many* wrong decisions throughout the plot, the audience is far more likely to connect with him on an emotional level. For example, his indecision when it came to picking a solution during the final conflict was a key element in showing that despite his ""vampiricism"" he's truly human at heart, for what human can have the resolve to make the righteous choice in that situation. A mediocre movie would have had everyone satisfied. Sadly, this is barely the case in reality and this movie portrays this fact brutally and accurately.  
 
Art and Sound: 10/10 
 
The symbolic art and dramatic change in style from time to time fits perfectly with the detailed and beautiful animation throughout the movie and really keeps this masterpiece from becoming stale at any point. The music was also delivered perfectly and really enhanced the emotions intended behind each scene.  
 
Overall this movie really is one of a kind and really tells a wonderful, yet tragic, story.

12,28221,127,5.575997434,Story between god and human,Etotama,"When Takeru Amato moved into his new apartment in Akihabara, he was warned that there was one problem with it. He wasn't warned, however, that the problem was a hole in the floor that leads to the realm of the zodiac gods. He also wasn't told about Nyaa-tan, the eccentric, immature, prospective zodiac-sign cat. 
 
Nyaa-tan would like nothing more than to join the rest of the girls, otherwise known as Eto-shin, in the Chineze zodiac, but she's going to have to fight to work her way in. Fortunately, establishing a relationship with Takeru can help her with that. In  Etotama  the members of the zodiac don't just represent people's births; they draw their power from positive human emotions in the form of energy called Sol/Lull. With this power, the Eto-musume, or potential Eto-shin, can change from their mostly humanoid appearances into smaller ""pretty modes"" that can battle with each other in the Eto world. 
 
Nyaa-tan needs to get Takeru to warm up to her fast, and not just because they're living together. The ETM12 selection festival to determine the next member of the zodiac is coming soon. With Takeru's good graces, Nyaa-tan just might be able to fight off the other Eto-musume and the 12 Eto-shin themselves, and finally take her place in the zodiac.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","The anime's story revolves around Nya-tan, the cat of Chinese astrology who wants to become a member of the Chinese zodiac. Nya-tan is simple and suffers from memory loss, and she tries various idiotic ways to become a member. She meets Takeru Tendo, a high school student who lives alone in Akihabara, and becomes a freeloader at his house. Little by little, she gets closer to her goal.
Sol/Lull is the source of the Eto-musume's life force. Sol/Lull is the embodiment of proper human emotions, it's a type of energy only humans possess, like Takeru Amato. Every time a human feels grateful, Sol/Lull appears. And when Sol/Lull collects into an Eto-musume's soul, their Etotama, they transform from adult mode, the form that allows then to exist in the human world, to the form that allows them to fight in the Eto world, pretty mode.
","Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.  The Chinese Zodiac is a figure that has long since been used to identify one's characteristics and personalities, since there's a saying that people are like a certain way on account of their perspective zodiac animal.  So, with an anime about this particular zodiac that is NOT Fruits Baskets, what are we to expect with Etotama? 
 
Story (6.34/10): Etotama's story is based around the life of one particular individual named Amato Takeru, a high school student who moves into a rather large house by himself in Akiba.  There, he notices a strange hole in a corner of his house, a hole that for some reason leads to the world of gods (probably).  Here, he meets a girl who comes out of the hole, a cat-girl by the name of ""Nya-tan"", sending Takeru on a journey with this strange eto-musume (basically, a god-like girl, but not an actual god) on her goal to become one of the twelve members of the zodiac. 
 
Etotama plays off from the original legend of the zodiac, where the rat tricked the cat before the start of the footrace to determine the twelve zodiac animals, leaving the cat no chance.  With the main story being surrounded around the idea of Nya-tan collecting the twelve sol-lull seals (basically, sol-lull is moe power/gratitude from humans and such) of the twelve zodiac animals so that she can become a member of the zodiac.  The show itself plays with this VERY straightforward plotline for literally the entire show.  Within a given episode, Nya-tan will fight any given Eto-shin (aka, the zodiac animals) in a battledome-style fight where if she wins, she can get their seal and continue off towards the next one sort of like your classic tournament-style anime.   
 
Its simplistic plot really only scratches the surface as to what kind of story Etotama has.  The biggest issue I have with Etotama is that for the most part, it's inconsistent with the way it wants to deliver its story, particularly in the latter half in the show, which is, mixing comedy, with a serious, dramatic plot.  I see this as Etotama's main problem because a good chunk of the time, the show will not only go serious for a brief moment and try and instill an actual plot aside from a cat dicking around with eleven animals and a dragon, which heavily clashes its for the most part, light-hearted and comedic tone that it sticks with most of the time.  They just don't really fit together well, and that's my main issue with this show.  Another problem I have is the fact that this show REALLY has no consequences with what it does.  Because it mixes comedic elements with an attempted serious tone, a lot of the more dramatic aspects/plot points that are presented in the less funny moments of the show basically get resolved later on when the show decides it wants to bust your funny bone.  To me, it's a bit of a distasteful experience because serious and funny don't really go together all that well, especially when your characters are gods that have the ability to reincarnate, essentially disregarding any sort of serious moment you attempted to put in the show to begin with.   
 
Another thing that bothers me with the show is the fact that it has all of these commandments, rules, and terms that while do get an explanation, don't really retain that explanation all that much.  Really, you're told what a certain term/rule is, then you'll probably forget it in a few episodes because the underlying complexity of these terms racks the brain quite a bit on account of their definitions taking at least 3-4 lines of text just to explain, so yeah, I'll pass on that. 
 
In terms of a comedy aspect, Etotama is a show that heavily references the fourth wall.  (Insert there is no fourth wall joke here.)  Most of the show's comedy comes from Nya-tan herself as her crazy and varying antics boot us from scene to scene of her ridiculous hyperactive personality.  But that's not all.  While a lot of the moments are created thanks to Nya-tan, a lot more of them become more prominent because of the expansive zodiac girls cast, which each have their own unique personality to give every joke a little bit of a different twist.  But, like all comedy, it's really depending on whether you think it's funny or not, since all comedy is subjective. 
 
Overall, Etotama's story isn't really all that fantastic in any real story aspect.  All it is mostly just a group of characters fooling around in an episode by episode story where each episode differs from one another with different and sometimes random topics like Shogi, a horserace, kick the can, and even just straight up bribery on several occasions.  (Nya-tan will do anything to get those seals.) 
 
Overview: 
+ Easy to follow base story 
+/- Good comedy (if you're a fan of fourth wall breaking) 
-  Has serious moments that clash with the show's mostly comedic aspect 
-  Terms within the show are somewhat complicated to actually remember (for the most part, you just know what the purpose of said term is, then move on with the show) 
 
Characters (7.72/10): Characters in Etotama are what I think really the selling point of the show, and really the bigger reason as to why someone would really want to watch this show. 
 
But since we have to be follow the rigid formula put in place by the reviewer himself, we'll start with Takeru, the only important human character in this show.  (Yay for continuity...) Takeru as a character really...isn't all that special.  As a person who produces very good Sol-lull (aka, that moe power thing I was talking about earlier), Takeru is for the most part put into this plot device role rather than an actual main character that has a grave impact on the show.  Most of his work within the show is done in the sidelines as a source of power to Nya-tan, and doesn't really involve himself as much with the affairs of the zodiac or Eto-Shin as one may think.  He does have this development where he ""appreciates"" the company of Nya-tan a lot more, but to me, it feels like forced development to give the serious areas of the show more impact, when in reality, it really doesn't.  I mean, he's already WAY too accepting of a literal dozen of animal girl gods just showing up in his house randomly.  He doesn't even so much as flinch when he learns that gods and a world of gods exists. 
 
And of course, we have the true star of the show (quite literally, cause she has a starfish thing on her head for some reason.  I don't know how that thing works tbh.  I swear it's like alive or something...), Nya-tan.  As a cat eto-musume, Nya-tan aspires to be a member of the zodiac for reasons that she herself doesn't even remember.  Oh well.  As the central character for the show, Nya-tan is a very exuberant character, attempting to find a character-type for herself so that she can shine and basically, make better ratings for the show.  (Or something like that.)  What I like personally about her is that she's not a very grounded character.  She's selfish, greedy, sometimes smart, sometimes helpful, determined, lazy, all sorts of adjectives.  I think that's what really makes her so much of a memorable character and truly stands above all the other characters in the show.  Of course, whether or not you like her is really your decision, cause she is a character that goes on quite literally, opposite ends of the spectrum.   
 
And finally, we have Chuu-tan, the rat Eto-Shin.  Personally, I felt like this character deserved mention specifically because she mainly serves as the show's antagonist and has a creed to ""destroy the cat clan!"" and all of that lovely business.  As far as villains go, Chuu-tan is a lacking character for no other reason than her lack of screen time.  While acting as the bad guy for basically the entire run of the show, she doesn't really appear all that often and has a very lackluster existence overall because she not only doesn't have much to go off on on account of how little she actually appears in the show, but because her actual motives for wanting to slay the cat clan was something I felt was explained very poorly.  It didn't really make sense, so I really just had to go along with it, even if I didn't truly understand what was being talked about.  That to me, is a major flaw. 
 
But truly though, I believe that the real stars of the show belong to the side characters, particularly the eleven Eto-Shin in the zodiac.  While each one of them really gets 1/2 - 1 episode completely devoted to themselves, and they all basically have one-note personalities, they don't actually falter all that much in that aspect.  In fact, the one-noteness actually makes most if not all of them more memorable characters.  They're a colorful cast that are all fairly easy to remember, and they all show up so often that it really makes it hard to not at least recognize the lot of them right away.  And besides, how can you forget characters like a perverted cow, a traumatized horse, a rooster with a three step memory, a sheep nurse, and the exposition pig with the sesame oil addiction? 
 
Overview: 
+ Interesting female lead 
+ Great supporting cast 
-  Male lead leaned towards supporting 
-  Villain was for the most part, not present/unexplained 
 
Art and Sound (7.44/10): The art for Etotama was made by a little known animation studio by the name of Shirogumi, a studio that really...hasn't done all that much in terms of quality work.  Nonetheless, Etotama's art style leans heavily towards the moe-style of animation.  With big eyes, cartoony expressions, and these very innocent looking ears on the girls of the show, with the standard animation not really looking all too different from animation these days.  For the most part, it's standard fare.  That is, until you get to the battles. 
 
Etotama in addition, also uses CGI whenever the characters within the show do battle.  And contrary to what you may think, it's not actually that bad.  The CGI for these specific scenes doesn't actually look all to bad in terms of Japan's CGI standards and does actually give a new depth to the visuals for the show.  Of course, it clashes with the original visuals for the show, that's an aspect of it on account of how glaringly different they look from one another. 
 
In terms of sound, the OP in particular for Etotama is a very...interesting track to say the least.  Similar to the show itself, the OP switches its tone as well, going from a rock sounding theme with the guitar before leading towards a bouncy melody and cute lyrics.  Personally, I found this song to be VERY addicting and found myself listening to it an absurd amount of times.  Is it a good song?  It's ok, not the best, but decent enough.  The ED on the other hand is a very mellow piece, reminiscent of sleeping on a meadow with its calm atmosphere and tones.  The tracks for Etotama aren't bad per say, and they're actually quite memorable, but they don't really stack up to be anything more than a fun song.  They're good, but not masterpieces. 
 
Overview: 
+ Standard fare animation 
+ Decent soundtrack (that I personally find to be memorable) 
+/- CGI is good, but clashes with the standard animation 
 
Personal Enjoyment (9.00/10): Admittedly...I had more fun with this show than I really should've.  Not only am I a big fan of girls with animal ears (yes, I'm that kind of person), the fourth wall breaks and the overall comedic style of the show just perfectly suited to my personal tastes.   
 
Did I like this anime? 
 
Far too much.  It was fun for me to watch, I enjoyed the characters, and I really liked the style of randomness and just overall oddity that the show presented itself to be.  I'm a personal big fan of fourth wall breaks, so that was definitely an aspect of the show that I really liked.  The music for me is one of my favorites this season, and even with the flaws that I will mention very soon, I really enjoyed this show regardless. 
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
The clash between serious and comedy was really the only true personal downfall I felt.  It's tough to balance comedy and plot together, and when you don't succeed, the end result doesn't really turn out well.  That being said though, every other flaw didn't really stick out or bother me too much, and because I really enjoyed the show a lot, there's really not much to complain about. 
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
If you're looking for something that isn't too thought provoking, Etotama is decent for that.  It's by no means a masterpiece, but rather just a fun show with randomness, CGI, some ecchi acts from a questionable cow, and lots and lots of fourth wall breaks.  This show really doesn't serve much beyond a casual watch on account of its material and style of comedy.  It's a decent show, and if you're into slapstick or random episodic episodes, and want something new, Etotama's a good pick for something of that category. 
 
Overall Score: 7.23/10

          
 
       Helpful Another anime without a plan. Basically its selling point are cute characters. 
 
Writter run out of weak jokes, even while whole anime is basically cute girls run around saying random words acting stupid. Anyway anime turns to be a drama as usual for animes without any real story. 
 
So drawing is okey, characters are boring stereotupes. Its is kind of like a harem anime, just not all the girls love protogonist, some seems to be there just as fanservice. Then there are those 3d scenes that look interesting but getting boring soon. I dont recomend watching this unles you like Lucky Star show. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Since when is the last time you watched an anime that is so much wacky and nuts that you pretty much gave up your soul to Satan? Well, if you have not seen this anime yet, you are going to miss the experience of getting sucked into Satan’s chamber. At the same time, no spoilers in this review. 
 
So, Etotama popped up this season. I did not know what to expect when I first heard about it, since I came to put in on my watchlist because of the voice actresses involved. But upon watching the first episode, I just find out how insane it is. Produced by Encourage Films, it revolves about Nyaa-tan, a cat who has an amnesia, and she aims to be a member of the Chinese zodiac through her silly methods. She meets Takeru, a high-schooler who lives in Akihabara, and decides to become a freeloader in his house. In order to reach her goal, she has to battle off against the twelve main zodiac characters and obtain their “Sol/Lull seals”. To explain about this battle system, it will have to take some time (probably a few episodes from the start) for a viewer to understand it fully. Even I had some trouble understanding about it, but after a while it came clear. It is a simple “collect all tokens, reap your rewards” kind of battle. Do not worry as there are eye-catch cards with a piece of information about the battle system during the middle of an episode. Back to the main story, usually in each episode, it introduces one or a few zodiac character(s) and how they will carry forward the story. The synopsis may sound quite clichéd, since there are many other anime with a similar one. It started out a bit weak, but as it progresses, the amount of pleasure into watching the anime grows, with more understanding and development. However, having this fast-paced, some parts of the story can be seen as rushed. The comedy is one of the high points in the anime - there are so many hilarious moments such as how meta it goes. There are also a few emotional scenes, especially during the last two episodes, but I do not think the staff is serious in most of them, since they break into more comedy afterwards. The zodiac is something unique since I never heard of other anime that played zodiac as a part, hence it is good to have a bit of originality here. Overall, it is a nice story to follow up on with extra hilarious comedy. 
 
You have twelve zodiac characters, Nyaa-tan, Takeru and maybe two more side characters that are not important as the cast. About Nyaa-tan, the main focal character, she may be dumb and crazy most of the time, but sometimes she understands the situations she face and gets on working to solve them. Maybe a few people will find this daunting, thinking that once she goes back being her usual self, the mood of the story gets ruined. But I felt quite the opposite, since I never want the emotions of the anime to develop further to become forced drama. Her involvement with Takeru is very big, in that case he is like her support. However silly she tries to force him into giving support, he usually does it whenever it is needed. I do not know if there is a lesson learnt in this, but I find it nice. For the other characters, I can say that they definitely have different personalities which have similar anime tropes. As I mentioned earlier, one or a few of them gets their own spotlight in each episode, but I feel that the spotlight do not necessarily be bright. The range of their involvement depends, so while some do have something, others are treated more as side characters who probably make people laugh. Character development is minimal, or I think it was not noticed enough. 
 
Another high point in this anime is the 3D animation. This anime has a fair usage of 3D animation, and most of it is used during the battle scenes. I loved the transformation scenes, the sceneries where two characters battle out, the action and visual effects when they fight and also the cute chibi character designs. Everything there is perfect, and I do not think I have any complains in their 3D animation at all. For everything else, I say that it is normal - nothing really stands out from the rest of the anime this season. The sceneries look nice, the character designs look great, and the facial expressions are funny. 
 
The opening song, sung by the voice actress of Nyaa-tan, is quite catchy and nice to listen to, if you are into this sort of music. The ending song, sung by all the voice actresses, oppose towards the opening song. It has a much more emotional feel and the vocals are good and they match to the instrumental well. There is one original soundtrack during the transformation scenes that I like, which fuses one type of genre into something more Asian. For every other tracks, I think that they are okay. Voice acting is good - yet again, nothing special. I appreciate Rie Murakawa for voicing Nyaa-tan since she did a great job as acting out with that kind of personality. 
 
Etotama is an anime that I found myself to be very high whenever I watch the episodes. Thanks to the comedy, the awesome 3D animation, Nyaa-tan herself, and some of the other characters in the anime, I pretty much enjoyed it a lot. Sure, there are some flaws along the way, but they are just unnoticeable if you do not care at all. And now that is over, I really hope there is another anime next season that fills that spot similar to the anime.

The picture book you used to read over and over again. The shining stone you found that day in the park. Where do all your childhood's treasures go when you grow up? In this story, we meet fantastic creatures that gather all these little objects that fall into oblivion as they are forgotten by their owners when they step into adulthood. These creatures sneak into our world from a different dimension, and unseen by humans, they take all the ditched and forgotten ""treasures"" into their world. Here, they use their booty to build their own city, a fairy tale-like place called... Oblivion Island! 
 
(Source: Production I.G)",['Fantasy'],"After losing her mother at a young age, Haruka has treasured the hand mirror she had received from her. As she grew older, she forgot about the mirror and eventually lost it. One day, she decides to go to a local shrine and pray to Inari for the hand mirror to be returned to her. After a brief nap, she drops her house key under the steps, but when she retrieves them, a small fox/pig-like creature, takes her key. She follows the creature into the woods, and comes across a small pool with one of the eggs offered at the shrine. She dips her hand into it but is sucked through the pool and lands in a cart with the creature.
The creature, named Teo, explains to Haruka she is in the world of the neglected, made of forgotten things because his race cannot make things themselves. Haruka agrees to give him her keychain if he can help her find the mirror.  With Haruka in disguise, the two board a tram cart to the main town on Oblivion Island. After asking several vendors, Haruka discovers that the mirror has magical powers, and it was kept by the Baron, the leader of the land who hovers in an airship, but that it was stolen. A group of bullies try to remove Haruka's mask, but Teo and Haruka escape.
At a theater area where they project the memories of neglected things. Haruka recognizes her stuffed animal named Cotton, who is upset that Haruka neglected him. When the bullies bust in with a large ostrich-like contraption, Haruka grabs Cotton and they escape. At Teo's place, Haruka learns Teo wants to build a real airplane. Cotton shares that the mirror was taken by a group of underground bandits called the Petitloss. While Teo goes to get water, he is captured and delivered to the Baron, who orders him to help Haruka find the mirror but bring it to the Baron, who will neglect his crime and will also give him a huge reward of stamp cards.
Haruka, Teo and Cotton head into the lair of the Petitloss. They soon find themselves attacked by Petitloss and a large Petitloss creature. Cotton removes the threads from the large creature and Haruka finds her mirror. Although they escape the underground area, the Baron arrives to seize the mirror and to abduct Haruka. Teo is left with a pile of stamp cards but he is upset about his choice to betray his friend.
The Baron tries to make Haruka swallow an Oblivion Drop in order to remove her memories. Teo tells the townsfolk that humans are actually good. He gives away his stamp cards, and the townsfolk build him a plane, which he flies. Cotton rallies the petit-loss to raid the airship, and Haruka breaks free. The Baron activates a bunch of robots using the power of the mirror to grab Haruka, but she falls off the airship, and hangs by a banner. Cotton attacks the Baron but he rips Cotton in two and tosses it. Haruka dives after Cotton and falls, but Teo rescues her in the plane. The Baron's airship attacks the plane. It falls onto a tunnel track but they reverse it in time to get out. They crash into the airship. Teo and Haruka climb the inside and the array of the other mirrors to try to get the hand mirror. The Baron tries to stop them, but Haruka grabs the mirror and it activates. Haruka finds herself inside the mirror which shows memories of her family life; she cries. The Baron chases them out of the mirror but accidentally damages the airship, causing all his mirrors to fly around. Teo snatches the mirror as the Baron falls and the airship crashes and is destroyed. The Baron is reduced to a mask-less creature and flees. Later, Teo sends off Haruka and Cotton through the portal, where she returns to the temple and calls her dad to meet him for dinner.
","Oblivion Island isn't so much a movie as it is a 90-minute revealing of some impressive cgi technology - or perhaps just a really long toy commercial. 
 
The movie begins with our young protagonist, Haruka, being read a children's fantasy by her bedridden mother. The book tells a story of a man whose treasured comb was returned to him by a fox after offering an egg at a shrine. The townspeople begin offering eggs to the shrine in hopes of having their items returned as well, but little do they know that the foxes are actually responsible for stealing the items that are considered 'forgotten' by the people. Haruka assures her mother that the hand mirror she received as a present won't share the same fate, since she'll treasure it forever. 
 
Flash ten years into the future, where Haruka is now a teenager. Her mother is no longer around, and she seems unsatisfied with her workaholic father and her disinterested friend. For a change of pace, she visits the shrine to pray for her hand mirror to be returned, since, as expected, she forgot about it and subsequently it had been lost. 
 
Haruka falls asleep at the shrine and wakes up to a scrounging fox-like anthromorph. The fox grabs some stray items, including Haruka's keychain, and scurries off. Haruka follows the creature into a parallel dimension, where the fox panics and tries to disguise her, or else he could get into trouble for leading a human to their world. After escaping danger, the fox tells Haruka to return to the human world, but she insists on staying to look for her mirror. 
 
Haruka promises to give the fox, who introduces himself as Teo, her keychain if they find her mirror. He agrees and they set off to search for it. On the way, Teo is bullied by three street-gang members, and Haruka helps him get away. The bullies guess - correctly - that Haruka is a human, so they head off to expose her. 
 
There's a pointless scene where the bullies chase Teo and Haruka which leads to the only funny moment in the movie, where their cylindrical vehicle flies off a roof, lands sideways on a tower, and slides down it, like a ring-toss game at a carnival. Teo and Haruka escape to a theater that is performing a play with one of Haruka's forgotten toys - don't ask why - and the bullies bust in, despite not knowing that their targets were in the theater. Haruka reunites with her toy, named Cotton, and the bullies chase her while causing a lot of property damage, even though she had already revealed herself to be a human, which calls into question the bullies' motive for chasing them in the first place. 
 
The duo escapes and retires to Teo's house, where Teo reveals that the mirror is in a underground thieves lair - why he doesn't reveal this earlier when they're searching for the mirror is anyone's guess. Teo then steps outside where he's kidnapped by the evil Baron, who tells the fox to use Haruka to get back the mirror so that he can steal it. Of course, Teo will be rewarded handsomely. 
 
The next day, the pair travels into the lair and the movie is tragically cut short when their cart derails and a giant stuffed monster forces Haruka into a pit of lava, killing her instantly - that is, until the lava is revealed to be syrup. The teenager climbs out and rips the stuffing out of the monster to discover that her mirror is inside of it. She retrieves the mirror and attempts to escape with Teo, but they are headed off by the Baron, who kidnaps Haruka to be a slave and steals the mirror. 
 
The Baron reveals his plan to use mirrors to control a robot army (mirrors are like a power source), and then proceeds to administer an amnesia gobstopper to Haruka by means of a Rube Goldberg machine. This gives Teo ample time to sway the townspeople into committing treason against the Baron, and they use Teo's reward money to build a plane that will propel him to the Baron's dirigible. 
 
Meanwhile, Haruka's toy, Cotton, rallies an army and inexplicably boards the Baron's airship without having any means to do so. The baron dismembers the sentient toy, and Haruka escapes into Teo's airplane. Then, amidst cannonball fireworks and balloons, Teo's airplane crashes into and disables the Baron's airship. The film then goes into a metaphysical sequence which explains the moral of treasuring memories, after which the Baron is defeated and Haruka retrieves her mirror and returns to the human world. 
 
So that's Oblivion Island. Haruka and Teo are the only characters who have more than a few lines, the plot is full of holes, and the story, for the most part, is unoriginal. For a children's movie, Oblivion Island is not charming, interesting, or funny. There are no attempts at puns or jokes at all, and since there is hardly any gripping drama, the movie ends up being a sort of fantasy adventure - the kind you might see if you had a high fever. However, the visuals are absolutely stunning, essentially making the art and animation the only attractions of the film.

          
 
       Helpful Oblivion Island is a movie that pops a question in my mind after I saw this movie; Why can't we get original and creative films like this on Hollywood? Well that's because nowadays, Hollywood is nothing more than a bunch of lazy dumbfucks that rather make garbage for the audience, while original movies get the middle finger by the audiences and they don't ever get mentioned again for generations to come. Oblivion Island gives hope that originality in filmmaking isn't dead and Production I.G has created a film filled with so much wonder and creativity that it deserves to be seen by the whole world and not just the US. 
 
The story is about Haruka, a 16- year old girl who lost her mother at a very young age and forgot all about the mirror that she had as a gift from her mother. Feeling guilty for not taking care of it, she decides to visit the shrine to pray for the return of her mirror to Lord Anari and which according to a real life Japanese legend, if a precious item was lost to you, an offering to Anari may bring your precious item back to you. Later on, she follows a strange little fox into the woods and when she founds a small pound between the rocks, she gets sucked in into Oblivion Island, a world where everything is built around objects and items that were neglected by their rightful owners. Now, Haruka and her new friend Tao decide to find the mirror before The Baron, the ruler of the island, gets his hand on the mirror first and use it to destroy the island in order to make a new world.  
 
While the story in Oblivion Island is not incredibly complex, it does have an incredibly deep theme that is rarely seen in movies these days: The theme of neglect. Oblivion Island's message is about never neglecting our precious childhood objects, since this film takes place in a world where items like broken dolls, mirrors, stuffed dolls and other kinds of objects are abandoned by their owners for no reason and that is sadly true to be honest, since nowadays parents buy toys for their kids cause it's ""hip"" and ""cool"" like the commercials advertised, instead of being gifts that you're suppose to take good care and treasure them like when you were a kid back then. The story combines real-life Japanese folklore with a mix of Alice In Wonderland storytelling to the film and it does feel like I'm watching an anime film of Alice In Wonderland, but about a world of abandoned objects instead. The main characters are pretty good. The chemistry with Tao and Haruka is heart-warming and their friendship develop well enough throughout the movie that you will care deeply for them, even that little plush doll Cotton is a very simple yet deep symbolic character in the film (which you have to see for yourself in order to understand it since I don't wanna spoil the film for you). The other characters are mediocre at best, plus the villain is weak and uninteresting, as he just wants to take over the island in order to make a new one. 
 
The animation by Production I.G is breathtaking. The amount of creativity and effort put into the animation will make Studio Ghibli jealous and the designs of the characters are magnificent. The island is also a stunner, the way the place is made is just unbelievable and did I mention that this film was in 3D when it was released in Japan? Cause if I watched this in 3D, my eyes would have been blown away with so much color and detail. The music is good, but not as jaw-drooping as you would have thought it would but to give credit, it does offer some gorgeous piano tracks that brings a lot of emotion to the story. The English dub for Oblivion Island is not that bad, Christine Marie Cabanos and Cassandra Lee were perfectly cast with their roles as Haruka and Tao, while Patrick Seitz delivers an awesome over the top performance as The Baron that gives the character enough charm than the Japanese version and Julie Maddalena gives a heart-warming performance as the doll Cotton. As for the other voices.... Well, they were ok, but their voices did not even fit for the characters at all and they come off goofy and bland. 
 
While it's not a masterpiece like other anime films, Oblivion Island has enough charm, originality and effort that some of the flaws can be overlooked, thanks to the charm of the story and the message it's trying to tell to it's audience. If you want a movie that's rich with imagination and creativity, I highly recommend this film to every animation fans of all ages. See this film cause we won't get a creative film like this in the US for a long time. As for the Oscars and The Academy Awards, they better nominate this movie or bad things will happen to them...

          
 
       Helpful Oblivion Island is a CGI animated film that was released in 2009 to commemorate Fuji Television’s fiftieth anniversary. As it mentions boldly on the DVD case, it went on to win three animation awards, and became nominated for two others. This is quite a feat, seeing how it’s basically another Alice in wonderland type story, and those have become pretty much a dime a dozen in recent years. But looking past that, when the film is taken at it’s own merits, did it really deserve those awards? Let’s take a look. 
 
The movie opens with a stylized piece of animation that tells the audience about a race of fox spirits who sneak around your property, stealing any of your possessions that’ve become neglected or unloved. This story is being told by Haruka’s mother, who’s being visited by her husband and daughter on what will soon become her death bed. Haruka says she won’t get visited by the foxes, because she takes care of her possessions, including a beautiful mirror that her mother gave her. I wonder where this is going. 
 
Fast forward about ten years, to when Haruka is a sixteen year old student, her father is working hard to support her, and right off the bat, Haruka comes off as a very unlikeable character. She walks into the house with a friend from school, sees that it’s still a mess, and complains that her father doesn’t clean the house often enough. She’s pissed that he drank her ginger ale, as well as at the fact that he’s rarely home. Because of his job. Where’s the Facebook Parenting guy when you need him? 
 
Looking at her clock somehow reminds her of her mother’s mirror, which she lost several years ago, so she visits a shrine to the fox spirits to ask for it back. Her keys fall behind the stairs to the shrine, so she crawls underneath to get them back. She places them on the step, but before she can get out, a fox spirit runs up and takes them, offering us our first actual plothole of the movie(wait for it). She follows him to the base of a tree, where she gets sucked into the Land of the Lost. At least that’s what i’m calling it. She meets up with the terrified fox, and accuses him of theft, but he reassures her that he doesn’t steal. He reclaims abandoned and neglected objects. 
 
Okay, so there are two plotholes here. First of all, yes, he just STOLE her keys, which had only been on the step for a few minutes. not abandoned, not neglected. And despite being a fox, he didn’t notice her there less than a foot in front of his face. DidAalan Grant write that scene?  And I’m sorry, but if these fox spirits were really this careless, we’d have captured at least one by now. 
 
Okay, back to the story... She promises to give him her keys if he helps her to get her mirror back, which she believes must be down here. This is where the plot finally takes off, and trust me, it has more holes in it than Spongebob Squarepants eating swiss cheese in the middle of a shootout. 
 
Production wise, Oblivion Island is pretty underwhelming. It’s a fully CGI movie, so it doesn’t have the typical anime problems... Like low frame rates and frozen images... But it’s still really cheap looking. The style and quality of the animation seem like an awkward cross between Mr.Stain in Junk Alley and a Kingdom Hearts cutscene. The artwork is colorful and highly detailed, but at the same time bland and gummy looking. There are times when it breaks away from this happy color palette long enough to really shine, like the real world scenes, and a giant skeletal beast that they deal with late in the movie, but for the most part, this movie is visually unremarkable. 
 
The story is well paced, and never boring, but the amount of contrived plot twists and broken physics rules that they had to use to tell the story is just absurd. Despite his species being prevalent in the opening animation, and the basis of the entire japanese myth, Teo’s the only fox spirit we ever meet. At one point in the movie, Te’o has to give a speech about humans not being all that bad, although he’s the only character in the movie who was ever afraid of her. He shows them a wind-up toy plane she built, and they react like they’ve never seen one before. Her mirror was supposedly stolen from the Baron by some mysterious underground thieves, but when they go underground to retrieve it, there’s nobody down there who looks capable of such a feat. Just creepy dolls, slimy bugs, and a sorta-cool giant monster that looks like a cross between a rancor and an ugly quilt. 
 
But my real problem with this movie, above all else, is the ending. As ridiculous and dumbly-plotted as this movie was, it could have been saved by having a smart ending. As it turned out, when they came back to the surface with the mirror, the Baron was waiting at that location... Somehow... and takes it, along with his new prisoner Haruka. Now, this is what I was hoping would happen; 
 
Upon entering his castle, Haruka notices that the Baron really does love and treasure her mirror. It’s like a comfort blanket to him. Being without it for so long has driven him mad, and having it back, his life is complete again. She realizes that she doesn’t need some mirror to remind her of her mother, because the memories in her heart are enough. She agrees to leave this world empty handed, but not empty hearted, as she’s taking a valuable life lesson, and several steps towards maturity, along with her. 
 
Of course, that doesn't happen.  A won’t tell you exactly what actually happens, but to put it in broad strokes, The Baron is a Bond villain, and the mirror is a MacGuffin. The entire third act of this obviously eastern-inspired movie is nothing but an explosion of westernized cliches. Haruka learns to appreciate her father and her possessions, but she never really grows or develops as a character, because *Spoiler alert* she got exactly what she came for. 
 
I own a 12 inch stuffed Bulbasaur that my father won for me at a carnival when I was little. I love it, treasure it, and still own it. It’s on my dresser as we speak. But if one of my little cousins saw it and fell in love with it, I’d surrender it in a heartbeat. Why? Because when you grow up, your childhood relics deserve to be with someone who needs them more than you. Toy Story 3 nailed this idea, and in a different way, so did Labyrinth, both of which are American movies. 
 
Overall, it’s a pretty bad movie by all accounts, but it’s not terrible. It’s watchable. It’s safe and entertaining for younger audiences, at least those who are young enough to watch The Santa Clause without asking any questions. I give this movie a 5/10. I don't think it really deserved any of those awards it won, but it's worth a rental.

12,19067,129,5.520085043,Story between god and human,Future Card Buddyfight,"An adaptation of the Future Card Buddyfight card game. 
 
Future Card Buddyfight takes place in a more futuristic version of today. The card game connects to a parallel universe through special cards (Buddy Rare Cards) that act as portals. They bring monsters to Earth in order for them to become buddies with humans. Through friendship and courage, they take on and fight challenges, known as Buddyfights, where people of all ages have friendly non-hurtful competitions. The main character, Gaou Mikado has just started Buddyfighting. As the story progresses, Buddyfights are seeming to become a little too real...",['Game'],none,"This isn't the bottom of the barrel. We're through the barrel and plunging into cavernous depths previously unknown to man. This is garbage. 
 
And that's the thing, too. There's no pretension of it being anything other than garbage. Everyone involved knew this was garbage pumped out to kill time on the airwaves and shill a third rate collectible card game. If the creators made a quick buck, I can respect their business sense. I can only muster respect for Future Card Buddyfight as a scam. 
 
This show is as creatively bankrupt as it gets. All the cliches that Pokemon and its ilk have worn into the ground for decades are on display, and somehow Future Card Buddyfight bungles every last one of them. Look, I'm not George R.R. Martin, I don't scoff if all the meticulous inner workings of a setting aren't accounted for. I can suspend my disbelief, especially for a kids show, but this is just stupid. There was no effort or thought put into any of this. That goes to the insanely cookie cutter characters, as well. 
 
I gave Aldnoah Zero's Second Season a 3 because, for as insipid as it was, it at least felt like there was some creative, artistic spark, even if the execution was terrible. Future Card Buddyfight doesn't even have that. It's just cynical. 
 
As far as positives go, a friend and I got a few good laughs at its expense. The main character's mom is obviously the best girl. It's sometimes animated. That's all I've got. 
 
As a show, Future Card Buddyfight is a turgid, rancid failure. Don't let any kids waste their time on it. They deserve better. We all deserve better.

          
 
       Helpful Yay! I have the honor of being the first review! 
 
Future Card Buddyfight is a brilliant TCG anime, that never takes itself too serious. I find this show a lovable mesh of Pokemon meets Cardfight!! Vanguard.  
 
 
STORY: 
 In contrast to other card-based animes, the characters can actually ""fight"" in the battles instead of only shouting commands. The characters keep one partner only (exception: Gao), so no time-consuming episodes of them trying to fill their fighting rosters.  
 
FCBF constantly uses the word 'buddy' in any sentence possible. This could potentially annoy you (along with Gao's victory one-liners), or it might make you laugh at the sheer cheesiness. In my case it made me giggle and try to count all the 'buddies' used in one episode. 
 
This is a kid's anime so it's lighthearted, but the battles can become dark when the (dun dun) dark cores arrive. One of the characters has a dead brother, who is fondly mentioned as well. 
 
There are few fillers in this anime unless you count the two cliché tournament arcs. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
I think this is one of the few animes where I loved all the characters and their magical creature friends. My favorite characters were Zanya, Gao, Jin, Asmodai, and Noburu. My least liked would be Tetsuya, who is annoying for the entire first season. Still, I found his character evolving from the annoying, dance guy entertaining and sad.  You can honestly sympathize with any of these characters! 
 
There is a serious lack of female characters and only four to five girls buddyfight in the show. 
 
The show slowly introduces its main characters and lesser ones appear often. FCBF never forgets its side characters because ALL the characters have a purpose. At some point, they reappear and contribute to the plot usually in a “Gao gains a new friend/foe”way.  This characteristic of FCBF has me eager for its sequel! I can't wait to see them expand my favorites' story-lines even more. 
 
Concerning Gao Mikado, our main character, he is an actual intelligent lead.  He is childish and eats a lot, like so many leads before him. He understands when the villain or one of the antagonists are trying to hurt him and OUTSMARTS them... By buddyfighing! Well, this is a TCG show! Some may find him too perfect due to his many wins and use of OP moves, whether you like or dislike him for that is up to you. Personally, I find it different having a character who is ungodly good the first time he plays a game. Almost every TCG or shounen anime has its main lead start out losing before becoming the best in the game. FCBF sets that trope ablaze and stomps and spits on it. You can argue other characters get more development than lovable Gao. 
 
SOUND: 
I have seen the dub version, and I can say they did an excellent job casting!  
Bushiroad is well-known (or notorious) for reusing its actors. You will recognize their voices in more than one role. I feel like one VA played at least five different characters! 
 
 All of the voices sound professional and unique. I enjoy three characters' voices in particular: Kyoya, Shido, and Genma. Although, all of the voices are satisfactory to my humble ears you could be disappointed by where the directors assigned them. Genma and Rouga, middle school students, have the voice of grown men. Another character, Zanya, who has an actual boy voicing him, takes time to like. Initially, his voice was too amateurish.  Zanya is considered the cool character, but his VA tried too hard to achieve that effect. I began to like his voice as the episodes progressed though. I think Zanya's VA really grew with his role until his voice became comfortable. His voice shines in the hilarious moments when Zanya freak outs! 
 
Kyoya's voice is my absolute favorite! His voice is angelic. It's like beauty in the form of sound. Ha! 
 
MUSIC: 
I LOVE the soundtrack! As soon as it is released, I am adding it to my music library.  
 
The music is rock-based and uses ample guitar solos. They also have some songs with electric bagpipes and organs! So cool! All of the music is not upbeat, there are even slow songs where piano is used.  
 
The theme song is catchy! It is one of those “either you love or you hate it” type of things. I don't think it has a neutral ground.  
 
The ending theme (Season One) is horrendous. It is just bad. I thought it was too cutesy and had a bad melody. You will have to skip past it or suffer for 20+ episodes.  However, the second and third ending themes are wonderful! They could fall under the “too cutesy” trope, but unlike the first I don't find them grating. 
 
The BGM works well to convey any of the scene's feelings. 10 out of 10! 
 
ART: 
I love the style and the character designs. Gao's design has a lot going on because he's extra special!  
 
OVERALL: 
Please watch this anime! I love spending Friday nights or Saturday mornings watching FCBF. All of the episodes are on Youtube, so go binge watch it! 
 
 “Can YOU open a buddy rare card?”

          
 
       Helpful Well time to review something different for once.  
 
Back when I was a teenager, I was re-introduced to card games thanks to little series called Cardfight Vanguard. The first season of Cardfight Vanguard was a pretty great show. I really adored the more grounded feel of the series as most of the Cardfight were won by still rather than lucky draws. It had great theme exploration such as not running away, communication, teamwork, redemption and understanding one another. The characters were the most part were nicely developed and likeable in they own way and the soundtrack while a bit repetitive at times was nicely executed. 
 
The only problems that I had with Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 were the gags, Kamui's junior love triangle BS and the limited animation other than that I really liked the first season of Cardfight Vanguard and I consider it to be one of the best children animes I have seen along with the first season of Gundam Build Fighters. However, notice I said the first season of Cardfight Vanguard. Why because after the first season the series started to lose a lot of charm that made the original season as it became another soulless cash grab by Bushiroad to sell cards. The series got worse quality wise to a point where they are now rushing the Cardfights themselves... When the series got to Cardfight Vanguard as well as G completely lost all respect of Cardfight Vanguard as the series along with the G saga is nothing more but a pretentious fanfic written mess that doesn't even respect the viewer. It was that point where I decided to find another card game anime that I watch weekly along with other seasonal anime and the first thing that pooped up was Future Card Buddyfight a fairly new card game anime that was meant to be a more enjoyable, entertaining child-friendly series compared to Cardfight Vanguard. 
 
At first, I was put off by the title of the series as it seemed too childish for my tastes however despite that I deiced to give the series a chance and after watching the first season of Future Card Buddyfight I have to say this. Future Card Buddyfight season 1 is a great and fun card anime. While it was it not in the same league as Yugioh 5ds and at times Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 in terms of quality and writing Future Card Buddyfight was still one of the more enjoyable anime I have seen in a long while. Now with that said let's begin. 
 
Story. 
The story follows Gao Mikado an eager young martial artist who becomes Buddies with the Hot-Blooded Drum Bunker Dragon. Receiving a Core Deck Case from Tasuku Ryuenji, a Buddyfight prodigy working for the Buddy Police, he takes his first steps into the fantastic world of Buddyfight. 
 
I really enjoyed the story of Future Card Buddyfight. Yeah, the story may be cliched and predictable in nature but the least the journey towards the destination was a fun one. 
 
For starters, this show is easy to follow as the show goes a great job at established its own setting as well as its characters to the viewer especially kids. 
 
The one thing I really liked about Future Card Buddyfight is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the things that plagued Cardfight Vanguard is that after season 1 the series went off rails where it devolved into an over-dramatic and contrived show series to itself too seriously. Future Card Buddyfight docent do any of this as the show from start to finish stayed true it's good roots which are being a light-hearted card game anime. The show did have some serious moments every now and then but it never went off rails. 
 
The comedy in Future Card Buddyfight is for the most part hilarious as they not only they are very funny but the comedy itself plays along with the shows lighthearted narrative. Some of my favourites include Zanya getting scared by girls, Shido failing his evil antics to Testua's gags. I will admit the comedy did somewhat repetitive as it progressed but never got annoying compare to Cardfight Vanguard comedy with the Morikawa Grade 3 stuff and Kamui's comedic love triangle antics. 
 
Despite Future Card Buddyfight being a more lighthearted show compare to Cardfight Vanguard the series did have some good theme exploration however unlike Cardfight Vanguard I thought the themes explored in this show were better executed here compared to Vanguard. One of the series recurring themes is adult corruption where the adults in the series seemed to have more power than the children an, as a result, the kids would only feel powerlessly unable to do anything. The theme also plays along into certain characters in the series manly Tasuku. Other themes that Future Card Buddyfight explores is friendship, confidence, pride and superiority. 
 
My favourite arc in this Season 1 of Future Card Buddyfight is the ABC cup arc due to engaging and entertaining it was. Most of the Buddfights in that arc was not only fun to watch but it's filled with good engaging strategies and smart plays. My favourite fight in that arc was Rouga vs Jin. That fight was such a joy to watch as both fighters battle out it restrive settings that they both set themselves. Some other notable fights include Tetsua vs Sophia, Zanya vs Rouga, Gao vs Gremlin and Noboru vs Genma. 
 
Now with all the good out let's talk about things some of Future Card Buddyfight flaws. 
 
First up is the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc. While the series is indeed being very well paced through most of it run the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc was too slow for its own good to a point where some of the Buddyfights drag on especially when all of the characters that were introduced in that arc were not all that interesting. Now if I think about it the Sengoku Academy arc was the weakest arc in the season. Minus the good character building for Rouga and Kiri, the arc didn't all that much to the overall plot. 
 
The second and final problem I had with Future Card Buddyfight is Gao's plot armour. It's such a shame because I really enjoyed Gao personality/development as well as his relationships towards characters. I just thought of his wins felt more like asspulls rather than legit victories thought I would admit it's not as bad as some of the asspulls from the Yugioh series as well as Cardfight Vanguard G. 
 
Overall, despite the show flaws, I thought the story of Future Card Buddyfight to be solid. 
7.5/10 
 
Characters. 
The characters in Future Card Buddyfight were easily the shows biggest strength. 
 
First, we have Gao Mikado. I actually really liked him. He may appear as this generic shounen hero at first but he's actually a pretty interesting character. Unlike Aichi Gao already has an established background 
 
His backstory was pretty interesting as he before used to be this ruthless guy who would do anything to win even if hurting others in the progress. However in order to make friends at all he to change his mind where he doesn't use ruthless techniques to hurt others in both martial arts and in Buddyfight. This really gives a pretty good insight about Gao's character as a whole as his actions were pretty reliable as he simply wants to escape from being a person that he used to be. 
 
Besides the backstory there's a bit more I have to talk about Gao's as a character. 
I really liked his character interactions and relationships towards the other characters as he wanted to support and help his friends take the right path but when he fails he gets pretty upset and he will end up doing anything just to save his friends from corruption and evil. 
 
The one cool thing about Gao is how he's able to use and master different decks and worlds. It really makes Gao think twice about the moves that he's going to play against set opponents using set deck. 
 
Now as much I enjoyed Gao as a character I have one problem with him and it's not about the character but rather how the plot treats him. You see despite Gao being a solidly written character who has character flaws there was a couple of instances where the plot wanted him to be this generic overpowered protagonist even though the series at various points showcases that he is a flawed character. I honestly wished the showed treated Gao a bit better because outside of all of the plot conveniences that the story gives his a likeable and fun character to be around. Overall, despite how the plot treats him at times, Gao is a pretty good character. 
 
Next, we have Tasuku. I really liked Tasuku. He's a friendly individual who is nice to everyone that he meets. However, despite his kindness he's want's to grow up faster as he works as a Buddy Police officer where he protects the world from crime done by criminal buddyfighters. 
 
(Spoilers ahead) 
 
Despite him being a successful buddy police officer, he feels that the buddy police force is corrupted as shown later on the series he gets very frustrated with the buddy police organisation as a whole as he quickly falls into darkness where he joins team Disaster as the Purgatory Knight. 
 
After getting defeated by Gao in the final match he starts doing through a mini redemption arc where he starts feeling ashamed and guilty of everything that he has done as the Purgatory Knight. (End of Spoilers) 
 
Despite the lack of screen time in the first half I found Tasuku to be a nicely developed and written character that I enjoyed from start to finish. 
 
I absolutely adored Kiri no am kidding I really like the show did with his characters. He starts off as this timid boy who would look up with his senpai being Gao. However, a couple of plot twists and plot aspects Kiri starts to grow as a character whereby the end of the show he's like a totally different person where it literally becomes a likeable badass. He's easily my third favourite character. 
 
Now we have Zayna. While I didn't care for him all that much in the beginning due to him being a solo who prefers to work alone rather than with other however as the series progresses he starts to become quite a cool character as he starts to open up to people as well trusting them. 
 
Despite him being a cool character overall the thing that hurts him quite a bit is he's afraid of girls and is not talking about his being afraid of girls boobs or anything but he literally cannot talk or go against a girl in a Buddyfight. I don't know why the writers didn't give him a 3 episode arc where he overcomes his fear of girls as that would have been interesting plus we got a backstory that showed how he became scared of girls. Don't get me wrong I still like Zayna as a character but him being scared of girls removes quite a bit of coolness about him. 
 
Tetsuya is an interesting likeable character. Unlike Gao and Zayna where they are dedicated to Buddyfighing Testuya is a dancer who doesn't devote his energy to Buddyfighting and because of those reasons he's basically an underdog and a very good one. Throughout the series people would gossip of how's he's a low rate fighter who cannot win however thanks to his buddy as well his determination he slowly moves up the ranks of being a pretty strong Buddyfighting where we end getting a lot of respect from his peers. If you remove the following characters that I will talk about next, he would be my favourite as he's not only a nicely written character but he's just so fun to watch and seeing improved at the game was so satisfying My second favourite character in the Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
If I had to pick my favourite character in Future Card Buddyfight, it would be Noboru Kodo. I absolutely adored this character from start to finish. 
He started off at this arrogant boy who had an inferiority complex where it always diminished Gao's Buddyfight as pure luck rather than actual skill. Typical rival stuff however what made him my favourite character in the series when he's starts to realise that he's not that special. When Tetsuya defeated Noboru in a Buddyfight, he didn't just lose the match but he's lost his pride and confidence to a point. A few episodes later he has gone so far that he was going to quit Buddyfight for good. 
 
However, thanks to El Quixote's advice defeats a criminal Buddyfighter and he started to become more confident about himself. From there he not only has the courage to be himself he also reconciles with Gao where he becomes his true friend again. Because of these reasons along Noboru is my favourite character. Thank you Buddyfight. 
 
Kazane was a fun charterer. While she didn't develop all that much when compared to the other characters in the show she still a lot of fun to watch. 
Now I have praised many of the characters in Buddyfight but now it's time to talk about the charterers that I have mixed feeling for and that character is Rouga. Now Rouga is a fun and entertaining character that I enjoyed, however, I feel like the writers did not what to do with him in the narrative as the writers keep on changing what type of character Rouga is. At times he can be lone wolf antagonist, while other the plot portrays as a misunderstood rival. The plot can also as times portrays him like the sword of Kyoya as he would do anything to defeat anyone who gets in Kyoya way while at others he's a typical badass student. This unfortunately really makes him an inconsistent character as I feel the writers had created a character that would have worked in Cardfight Vanguard or Yugioh Arc V. 
 
The other two charterers I have mixed feelings towards is Baku and Kuguru. Despite them being Gao best friends and deck builder/intel they didn't do all that much as characters. They aren't bad characters but any means, in fact, I found the humour to be decent but they didn't leave a lasting impact of the series compared to many of the characters like Kiri, Tasuku and Noboru. 
 
As for the villain origination Disaster, I thought they were pretty good overall. Some were better than others but that they brought enough entertainment to make them enjoyable to watch on screen. My favourite characters in Team Disaster were Sofia and the main antagonist of the season Kyoya. 
 
Finally, we have the buddies themselves and to be honest apart from Asmodai, Jack, Drum and El Quixote they are pretty one-note mainly because they only have single character trait and not much else. 
 
Overall the characters in Buddyfight were great for the most part and them easily my favourite thing about this series. If it weren't for the characters that I simply wouldn't have enjoyed it all that much. Great job Buddyfight. 
8.5/10 
 
Visuals. 
As for the visuals, I thought the show was pretty good. 
 
The characters designs were unique and fitted well with the personality of the characters especially Noboru who is far the best character design wise thanks hair resembling like an actual brown tiger on the top of his yellow hair. Other notable designs include Gao, Kiri especially his second form, and Tetsuya. The buddy designs were for the most part pretty good despite some of them being in full CGI. 
 
The one thing that I really liked about the visuals is how colourful it is. The series uses its urban smooth colour palette for the background scenery in the series. It really makes the setting of Future Card Buddyfight feel more alive. 
 
The animation in Future Card Buddyfight surprisingly pretty good. It is smooth, consistent, and nicely animated. The show did have some stock footage in certain moments but don't you worry the stock footage doesn't get abused as much compared to older brother Cardfight Vanguard Season 1. 
The only issue that I had with the visuals is the use of CGI at times and while it wasn't that bad compared to other shows of its genre it still pretty distracting to look at. 
 
Overall I thought the visuals were pretty good. 
8/10 
 
Sound. 
The soundtrack of Future Card Buddyfight is pretty good and memorable. It uses a selection of clam, thrilling sci-fi and ninja tracks pieces to enhance the setting and tone of the series. Some of my favourite tracks include Gao's theme, Noboru theme, Grim Reaper theme, I be mine and team Disaster theme. 
The first opening Card Of The Future by Psychic Lover is a catchy opening theme that fits well with the lighthearted tone of the series. While the first opening visuals were bland the second opening visuals were much better and engaging.The second opening theme ""Buddy Buddy BAAAAAN!! sung by the Seiyuus of Gao and Baku was decent at best. While the song itself was alright the visuals didn't fit the tone of the arc at all thanks to its bizarre tone.? 
The first ending theme Buddy Buddy Fight!"" sung by Paruko Seiyuu Sora Tokui is an ending theme that is so bad it's good. The song itself was very cheesy and the melody wasn't all that good. The only redeeming theme about the first ending theme was the visuals which were pretty solid. 
The second ending theme Natsuiro Fighting!! sung by Paruko Seiyuu is a good catch that was a big improvement over the first ending theme. Not only the ending visuals were much better, but the song had a great and catchy rhythm. 
 
The third ending theme Shining Up sung by Hanako Seiyuu is in my top 30 favourite anime ending themes as it was a very sad song that perfectly showcases the lifespan of Gao brother. 
 
I have not seen much of the sub mainly because its most of the episodes didn't get an English translation but I what I remember I thought it was solid. 
 
The dub of Buddyfight is pretty good. The voice actors really did a job with the roles that they were given and it really makes these characters feels more live. My favourite performances were Bacchus, Patricia as Gao, Hannah Dickinson as Kiri, Slusar, Zoe as Noboru and Hanson, Cole as Tasuku. Overall very good dub. 
 
9/10 
Final Thoughts. 
There is no secret that I really liked Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The story despite being cliched at times was entertaining and interesting to watch. The characters were, for the most part, great and likeable. The visuals were solid and consistent minus the awarded use of CGI at certain points and the music was good. It did have a small couple of problems, though. The Sengoku Academy arc could have been better paced, the plot armour was out of control at times and a small handful of the supporting characters were not that good. Despite that issues, I still made it through the first season feeling a sense of satisfaction. Future Card Buddyfight gain a pretty strong following after it came out as it, not only card game anime watchers into watching it but it also converted many jaded Yugioh/Cardfight Vanguard players into playing the card game itself. If you're looking for a good card game anime that has likeable characters and has a fun addicting plot than I easily recommend Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The show may not revolutionise the card game anime genre, but I still think it's a great show that I enjoyed. 
 
Final Score 8.5/10

12,9367,130,5.499739909,Story between god and human,Freezing,"Decades into the future, humanity is under siege by an alien race known as the Novas. These inhuman beings leave devastation in their wake whenever they appear, with the efforts to stave them off becoming known as Nova Clashes. Young women known as ""Pandoras"" and young men known as ""Limiters"" are implanted with stigmata to give them superhuman powers and are trained in military academies, where they must learn to work together if humanity is to have a chance of surviving. 
 
 Freezing  tells the story of Kazuya Aoi as he sets out for his first day at the West Genetics military academy, right when a battle royale is being undertaken by the Pandoras. It is here that he mistakes Satellizer el Bridget—a powerful Pandora known as the ""Untouchable Queen""—as his deceased sister and embraces her. Though he costs her the match, she finds that his touch doesn't drive her away and decides to take him as her Limiter. The only question is whether or not their partnership can survive the machinations of their upperclassmen and the impending battle with the Novas…","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Harem', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Martial Arts', 'Seinen']","In 2065, Earth is in the middle of a war with extra-dimensional aliens called Nova. The military develops and trains Pandoras (パンドラ), girls who are able to use special genetic tissue called Stigmata (聖痕, Seikon) to manifest superhuman fighting skills and weapons. Supporting the Pandoras are male partners called Limiters (リミッター, Rimittā), who use special ""freezing"" powers to limit their opponent's mobility.
One of these limiters is Kazuya Aoi, whose late sister was a Pandora. While attending West Genetics Academy in Japan, Kazuya meets Satellizer el Bridget, a powerful Pandora, nicknamed the Untouchable Queen, for her ruthless personality and her intense aphephobia. Despite warnings from his schoolmates to keep away from Satellizer, Kazuya befriends her, and asks to be her Limiter. After helping her through several fights against school rivals of varying ranks and classes, Satellizer agrees to partner with him, although she soon encounters a rival in romance named Rana Linchen, who thinks Kazuya is her soulmate. Their rivalry is put aside when the Novas attack their school using Pandoras under their control to access the school's underground lab.
Satellizer and Kazuya join a handful of West Genetics students to a research lab in Alaska, where they are to help with the Evolution Pandora (E-Pandora) project. The E-Pandora project allows ordinary girls to undergo Stigmata transplants and become Pandoras. When one of the E-Pandoras goes berserk, the others question whether the drugs in the experiment are safe, but are forced to comply with the director and the corporation's wishes. Upon discovering that they are to be used until they are expendable, the E-Pandora Amelia Evans leads a rebellion which escalates into a full-on Nova Clash.
Kazuya learns more about his family's connections to the Pandora and the Nova. Kazuya's grandfather Gengo Aoi launches a similar project, which puts Satellizer and Rana into a special team with girls called Valkyries. However, during the demonstration exercise with custom-designed dummy Nova, the Pandoras experience illusions, and the dummy Novas become a legion of hundreds of Nova that decimate Genetics. Gengo counters this by unleashing the Legendary Pandoras who are Kazuya's aunts. The Chevalier attempt to assassinate Gengo using a group of convicts called the Busters, but the mission falls apart when some of the Legendary Pandoras turn into deadly Novas due to the anti-freezing of the busters, but they are defeated by the power of Kazuya's special freezing, and Arcadia 01, Daughter of Cassandra conceived from Kazuha's father which awakens from stasis in response to her brother's awakened power.
Before Chevalier launches another attack, Gengo moves on with his main plan, which involves sending Kazuya to Elca, the world from which the Novas come from to learn the truth about them. During his time there, he discovers that there might be a direct link between the two worlds with relation to Novas, Pandoras, and Limiters. There also appear to be several alternate versions of people he knows on Elca.
","There are still a couple of more episodes to go and I have not read the manga version of this anime, so pls don't judge me, amigos. So, my rating for this anime is as follows: 
 
Story: Dreadful number 2. 
 
The story is about genetically modified girls called ""Pandoras"" duking it out with extra dimensional invaders called ""Novas"" which only appers at the frist part of the episode, flash backs and obviously on the last 2 episodes, but instead it has more to do with the Pandoras who engage in CATFIGHTS and a whole lot of ecchi. 
 
Art: Very Good 8. 
 
What can I say, I like the way the chicas were drawn. 
 
Sound: Decent 4. 
 
No need for me to say anything. 
 
Characters: Fair 6. 
 
Let's go over the charaters: 
 
Satellizer El Bridget - the infamous ""UNTOUCHABLE QUEEN"" she earned the reputation because she beat the crap out of every humbre who wants to be her limiter and whom also makes a dreadful mistake of touching her (except Aoi), she also doesn't take any crap from other Pandoras regaurdless of seniority. According to info, it is said that she was implanted with stigmata from Aoi's sister which may partly explain why she didn't instictily attacked Aoi when he touched her and later on develop a brother sister relationship with him, eventhough she doesn't want to perform a baptismal with Aoi she does wants to bond with him. She's born of noblity, but she also experience a rough childhood in the hands of her half brother molesting and abusing her, but she was saved by her elder half-sister. She's a regular at a Queen Burger stand in the school's canteen always ordering a lot of cheseburgers. 
 
Aoi Kazuya - At frist Satellizer avoids him, later on she takes his offer to be her limiter on the condition that they will not performed a baptismal, his realtionship with Satellizer is that of a brother and sister relationship. He's the only limiter who can use freezing without being baptize, him being close to has more to do with the respect that he earned from Satellizer for standing out for her even at the cost of his own life. Also according to info, her sister is also a Pandora who risked her life to save the reamining Pandoras from the Nova's onslaught, surprisingly his attraction to Satellizer has to do with her resemblance to his sister, who also goes by the name Aoi Kazuya. 
 
Clipton Arthur- who's is Roland Genessa's boy bitch and Aoi's friend, he's always seen with Hiiragi Kaho and one would mistaken him to be her Limiter. 
 
Mably Elizabeth - Satellizer's next opponent, I think. 
 
Linchen Rana - a tibetan Pandora who has hot's for Aoi. 
 
Fairchild Chiffon- she's the president of the west genetics student council, and may soon to be Sattllize's opponet. 
 
I have no words to say as to why the rating. 
 
Enjoyment: a very good 8. 
 
Don't ask. 
 
Overall: a fair 6. 
 
Hey, this anime is more about fanservice. 
 
the end. 


          
 
       Helpful Before I start this review I will say: I will try to keep this review spoiler free, and welcome to titsville. 
 
I have mixed feelings about this anime. There are some good aspects. However, if you decide to watch this, you are in for one hell of a ride, to hell. The combination of tits-for-brains characters and constant meaningless fanservice left me cringing and facepalming on multiple occasions. If you don't feel like reading my jumbled thoughts, skip right to the conclusion. 
 
 
Story: 
 
Lets start with the good news. The story was actually quite interesting. Although it could have been executed much better, the story intrigued me enough to watch until the end despite all the horse shit (which will be discussed later) that takes place from beginning to end. The season finale looked like it was going to be meaningful, but don't be fooled, it's a mediocre harem after all. 
 
There is one filler-like episode where nothing happens plot-wise. It's in this episode that you see exactly how boring this anime would be without the story.  
 
 
Art: 
 
If you ignore the disproportionate tits and constant meaningless panty shots, the artwork is fairly decent. Most of the fight scenes are decent. Some of the action scenes seemed too slow and lazily drawn, but for the most part, they managed to keep the momentum going.  
( '-')b 
 
This anime also contains some scenes of gore. Although it wasn't implemented the way I liked, at least it was a step in the right direction. An arm or leg falling off illogically here and there, very meaningful ( '-')b (sarcasm). Aside from that, gore is decently implemented for scenes where the tits-for-brains syndrome doesn't kick in to overshadow the blood. 
 
I will now tell you about tits, because it seems to be the heart of the anime. Most of the important characters have over-sized over-sized tits. Not so bad right? Well they sure like to slap it on your faces :). What happens when someone gets slashed? They bleed right? Well in the case of Freezing, you constantly wonder where the blood comes from. When a female gets slashed, blood splatters and the cloth covering their tits shreds off. You will notice that the female shows no signs of slash wounds, her tits are conveniently uncovered and unscathed. You begin to wonder where the blood really comes from, them or their clothes? If you happen to like watching clothes (only around their tits) being torn off randomly and illogically during important and meaningful scenes, then this may be the anime for you. Along with that, they seem to think it's a good idea to slap in as many meaningless panty shots as possible. 
 
 
Characters (I think this section has spoilers): 
 
The entire school staff in this anime seems to only consist of two or three tits-for-brains, because that is how incompetent they are. Despite chaos and earthquakes, teachers either are never there to resolve issues, or show up too late. For some reason they seem to only show up when it's inconvenient for the main heroine. FOR SOME REASON, the main heroine is always taking most of the blame even though it's painfully obvious who is at fault. 
 
There is a social hierarchy in the school between students of different grades. For some reason, most of the 3rd year students who are part of the cast are extremely stupid psychos. I wonder why they are not expelled from the school. I forgot, the staff members have tits for brains. 
 
Let me introduce you to the main villain of this anime, the main character (MC). Are you looking for an MC that surpasses the generic harem MC? Well look no further. Actually, you shouldn't look here at all, because the only aspect in which he excels is... stupidity. Take a generic harem MC, and replace his brain with rocks. Congratulations, your typical harem MC has evolved into Aoi Kazuya! It appears that this MC has no sense of common decency whatsoever. During times of crisis he gives out some cool speeches, and sometimes they even sound stupid. There isn't really much depth to this character. Make an MC, throw in some random ""cool"" speeches, make the girls love him for no reason, and don't forget the overdose of idiocy. 
 
Unlike the MC, the main heroine seems to be likable... at first. The main heroine was intriguing. I wanted to know more about her past and why she behaved the way she did. Oh I found out all right, that she is probably delusional. Her backstory contradicts the way she feels for the main character, and she seems to only act like that towards him for... hold on, there is no reason whatsoever. Go harem MC power ( '0')/ 
 
 
Sound: 
 
For god's sake, stop moaning when you transform. Other than that, it seems pretty normal, except for the MC's annoying voice. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
It pains me to watch a potentially good anime being destroyed by excessive fan service, illogical events and characters that lack common sense. Despite the horse shit, the story was interesting, the action scenes had momentum, the animations were decent (excluding fanservice), and the main heroine was interesting (until the later episodes that is).

          
 
       Helpful Let me begin by saying that this is one of the better ecchi anime I have seen to date. Most aspects of it are above average to say the least. However, there's no denying the fact that the anime could've been much better if it had avoided some frustrating cliches. 
 
The thing that struck me the most about this anime is how similar the setting is to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Humankind under threat of invasion by otherworldly beings of alien origin, some kind of top-secret technology that allows them to combat the unknown threat and even conspiracies to top it off. It has NGE written all over it thus far. But this is where the similarities end and, cracks begin to appear. To begin with, I do not think an anime with such a serious theme should have had as much ecchiness as Freezing did. This is a minor complaint though and shouldn't affect the experience much if you've decided to pick it up after seeing the 'ecchi' tag as I did. The second and the biggest problem is that the plot veers wildly off course after the introduction. One doesn't witness epic battles for survival. No, the viewer is instead treated to squabbles between the female protagonist (Satellizer) and other random Pandora. Given the backdrop of the series, this is an odd decision on the part of the producers. That said, the plot does manage to recover partially towards the end. It may be too little too late for some, but I personally liked the cliffhanger ending. If only the plot and setting were bolstered by not-so-weak characterization, maybe this anime would've stood out of the crowd.  
 
The characterization is probably the weakest link in Freezing. In fact, it's downright frustrating. To the extent that you might be inclined to drop the series solely because of it. Let's talk about Satellizer first. She is the only character who receives some semblance of development during the course of the series. This by no means implies that she is tolerable as a character. Satellizer is irritating, period. She comes across as a tsundere of the highest order at the beginning (first few minutes of the first episode). Now, that impression is destroyed as soon as it is created by none other than Aoi Kazuya, the male protagonist. He has a sudden urge to hug her because she resembles his late sister, a legendary Pandora. This effectively sends Satellizer's reputation as the 'Untouchable Queen' down the drain. Thereafter, she transforms into this cute, shy insecure high school girl whenever she comes into contact with Kazuya. This, frankly speaking, is downright pathetic and a pain to watch even after the flashback to her distressing past. The chief reason for this is her 'I will not lose' personality. Under normal circumstances, this is supposed to be something admirable. But it's obvious that this is only a facade and she requires Kazuya to bail her out of tough situations. So, what happens when it's all done? You guessed it, she acts all feminine, says something like 'I didn't need your help' and makes a hurried exit from the scene. Satellizer does change during the course of the series though, in fact, she's the only one. But it comes after eleven episodes of utter stupidity. In other words, it doesn't amount to much. 
 
Aoi Kazuya is another entity that I would like to discuss in detail. But I'll keep this one brief. Basically, he's your idealistic hero who doesn't take 'no' for an answer and is obsessed with becoming Satellizer's Limiter, probably because of his sister complex. Kazuya's okay for the most part, but it has to be pointed out that his tendency to deliver long, emotional (mostly uninspired) speeches can get irritating. Also, he has some kind of mysterious power which makes his Freezing a lot stronger at the right time. Personally, I'm not a big fan of characters with 'hidden potential' who come through for others in the nick of time and that too, recurrently. Personal views aside, Kazuya doesn't receive any development AT ALL. This is unfortunate as he is one of the leads in this show. The rest of the cast is composed solely of extras. Even Rana Linchen, Satellizer's rival, is just that and doesn't serve any other purpose. But as strange as it may seem, she is actually better than either protagonist in many ways. This is one of those rare anime in which the supporting cast is apparently far better than the protagonists. Don't ask me why though, I have no answer. Overall, this is one of the worst assortment of characters I've seen in any anime. 
 
The art and animation are pretty well done for the most and manage to portray action scenes quite nicely. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's more than adequate for an ecchi anime. The same goes for the character designs. They're ok, albeit a tad generic. 
 
The audio on the other hand is slightly disappointing. The voice cast does a pretty good job, but, none of them really stand out. One gripe I have about with regard to this is that most of what Satellizer says to Kazuya after about five episodes is annoying. Almost every dialogue is delivered in an irritating hesitant tone and has numerous pauses which are quite unnecessary. The soundtack is average, but manages to get the job done. 
 
Freezing isn't a bad anime by any means. In fact, it has an interesting setting and more than adequate back-story for an ecchi anime. But it fails to use that solid foundation to its full potential. Weak characterization and an uninteresting plot prevent it from being one of the best products in it's genre. despite everything I have said, I still think it's a good pick for anyone looking for mindless ecchi action. Freezing has a lot of content to satisfy perverted minds.

I LOVE Medieval type stories. Gives me inspiration to write and finish my own personal fictional world.......   
Someday.  
Aaanyway, here is another classic anime review compared to my other previous work. Here, I am going to review ""Legend of Crystania"".  
So, what IS Crystania? Why is this world is so..... ""legendary""?  
I am going to tell you all about so, let's venture right in!  
  
_________________  
**STORY**  
  
Since the beginning of time, Gods of Light and Darkness went to war with at each other. During the midst of battle, legendary dragons appeared whom are called ""God Killers"". When some of the Gods have heard of this, went neutral and fled from the war then created a world of their own, which is known as Crystania.  
The Animal Gods (Beast Gods) have placed their souls to the people and giving them the power of their according animal God.  
""Furries"" if you will.  
After that, The Animal Gods created a lifted the entire world (or island) so high and placed a snake way- um WALL! A snake-looking wall to protect and keep outsiders who tries to enter Crystania.  
Crystania is peaceful....  
Until everything changed, when a man named Ashram who came with his people, searching for a place to migrate.  
Barbas, The Tiger God was there and made a deal with Ashram and later he let them in.  
Sounds reasonable right? However, you'll know more once you've dive in a little into the movie.  
Okay, enough about Barbas and Christopher Columbus searching for India, I mean Crystania.  
Enter Redon/Raydan/Reidong, however this movie tries to name him. Y'know what, I'll call him Raymond, yeah that's it, Raymond. A young prince who doesn't know just yet who would help change Crystania for the better along with his party of ""friends"".  
Gretta – Rogue Class: Loyal to Raymond's royal family and his only purpose to serve and protect Raymond, even if it cost his own life.  
Ovierre – Swordsman Class: A mercenary who would kill and/or follow orders where the money is.  
Rifan – Beginner Mage Class: Young little girl whos mesmerized by Maddam Amerisia and likes hangs around with Ovierre.  
Nasser – Sorcerer Class: Friend to the royal family and close to Raymond.  
Lady Amerisia – Advance Mage Class: Priestess and firm believer who believes that everyone should get along..... basically.  
  
Well then, down to the nitty gritty.  
The story itself is very intriguing but leaves with so many plot holes that will leave you going ""huh?"" Yet, it's enough to get really immersed in. Furry or not. Perhaps all this could work if you maybe try to connect with ""Record of Lodoss War"" then maybe?   
The director's style for this 'Crystania' is jumping from character to character just to have everyone follow along. It's hard to explain. Kinda like, you pick a character from RPG video game and you're following that character's story that connects to other main character's story.  
  
6/10  
_________________  
**ANIMATION**  
  
May be old, but for this kind of animation quality to release back in the late 90's is way ahead of it's time. It's the same animation that worked on ""Record of Lodoss War"".  
I can say, it could still hold up to this very day, for it has that timeless feel to it.  
  
9/10  
_________________  
**SOUND**  
  
Let me put it this way: The main song that plays from the trailer and at the end of the movie, is the BEST SONG EVER!!!  
I couldn't imagine that no one wouldn't ever bobbing their skulls on how good the song is. Best choice they ever picked.  
The OST for Crystania is not bad either. Actually, it’s pretty darn good on which scene is appropriate for use.  
  
9/10  
_________________  
**CHARACTERS**  
  
This is the part where I get REALLY sour.  
The English Dub are okayish but the majority of it but It gets pretty to listen to them talk. The most of the actors are fine for portraying the the character really well. The Original Jap Dub is slightly better and is lesser annoying but I wouldn't they would make 'Crystania' anymore good.  
The whoever the actor who portraid as Rifan, should be booted. Her acting is so cringeworthy, I just thought she should die somewhere.  
I would say the same thing for the main character for this movie too.  
  
Raymond was really nice from the beginning but as he goes through the whole story, he's such a whiny little bastard who so much wanted revenge. There is some character development and he got lesser whining. Of course he does held up on his own in battle.  
Rifan is godawful annoying. She's a child, sure but should be less exaggerated throughout the entire movie.  
  
6/10  
_________________  
**ENJOYMENT**  
  
Yeah, I did enjoyed some. Despite myself power horsing through the acting, I really loved the battle action scenes. Pretty damn brutal when you two furry clans fighting each other and everyone working for the same cause on defeating the final boss (God's King Barbas) then bringing peace.  
I could REALLY see this as a good RPG if there ever is one.  
  
7/10  
_________________  
**VERDICT**  
  
It's a pretty well drawn anime that would have anyone interested and be immersed in a beautiful, yet chaotic world like Crystania. The thing is, ""Legend Of Crystania"" is just an OPENING of the OVA series that comes right after. Despite for all the plot holes and cringeworthy acting, I would give this a solid recommendation for anyone who enjoys the ""Record of Lodoss War"" series. I wouldn't say it's the kind for someone who would enjoy this on a rainy day but it would be fun to look at.  
FURSONA TRANSFURMATION!!!!  
  
VERDICT: 6/10 - Legend? Eh!  
RECOMMENDATION: BUY  
BUY: Solid keeper for anyone who enjoys the Record of Lodoss War series and for those who like Fantasy Stories. 

          
 
       Helpful May include minor spoilers. Alright, since there's no review here, I decided to write one and try and keep it short. Try. Legend of Crystania is a rather average movie overall, but even with all it's flaws I still managed to enjoy it, because I went into it expecting it to be almost exactly as it is: average. 
 
Flaws - First and foremost, LoC suffers greatly from it's short length; there's dozens of loose ends and plot-holes and just general shortcuts/skip. Someone is locked in a room and can't bust out? Next scene they're rejoining the main group with no real explanation as to how they got out. And that's not nearly the worst of it; the anime is incomplete, possibly needing the OVAs eps for conclusion, though I've yet to see them, so I can't tell for sure (judging by the description of the OVA, I'd put my money on them not completing this story) 
 
The characters are very bland, mostly due to the length so none of them really have any depth or backstory, with only a few exceptions with the minor characters that I personally wished would have had more time because they were somewhat interesting. 
 
I'm really not one to care about art, but I've met enough anime fans to know that the art and animation will definitely bother some folks who only want smooth, pretty art, so there's that. 
 
Merits - The action was good, the story was comprehensible and decent, even if it was incomplete and full of holes, and a few of the characters were interesting, even without any depth. And, as I said before, I did still enjoy it. That's honestly all I can say in favor of this anime movie. 
 
Conclusion - Watch it, but do not expect to be wowed. This is definitely a ""bubblegum"" movie; something to watch on a rainy day, when you have nothing else on your plate, and need something to pass the time.

The story itself is very intriguing but leaves with so many plot holes that will leave you going ""huh?"" Yet, it's enough to get really immersed in. Furry or not. Perhaps all this could work if you maybe try to connect with ""Record of Lodoss War"" then maybe?   
The director's style for this 'Crystania' is jumping from character to character just to have everyone follow along. It's hard to explain. Kinda like, you pick a character from RPG video game and you're following that character's story that connects to other main character's story.

**ANIMATION**  
  
May be old, but for this kind of animation quality to release back in the late 90's is way ahead of it's time. It's the same animation that worked on ""Record of Lodoss War"".  
I can say, it could still hold up to this very day, for it has that timeless feel to it.

**SOUND**  
  
Let me put it this way: The main song that plays from the trailer and at the end of the movie, is the BEST SONG EVER!!!  
I couldn't imagine that no one wouldn't ever bobbing their skulls on how good the song is. Best choice they ever picked.  
The OST for Crystania is not bad either. Actually, it’s pretty darn good on which scene is appropriate for use.  
  
9/10

**CHARACTERS**  
  
This is the part where I get REALLY sour.  
The English Dub are okayish but the majority of it but It gets pretty to listen to them talk. The most of the actors are fine for portraying the the character really well. The Original Jap Dub is slightly better and is lesser annoying but I wouldn't they would make 'Crystania' anymore good.  
The whoever the actor who portraid as Rifan, should be booted. Her acting is so cringeworthy, I just thought she should die somewhere.  
I would say the same thing for the main character for this movie too.  
  
Raymond was really nice from the beginning but as he goes through the whole story, he's such a whiny little bastard who so much wanted revenge. There is some character development and he got lesser whining. Of course he does held up on his own in battle.  
Rifan is godawful annoying. She's a child, sure but should be less exaggerated throughout the entire movie.  
  
6/10  
_________________  
**ENJOYMENT**  
  
Yeah, I did enjoyed some. Despite myself power horsing through the acting, I really loved the battle action scenes. Pretty damn brutal when you two furry clans fighting each other and everyone working for the same cause on defeating the final boss (God's King Barbas) then bringing peace.  
I could REALLY see this as a good RPG if there ever is one.  
  
7/10  
_________________  
**VERDICT**  
  
It's a pretty well drawn anime that would have anyone interested and be immersed in a beautiful, yet chaotic world like Crystania. The thing is, ""Legend Of Crystania"" is just an OPENING of the OVA series that comes right after. Despite for all the plot holes and cringeworthy acting, I would give this a solid recommendation for anyone who enjoys the ""Record of Lodoss War"" series. I wouldn't say it's the kind for someone who would enjoy this on a rainy day but it would be fun to look at.  
FURSONA TRANSFURMATION!!!!  
  
VERDICT: 6/10 - Legend? Eh!  
RECOMMENDATION: BUY  
BUY: Solid keeper for anyone who enjoys the Record of Lodoss War series and for those who like Fantasy Stories.

Other characters include Tsubaki Tamashiro (granddaughter of Miwa Uzuki) and Kyo Misumi, Kenji's partners. Other main characters from the original series also appear.
1975, Kyushu. The war against the Great Jama Kingdom is turning against the Japanese Security Forces. During a violent clash between Queen Himika and her generals against the first Jeeg, piloted by Hiroshi Shiba, the bronze bell embedded within Jeeg activates and he is transported to the crater of an extinct volcano. There, he grasps a giant sword, creating an energy vortex that surrounds the entire island. Dark clouds swirl and Kyushu is engulfed in an impenetrable space, later dubbed the ""zone."" All communication with Kyushu ceases. As years go by with no change in the zone recorded, people and even the world's governments lose their interest in the zone, and the world moves on. The Japanese Government, however, decides to build a new Build Base to watch over the zone in preparation for a possible attack.
","A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design. 
 
However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's forms get more use would make it a lot better. 
 
It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

Saeki Makoto's family possesses the power to see the gods' agent, but the ability is limited to one living relative at a time. When Makoto's mother passed away while she was still young, Makoto inherited the ability as the sole remaining family member. With the help of fox spirit's power, Makoto and Gintarou help the people of their community, in spite of their many differences. 
 
(Source: MangaHelpers, edited)","['Seinen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Makoto Saeki is the daughter of a shrine priest in a small Inari Shinto shrine dedicated to the God Ukanomitama. When she was 4 years old, her mother died and she inherited an unusual gift called The Sight, allowing her to see the Shrine's Heralds. She met the messenger of the god Inari, an anthropomorphic fox named Gintarou, during the funeral, and he declared her as the fifteenth generation heiress. Gintarou can see a short glimpse into the future and can find lost things despite being rude and unmotivated, but still develops a good friendship with Makoto. As she is the only girl who can see the spirit, both of them decide to be a go-between for the gods and humans as they try to help those who come to the shrine.
","Gingitsune caught me at a good time, offering a bit of heartfelt drama and a relaxing atmosphere to take it all in with. Looking at the premise I almost skipped over this series entirely, mainly due to my personal bias against slice-of-life and how I usually see them as snore-fests where nothing really happens. In the end I gave the first episode a chance and my expectations were quickly surpassed. 
 
What exactly caught me off guard? It would be the fact that the script and characters brought genuine life to the story, both subtle and meaningful. I’ve grown used to slice-of-life having little to no story, and themes that ultimately are delivered in such a limp-wristed way that you can’t care about it. Already in the first episode, Gingitsune accomplishes to remind me of how drama can teach us things about real questions we face in everyday-life. At its best points, the series focuses on problems ranging from isolation and bullying, to more philosophical matters such as what gives apologies their meaning. 
 
The animation fulfills its purpose and always manages to stay at an above average to great level, showing that plenty of love went into the making of the series. The design and direction manages to be colorful yet never abundantly so to the point where it sticks out, giving it a more neutral tone that feels more grounded in reality, disregarding the presence of fox-spirits and other deities of course. 
 
The use of the soundtrack helps in creating a tranquil environment for the series, with its use of flutes and string-instruments at the forefront, emphasizing the feeling of being at a mysterious shrine that contains more than meets the eye. It is also a perfect fit for the bits of Japanese culture and Shinto religion that is shown. The one thing that could have been improved sound-wise would be some of the voice-acting, as certain voices didn’t fit the characters’ ages, and in the case of the spirits there are some who get very loud and annoying at times. 
 
As for the down-sides of the series, there are a few annoyances and at least one greater flaw. The biggest con among the pros of Gingitsune is that it‘s short and incomplete. Normally when a series’ main flaw is that it leaves you wanting more, that is a compliment. At the time this review is written however, there seemingly is no available manga to continue the story with, leaving the viewer with some loose threads hanging at the end of episode twelve. 
 
Ultimately, Gingitsune captures its audience with a lovable cast and skillful writing that makes you care for the simple things in life. With a relaxed yet mature tone that doesn’t talk down to its audience, Gingitsune includes a lot of heart into its characters and script, ultimately ending up a short but sweet experience.

          
 
       Helpful I finally decided to write a review, yay xD Hopefully somebody will read this incoming rant :P 
 
Gingitsune revolves around a girl Makoto, who can see gods' messengers and a bunch of people around her, mainly her father, friends from school and Gintaro, the fox spirit that resides in the shrine where she and her father live. With Gintaro's power to see glimpses of the future and find lost things,  Makoto tries to help anyone from their little community who comes to the shrine. Around the middle of the series, a boy named Satoru comes to live at Makoto's shrine. He can also see the messengers and has one attached to him as well, Haru. She is also a fox spirit, but a younger one than Gintaro so she is much smaller compared to him and has a childish personality.  
 
The pace story is really slow. It's an episodic anime with no central story. It's just about every day lives, and the relationship between Makoto and her friends, with a little bit of supernatural. If you are looking an anime before bed, that's not hard to understand  and relaxing, this is the right choice for you.  
 
There's nothing much to say about the art; is't pretty decent, somewhat similar to Kotoura-san plus the big white anthropomorphic fox. There are no fantastic nature background images, no detailed outlines nor anything spectacular. I think that flashy art was not needed in this kind of anime anyway, you just watch it to relax, not to see something complicated and out of the ordinary. 
 
There's nothing memorable about the sound, OP and ED songs are also pretty quiet and in accordance to the overall mood of the series. The seiyuus did a good job, nothing out of the ordinary. I personally find Haru's voice a little annoying but that's just a personal opinion. High pitched voices are just too much for me. 
 
The characters are pretty likable and all of them have their own unique personalities. There are lot of hints for a potential romantic relations between a lot of characters, but there was just not enough time to develop anything. It's like the series is just a prologue to something more awesome and engaging. Many dialogs and moments are funny, too, especially between Haru and Gintaro. Satoru's background story brings some drama into the picture too, so I think this series has a lot to offer. 
 
Gingitsune is not a story for the masses, it doesn't have flashy fight scenes, witty dialog or any kind of mystery. All the cards are on the table from the start (except the explanation of how Gintaro got to be the herald of that shrine,which is not essential to anything ), there are no surprises. Still, I found this series really likable and was looking forward to every new episode. I just wanted my 20 minutes of relaxation every week, because that's what this series was for me. Also, Satoru's background story really got me hooked on it and I generally liked him the most. His socially awkward moments were the best, always getting me to giggle and smile.  
 
I would recommend this to fans of Natsume Yuujinchou, because the series has somewhat the same feeling. And also for all fans of Japan in general, because you can also find out about their culture through this, mainly the purification ceremony and some interesting customs. 

          
 
       Helpful I have downgraded this anime for a few reasons. There are some bright spots, but most of it is not very good in my opinion. 
 
I liked the overall general idea that there are some temple people that can talk to temple gods. I thought that was a pretty cool idea and they probably could have done some interesting story elements with that.  
 
But alas! It is a slice of life and I feel that this anime doesn't really get started. For some slice of life, that is fine. Slice of Life is my favorite genre. 
 
But I felt like this slice of life was more character focused and driven. And that was the issue. I thought some of the characters were way to emotional and whiny. It got very annoying and that is why I dropped it. I did my best to use all of my anime logical and just get through it. But at the end of the day, there are so many great series out there.  
 
Everyone, be selfish with your time. Watch what you want, drop what you dont.

12,39063,134,5.487973677,Story between god and human,Fairy Gone,"""Once upon a time, fairies were tools of war."" 
 
The story takes place in a world where fairies possess and dwell in animals, giving them mysterious abilities. By removing the organs of a possessed animal and transplanting them into humans, fairies can be summoned as an alter ego and be used as a weapon. Such individuals who used fairies as war tools were called ""Fairy Soldiers."" Once the war was over and they completed their roles, the soldiers lost their purpose. Some began working for the government, some joined the mafia, and some even became terrorists, as each chose their own way to live. 
 
Nine years have passed since the war. The protagonist Mariya is a new recruit of ""Dorothea,"" an organization which investigates and suppresses fairy-related crimes. Amidst the unstable political situation, criminals with lingering wounds from the war and past conflicts emerge and engage in terrorism as an act of revenge. This is the story of Fairy Soldiers, fighting for their own justice in a chaotic postwar world.

During the war, special soldiers were implanted with Fairy organs, allowing them to summon powerful Fairies to fight under their command. These soldiers were dubbed ""Fairy Soldiers"" and used by all sides. However, nine years after the end of the war, conflict still remains as rogue Fairy Soldiers and criminals take advantage of the postwar instability. To combat this threat, the government agency ""Dorothea"" is formed, whose sole purpose is to combat illegal Fairy users.
One of Dorothea's newest recruits, Marlya, teams up with veteran Fairy Soldier and Dorothea operative Free in hopes of tracking down her long–lost childhood friend Veronica, who is now an illegal Fairy Soldier working for an unknown organization looking to recover an artifact dubbed the ""Black Fairy Tome"".
","I went into Fairy gone optimistic it looked liked a genre I liked with a tech level a little before WW1 plus some fantasy elements. What I got bored me to tears even the action scenes which are supposed to relieve that. 
 
The story takes place after a big war and focuses on these special soldiers that fuze themselves with things called fairies to have access to some horrible CG animalistic parters that sort of have magic powers. It depends on the type as each fairy gives different power sets. Anyhow, we follow what they are doing some work for the government, some for organized crime, and others for other things ...I honestly did not make it that far. 
 
Fairy gone main problem is that it does these big exposition dumps expecting you to care and honestly I don't. It also has this ongoing story between two estranged friends I could care less for. The battle scenes look horrible, and they try and pair them with music that does not fit at all.  
 
I could not tell you anything about the characters anymore they are so forgettable and it is only been a little over two months since I Watched.

       Helpful It has been so long since I wrote a review but this anime is truly GONE. Fairy GONE is a terrible anime with a terrible story to boot.  ~SPOILER FREE review~ TL;DR: Garbage anime do not bother watching, might cause brain damage. 
 
Story:2/10  
The entire premise of the anime is shallow and does not have much of anything.  It just overloads you with mundane information and finishes the story way too quickly. It is just like a nightmare, but you could not escape from it. 
 
Art:6/10 
It has a decent art backing its disgraceful story. I cannot imagine how much money is spent on designing this piece of garbage, that is getting a second season. Truly disappointing with what is has done other than depicting the terrible storyline, it could have done some truly amazing things with their art.  
 
Sound: 7/10 
Pretty decent, it has the right sounds as the right time and have the story in its control. The music is what make one want to watch the story not the other way around.  
 
Character:5/10 
Pretty terrible character development, things happen and they just kill off characters as they deem fit. Too many characters and too little development to understand them and their motives to do the things they do. It become quite underwhelming when it is a seasonal anime that is supposedly hyped up.  
 
~ Overall: 5/10 ~ 
Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to watch this. It might just give you brain damage for all I know, this garbage anime that is. 


          
 
       Helpful You know, I'll give P.A. Works this, the plot at least seems interesting this time.? Compared to Sirius's seemingly generic story idea or how Irozuku is situated in high school, this one at least has a new setting.? Unfortunately that's about the only pass for it I've got... 
 
Story: 
 
The fractured continent was brought together under the name of 'Unified Zesskia' nine years ago after a long period of war to unify the smaller nations thanks to the the liberal use of fairies and 'Fairy Soldiers', warriors created by implanting the creatures' organs into suitable hosts.? As a victim of the war, Marlya Noel joins the neutral faction of Dorothea as the tensions of this newly unified nation arise all the while a figure from her past appears amidst the chaos. 
 
Fairy Gone is a lot of things.? It's a series about the dirtied history and politics of the story's setting, the illegal activity involving three mafia families that each hold secondary power to the government, the secret of the 'Black Fairy Tome' and the lore of the fairies, and one girl's journey to defy her own preconceived notions and search for her friend after the death of her village.? Just at a glance, the story of Fairy Gone is so incredibly dense with material that it actually begs the question what on earth P.A. thought was going to happen when they decided that they only had twelve episodes to pull maximum half of this off. 
 
As such, pacing is the one major issue this series has.? At any point in the series, the story is running at least two concurrent story threads where in one scene, we'll see members of Dorothea follow a lead for something before quickly switching to another perspective a few seconds alter that builds things up from behind the scenes, switching back, then conjoin the two so that the narrative fits together in the end for the story to come to a close.? However the mileage on how well this style of storytelling is executed is heavily variable due to how the story will sometimes bracket the secondary thread and elongate it into the next arc, therefore making it so that the conjoining point encompasses EVERYTHING seen before like some kind of domino effect. 
 
If the series had less plot threads than it did, it would've worked out.? But unfortunately because of P.A.'s narrative decisions, everything feels wholly incomplete: Marlya's story is largely thrown to the side a few episodes in as she's no longer the only focus, the interesting lore of the fairies and by extension the artificial fairies is never touched on to explain any details about them aside from what we see visually, the mafia families serve as more of a convenient plot element to throw in wrenches for the sake of adding more unnecessary characters, thus leaving the whole political element which by comparison is the only functional aspect of the story the series has. 
 
But even that's not really all that interesting because so many parts of the show make it abundantly clear that 'peace' is impossible, so none of it is really a surprise the moment the series does a one-eighty by the end by unleashing the most predictable civil war possible given the numerous amount of anti-political sentiment shared among the side cast. 
 
Because of all of this, Fairy Gone falls into the unfortunate group of shows with ""Great Idea, Bad Execution"", a trend that plagues P.A. Works to the point that I'm not even surprised anymore.? Granted there is a season two airing October 2019, but the damage to the series is already done given how messy and incoherent the series already is as a result of its less than stellar story presentation and execution.? It's so goddamn rushed that I've had to do a number of double takes to make sure I've got everything down because there are an absurd amount of jump cuts and scene changes that it's just sometimes jarring to watch. 
 
Characters: 
 
Marlya Noel is about the closest thing this series has to a protagonist.? A girl who considers herself unlucky due to the sheer amount of people that've died around her because of her mere presence, a lot of Marlya's character revolves around her newfound purpose of trying to do right in Dorothea and searching for her friend, Veronica, who disappeared some time nine years ago after their village burns down.? Even with a new fairy embedded somewhere in her chest, the show doesn't make enough of an effort to make her a protagonist worth rooting for.? So much of her time is devoted to watching her mope around, including an entire episode devoted to hammering in how little she thinks of herself by revealing a backstory where some other dude in her past died with her around.? I find it really hard to root for her and wished the series sometimes just dropped her instead of using her to introduce things while also trying to grow her character. 
 
Free Underbar is another character I'll choose to mention only because both he and Marlya are rarely seen apart.? Free's character...isn't at all fleshed out, and this becomes a common trend amongst a majority of the cast.? Because the show is heavily focused on story above else, the bits of character that we are shown matter little in the long run, and that's no different with this man.? There're a few backstory moments like the day he gets his fairy and flashbacks from the war, but Free largely doesn't do anything aside from function as the Dorothea lapdog that he's made out to be. 
 
Similarly, most if not every other character follows a similar, unfortunate pattern of just being just a pawn in the grand story of this political nightmare.? And not in the good way.? Every episode to couple episodes reveals a new character in some form or another, whether or not they be members of Dorothea, government officials, 'mysterious figures' with motives not shown (and probably will never be shown), mafia people who get stupid names like 'Bitter Sweet' (seriously, what the hell), or people in flashbacks who ultimately don't matter because exploration of character is stupid and who needs that when we've got a war to fight?!? It's best to see these characters as the stage puppets they are since ultimately their impact to the story is only skin deep at being a member of the some seven odd factions that exist in this series.? Because yeah, that makes sense to reveal in a twelve episode season. 
 
Aesthetics: 
 
I'm not really a fan of P.A.'s work this time around.? Fairy Gone lends itself to a darker aesthetic where the colors are more drab or dark with the few colors that do exist have themselves be muted to give off a more serious and mature look to the series.? On the note of characters, one thing that the style really likes to do this time is really exemplify the lips, particularly of the female cast where they either have a noticeable gloss to them that makes them pop out more and/or has a curl in the middle to make them seem more 'realistic'.? Personally I'm not a fan and it was weirdly distracting for me to see so much emphasis, especially on one particular character who seems like a big fan of botox.? Ultimately, the art itself is functional and still lends itself to the style, but compared to what the company is capable of, I'm just not that impressed. 
 
The one thing I will note for art are the fairies and how despite being CGI monsters that clash with the typical style of the series, are genuinely interesting to look at.? Aside from the tiny primordials (who don't get an explanation), each fairy from the characters that wield them physically look different and are more reminiscent of European folklore's fae creatures that take on numerous horrendous or monstrous designs with their own unique skillsets.? I'm just personally a fan because anything that uses the original meaning of fairy with interesting, unique designs is just better in my book. 
 
Animation is largely saved for the fight scenes which are fluid enough to warrant being noted.? Of course the CGI models for the fairies cut down on costs, but the fight choreography is good enough to warrant interest.? However it's not really anything special, especially given how a lot of the 'fight' scenes involve guns and ducking behind cover, with only a few featuring the swords and fairy weapons showcased. 
 
As for the soundtrack, ""KNOCK on the CORE"" by (K)NoW_NAME is an OP that I've grown to have interest in only for the background choir and the steady rock beat that it has to really push how the show is an action-packed adventure despite having 'Fairy' in the title.? It's a nice song that's worth a listen to, but that's about all I can really credit it for since beyond that, I don't really find it memorable.? Similarly, its ED sister ""Ash-like Snow"" by the same artist is only interesting because of how it starts with the lead up of the piano before going into a song that largely feels generic despite how it starts. 
 
Personal Enjoyment: 
 
I'm just going to have to accept the fact that P.A. Works doesn't know the definition of 'follow through', now do I?? Like all P.A. Works shows, I was very, very, very, very, very, VERY skeptical on how Fairy Gone was gonna do.? The company only does original shows, and while the onset looked interesting, I was almost positive at the time of seeing this advertised that this was going to crash and burn somehow; I just didn't know how. 
 
Well, apparently it's by following in the steps of Angel Beats and Charlotte by making the narrative so absurdly complex through dumping in every idea you could think of for the plot and saying 'no' to none of them.? I'm honestly just tired having to write and say the same fucking thing for every P.A. Works, but they keep fucking doing it!? Now I don't hate Fairy Gone.? In fact, I actually find the show to be very interesting because of how many facets of this narrative they managed to cram in here.? But because all of them are half-assed in the way they are, I find it very hard to give the show any other positive qualities aside from maybe neat designs for the soldiers' fairies.? It's just...disheartening, really disheartening to see the same cycle get repeated season after season, year after year. 
 
So ultimately I do not recommend this series.? I'm still watching the second season just to know how it ends (and I've signed a blood oath to watch everything P.A. makes henceforth), but I think for the casual/typical watcher, you're better off finding something else to watch.? A damn shame too cause a part of me was really looking forward to having something from this company to recommend to people aside from the usual three to four shows I found to be at least of decent quality.

To avoid being killed by the zealots of Mauser, Pacifica and her adoptive brother and sister leave the village of Manhurin. Her brother, Shannon, is an expert with the sword while Racquel is proficient with magic. At every step of the way, however, someone is constantly trying to kill Pacifica, hoping to somehow avert the catastrophe that is supposed to befall the world on her 16th birthday. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","The story takes place in what appears to be a fantasy world (revealed later to be Earth in the distant future) and revolves around a girl named Pacifica Casull, the sister in a pair of twins born to the royal family of a kingdom called Leinwan. Pacifica is abandoned at birth. The 5111th Grendel Prophecy predicts that she is the ""poison that will destroy the world"" if she reaches her sixteenth birthday. To prevent this, she is dropped off a cliff as an infant (""scrapped"").
Pacifica is rescued by a court wizard and adopted by the commoner Casull family. Her foster siblings, Shannon, a swordsman, and Raquel, a wizard, become her protectors. Both siblings are extremely powerful and, more often than not, they easily break out of whatever difficult situation they face. Her siblings travel with her throughout most of the story, protecting her from the numerous attempts on her life by people who fear the outcome of the prophecy. Both siblings' skills see constant use. By contrast, Pacifica is mostly a typical fifteen-year-old and her inability to defend herself is a recurring source of self-doubt for her, as is the constantly repeated insistence that she will destroy the world.
As the series progresses, the truth about the prophecy slowly comes to light, but even as more of the truth is revealed, more questions arise. Pacifica must discover her hidden destiny, as powerful beings called Peacemakers, who are worshipped in this world as demi-gods, continually manoeuvre to have her destroyed. At the same time, a mysterious being called a Dragoon comes to the aid of Pacifica and her guardians, offsetting the attack of the Peacemakers. It turns out that Pacifica is not ""the poison that will destroy the world"", but humanity's last hope, as part of a plan that was set in motion 5000 years before by scientists among the human resistance during what were called the Genesis Wars.
Before the Genesis Wars, the Peacemakers were created by humans as weapons against humanity's alien foes, but, determined to protect their human creators and prevent them from destroying themselves, the Peacemakers switched sides and assisted the aliens by imprisoning the survivors of the war in an artificial environment, while at the same time backing up their cultural development to the Middle Ages. The Peacemakers were able to do this with the help of a gifted psychic named Celia Mauser, who, like the Peacemakers themselves, had originally been a tool of the defense. Her powers were used to enhance humanity's weaponry, to the point where it was possible to predict enemy movements. The Peacemakers encouraged Celia Mauser to leak information to them in exchange for the lives of her brother and sister. She was too late; her siblings died, and Celia Mauser's treason was for nothing. Celia was then kept in an area of phase space in a sort of virtual reality for 5000 years, while humanity continued to live on unknowingly in an intangible cage, isolated on a single continent called Dusbin. Her powerful mind was programmed into the artificial environment's control system, and the religion concocted by the aliens to control humanity worships her as a god.
For 5000 years, the Peacemakers watched over humanity, keeping cultural development at a standstill, and prepared to wipe out much of the human race if it ever showed any sign of stepping beyond its apportioned limits (as the Kingdom of Leinwan does toward the end of the series when the attempt is made to coerce the Peacemakers into helping them conquer the world). As the Peacemakers put it, ""You don't know you are trapped if all you've ever known is your cage."" Humans are completely incapable of resisting the will of the Peacemakers. Just looking a Peacemaker in the eye renders a human obedient – even Shannon and Raquel are not immune to this. Pacifica is the only human being in 5000 years who is immune to this control, and her ability will become communicable to others once she reaches her sixteenth birthday. This is why the Peacemakers are determined to destroy her, and why they have used the Grendel Prophecies to induce others to do the job for them, since Pacifica cannot be directly attacked by the Peacemakers. In the end, Pacifica's twin brother, Prince Forsyth, who has seen the suffering inflicted on his people by the Peacemakers in their attempts to eliminate Pacifica, asks to meet her. Her guardians allow it and he uses the opportunity to stab her in the back, ten hours before she turns sixteen. This causes her to be removed to the phase sphere, where she meets Celia Mauser and is given the choice of whether humanity will remain in their prison or not. Pacifica chooses freedom.
","This is one of those anime taking place in older times, with knights and a medieval stuff, for a while anyway. 
 
This show has a relatively slow moving plot, but once it picks up, you really start to get interested in it.  I will admit though, even once it picks up, the plot still moves slow, but its the interesting things that happen that keep you wanting to watch more, and trust me, the ending is pretty sweet and worth watching. 
 
The magic is pretty cool and the &quot;bad guys&quot; have some pretty unique talents that make battle scenes pretty fun to watch.  there is plenty of sword/physical fighting as well as magic and dragons to balance it out.   
 
The characters are pretty interesting, although i have to say the secondary characters are more often than not more interesting than the main, even though the main characters is supposed to be wrapped in mystery.  All the characters grow on you, and they balance out pretty well with each other. 
 
The art work is done well for a medieval setting, and although some of the characters are lacking in the fresh look department, others more than make up for it.   
 
Overall enjoyable series.  I've only seen the dub which wasn't too bad, but the sub is probably better so watch that one if you can.

Story: 8/10 
While Scrapped Princess has what can be called a traditional story, it takes some very untraditional twists and turns. There is a lot of emotion here as we watch Pacifica buckle under the pressure of having this existence thrust upon her, being hunted down like an animal for reasons she is not even certain of. 
 
Art & Animation: 8/10 
Scrapped Princess was animated by Bones, so it goes without saying that it looks beautiful. Though the show is a bit older than the similar-looking Fullmetal Alchemist?Scrapped Princess far exceeds it in terms of animation and artwork. There are no ""soft-spots"" where the animators were slacking off. Every episode looks as beautiful as the last, and even as it approaches 13 years mark, it still remains one of the more beautiful TV animes I have seen. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
Composer Hikaru Nanase (Noein, Zone of the Enders, Gravion) provides her usual fare; a very competent, sweeping, and fitting orchestral soundtrack. There are quite a few standout pieces here and there, and overall, the music encapsulates the scenery very well, but some of it is much the same of what you would expect in your average RPG video game rather than series such as this. The opening and ending themes for the show are very fitting, with a nice Celtic vibe and especially with the latter, beautifully sung lyrics. 
 
Character: 9/10 
The interactions between Pacifica and the other characters are very sincere, and are the centerpiece of the show. In particular are some of the more candid moments between Pacifica and Shannon, whom are easily the two most well-constructed characters in the show. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
As a high fantasy fan, I really enjoyed the show, even though I admit it has slow moving plot, theres always something interesting happening that keep you to continue watching it, Heck I've watched this series 3 times already both in Dubbed and Subbed versions, While there is nothing wrong with the Japanese voice cast, the English voice acting in Scrapped Princess is some of the finest voice work I have ever heard. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
What you have here is an excellent show with excellent pacing and excellent writing. Not only is it one of the finest examples of a fantasy anime, it is one of the best I have ever seen in all my years of anime watching. There is a perfect balance between drama and comedy, and the transitions between the two are smooth and well-executed. If you have any love for shows like The Slayers or Lodoss, Scrapped Princess is an absolute must-see. Even if not, Scrapped Princess is more than worth a look.

          
 
       Helpful This is so much like Slayers and Rune Soilder but then, it’s not like anything that really has been done before. It is placed in a fantasy kingdom called Leiwan that’s pretty much under a religious order.  
 
Pacifica always acts like a princess even though she grew up with her brother and sister. For a 15 year old girl, she pretty much acts like any normal 15 year old girl. Bitchy, whiny and all together bothersome in most places. She does get annoying at some times but in the end, you really feel for her. She was thrown away at birth and has only her foster siblings to live with. You can really tell that she loves both her siblings but it seems that she really loves Shannon. I guess you could consider her to have a big brother complex even if he isn’t her real brother. Although she is always called the poison that will destroy the world, she makes lasting impressions on those that meet her. 
 
Shannon himself seems to always have problems wondering what he should even do. He fights within himself on the duty he has for his family and for all the other people around him. Even though he fights within himself, when on the battlefield, he protects her without thought. I myself think he looks really cute by the way. He is really reserved and doesn’t really show his emotions towards his siblings. He hates anybody outside the family and doesn’t trust them even if they show that they can be. When we talk about Shannon, we also have to talk about Zefiris who shows up in episode 2. I won’t exactly say why, but she has a large connection to Shannon and helps them with information. She sounds just like a computer with how logical she talks and acts.  
 
Raquel is the oldest of the siblings, very kind and motherly to both Shannon and Pacifica. She normally keeps a level head and uses powerful magic, able to cast them rather fast. She doesn’t really have a lot of backstory and her personality to me feels a bit like it is lacking on some aspects, not really as filled out as Shannon and Pacifica. When putting her next to the other two, she doesn’t stand out as well as the others in the series including the people who are not related. 
 
Leo takes up the clueless knight area. He is a noble knight who falls in love with Pacifica and his love never seems to faulter no matter what. He is always proposing to her and trying to protect her when he sees her until finds out about her being a scrapped princess. After that, he fights with himself with the question ‘What is Chivalry?’ and the question haunts him. 
 
The Animation is wonderfully done with fluid movements as known from Studio Bones. I don’t really see many problems in the artwork as every little detail is done pretty well. There are things that I nit pick about it though like in the second episode, what the hell is the map the old women gave them? There is nothing to actually use to find the house they are looking for! 
 
The opening is really lovely, and sounds really nice like a fairy tail beat. I truly love the English dub of the show even if it seems a little off in some of the background characters. The main characters are pretty perfect for the show, giving it the air of class. Crispin Freeman does a perfect job as Shannon, like almost all the characters he does, and makes him sound reserved and calm. He does sometimes seem too reserved but I think that more fits him. There are a lot of words that are used without much definition to the point that we sort of need a Glossary to figure them out. I wish they had a little more information about the different things like the Dragoon and Phase Space. Many of them are rather technical for a fantasy based show and open up the posiblities of something else going on.

","Yokai Watch Shadow Side Rise of the Oni King is the best Yokai Watch movie! The events of this film take place thirty years after the main Yokai Watch series with new human characters and different art style. (Well, everyone gets an updated art-style expect Enma, Nurarihyon, and Kaira. They kept the old look.) 
 
While the main series is a comedy-fantasy, this film ditches the comedy (there are still a few funny moments) and goes straight fantasy. I'd actually go so far as calling this film a dark fantasy. There are really only two things that connect Shadow Side to the main series: 1. The main characters use a watch to summon yokai. 2. Some of the yokai from the main series play major roles in this film. Seriously, if an entire new case of yokai were introduced, and the humans used something other then a watch for summoning and exorcisms (one of them does), there would be no reason to call this a Yokai Watch film. Not to say that's bad thing. Yokai Watch Shadow Side Rise of the Oni King is a great film, and Yokai Watch is a great series. I'm just saying Shadow Side isn't really a sequel. 
 
Oh, and one more thing, I wasn't expecting Kitaro to appear in this film. That was a pleasant surprise. This film is technically a crossover between Yokai Watch and Gegege no Kitaro. (Was there a demand for one???)

Two youths fight for survival on our hostile planet and find hope. The sea, the sky and the land had been completely polluted by mankind when mysterious objects fall from the heavens. These titanic vessels smash into the planet and suck up the air, water, and most living creatures into their womb, stealing away the very essence of Earth`s nature. 
 
The few remaining inhabitants struggle for survival against a hostile environment and an oppressive ruling race known as the Rodo. One young, hot-blooded human named Ran, fights against the Rodo and a world in which rain is only a legend. He strives to join an Anti-Rodo group known as the Hazzard, not only to defeat the Rodo, but also to hunt down the man who killed his mother. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']","Green Legend is set in a science fiction-style post-apocalyptic Earth, which has turned largely into a vast desert after an alien invasion, in which six of the ""Rodo"" (a race of what appear to be giant monoliths) crashed onto Earth from space, somehow effecting massive climate change which has completely wiped out the oceans and rain. At the time, mankind was ruining the environment, making an apocalypse of some sort inevitable (similar to other environmentally-focused anime like Nausica? of the Valley of the Wind; in general style, Green Legend is much like Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water and Future Boy Conan).
In this brutal new world, two polarized factions have arisen: the first faction, the ""Rodoists"" are a fanatical religious sect who worship the Rodo while practicing hydraulic despotism; all communities are clustered around one of the monoliths, as they are the only remaining sources of water and food - most of which is gathered quite close to the monoliths in what they call the ""Holy Green"". Travel between communities is infrequent, as at a certain distance from the monoliths, the environment peters out to the point that the air itself cannot be breathed - necessitating pressurized vehicles akin to spaceships. The second faction, the ""Hazard"", is a secretive revolutionary movement opposed to the Rodoists.
The protagonist (Ran the greener) is a young orphaned boy who seeks to survive, to join the Hazard, and to find and take revenge upon the man with a scar on his chest who killed his mother. He blunders into the middle of a battle between the Hazard and the Rodoists, during which he meets a strange silver-haired girl named Aira.

Ran attempts to board the sand ship, but fails, and begins pursuing it across the desert in a stolen pressure suit. He is rescued by traveling water and food merchants just before his air runs out.

The rescue goes awry when the Rodoists attack the Hazard sand ship and recapture Aira as Ran and the merchants attempt to infiltrate the same sand ship.
","Green Legend Ran is an OVA from the early 90s. It was brought to us by AIC, the same studio that was responsible for Battle Athletes, Blue Gender, SoltyRei, Explorer Woman Ray & a variety of others. I don't know anything going into it besides it being science fiction. So, let's take a look and see if this one, unlike the last OVA I dug up, is worth a look.  
 
Story: 
 
In the distant future our planet has been transformed into a world of desserts after giant extra terrestrials dropped onto our planet. There are contained patches of green, but they're few and hidden away. In this world, the ruling class is made up of the Rodoists, people who worship the invading aliens and control the water supply. An opposition faction called Hazzard has also stepped up to fight against the Rodoists while most people are caught in the middle. We follow Ran, a young man who wants to join Hazzard to take revenge for his mother's death. She was killed by a man with a scar on his chest during a confrontation betwixt the Rodoists & Hazzard. He meets up with  Hazzard and befriends a girl his age named Aira. She's immediately abnormal because of her silver hair. Normally that wouldn't be strange in an anime, but in this one it's significant. What does her silver hair mean? Will Ran manage to find his mother's killer? What will happen between the factions? 
 
While there are some interesting ideas on display, the execution leaves much to be desired. The series is pretty passable at building things up but its resolutions tend to last for all of thirty seconds and be unsatisfying. Ran spends most of the OVA repeating himself and contributing very little to the events that are happening. The story arc manages to simultaneously drag and skip over important elements. We'll get long, slow periods that will contribute little or repeat information we already have and then we'll skip ahead in time and be left with the impression that something important happened between the scenes but they aren't sharing what. The environmental message in this is also really unsubtle and in your face. On a scale of Captain Planet bad to a Miyazaki film, it comes considerably closer to Captain Planet.  
 
To the OVA's credit, it does have some pretty strong moments when it manages to keep its focus. I also do kind of like the ending to the series. It does subvert the kind of ending you'd expect.  
 
Characters: 
 
There are some major problems with the characterisation in this OVA. First off, there are the villains. When a villain is supposed to be somewhat sympathetic, the series tries to hammer that in with really stilted dialogue. Which may or may not work. When a villain is just a villain, they're cartoonishly, over the top evil. Then we have Ran himself. He's a really dull character. It doesn't help that he's largely completely inept and just yammers on about the same things constantly. There's also the dynamic betwixt Aira and Ran. It comes across as completely contrived in order to move the plot. They spend maybe a day in one another's company and all of a sudden they're the best of friends and willing to completely rely on one another. I would only buy that if one of them was actually a dog. Not a dog in human form, but a literal dog of some kind.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork and animation vary. On one hand, the OVA is quite good when it comes to strange, surreal imagery. There are quite a few scenes that employ that aesthetic effectively. In contrast, their stuff with ordinary people can be pretty bad. There are a lot of awkward movements that no normal human would do without actively trying to contort themselves, a lot of awkward facial expressions that don't actually match the emotion that the character is supposed to be conveying and a lot of action sequences weakened by a combination thereof. There's also the design of their desert suits to be considered. They look like they're made of heavy material and they have completely unnecessary shoulder pads. Because when you're under a hot sun, you want heavy material with extra features that weigh you down. There's also the question of how they're supposed to function. They look a bit like diving suits. Initially, I thought they might be like proto-stillsuits where they recycle a character's lost moisture but there's never any indication that they can get moisture from them. It's almost like they didn't even consider functionality and just designed something stupid. At least it wasn't a battle bikini.  
 
Sound: 
 
The performances in this aren't bad but they aren't good either. Ultimately what we get from Kikuchi Hidehiro, Yayoi Mitsuki and the others are passable performances. The music from Yoshikawa Youichirou is decent enough. It's not as good as the soundtrack he did for Iria, certainly, but it's all right.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
Don't expect to find any here.  
 
Final Thoughts:  
 
Ultimately, Green Legend Ran is a series with a promising premise, that's held back by poor execution. The story ends up with more weak moments than strong moments. The characters are largely bland, or worse. The artwork is bad when it comes to conveying normalcy and the acting is just mediocre. It's not a bad little OVA, but in the end, my final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's weak. Next week I'll look at another OVA with AD Police. 

          
 
       Helpful Green Legend Ran is an interesting little OVA from the early 90s that's probably too ambitious for its own good. It's got ancient aliens, a post-apocalyptic earth, opposing factions consisting of religious extremists and their corresponding resistance, a revenge plot, a love story, and some kind of environmental message. Taking place in such a detailed setting with such a detailed lore, it doesn't quite know where to start and where to end.  
 
And that's a major problem for Green Legend Ran: It has lots of interesting ideas, but it doesn't spend the appropriate amount of time on each one, and in that way its two hour run time paradoxically feels both too long and too short. The narrative that's woven between all of these concepts can be a little jarring as a result, causing the motivations of some characters to come into question. Some holes are present in the plot, too. While it's not really hard to catch on eventually, it is hard to feel engaged when you're not always invested in what's going on. And, although the concepts can be interesting, they're sometimes relegated to expository dialogue instead of being explored through actions. 
 
The main characters of this OVA are Ran and Aira, and they have some pretty good chemistry together. In fact, the best scene of the series is simply a lighthearted one that features the two of them playfully getting to know each other while on an errand to fetch some resources. The animators portray their body language so fluidly and realistically here that it's just really fun to watch. But, as fun as it is, the scene's simply not long enough to convince the viewer that Ran already feels as strongly as he does for Aira. As soon as she gets snatched up by the bad guys, he's already dead set on risking his life for her, and they've only talked for what was maybe twenty minutes at best. Not only is this abrupt parting unsuccessful in providing a compelling character motivation for Ran, it also robs the rest of the series of further interactions between these two characters, which is especially disappointing. 
 
Ran himself isn't exactly the most likable character, either—at least sometimes. It's an odd situation where the show clearly tries its hardest to make you care for him...and you know, it does work to an extent, but there's just something about it that doesn't feel genuine—like they were going through a checklist of things they could mix together to make a protagonist that would earn your sympathy, when ultimately he just comes across as a nasally-voiced little shit half the time. The emotional climaxes of his arc seem kind of awkward, too, probably due to him hardly getting the chances to interact with those characters who are supposed to be so important to him. However, Ran does have some cute moments with Jeke that do manage to feel genuine despite their predictability. 
 
What probably ends up being the most fascinating aspect of this series is its atypical interpretation of environmentalism. It's almost the antithesis to the idealistic pro-earth beliefs of someone like Hayao Miyazaki; here, rather than being put on a pedestal, the forces of nature are represented by an oppressive alien god who actually feels like an exaggerated mockery of the type of person who would love nothing more than to see the earth purged of us ""rotten humans"" who do nothing but destroy it. This series proposes that wishing for such a thing would probably be going too far and that moderation is important for both sides. To be fair, though, Miyazaki's works never quite go that far either, as they usually end on the hopeful note of giving humans a second chance. However, nature is usually portrayed as the side that's deserving of the most respect in his stories, and it'll certainly never be painted as the villain. (And, if you've read certain quotes from the man, you'll know he's the type who'd probably be more in agreement with the ""screw humanity"" creed of the alien god of this story.) Regardless, it is refreshing to see an anime that tackles this subject matter from an angle that's different from what's seen most of the time. 
 
Now, if there's one thing that's clear about this OVA it's that it looks very good. It's got appealing character designs, the animation is stellar, and there's a lot of momentum that's given to every action; objects and characters have a nice physicality and weight to them. The setting of the series also really comes through in the creative shot compositions that show off the gorgeous landscapes of the desert and the rows of rusty industrial buildings. There's also a great use of lighting here, where vivid, colorful rays and other shapes frequently shine though and pop against the darker backdrops creating an atmosphere with a lot of depth. The only negative when it comes to the look of the show is the occasional use of black gradients that are thrown on top of shots which looks pretty lazy and distracting. But, other than that, the visuals provide nothing but eye candy throughout the entire series. 
 
The more I think about it, the more the story of Green Legend Ran actually feels like something better suited for a long JRPG, where all of its ideas could've had the time to shine. Some scenes even feature segments that could've easily been gameplay instead, particularly one moment where Ran has to follow directions written on notes left by another character in order to make it through a mysterious maze. That being said, the glimpse we do get of this world, however disjointed, is one that's filled with imagination. Its attitude towards the environmentalism debate is intriguing enough on its own. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I first stumbled upon this quaint little OVA at used bookstore, in a similar fashion to how I first discovered Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna… I thought the cover looked interesting and bought the VHS for a $1 on the clearance rack! The $1 was well worth the investment—Green Legend Ran changed my life, in my teens, and I still think about it quite often in my ‘20s! 
 
—Story/Characters 
 
Green Legend Ran takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has become a *barren wasteland after an alien invasion. Six of the “Rodo”—a race of giant monoliths that are revealed to be more than what they seem later in the OVA—crash through the atmosphere and, through emitting a force field of carbon dioxide in the areas where they land, causing all of the planet’s food and water to erode. The massive climate change causes the divide between the wealthy and poor to become more extreme, leading the wealthier class to monopolize the remaining reservoirs. 
*Think Fist of the North Star. 
 
The two factions are: 
a)	The ‘Rodoists’—the wealthy have taken to hoarding the remaining sources of food and water from the poor. They also fanatically worship the Rodo, despite their lack of communication with the monoliths. They refer to the areas around the monoliths as the ‘Holy Green.’ 
b)	The ‘Hazard’—a revolutionary movement that opposes the Rodoists. 
 
Travel between communities is infrequent, at a certain distance away from the monoliths, because of the carbon dioxide, the air between the impoverished and the ‘Holy Green’ can’t be breathed—necessitating *pressurized vehicles and suits. The only people that are legally authorized to use the pressurized vehicles and suits are merchants that bring the small villages food and water from the ‘Holy Green’ but it is barely enough to survive on and many of the villagers die from either starvation or dehydration. 
*The suits and vehicles are very similar to equipment used for space travel. 
 
Ran is a young, orphaned boy who seeks to survive, join the Hazard, and enact revenge on the man who murdered his mother, a muscular man with a scar on his chest. During a failed Hazard attack, he meets *Aira. During their meeting, Aira slaps him for trying to kill a wounded Rodoist and she says that he’s no different from them if he’s a murderer. After spending some time around Aira’s tranquil aura, Ran’s anger begins to wane. 
 
Suddenly, the Rodoist army attacks the Hazard base and Aira is abducted. Ran tries to board the Rodo *sand ship as it is taking off, doubly enraged at the sight of the man who killed his mother, but fails. Ran attempts to traverse the desert in a stolen pressure suit to rescue Aira from the Rodoist’s base and is rescued by traveling merchants, right before the oxygen tank in his suit runs out.  
*Think Frank Herbert’s Dune. 
 
The merchant leader, a contemplative man named Jeke, offers Ran his assistance to rescue Aira. They infiltrate the ‘Holy Green’ disguised as supply shipment, and it is revealed that Aira is not only abducted by the Rodoists to *extract water from her veins but to also as *a source of communication with the Rodo. Meanwhile, Ran catches up with Aira—after the man who killed his mother, Kiba, comes face-to-face with Jeke, who is then revealed to be Ran’s father! 
*Aira is a descendant of Rodo, born from the monolith, so she’s a plant-human hybrid. Rodoists are able to distinguish descendants of Rodo apart from normal humans because of their silver hair. In captivity, she meets Rurui, another descendent of Rodo, who talks to her telepathically before he dies from having all of the water extracted from his body. It’s not explicitly stated but it implies that they keep her alive, as a source of communication, because she’s a sexually attractive female and the previous descendent was male. 
 
Rodo manifests itself into a human form and tells Aira that the Rodo can replenish Earth’s greenery, but are waiting for the remaining humans to kill each other, so all other lifeforms of Earth won’t be destroyed by human greed. Rodo urges Aira to join the past maidens in a collective conscious to let humans be their own undoing. Aira pleads with Rodo to give humanity another chance; Rodo concedes and decides to leave the planet with the other monoliths. 
 
Jeke leaves behind an escape plan for Aira and Ran to be ejected from Rodo’s alien pods that are filled with seeds. Jeke then blows up the Rodoist’s base, killing most of them, himself, and Kiba; and the Rodo lifts up into space and it begins to *heavily rain; and the Earth begins to go back to how it used to be, before the apocalypse. The end. 
*In the first OVA, it only shown to sparsely rain. To the point where the people in the Hazard faction can barely even glean sustenance from how little it does. 
 
Before Green Legend Ran, many of the OVAs I had seen weren’t able to form a cohesive story; that’s why my mind was blown upon my first viewing! The conclusion with hopeful melody of ‘Tears and Rain’ by Ichirō Suzuki playing, while Aira and Ran glance lovingly at each other is one of the greatest endings! 
 
The characters weren’t the strongest but the duality between Ran and Aira’s demeanors, as well as the roles that they played—more than made up for it! I still believe that Green Legend Ran is a criminally underrated gem, and after revisiting it, I still believe that! If only, more people would just sporadically find something at a used bookstore and decide to check it out on a whim. I still am fairly sporadic with streaming, but there was a certain magic to staring at a physical VHS cover and eagerly anticipating whether it would be good or not!

The solid scripting is thanks to the writer, Yū Yamamoto, who also wrote Mobile Suit Gundam. Yoshiyuki Tomino often gets all the credit for creating Gundam, so much that the people under him efforts are depreciated in the process. Despite my nostalgia for Green Legend Ran, one of the reasons that I rate it so highly is because of its tight story telling! 
 
The director of Green Legend Ran, Yoshimitsu ?hashi, doesn’t have many series that he chiefly directed: Amnesia, Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution, Bakumatsu Kikansetsu Irohanihoheto, Galaxy Angel, and Kokkoku—while many of the series aren’t above aren’t very widely acclaimed, Galaxy Angel and Kokkoku both have their own niche followings! ?hashi also did key animation for a lot of animations that I am a fan of, like Bakuen Campus Guardress, Darkside Blues, Fushigi no Umi no Nadia, Tokyo Babylon, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust! 
 
Conclusively, Green Legend Ran is story that still tugs at my heartstrings—after more than a decade of initially watching it. My eyes still tear up when I hear the opening verse of ‘Yasashisa wa Furu Ame no Yōni’ or when I think about Aira and Ran’s scene together at the reservoir or when Aira pleads with the Rodo to forgive humanity for its mistakes; Green Legend Ran is a powerful OVA that is still near and dear to my heart! It’s an animation that will always be beautiful to me and stands the test of time! 
NOTE: Gin'iro no Kami no Agito borrowed a lot from Green Legend Ran’s story, but blundered in its execution.

12,5289,138,5.366042936,Story between god and human,Beast Wars Second Chou Seimeitai Transformers: Lio Convoy Kiki Ippatsu! Movie,"The movie begins with a space battle between the space pirate Seacons and the Cybertron Jointron brothers. Both combine, forming God Neptune and Tripledacus respectively, and being fighting it out. They become heavily engaged in combat, until a mysterious spaceship knocks them both deeper into space. Back at the Cybertron base, one of the Cybertron warriors, Apache, informs the Cybertrons that an object is approaching Planet Gaea. The Destrons have also noticed the spaceship. Galvatron and his brother Gigastorm discuss it and Galvatron decides that the ship is a positive sign, and it will bring good luck.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure']","In Gaia's atmosphere, the Jointrons and the Seacons battle each other but both factions are interrupted by the arrival of a large spaceship which rams into them and sends them all flying into space before crash landing on the planet, and the Maximals and Predacons are immediately alerted. On the Galvaburg II, Gigastorm recommends destroying the ship but Galvatron is interested and believes it may hold good fortune for the Predacons. On the Yukikaze Lio Convoy orders a unit sent to investigate the ship but Lio Junior, Lio Convoy's son, wishes to go but the other Maximals shoot him down, but Tasmania Kid stands up for him and asks if both can go and Lio Convoy approves and has Stanton and Skywarp accompany also. The 4 Maximals arrive at the ship and discover a “teleport gate”, an ancient device capable of opening a doorway into the past and transporting any living creature into the present, Transformers included but it requires a control unit to function. When Lio Junior finds it the Predacon Combaticons Hellscream, Dirgegun, Thrustor and Max-B swoop in and steals it but Lio Junior dives off after it alone and the Predacons overpower and nearly kill him, but before Hellscream can fire a finishing blow Kid takes the hit as the other Maximals arrive and scare off the Predacons and secure the control unit.
When Kid doesn't respond to medical treatment the other Maximals blame Lio Junior for his condition and he becomes mad at them as they have the ship and the control unit and is frustrated of not having any respect. Lio Convoy though agrees with his troops and scolds Lio Junior's actions calling him reckless, impatient and is more concerned with destroying Predacons, not protecting innocent lives as per the Maximals code. Lio Junior though snaps and runs off vowing to kill the Predacons himself but forgetting to return the control unit first. As the Maximals return to their ship to tend to Kid's wounds Dirgegun informs Galvatron how the machine works and seeking advantage of Lio Junior's feud with his father, seeks him out and deceives him. He tells Lio Junior that the Predacons accidentally activated the teleport gate and it will self-destruct in under an hour and destroy the whole planet unless the control unit is returned. A barely functioning Tasmania Kid however arrives and begs Lio Junior not to trust him but Galvatron knocks him out and despite his hatred for Galvatron, Lio Junior accompanies him back to the Galvaburg to shut down the machine, and to prove his worth to the Maximals, but once Galvatron has the control unit he drops the facade and has Lio Junior imprisoned in the ship. Galvatron announces his intention to the Predacons, and Lio Junior, to summon the Predacon Megatron from the Beast Wars on prehistoric Earth (set during Beast Wars) to assist him destroying the Maximals.
After Kid awakens and returns to the Maximal's ship he informs Lio Convoy of his son's defection and Galvatron having possession of the control unit so Lio Convoy orders the Maximals to rescue his son and stop Galvatron from activating the teleport gate. Before doing so Lio Convoy expresses a deep resentment for his son's actions but Kid begs him not to treat him so harshly as he is just young, and Lio Convoy eases up. Elsewhere Gigastorm activates the teleport gate to summon Megatron but miscalculates and instead summons the colossal Decepticon giant Majin Zarak but due to his immense strength and arsenal of weapons Galvatron is even more pleased. Galvatron assumes command of the seemingly mindless giant and transforms him into aircraft carrier mode and takes Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers to face down the Maximals while Dirgegun and Thrustor guard Lio Junior.
The Maximals detect the arrival of Majin Zarak, much to their horror, and prepare to face him using a small shuttle but Zarak's firepower proves too intense to evade and they regroup for a land ambush. Meanwhile, Lio Junior escapes as Stanton and Skywarp arrive and Lio Junior apologises for his rash behaviour and asks them to accompany him to the teleport gate, as he plans to even the odds. They agree and the trio combine into Magnaboss who easily defeats Thrustor and Dirgegun but not before the former delivers a fatal blow to his chest and with his last ounce of strength, Magnaboss uses his own spark energy to activate the teleport gate and summon someone else to assist them.
In a canyon Lio Convoy leads the other Maximals against the Predacons, using Majin Zarak as their new base. The Maximals are able to force Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers into retreating but Galvatron and Gigastorm continue to have Zarak attack them and though Lio Convoy is able to defeat Gigastorm, Galvatron eventually unveils Zarak's robot mode to deliver a massive energy burst to vaporise the area and believing all the present Maximals to be destroyed but receives a call from a “Convoy” challenging him to another fight in “Point B-2”. Believing Lio Convoy to have sent the message Galvatron accepts and takes Majin Zarak to the point. Underground however a barely conscious Lio Convoy is contacted by a familiar voice who informs him that his son nearly killed himself to summon him to the present time and praises Lio Convoy's abilities as a commander and asks to team up, one commander to another.
When Lio Convoy wakes up he discovers every Maximals has survived the blast, including a fully recovered Tasmania Kid, and Lio Convoy apologises to Magnaboss for mistreating him and is praised for his selfless act and is introduced to the legendary former Maximal commander from the past: Optimus Primal who agrees to follow Lio Convoy's lead into battle against Galvatron and Majin Zarak. Magnaboss begs to participate also but Lio Convoy forbids it with his injuries but Kid persuades to him to change his mind when he merges with Magnaboss to give him his needed strength back. Galvatron and Majin Zarak arrive at Point B-2 but Galvatron is enraged to learn that it wasn't Lio Convoy who sent the call but Optimus and attempts to kill both of them, but is stopped by Magnaboss who tosses Zarak and throws Galvatron out of his ship-mode and is saved by Gigastorm but vows revenge.
With Majin Zarak inoperable the battle appears won but Zarak transforms on his own will revealing he has a sentience of his own and was never under Galvatron's control to begin with and attacks the Maximals using numerous attack methods and severely injuring Bighorn and Apache, Kid and Magnaboss leaving only Lio Convoy and Optimus to fight Majin Zarak. However, Scuba and Diver learn that Zarak's weakness is his third eye as his nerve clusters are gathered there and as Zarak moves in to kill both commanders they combine their Energon Matrix powers and immensely power each other up as they launch a combined attack against Zarak and kill him. After the battle Optimus prepares to return to his own time in the Beast Wars on prehistoric Earth, Gaia's pastime counterpart, and though the other Maximals beg him to stay Optimus knows his presence will endanger existence itself, supported by Apache's theory that the civilization who created the teleport gate sent it to Gaia preciously to be destroyed. Before leaving Optimus commends Lio Convoy and the other Maximals for their unity and accomplishment and is honoured to have battled alongside them and departs back to his own time as Lio Convoy orders the teleport gate destroyed behind him to prevent its power from being abused again.
","A review for the short anime movie called Beast Wars Second Chou Seimeitai Transformers: Lio Convoy Kiki Ippatsu! It has been fansubbed by Karyuudo Fansub in 2016 for English speaking fans around the globe. 
 
It's basicly a spin-off based somewhere at the ending of  the anime 'Beast Wars Second Chou Seimeitai Transformers ' or Beast Wars II in short, but is not really connected towards the anime series. Incase you haven't seen Beast Wars II, watch that first so you're familair with the (newer) characters that get introduced during the series and read the review about Beast Wars II what kind of minor flaws this anime movie also has. 
 
The animation is compaired with the anime much smoother and much better, but it also contains minor errors during the transformation parts. It feels this small movie was done by a different studio, but I'm not sure about that. 
 
The story is OK'ish for a kids show and for the real die-hard Beast Wars fans you get a mere 5(!) minutes fanservice, because Optimus Primal (you know, the character where picky Transformer fans use the prase ""Trukk not munky"") is also in the story somehow, where it really does suggest you can also pinpoint this movie before the events of Beast Wars: Transmetals. 
 
Overall, a great watch for Beast Wars fans. It felt much more enjoyable than the Beast Wars II anime in my opinion. But I really advice you should watch Beast Wars II first.

There are those who try to continue on the race with the help of science... 
It is a society of constant conflict over their differences of principles and policies.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shoujo Ai', 'Yuri']",none,"When I watched this back in 2007 I didn't like it.  But somehow it has always stuck in the back of my mind.  Now 12 years later I've watched for a third time.  For me this is one of those experiences with self-contained OVA productions.  Stuff like Armitage III, Gunbuster, Orgus 02, Yukikaze, Blue Submarine No. 6, Project A-ko, Gunnm.  These utterly unique productions that I randomly come across that, for some reason, stick with me.  They'll have really out-there premises and the production quality can be a mixed bag, but they are so different from everything else I feel they are worth watching. 
 
I'm really into the visual and character design in ICE.  Even if the animation is stiff in some parts, visually it is fascinating.  The sound is pretty average.  I quite like the theme song, incidentally by AKB48, whose members did some of the voice acting.  While the acting is amateurish in some places it really doesn't bother me.  Plus I'm one of the few who like unique/odd voices like Sakura from Hyper Police, or Nonon in Kill la Kill. 
 
When I first saw it my mind was reeling from the over-the-top premise and setting.  Upon later viewings I was able to appreciate it more.  Personally I set any gender politics aside, because that's not what the story is really about, it's just one aspect of the setting.  And honestly looking back over the past few years this is better science fiction than I've seen in a while. 
 
What if males ceased being born?  What if the native life on earth artificially evolved is a way that made its biology incompatible with humanity?  While the way this series answers those questions may be more about entertainment than logic, it is still thought provoking in its own way. 
 
No doubt this OVA is flawed, but it is not bad.  And some days I have a real taste for the flawed and odd stuff. 


          
 
       Helpful I'd love nothing more than to sit here and give a long-winded, informative, and detailed review of this anime, but sadly I can't. It's not that I can't it's that there's just so little to go off of to really say anything of value. The best that I can tell you is that is the worst thing I have ever viewed in my entire life...Even more heartbreakingly terrible than The Last Air Bender(Movie) by M. Night Shamalamadingdong( I honestly cant spell his name but he makes terrible movies).  
 
I guess I can give a brief breakdown.  
Art: 
Was horrid. It was like watching something from 1995 or watching Dragon Ball Z before they hired more artists. So at the time of release it was already dated. 
 
Music: 
Music did a horrible job of moving the story in any direction; as if the story was going anywhere(?) Sound effects were mediocre at best and really didn't fit the environment or even into the context that was being shown in some cases. 
 
characters: 
Characters? What characters? Oh you mean the collection of people that were on screen for a few minutes at a time and had no real importance other than the fact that they were in the movie? Honestly half of them were just perverted. There was no nudity per se, but there were things hinted at ""Manly woman sitting in a room covered in women smiles as the doors close and random sounds are made""...type of thing. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Nein!  
 
Story: 
There was no story, only a very good premise that failed to deliver. 
 
Overall... 
well i think the review kind of speaks for itself.

          
 
       Helpful serously I'm going to waste my time writing a review of this? lol... after seeing all the other reviews with scores of 2 and 3 this show deserves a little more justice... 
 
the first time i saw this was a dvd i happen to see at the store at first glance my thought was hey that looks pretty cool a quick read of the synopsis won the series a ""what the frick?"" and it was returned to the shelf, about a year later Hulu added it, I figured I had some time before work why not? the art style looks nice enough anyway... 
 
so lets see the show opens up with some chick sleeping in her underwear... not a great start to say the least... but hey they move on and SPOILERS AHOY MATEY  she gets hit by a car, and we jump ahead to the end of the world :/ 
 
while the synopsis's for this show arent wrong, i feel they portray the show like its some kind of cheap porno, perhaps thats why all the veiwers of it are so butthurt, ther is very little fanservice in the entire show, the plot is about the fight between the 2 factions, the remenants of the government that are attempting to save the world, and the Kisaragi family who are ready to die and have a good time while wating 
 
the show isnt bad, no it isnt groundbreaking, but its also not the just some generic fanservice drivvle like the synopsis makes it seem, its just kind of a short scifi love story, not anything deep or big just kinda ther, no not all the parts make sense but theres nothing so wrong about this show, its just kinda okay, and since its only 3 episodes, hey why not watch it if you have some time to kill 
 
Final note: shows not bad, just alright

Each of these was infinitely less exciting than the current Animation Age! In this RPG-esque existence, becoming stronger is paramount to one's survival and leveling up is a must. From pacifists to news casting, from fishing woes to love advice, there's nothing the Animation Age can't show or teach us about life in a game world! Armed with healing spells, changes of clothes and plenty of summoned familiars, the characters of Master of Epic will do what it takes to level up and live to fight another day! 
 
(Source: Anime-Planet)","['Fantasy', 'Game', 'Comedy']","The game is set in Diaros, a mysterious land of legends. One of the legends is of the Noah Stone, which is said to bring prosperity to any nation which possesses it, and has therefore been the source of much conflict. A vision calling herself Irmina appears to all inhabitants of the world, warning them that they will soon enter an age of darkness. A group of adventurers are led by Irmina to Diaros, where they become acquainted with its past and future.
13 Million Years Ago, on Diaros, the High Civilization of the Mora Clan flourished thanks to the Noah Stone. However, other groups seeking the stone began persecuting the Mora Clan, and they were forced to relinquish control of the Noah Stone. 
In the Present Age, there are three powers present in Diaros: Elgadin, country of the Dragon Knights who value law and order; Bisque, a country where according to the Lal Fac Faith, various clans are given the autonomy to regulate themselves; and Sasool, a country where therianthropy plays a leading role. These countries vie for control of the Noah Stone.
Ten years into the future, due to the ensuing events, war has erupted, the Age of Darkness predicted by Irmina. The war is the result of secret manoeuvers by the Mora Clan's Igo, who has put various strategies in action to take possession of the Noah Stone.
The game also takes place in the Future Age, 3,000 years after the rule of Igo, and the Chaos Age, at the beginning of everything, 45 Million Years Ago. Players pass from one age to another, addressing a variety of obstacles, attempting to prevent the coming Age of Darkness.
","Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best: 
 
Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll... 
 
Master of Epic does quite well in the humor department. Although it is based on one particular MMORPG, it does a very good job of satirizing many of the small idiosyncrasies common to most RPG's. Some examples include going AFK, being resurrected from death, random monster spawn, combat and non-combat skills etc etc. It has some other jokes too, but really you will probably want to be somewhat of an RPG fan... or at least understand RPGs to find a lot of this funny. Still, as a fan myself, I found the humor to be quite simple but effective. 
 
Ummmm and that's it really. The music isn't that great, but the art is pretty good for a little known show like this.  Its sad to see that so few people have managed to find this little gem, because its really quite good. As a sketch comedy, I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. Characters are simple but memorable enough, the comedy is funny, there are 7 or 8 repeating sketches that you can enjoy every time they come back. All in all, if you like RPGs, and like this kind of un-connected random comedy, then you'll definitely like Master of Epic. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I personally watched the hell out of it a few times already, but this show is utter garbage. The characters are flat one dimensional, even when they are portraying different archetypes of people you encounter in  games. 
 
The show is set as skits, and they are very nonsensical, and they draw on the nonsense to go about getting you to laugh, I didn't laugh much at the skits and their premises much, however, they did have one segment i enjoyed a lot and those where wenever the Waragetcha 5 showed up. 
 
The art... honestly is pretty bland, definitely felt like a low budget anime, but then again when i did check out the game the anime was promoting... the art style matched the game well. 
 
Music was not really worth mentioning as it wasn't really memorable... maybe except the intro to the waragetcha 5 only because it is such a self poking song. 
 
All in all, the humor and the premise of this show caters a really narrow number of people, and i can't say i know people who could enjoy this show... unless they are into bad gags and some weird slapstick comedy. The show doesn't take itself seriously, almost as if it knows it's bad, which is probably what drew me into watching the show...  having a feeling that the staff did the show just for the giggles. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best: 
 
Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll...

12,1991,141,5.326199088,Story between god and human,Juusou Kikou Dancougar Nova,"In the 22nd century, there are no longer any world wide wars. Instead, small scale wars break out all over the Earth. Meanwhile, a large robot appears who protects the weak. It is called ""Dancougar Nova"". Some even call it God.  
 
However, no one knows the reason for its existence - not even its pilots.  
Then, another robot, beyond anyone's expectations, reveals itself as the true enemy and begins its attack on the Earth.  
 
Dancougar Nova retaliates against this enemy with a power that was kept secret until now. Will Dancougar Nova be able to save the Earth? The prelude to this explosive confrontation rings out.  
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)",['Mecha'],"The series takes place in 2107, where small wars take place all over the globe.  A team of four people; Aoi Hidaka, Kurara Tachibana, Sakuya Kamon, Johnny Bernet, are chosen to be the pilots of the mysterious large robot that ""protects the weak"" and stops these small-scale wars, the Dancouga Nova. Like its predecessor, Dancouga Nova is a combining robot type of Super Robot, which have four separate units with each unit having its own pilot; the Nova Eagle, Nova Rhino, Nova Liger, and Nova Elephant, that form the Super Robot Dancouga Nova. The pilots are gathered by a secret organization that maintains the Dancouga Nova and dispatches its pilots on assigned missions from the organization's base of operations, the Dragon's Hive.
","This was actually pretty all right. I'm a big fan of the original Dancouga series and at some point swore to never watch Dancouga Nova out of principle. I made a snap judgment assuming it'd be some moe fanservice sell-out, but the reality is that it's a standard mecha series that doesn't go so far as to insult the original series. That being said, it IS still very standard, and while not an embarrassment it struggles to find a reason to be watched by both mecha and Dancouga fans. I decided to shovel down this one cour series since Dancouga Nova seems to have replaced the original in the Super Robot Wars games, and how many mecha series are there that aren't a billion episodes long? 
 
Given its episode count, Dancouga Nova is able to pace itself at a decent clip without dragging scenes or rushing the storyline too much. It's a simple series that isn't difficult to watch but isn't inspiringly creative or well-executed either. The team can't compare to the original but are all likable enough. Much of the dynamic that made the original cast so endearing was their abrasive qualities and inter-conflicts. They were a team with little to no connections culled and forced to work together and they naturally clashed and bonded over time. The increasing friendship of the Dancouga Nova pilots is still an observable thing, but it happens quicker and understandably so considering how soft the pilots are in comparison. It was hard for me not to be disappointed in lead character Aoi Hidaka's comparison to Shinobu Fujiwara. Fujiwara is a vainglorious asshole in some ways that would normally be associated with a generic shonen protagonist, but the writers were aware of his personality flaws and wrote them into his character development and interaction with others. Fujiwara is routinely criticized and denied his superiority complex by his teammates, and watching both his successes and failures at proving himself is a huge draw of the show and the biggest example of how the characters drove the original series. By comparison, Aoi is introduced as a tough daredevil similar to Shinobu, but entirely lacks his extremes and the flaws that come with them, meaning she loses both of those appeals mentioned earlier. It's actually her that comes across as generic, which is a shame considering the rarity of female mecha leads. She's universally soft and reasonably aggressive at any time, and she becomes bland, indistinct, and predictable in her reactions and her team's reactions to her. 
 
The other team members fare better and worse. Kurara makes a positive impression in the beginning of the series as she's more of an extreme of Aoi's archetype, being a serious and highly professional policewoman. But the flaws of her personality, mainly her suspicious nature and coldness, aren't woven into her to make her more interesting past the beginning. She quickly becomes an Aoi clone rather than standing out, hotblooded in battle and neutral in demeanor. Johnny is the worst teammate of anyone, having absolutely zero conflicts with his character at any time and being the constant deliverer of a run-on gag where he mentions reading the latest men's magazines. His milquetoast personality is the least forgivable because it's never paired with anything endearing at any point in the show. He feels like team filler, and the run-on gags are a cheap way to force lines by him when his personality itself wouldn't make anything he delivers worth hearing. He also has an interest in a minor idol character, which I only mention because it's possibly a reference to the voice actress/pop star Rie Fujiwara from the original series. Last on the team is Sakuya, a deliberately homeless teenager who's chosen (for a reason we never learn) to be another of Dancouga's pilots. Despite his flimsy motivations, the overly zealous jokester of the group remains the most consistently entertaining since he never loses his distinguishable personality traits. Still, he lacks his own conflict. 
 
Together the Dancouga pilots have little difficulty agreeing to a secret organization's plan. Their job is to travel the globe, interfering with conflicts to assist whatever the losing side is at the time regardless of motives or morals. I like this premise. It bears a similarity to Mobile Suit Gundam 00's premise, which Dancouga Nova actually predates by a few months. While I don't think the Dancouga Nova team's mission of leveling conflicts to draw them out and prevent them from escalating is very justifiable, it at least raises a moral and philosophical question for the show and characters to work with. In the beginning, the team is meant with some resistance of this ideology and questions it themselves, but alas, in the most disappointing part of the show this concept is nothing short of abandoned in the face of a more generic ""fight against evil"" plot that drives the remainder of the series. The questions this premise raises never amount to any substantial debate, let alone resolution. It ends up being intriguing and a proof of concept that doesn't deliver on any potential. 
 
In a rare twist, my biggest problem with a show ends up being its animation quality. Dancouga Nova makes the original 80s series look like Studio Ghibli. I've seen people theorize that this was intentional to nod to the original series's animation problems, but that's a nonsense theory because the two's issues often manifest in different ways and it's evident Dancouga Nova's struggling with a budget as its animation gets consistently worse every single episode. Even still, a hand-painted Blu-ray release will almost always look better than a sloppy, low resolution, digitally-colored DVD release. Even putting aside the release format bias the original series would look better just from the techniques used, while Nova struggles with similar framerate issues that its averagely directed action scenes wouldn't make much use of anyway. The final three episodes introduce this absolutely obnoxious technique where, instead of ""camera"" angles shifting to show new characters talking or a different focus, a section of the frame (such as a standing character) will have their outline filled in with another character's talking face or some other scene. It makes the frame composition look like fragmented chaos, and if it's a ""style"" then it's definitely not one that benefits the series. Also introduced at this point are tacky screen wipes used with character faces like it's straight out of some 70s superhero cartoon. It's so cheap. As for the new Dancouga design, it doesn't beat the original, but I like it overall. The biggest issue are the weird vertical stereo-looking boxes on the side of its head. In conclusion, both series' visuals are littered with warts, but at least the original series had the decency to wear makeup. 
 
As for the music, there's no comparison. I struggle to remember any song from the soundtrack other than the repeatedly used battle theme, which sounds like pop rap recorded on a cassette tape. It's barely audible and the same verse from the song is used constantly until the final battle. The original series could've used music variety as well, but tracks like Burning Rage are lovably distinct both in their archaic 80s synth composition and stronger melody. 
 
Much of the series revolves around those two earlier mentioned halves of the political conflicts and fight against evil, with the Dancouga pilots learning to work together while facing military resistance and investigating the secrets behind the organization that's picked them up. The series maintains enough intrigue and momentum from these basic ingredients to be an entertaining enough watch that isn't boring but lacks any impressive moments. It all ends up being lightly likable in all aspects, but in the saturation of anime that just isn't enough of an endorsement - even for mecha fans. And if mecha fans are so desperate as to be looking for niche series like Dancouga Nova, then any recommendations probably don't matter. They'll take whatever has the genre attached. Still, if Dancouga Nova is a sequel that needed to be made, then at least it didn't do the original team any shame. According to MyAnimeList, over twice the amount of people have watched Dancouga Nova over the original series. Those who enjoyed this show enough or are considering watching it, do yourself a favor, buckle down, and watch something ""old"" - and better.

          
 
       Helpful As a fan of the original Choujuu Kishin Dancougar series, Nova is a complete dumpster fire. It pretty much ignores the original story of Dancouga. They just used the premise of the Dancouga mecha and some of its abilities. For some of the mecha, they chose to use Mazinger and its brethren as a basis for ability ideas. as in a flying fist attack or a tornado type attack. The final episode was the worst, defiling the original show by claiming they were fighting the original Dancouga which looked nothing like the original, nor had the same abilities. It was just bad. 
If they were to remove the Dancouga name from this series and sever ties to the original so that it was a stand-alone show it would be mediocre at best and maybe warrant a five overall rating. As part of the Dancouga line of series, I would give it a two or three at best.

          
 
       Helpful This show sort of reminds me of the Power Rangers. Only the Power Rangers were lame, didn't really do anything at all and worst of all: it was live action. 
The robots in Dancouga Nova are animated in a typical 80's style (like Macron One), but don't look old due to the wonders of CGI. Furthermore, this series looks fresh and has a lot of potential for the main characters to develop. 
If you like mecha series and loved the 80's, this is definitely a show to pick up!

12,30806,142,5.317736676,Story between god and human,Schwarzesmarken,"The year is 1983. The Cold War is in full effect, and humanity is under attack. Strange aliens, given the name ""BETA,"" have descended to Earth with the goal of destroying all life. Soldiers have been tasked with piloting large combat suits called Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) to repel the alien invaders, but the front line is slowly being pushed back towards the surviving cities. 
 
 Schwarzesmarken  follows the story of Second Lieutenant Theodor Eberbach and the other members of the 666th TSF squadron, a ruthless unit that values a mission's completion over human life. Stationed in East Germany and led by war hero Captain Irisdina Bernhard, the unit specializes in counterassault attacks on laser-class BETA. But the 666th squadron finds itself with more enemies than just the alien forces when optimistic rookie Katia Waldheim joins the squadron, drawing the attention of East Germany's secret police, the Stasi. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Mecha']","The visual novel Muv-Luv is divided into two parts. The first part, titled Muv-Luv Extra, features playable character Takeru Shirogane (voiced by Takeshi Aiba in the Windows version and Soichiro Hoshi in ports) who wakes up one morning to find a beautiful young woman sleeping in his bed, just as an infuriated Sumika Kagami (voiced by Hiroko Taguchi, credited as Rika Fujiwara in the Windows version), Takeru's neighbor and childhood friend, comes to wake him up that morning. The young woman, Meiya Mitsurugi (voiced by Aki Okuda in the Windows version and Kazumi Okushima in ports), is the heiress to a financially powerful family and is determined to be Takeru's bride. As the story progresses, both girls compete for Takeru's affections while Takeru has recurring dreams about a marriage promise he made to a girl long ago. At first, he believes the girl was Sumika, but eventually realizes that it was actually Meiya. At the conclusion, Takeru must choose between which of the girls he truly loves. In addition, the player may also make decisions to choose between one of the three girls in the main supporting cast: Chizuru Sakaki (voiced by Masayo Kurata), Miki Tamase (voiced by Hitomi), and Kei Ayamine (voiced by Nagashima Yuuko).
The second part, Muv-Luv Unlimited, starts with Takeru Shirogane waking up in his bed, reminiscent of the start of Muv-Luv Extra; however, Takeru quickly realizes that neither Meiya nor Sumika come to wake him that morning. Upon leaving his house, he finds his neighborhood destroyed and Sumika's house crushed under the wreckage of a large mecha. Takeru later learns that he is in an alternate world to Extra, where aliens called BETA (an acronym for ""Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which are Adversary of the human race"") have invaded and mankind fights back against the alien aggressors with mecha called Tactical Surface Fighters, (戦術歩行戦闘機, Senjutsuhokōsentōki) usually referred to in Japanese as simply Senjutsuki (戦術機).
Muv-Luv Unlimited explains that the BETA first arrived on Earth in 1973 (in China and Canada) after arriving on the Moon in 1967 and being spotted on Mars in 1958. Subsequent battles with BETA resulted in the global population dropping to 2.4 billion with most of mainland Eurasia having been lost by the time the game starts in 2001. Most of the major characters from the Extra timeline are present in Unlimited, notably excluding the Unlimited world's Takeru, who is said to be dead, and Sumika, who does not seem to exist in the Unlimited timeline. The characters are mostly identical to their Extra counterparts, with the notable exception of Yoroi, Takeru's best friend in Extra who, for reasons unclear, is a girl in this reality.
In the sequel Muv-Luv Alternative, Takeru wakes up three years after the beginning of Unlimited to find himself back in his room. Although he first thinks that the events of Muv-Luv Unlimited were a dream, he soon feels that something is wrong, and leaves the house to find that he has been sent back in time to the beginning of the events in Unlimited. Unwilling to accept the events at the end of Unlimited, he decides to help professor Kouzuki save the Earth and mankind by bringing the mysterious Alternative IV plan — cancelled at the end of Unlimited — to fruition.
","The world is under attack by an alien life form known as Beta and East Germany appears to be next on the aliens' munch list. Schwarzesmarken is supposedly the best mech platoon in Eastern Germany, and charged with performing surgical strikes to give the country a chance. Our protagonist, a young, disagreeable pilot, serves on this mech squad where he must survive countless waves of ugly CGI aliens and the generous breast sizes of his fellow pilots. However, his country is also under dire straits internally as various government factions vie for control, leading to Stalin-style purges and wasted resources. Will his unit survive the dual threat of alien invasion and internal civil war? 
 
Let me preface the rest of the review by noting that this is the first work I've seen in the Muv-Luv universe. Schwarzesmarken is an action-based mech show with a very pessimistic overall mood- full of random killings, deaths, betrayals, and really just anything to compare the worst of humanity with the worst the aliens can bring. I've read of some people having PTSD after watching Total Eclipse- while I didn't experience anything to that level here I would say that it's probably comparable to Aldnoah Zero. While it is a pretty engaging watch from a thriller perspective, it isn't full of particularly smart people; bad choices are made pretty much throughout the entire plot. Furthermore, the story is rife with inconsistencies and gotchas that are jarring and off-putting. If you're just looking for some action and don't mind the plot, it's a pretty fun watch. Otherwise, I'd say this is only average at best. 
 
Animation: 
I came across mixed overall for the animation in the show. I liked how they set the dark atmosphere with moody clouds and many grays in the palette but more often than not, this was overshadowed by ugly CGI and rather repulsive and anatomically illogical aliens- though I have to say the laser-class aliens add a humorously cute flair to the otherwise dreadful alien mobs. The mechs are also drawn via CGI and though they're better than those a decade ago, movements still feel off occasionally. The characters themselves are fairly diverse in appearance though most of the girls are overly proportioned in the chest region. The show also uses overly-heavy eye shadows on the girls, which just makes the antagonists' instant-giveaway look all the more apparent. I also found the mech outfits rather outlandish; seems to be specifically tailored to highlight bouncy parts. Expressions are pretty generic and other than a few sequences with Katia, rather bland overall. 
 
The show has a lot of action, be it mech battles against mechs or aliens or ground warfare with conventional arms. Though a majority of the show is just bullet spamming, some of the sequences aren't bad (even a few moments of tactical brilliance) - I'd still put it a few levels beneath a Gundam show, however. There is a lot of death and a bit of gore, though the camera angle tends to shy away from the bloodiest scenes. Given the rather serious tonality of the show, there isn't much accidental ecchi here. Other than the obvious harem-friendly figures of the female cast, there are just a few suggestive scenes. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a fast-paced OP with a nice melody and the typical electronic instrumentation of FripSide (think Railgun). The ED is a cool down piece by two of the VAs- the first few measures would probably fit just as well in a breakup scene in a drama. The BGM is pretty well utilized with a wide range of instrumentation. Peaceful moments are full of light orchestral and piano pieces with wide reverb. Battles are much more intense with vocal choirs and brass/electronic instrumentation joining the string-leads, some pieces here are particularly good both melodically and in giving a sense of tension. 
 
The VA cast, like the character cast, is quite huge; there are some notable surprises though. I think Nozomi Yamamoto gives by far the strongest performance here. She gives her character a commanding yet reassuring feel, which is just perfect for her role. It is also impressively different from her previous role as Julie in Absolute Duo. I think this is also one of the first roles in which I've seen Yukari Tamura play an antagonist; though in this case her character doesn't have much depth. 
 
Story: 
Schwarzesmarken tells a fast-paced yet vile story about our inability to work with each other. It is a fine plot for those who don't try to poke holes at it, but unfortunately for me poking around is what I like doing. If you really dig into it, this story is chuck full of inconsistencies, miracles, and improbable circumstances; unfortunately, many of these surface too late in the show to divulge in this review. 
 
The story follows one central plotline that pivots wildly between various events; you really are just along for the ride. Many of the show's twists are predictable, some are along the lines of things you don't want to be true but know will be true... The show builds to a final, mech battle climax that is a bit of a letdown given the falling action. This is followed by a fair conclusion that ties up loose ends fairly well. I still can't get over the fact that, despite having advanced mech technology, they don't try at all to save their injured. 
 
If you're looking for a thriller with lots of last second saves and plenty of action, this is your kind of story. If you're looking for thought-provoking political dialogue or any real depth to the almost universal mech question of ""why are we fighting"", you won't find it here. The disposability of the famous ""Schwarzesmarken"" team members really leaves a sour aftertaste for me. 
 
Character: 
This is kind of a mess. If you check the character ratings for the show on anidb, you'll see that most of them are horridly rated. There are many issues in this section that would negatively affect the characters. First, the huge breadth of primary and supporting characters makes it difficult for the viewer to relate to everyone. Second, the show attempts to make as many characters dynamic as possible; this only backfires as it makes a lot of characters (such as Kirce) feel very simple-minded. Third, the show can't choose whom to pair up with the protagonist, I counted five potential visual novel potential routes in this animation. Fourth, despite the incredibly important nature of Katia to the story's plot, she gets relatively little development- often just shoved aside by Lise. Which brings up number five, Lise is just an unnecessary distraction that ends in exactly how one would predict. Finally, sixth, the antagonists are abhorrent cookie-cutter villains with no depth. 
 
I usually like dynamism in characters, but the usage in this show just feels cheesy. This combined with unstable character relationships (especially those involving the protagonist) really bring down this section. 
 
Value: 
Schwarzesmarken is a relatively dark show. Perhaps there is some parallels with the real world situation of today; but philosophizing aside, the show's fairly good production and entertainment values are overshadowed by an inconsistent storyline and weak characters- and no I'm not just ranting about the various pointless deaths in the show. I'm going to go on a limb and say this is a good watch for those who liked Valvrave- lots of interesting mech battles but little if any real core substance and heart.

          
 
       Helpful Yo Minna! 
Why not recall what happened to Germany after WWII? Germany was split into the ""Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" (west) and the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik-East Germany) and they kinda hated each other but it was more a reaction due to the Cold War. So you probably ask why is this related to an anime review? Well, the setting of this anime is an alternative version of East Germany in the 1980s. I was wondering if there was an anime that has that ""after WWII"" setting and this anime was close to it. The title was supposed to be in German with the meaning ""Black Marks"", but it ended up being a grammar flop in my opinion. What should be ""Schwarze Marken"" became ""Schwarzesmarken"" in the end and here is the review to it. 
 
Plot and Story Line 
As said in the intro, the plot of Schwarzesmarken tkes place in an alternative version of East Germany in the 1980s. West Germany is also there and as our history books, the anime too, shows the hatred between the two sides. Of course history alone would be too boring in an anime, so the makers of Schwarzesmrken added up a little drama, a little bit of Sci-Fi and some Mecha-military action. Out came an anime that has a solid and interesting plot with a couple of good background stories and full of action, drama and intrigue. But what is this anime actually about? 
Well, in such a divided Germany, a new species of extraterrestrial origin called BETA are doing everything just to destroy the world. They are really ugly and creepy monsters that come in all forms and sizes. The story of Schwarzesmarken follows the East Germany Army's  666th TSF Squadron, also known as the ""Black Marks"". With Mecha suits that we've unfortunately seen so many times and the most advanced technology, they fight the BETA in order to free the planet of those extremely dangerous creatures.  
The all BETA story is actually just the foundation of the anime. The highlight of the story is actually a set of circumstances that involve our main characters Theodor Eberbach, Irisdina Bernhard, Katia Waldheim and Lise Hohenstein into the political tensions between the two Germanies.  
When I firstly started watching Schwarzesmarken I thought that this is gonna end up as one more ""kill the ugly creatures that want to destroy human kind"" anime, but it did not. Because in all that awesome action fights with the BETA comes that intriguing political tension drama between the the East and the West. Not being enough to all that politics comes up another mystery side story about Katia, who she really is and where she actually comes from.  And after some episodes Theodor's past catches up and just adds up with all the drama from before. Trust me guys, the show becomes something like an anime soap opera, but a very good one to be honest. That's exactly what makes the anime so good. You have all that military action and in the middle of it some drama between our main protagonist. Of course, romance too. In that way, Schwarzesmarken has something for everyone's soul.  
The thing that I liked the most about Schwarzesmarken is definitely the link to the past and the situation in the Cold War. I always wanted to watch an anime based on the happenings after WWII and that's why I decided to watch this one. True the BETA stuff wasn't a thing I was expecting, but it ended up being a good anime. You really get the feeling of all the hatred and the tensions between the East and West.  
The story of Schwarzesmarken is a little bit complex, but so intriguing and amazing that you won't regret watching it. Of course, action overload and amazing mecha fights. And all that fits perfectly into 12 episodes which is also the reason this anime got an ""Honorable mention"" in ""My Top 5 Anime You Can Watch in Less Than 6h"".  
 
Characters 
This is another good part of Schwarzesmarken-the characters. They are all realistic personalities and very interesting too. 
 
My personal favorite was the leader of the 666th Squadron, Irisdina Bernhard. She is a tough leader and a very independent young woman. She has to bear much pressure on her shoulders being the hero of the nation. Also there is no doubt that her exemplary leadership and tactical skill are the key for the survival and ongoing success of her team. 
 
Also very important in the Schwarzesmarken story is our little Katia Waldheim. She is extremely idealistic, hardworking and adored by the maintenance crew. She has a natural talent and good instinct when it comes to piloting the TSF. She does seem like that overly perfect character that annoys you from time to time, but she is not. Besides, her background story becomes the most intriguing part of the anime so... 
 
Animation and Style 
 
The Animation of Schwarzesmarken is okay. It is definitely not bad, but not a masterpiece either. I think the colors could have been a little bit brighter, they are too dull in my opinion. And since everything is most of the time covered in snow, you don't get to enjoy beautiful backgrounds and stuff. The style is aso not special but again, also not bad. It is an ordinary anime style with no special extras. The one thing that the makers could have changed is the style of the robots, the TSF. Giving them a different name doesn't make the more special than the ones in Code Geass, Giulty Crown etc. I was disappointed, considering the fact that Germany is the leader in the mechanic industry. They could have come up with something new.  
 
 
Conclusion 
On the whole, Schwarzesmarken is a very good anime with a lot of action first of all. The fights and the battle tactics are amazing and very interesting. Linking to the past events in German history, Schwarzesmarken chooses the perfect setting for a political drama like the one we have here. Still there are so many more amazing things that are coming which I can't tell because they would be huge spoilers. I recommend, watch Schwarzesmarken and enjoy!  


          
 
       Helpful This review is going to make a lot of comparisons to the original visual novel series of Muv Luv, expect a very bias review. If you are a visual novel/mecha fan I suggest you avoid this series and read the games first so you don't get spoiled. Chomp! ect. 
 
As a big fan of the Muv Luv visual novel trilogy I was pretty unenthused to hear that a spinoff called ""Schwarzesmarken"" was being made into anime based on the light novel series of said name. 
 
While I am a fan of the original vn I cant say I appreciate Age trying to make a universe out of the series, the whole point of the original series was that it was a parody of mecha tropes in mainly 90's mecha anime and took a bunch of walking trope characters and set them in a misery filled war against campy/horrifying looking alien creatures. 
 
The source story spent alot of time making you like these generic characters and actually care about them when they were placed in the worst situation ever but Schwarzesmarken takes itself a little too seriously without making you care for its own new cast beforehand. 
 
The main character, Theodore, does a pretty funny personality flip between the first two episodes from, uncaring edgemaster to a patriot fighting for freedom. It comes off as really rushed, like the director had no clue how to make the reveal that Theodore was a broken person since he lost his sister and just made it more matter of fact like. 
I think Theodore would have been a little more interestering if they let his stay an asshole for a little longer so that when he actually starts caring about the things happening around him the impact for the viewer would be more satisfying. 
 
While Takeru, from the original vn, was a very basic character also he was more like a self insert for you to experience the other characters and learn more about the rest of the cast and then share his pain when his way of life was destroyed and replaced by never ending fighting. Theodore kinda is just there since you need to have at a male character in this almost fully female cast. 
  
Every character in this show is boring, I can't even remember the names of most of them and I have no clue why I should care about anyone aside from the fact that the evil Germans are really, really evil. They show this by having the bad guys torture people and have really sick smiles of enjoyment while doing this, like really? These are the bad guys? Shits as subtle as having them kill a cat and pushing an old women down stairs. 
 
Katia has very few scenes with Theodore so you don't really feel a connection between them, they just seem to work together. Theodore cares way more about banging his sister then any other character in the show and it makes it really awkward when people start dropping like flies towards the end and they play it off like Theodore lost a precious person that could never be replaced. Like when the hell did he even talk to them? I'm going to just assume that a lot of content was cut from the light novels to fit into the 12 episodes. 
 
I did like the CG animation in this show, I normally hate CG but the snow filter then ran on every single mecha scene really disguised the other wise ugly cg movement. Still am dreading the new CG dystopian anime future that is coming though. 
 
This show is pretty much just a commercial for the light novel series that has ended and the new visual novel adaption that has part 1 released and part 2 coming out later. Expect rushed scenes of exposition and plot points that solve themselves a little to fast. I would suggest you check out the Steam green light page for the Schwarzesmarken visual novel in English in hope that we can get a more complete well written version of the story because it does have some nice mecha designs and Katia is pretty cute if annoyingly idealistic.

12,37623,143,5.2911575,Story between god and human,Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen,"Modest Heroes will consist of three shorts by three different directors: ""Kanini & Kanino"" (""Kanini to Kanino"") by Hiromasa Yonebayashi will be a 15-minute fantasy adventure story of two crab siblings, and will be long. ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" (""Samurai Egg"") by Yoshiyuki Momose will be a 15-minute ""human drama"" showing the love between a mother and a boy. ""Invisible"" (""Tōmei Ningen"") by Akihiko Yamashita will be a 14-minute ""action spectacle"" that centers on the lonely struggle of one invisible man. Studio Ponoc describes the shorts as ""tales of modest heroes of our times."" 
 
(Source: ANN, edited)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","
","""Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen (Modest Heroes)"" is Studio Ponac's second movie project after their debut film, ""Mary to Majo no Hana (Mary and the Witch's Flower)"". The film is a collection of three non sequential shorts that each tell a unique story about a heroic character and his or her respective journey. ""Modest Heroes"" is obviously not going to beat ""Mary and the Witch's Flower"", but it's still an enjoyable watch and it did certainly kept me interested the whole way through. 
 
Short One: ""Kanini & Kanino"" 
""Kanini & Kanino"" surrounds the tale of two crab siblings whose life of living underwater becomes drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river. One night, one of the siblings attempts to travel to the surface, only for something dramatic to occur, ultimately leaving the two siblings to fend for themselves in the vast river environment. I can't really say much about the short. I enjoyed the visuals way more than the characters or the plot, with its fantastic blend of 2D animation with splashes of CGI for the river environment that is eye-catchingly beautiful to say the least (despite the CGI fish, but whatever). I'm not really invested in Kanini or Kanino, as forgettable as they are, and the fact that the short doesn't have any dialog hurts their dynamics as a whole. For the story and characters to be lacking in depth, the visual did make up for it to be considered for an enjoyable one-time watch. 
 
Short Two: ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" 
""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" is about the relationship between a mother and her son, Shun, who has a severe egg allergy that in-contact, could cause a life-threatening case in which Shun only has minutes to live. The short is based off a true story (claimed by the director) and it does a pretty good job keeping me interested in the characters and how they deal with Shun's condition. The mother is overly protected of Shun and tries her hardest to protect him from any harm, just to amend for all the times that she isn't there for him. Shun himself quickly learns to stay strong and formidable despite his unfortunate state and is eager to overcome any obstacles in his life to prove that he isn't frail and weak. The characters in this short are way more realistic and the hand-drawn artstyle complements it by having a sort of nostalgic feel, reminiscent of a children's storybook. The animation is fluid and the movements are more expressive that doesn't distract you from the overall atmosphere of the short. The intriguing aesthetic and the lovable character makes this short exceedingly enjoyable for anybody to enjoy, and this, along with the next short, produces a well crafted compilation if it weren't for the first short.  
 
Short Three: ""Invisible"" 
""Invisible"" contains an interesting and ingenious concept that is explored in a very creative way. The short follows an invisible man, whom others cannot see. The man is required to carry a heavy object since he could easily be carried by a gust of wind without it. The short basically surrounds a day of his life, in which he ponders about his identity in life and his struggle of loneliness. What makes the short especially unique is through several brilliant action-packed moments that is exemplified by the gripping animation and the spectacular choreographer of the whole segment. Aesthetically, the short is bleak and almost depressing with its dimmed colors and almost dreary tone that sets it apart from the bright and colorful visuals of the previous two shorts. The Invisible-Man himself carries a dispirited mood that I can't help but feel sympathetic for. These design choices overall make the conclusion of the short extremely satisfying and makes the whole experience well-worth the watch. 
 
So what can I say? Studio Ponac did a fine job producing these shorts and I highly recommend this to those who are fans of their previous film. Creatively impressive and tremendously entertaining, ""Modest Heroes"" is huge step for Studio Ponac to work with other directors and their consistency in quality has me anxiously waiting for their next project. 

          
 
       Helpful Modest Heroes consists of three shorts aimed at children. The first short is about two brothers braving the dangers of the river to save their father from a fish. It is a straightforward story that children will enjoy and adults will not be too interest by. The second short is about a boy that is allergic to eggs. This has more application to adult life because it shows how the mother must change her lifestyle for the safety of her son, and it shows how there could be any number of unknown threats with such a common food as egg. The best short is about an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible. It is my favourite anime short because of how it handles this premise. The art style is not smooth and fluffy nor sharp and edgy, and has a particular aesthetic, helped by the animation style, to visually explain what sort of a person this invisible man is. Although he is invisible, he still does the right thing and helps people even when they don't even acknowledge his existence. He is the most modest hero of all.  
Modest Heroes is primarily for children, and while not all the shorts may appeal to you, The Invisible Man is the best short ever made and deserves your attention. 

          
 
       Helpful Appearance and technicality is not everything in an anime : These 3 short movies produced by the Studio Ponoc seems more a beautiful technical demonstration of the studio pure animation capabilities than real narrative works, in-depth reflections or compelling/original stories.  
 
The first one is a mildly fantastic family friendly scenario with superficial events, classic stereotypes and extremely predictable outcomes.  
The second one is an ordinary slice of life story about allergy. 
The last one which seems at first the most original of the three was obviously inspired by John Carpenter's version of the Invisible Man and ends up in an ordinary fashion instead of bending to the mystical symbolism or spiritual side (which would have been more interesting to my opinion). 
 
Therefore, everything looks like very superficial and do not offer much aside from the beauty of the drawing, lighting and animation.  
When compared to other Japanese short movies such as ""Memories"" or simply recent anime series such as ""Mob Psycho 100"" or ""Mushishi"" which features unusual scenario, strange and disturbing symbolism, ambivalent emotion, and unpredictable events (and beautiful animation as well) you can realize the huge difference in terms of narrative and reflective qualities. 
 
  Therefore, unless you are interested solely in animation technical details, I do not recommend watching these very ordinary and somewhat trivial short movies.

","This is going to be a short review that highlights the best parts about this anime and the series as a whole. From a short time Jojo fan who got into the series in the summer of 2015. 
 
A LOT better from the previous season, this part has some of the most interesting and nail biting arcs so far from the previous 2 parts. It sometimes tends to have the same problems as the previous season, but it makes up for it at least for the viewers to see the conclusion to the part.  
 
If you've seen season one of SDC and do not wish to continue because you think it's going to stay the same - it's not, it's a lot better. 

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR: The second season to Stardust Crusaders fails to keep one interested as the creativity of the end of Part 3 plummets, and makes the viewer both lethargic and bored. I would physically only recommend this season to people who desire to finish up Stardust Crusaders, but one could skip to the last 6 episodes to save the trouble of wasting a great deal of time.  
 
I don't want to bash Araki's epic tale overall because I genuinely enjoyed the first two part of JJBA, but Part 3 has definitely been the weakest link so far in the JJBA anime series in my opinion. 
 
The characters are fun, cool, exciting, and hilarious to experience on screen, but this season's interaction with enemies seemed very artificial. I can only hear the phrase ""THIS enemy is the MOST powerful we have every seen!"" so many times. Its like playing a game of chess, but then the opponent makes you stand on one leg while playing, and then makes you speak in rhymes, and then makes you close your eyes, etc. The fights lose creativity, and the struggle of the characters ceases to feel real or necessary.  
 
The art of this show also gets pretty dull to look at in this season, as scenes of the desert and of Cairo all blend together to form one tan/golden blur, although perhaps that is unavoidable given the show's location. The character designs for the enemies also seem to be uninspired for the most part of this season save for Pet Shop. 
 
[SPOILER SECTION] 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
The introduction of Iggy was an interesting one at first, but in the end Iggy had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and the show pretends he did post mortem by saying ""he really loved his friends though! Even though he was an abrasive asshole who hated them and didn't want to attend this journey and didn't participate in the show save for his own personal fight!"" In the end as he saves the life of Polnareff it seemed not only out-of-character, but it felt like a plot device to spice up the show. 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
[END OF SPOILER SECTION] 
 
After taking a long pause from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, I returned to finish the second part of Stardust Crusaders, and I found myself both underwhelmed and bored. For almost 50 episodes of an anime, the lack of any substantial character growth was appalling. The only thing these characters have to show for 48 episodes total is the power of friendship? At the end of the show the only thing anyone can keep repeating is ""this journey was fun!"", and ironically enough a show isn't fun just because it says it is. 

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the most awesome anime ever created.  
What an adventure. A story of true friendship and fight against evil in its purest form. 
 
The villain Dio is probably one of the most greatest villains ever created. Dio is so perfect,that anyone can fall for his handsome looks and charm.When he talks even the most bravest of heroes can't move,that's how he traps them and gets control over them.No one can stop Dio, and he will rule the world. He has many faithful servants that are willing to die for him and are equally evil, as he is.  
 
But, he needs one thing and one thing only. 
To destroy the Joestars once and for all. 
 
Joseph and his grandson Jotaro need to destroy Dio in order to save Holy. So the mission begins. If you think the Hamon power was cool, wait till you see the Stand Power, because it's the coolest thing you'll ever see. There are many different stands, all interesting in their own way.  
 
The designs of these stands and the story behind each and every one of them, is just a joy to watch. Entertainment at its highest level. Leaving you wanting more after each episode.The excitement never ends! Full of crazy horror bloody scenes, filled with ton of comedy and joy. 
With a lot of mystery and anticipation what the next stand will be like.  
 
The old hag stand was so spooky, but when she talks and screams of her revenge, those scenes with Polnareff leave you laughing to the point where, your neighbors will hear you. The dog Iggy will become your favorite after you get to know him better in one of the most amazing episodes ever created, when he encounters an evil guardian.  
 
The episode when they play games is so much fun, when Jotaro takes of his hat and the old man screaming at him the whole time, because Jotaro doesn't even know how to play the baseball game. Just so much fun. 
 
In this anime every episode has a story on its own, but always connected to the main plot. Bringing new and exiting characters who all have great original stand powers. Most anime would drag one simple story throughout the whole Season, but not this one. Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and 2 gives you so much more. You are left with a feeling of getting to know so many characters and their own stories. 
 
Overall this adventure is such a rich, powerful, creative, heartwarming story. It will make you laugh,cry, be amazed, and cheer for our heroes.  
 
(OMG!!!!!! I cant forget to mention such style, such fashion and such perfect hairstyles!!!! Such muscles! A girl can just gush over these things lol ) 
 
GOOD GRIEF.  
 
P.S. The old man's Sony Walkman looks exactly like my Sony Walkman...Just one of the little details, that makes it so damn nostalgic for me.

","Monochrome Factor 
 
I decided to give this series a try considering the amount of perfect 10 given by other reviewers, and after finishing all 24 eps I'm wondering if I even watched the same anime as those reviewers who gave this a perfect score -_- 
 
STORY = 5 
The premise of Monochrome Factor isn't exactly anything new. Good v Evil, Light v Dark, MC must prevent the impending destruction of the world. Nothing exactly groundbreaking and easy to swallow. However this show fails massively with the pacing of the story. Monochrome Factor is a 24 episode anime however if you actually look in detail only really about 8 of the 24 eps actually move the story forward and the rest are filler eps. The filler eps follow a generic pattern of the MC encountering an issue for the first half of the episode then have the other half fighting monsters. There ARE so many eps which you could've missed all together and not missed anything important story wise -_- 
 
Also if you're watching for the shounen-ai aspect, don't bother with Monochrome Factor unless you're like really desperate. You'll get jokes about it, but the actual Shounen ai is very very light. 
 
ART = 7 
Monochrome Factor actually has nice character design. There are a lot of characters in this anime so you do see a lot of well drawn characters. The artwork for the background are nice as well and there are a lot of different settings which is nice. There are a lot of comical scenes and they are really done well with the art style in Monochrome Factor 
 
SOUND = 6  
Nothing really that special, quite a generic soundtrack. Fast paced dramatic music for action sequences and comedic music for the more comical scenes. 
 
CHARACTER = 8 
This was actually a strong point of Monochrome Factor. The characters you are introduced in Monochrome Factor are fun and lighthearted. You have the Tsundere like MC, the tomboyish girl of the group, the idiotic best friend, the mysterious cool guy, the hot guy and of course the kid genius. The characters interact really well together and the voice acting of the characters is quite good. As I mentioned before the series is 24 eps so you do meet a large variety of other characters and some of these characters are more well written than others but still great in their own way. 
 
ENJOYMENT = 6 
I love to watch anime and I love to marathon many episodes in one night, however in the case of Monochrome Factor I could not. It actually took me more than 2 weeks to finish Monochrome Factor. After watching 2 filler episodes I had to take a break and watch something else. It was simply too boring and repetitive. The final few eps did capture my attention and I did watching in suspense so the story did have it strong point at time.. The comedic scenes are another saving grace of this series, they do make you laugh and are genuinely funny. 
 
OVERALL = 6 
Overall this anime IMO is disappointing. I did have high hopes considering the amount of perfect 10 I saw before but for me this show did not deliver. The amount of filler eps really threw off and did not make this series enjoyable for me. 

          
 
       Helpful Dropped due to pacing and changes in the plot, mainly. It's been a while since I've looked for anime that'd be capable of pulling me thoroughly into its realm, alas this disappointed me. Half of the series is painfully repeatable, tinged with shounen-ai - which is not a bad thing on its own - but this anime didn't pull it off. 
The good thing about it is that it directed me to the manga which is a whole lot better.

          
 
       Helpful I know that there are very different opinions on this show, especially since the adaption of the anime varies so greatly from the original manga. Fortunately excellent voice acting, nice artwork and hilarious characters are all able to save the series from a complete failure. 
 
Story - 6/10 
 
The story is a common one. Ordinary highschooler meets mysterious stranger and gains mighty powers with which he has to save the universe. Of course, his friends join him in the quest. And we can't forget that he has a destiny. 
 
As if the plot wasn't bad enough, the entire series seemed to drag on, especially when it came to the fights. Not even half of the episodes had any real relation to the plot and the ""real"" evil was only revealed in the last episode, where it all seemed awfully rushed. This could have been done a LOT better! 
 
The major downside of Monochrome Factor is, that the manga was not finished by the time that the anime was made. Therefore what we get is something that can be compared to the first Fullmetal Alchemist series; it starts out promising, but takes a wrong turn. 
 
Art - 8/10 
 
As a fan of this genre, I liked the artwork of the characters. The artwork was slightly different than other shonen-ai series I had been watching and it was really nice. The background art was a bit generic though, but I like the way the characters were drawn, as at least that point stayed true to the manga. I found the transformation scenes rather silly, but overall, the artwork was just as I liked it. 
 
Sound - 8/10 
 
I do not remember much of the background music in this series, which drags this down to an 9, but the ending themes and voice acting was top-notch: 
Daisuke Ono as Akira, Hiroshi Kamiya as Kengo, Junichi Suwabe as Shirogane and Katsuyuki Konishi as Kou. Those are just the voice actors that I can remember. The entire cast of this series was absolutely wonderful. And the ending, oh the ending! I absolutely adored the first ending, sung by Ono and Kamiya. Overall, wonderful. 
 
Character - 8/10 
 
Apart from being a bit flat, the characters where humorous. You have a wide range of characters with each its own personality. I especially enjoyed the interaction between Akira and Kengo, the childhood friends and between Akira and Kou, who has also have a relationship from far back (no spoilers!). 
Unfortunately, this once again leaves me wanting more. I want to know more, especially about Akira's past and how he and Kengo first met Kou (which is a rather important part of the manga). Also, I slightly dislike the personality of Shirogane as he constantly flirts with Akira, something which I found non-existant in the manga. 
 
Enjoyment - 9/10 
 
Apart from dragging on too long, Monochrome Factor was able to keep my attention with its constant joking. Also, the appearance of Kou in the opening left me wanting to know who he was (funny how much 5 seconds can leave you wanting more).  
Through the first half of the series, it was mostly the funny shonen-ai moments between Akira and Shirogane that kept my interest, as well as Kengo's silly personality. During the second half, it was mainly the flirty Kou, who kept my interest up. 
Again, the reason I can enjoy the series so much is because I always enjoy series with good voice acting which can leave me watching it over and over again. So far, I have watched Monochrome Factor from beginning to end 4 times and I still have not grown tired of it. 
 
Overall - 8/10 
 
Despite the shallow and rather ridiculous plot, the series is saved by a wonderful cast of characters and a good dose of shonen-ai hints for the fangirls. This is not a series for people who wants a deep plot and serious characters, but rather for girls who likes a lighthearted and funny story with lovable characters. 
As a last recommendation, for those who enjoyed the series and wishes to know more about the series, read the manga! You will not be disappointed.

Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.
The volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the Avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.

One of the prominent characters is Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.
","Lodoss-tou Senki (Record of Lodoss War) is a very western-style fantasy story. The protagonist is a village-boy-turned-swordsman, his love interest is an elf, they’re joined by a priest, a wizard, a dwarven warrior, and a thief. They fight against evil wizards, dark elves, orc-like beastmen, and ultimately an evil kingdom, all of which are in service of resurrecting an evil god. They meet various allies throughout the series, including kings, lords, and mercenaries. They explore ruins and travel the land.  
 
If you’re a fan of fantasy novels or video games, all of this probably sounds fairly familiar. I don’t know what Japanese audiences would have thought, but Lodoss is rather cliché. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. Cliché stories can be comforting (eg. in the form of nostalgia) or sources of easy entertainment. And even a bad story (cliché or not) can be saved by having exciting or complex characters. But this is where the first real problem with Lodoss’ writing emerges: the characters aren’t particularly great. 
 
Of maybe half a dozen major characters, only one, the protagonist Parn, sees anything resembling character development. Parn starts out as a reckless teenager who doesn’t know how to use a sword. Over the course of Lodoss, he learns how to use a sword, becomes less reckless, and appears to mature at least a little. However, these changes are rather superficial. Parn is fundamentally the same person at the beginning of the story, in the middle of the story, and at the end of the story. Likewise, Parn never seems conflicted or in doubt about his choices, nor does he ever despair in the face of evil. Parn’s entire personality and character arc could be summarized with one word: protagonist. 
 
The other characters don’t differ, really. They all fit into familiar archetypes, none of them demonstrate any hidden depths or complex motivations, and, unlike Parn, none of them have any kind of character growth. None of this is to say that there aren’t any likeable characters – Ghim, Woodchuck, and Ashram all stood out for me – but for every likeable character, you can probably find at least one or two who feel superfluous. For example, I can vaguely recall both Slayn the wizard and Etoh the priest doing things, but neither really felt integral to the plot, despite being two of Parn’s companions. 
 
A lot of these problems with characterization could be solved if Lodoss was better paced. Lodoss’ pacing is odd. The OVA was adapted from a series of novels; however at the time, only the first three of seven novels had been published, and only three more would be published by the OVA’s conclusion. And whilst those novels were, in turn, adapted from a DnD campaign run by the author and his friends, at best that would have only provided an outline to the production company. Whilst one can’t know for sure, I suspect that this had some impact on the production, pacing, and writing of the episodes.  
 
Lodoss’ first episode is in media res, taking place probably around the same time as episode six. It doesn’t really spare much time in introducing the characters. As a story about six companions adventuring in a dungeon, it’s pretty entertaining, but I admittedly found it hard to follow at times, especially when it cut away from our heroes to focus on conversations being had by various villains and supporting characters. The second episode is the true beginning of the story, and from there the series progresses normally. Lodoss is primarily about a war staged between the evil empire of Marmo and the various other kingdoms of Lodoss, and this war transpires over the course of the series. However, for the first eight episodes, at least some of the narrative focus is on Ghim’s quest to find a young woman, Leylia, who had disappeared some years before. These eight episodes are probably the best part of the series, and if the story told during them had been expanded to the full thirteen episodes, I suspect that many of my complaints regarding characterization would have been moot.  
 
Unfortunately, after episode eight, Lodoss’ story takes a nosedive. The last five episodes concern the bulk of the war against Marmo, and five episodes isn’t enough to tell the story of a war. Often times, I felt as I were missing something – as if, for example, the characters had decided something or come to some realization between episodes. I’ll admit that I had trouble maintaining interest by this point, so I may simply have missed something, but these final episodes definitely felt rushed when compared to the eight that preceeded them.  
 
If there is a bright spot to Lodoss, it is the fantastic art. The characters designs are all richly detailed and are an interesting blend of Eastern and Western art styles. Any one of the characters wouldn’t look out of place in a DnD manual from the eighties. On the other hand, the animation leaves something to be desired. I’m not the greatest judge of these kinds of things, but I suppose one expects a bit more fluidity from an OVA, whereas Lodoss – character designs aside – felt more like a television series in terms of quality. That’s maybe not the best way of putting it, but I’m not an art guy. The color palette is also more muted when compared to other fantasy anime (such as Slayers), though I think that’s fitting given how seriously Lodoss takes itself. 
 
As I mentioned before, I think that Lodoss would have been more enjoyable overall had the story arc of the first eight episodes been extended to all thirteen. However, as it is, I don’t think Lodoss is without it’s appeal. It is a solid, if predictable and cliché fantasy story, and I suspect those with an interest in the fantasy genre will find something to enjoy here, whether it be the nostalgia or the art. Likewise, I don’t know how faithful it is to the novels, but I imagine fans of the novels would appreciate the OVA, as well (and perhaps get a lot more out of it). Then again, fans of the novels might take issue with any deviations the OVA made, and given the OVA was being released before the series was fully published, I can imagine there were a few.  
 
However, you probably already know whether Lodoss is the kind of series that will interest you. It is exactly what it seems to be, for better or worse.

          
 
       Helpful Knights, clerics, elves, dwarves and dragons occupy some of our biggest inner-nerd imaginations. Some of my fondest memories were playing old school dungeon-crawler video games on the PC, and interacting with this type of fantasy lore. Lord of the Rings, Willow and the Chronicles of Narnia all come to mind when reminiscing of some of my favorite fictional fantasies, and there’s plenty of anime out there that scratch the itch. Legendary anime studio Madhouse attempted to tackle Record of Lodoss War in the early 90’s, a time when fantasy novels and movies were undoubtedly on the rise. It has a palpable Dungeons and Dragons feel, and is nostalgic of those all-nighters with friends, chugging our Mountain Dews and munching on Doritos while rolling the 20-sided die one more time. Unfortunately Lodoss is plagued with a sense of “generic” that’ll have you thirsting for more depth… which’ll sadly never come. Coupled with some of the most inconsistent English voice acting I’ve ever heard, it’ll be an anime you’ll probably forget soon after watching it. 
  
My biggest complaint about Lodoss is that it wasn’t given the proper amount of episodes to expand its story properly. It has such an engrossing atmosphere and massive worldbuilding potential that is squandered terribly due to a lack of time investment. What we’re left with is a marginalized “good vs. evil” approach, thinning the cast of characters to generic protagonists and antagonists. A series with this much imagination needs the proper nurturing to ensure success, and 26 episodes would’ve given it more of a fighting chance. On top of that, they decided to drop the viewers into the middle of what is chronologically after the 5th episode… only leading to the confusion. I don’t know if different mediums of media were trying this reverse storytelling at the time, but it was entirely unnecessary and only confused the hell out of me, and I’m assuming a lot of other people. 
  
You follow Parn (yep, sounds like porn) and his stereotypical group of fellow travelers (a cleric, wizard, elf, dwarf and thief) as they seek to prevent the destruction of the planet by baddies that want to control the universe. Sound intriguing? Well, I can assure you that this is the Dynasty Warriors button masher of plots. Considering the source material is actually written to emulate a D&D experience, the dungeon master must’ve been rather disappointing. The main character transforms from useless fodder to going toe for toe with the most powerful foe on Lodoss (which has definitely never happened in an anime before), all in the course of like 5 episodes. There's a loose backstory referencing his father and restoring his family’s honor, but it’s unconvincing at best. Generic quotes like “I'll get you!” and “you're no match for me!” resonate from his vocabulary on occasion, and you sense there isn't much there are on his intellectual level. Parn’s childhood friend Etoh, the with perhaps the worst English voice actor of all time, accompanies him as a sworn companion. 
  
Deedlit, a high elf and Parn’s hinted love interest, is a princess that randomly decides to join the adventure. Given the fact that she’s actually of royalty, she naturally drops everything to answer the underlying question of what is happening to her people. And honestly, the rest of the main pack is irrelevant. A gaggle of genericized fantasy tropes, which doesn’t create the best selling point. The most interesting character in the entire series is Ashram, a knight who seeks the highest power, but has some serious self-identification and reflecting to do in the process. He’s initially perceived as a villain, but can actually draw some empathy and understanding as the series elapses.  
  
In addition to being a relatively generic series, Lodoss is littered with bits of randomness along the way. Although the “potential” romantic relationship between Parn and Deedlit never actually develops, there are plenty of awkward exchanges or long stares that force the viewer into thinking there’s something there. I’m just not buying it, there’s almost no chemistry between the two. Not to mention the interest fellow traveler Shiris (the girl with the berserker friend) has in Parn…. something that's awkwardly left by the wayside. There's also the evil witch Carla, with perhaps the most unassuming name in anime villainy existence, and another dark elf that sporadically falls for Ashram along the way. The more I get frustrated with the lack of finesse in writing, the more I realize what the anime was modeled after: a D&D quest. Speaking from experience, the element of randomness doesn’t even scratch the surface of the ridiculous stuff me and my friends used to come up with when we played. So…. I guess there’s that. 
  
Sometimes I don’t consider it fair to criticize animation from the 90’s or earlier, because it’s merely a sign of the times. In Lodoss’ case, the art style isn’t necessarily my cup of tea but it’s consistent with the art out at the time in terms of quality. From what I remember reading, the studio actually utilized a sizable budget in order to get exactly what they were looking for in terms of emulating various fantasy elements and characters. Some of the fight scenes are actually quite fluid as well, something that earlier anime had issues with. No choppiness or quality drop during the heavier action sequences, something I can really appreciate. Especially when you consider the issues modern day anime have with frame drops and inconsistent animation, likely without any legitimate excuse. 
  
Did I mention how bad the voice acting is? Central Park Media, a NYC based company took the reigns dubbing Lodoss. It was clear they had no idea what they were doing. Some acting is decent, but others are absolutely atrocious. It’s almost as though when the producers signed off on it they were doing more of a “screw it”, knowing they’d be out of a job anyway. If you’re a fan of dubs due to convenience, I strongly suggest you watch the Japanese version or avoid it altogether. It’s THAT bad. Performances like this employs hopefulness for my future seiyuu career… I digress. 
  
The rest of the music is slightly unfitting, but about what I expect from an early 90’s series. Anime was largely in a learning period, starkly evident by the slow female ballads present in their OPs. For a show so focused on action and fantasy elements, the OP just...doesn’t work. As a standalone track it’s quite present, reminiscent of “Fly Me to the Moon” from NGE, but not an anime fit. The background tracks depict the genre much better. They’re full of orchestral life, and build crescendos left and right.  
  
As much as I disliked certain aspects of Lodoss, I enjoyed it overall. However, one must understand that most of my enjoyment comes from a mix of nostalgia and relatability. I was a HUGE nerd in my high school days, so Lodoss speaks to me in some ways other anime cannot. On the other hand, it’s leaps and bounds from being “good” by any normal definition. Perhaps I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had watched the Japanese dub vice the English, but a generic plot, short run time and forced romance all work to cripple Lodoss, dooming it from the start. I would recommend this series to fans of other fantasy anime or earlier shows, or those just looking for something different. As always, thanks for reading!

          
 
       Helpful This one is a little bit serious. If you want to talk about this in DnD perspective, these are the guys that take everything serious and say that you can’t talk out of character and all that. Sure there is a little comedy but it is pretty much ether nurd-ifide or magically complicated. Maybe this is why I don’t really get along with the serious people… because I didn’t much care for it. Now this doesn’t mean that it is bad, oh no. It’s far from bad even to today’s standards. It just takes a lot of talking and standing around before anything really significant gets done. 
 
The characters are alright though I have to wonder about the names and character designs. Ghim, the dwarf, reminds me a lot of Ghimbli from Lord of the Rings, and I’m not sure but depending on when Rune Soldier was made, Deedlit looks a lot like Crysta, the elf girl they meet. No matter how you try to sugar coat it, Parn is pretty much a weakling trying to fit into his father’s armor, though that’s mostly what he looks like. He does have a brave heart though, which I have to sit down and roll my eyes at since it’s pretty much generic. The whole thing is freaken generic and rather boring to me most of the time.  
 
The animation, though beautiful, felt more like still shots with lips flapping because The fight scenes aren’t well done in today’s standard. They might have been fine back then but I come from a generation where we like our active fight scenes and not this ‘clash swords and talk’ thing most of the characters do. 
 
The voices, mostly actually miss in the English version and since I couldn’t find the Japanese, I couldn’t see weather it was the same there too. This is just one that I really wish had some more comedy to keep me interested. The narrator got on my nerves a hell of a lot more then the others though. It seemed ever part that could have been better without any sound was voiced over to talk about what was right in front of us!

12,37348,147,5.099031647,Story between god and human,Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Movie: Orion no Ya,"In the city of Orario, beneath an impossibly tall tower, lies the dungeon. Only adventurers who form partnerships with the gods themselves have any hope of defeating the monsters that lie within. But the dungeon is not the only place where monsters exist. Far from Orario, in the ruins of an ancient city, a new threat arises. To counter this threat, the goddess Artemis has come to Orario in search of a champion—but it's not Ais Wallenstein (the legendary Sword Princess) nor Ottar (the strongest warrior to ever enter the dungeon) that she chooses. Rather it is Bell Cranel, a newbie adventurer partnered with a low-tier goddess. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia (ファミリア, Famiria). The primary activity of these organisations is exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon (ダンジョン, Danjon) in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores. By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known as skills.
The story follows the adventures of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old rookie adventurer and sole member of the Hestia Familia. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman of the Loki Familia, and vows to become as strong as her following a chance encounter where she saves his life from a powerful monster. While Ais is the object of Bell's romantic affection, several other girls, deities and mortals alike, have similar feelings for him; most notably, Hestia herself.
","I Saw European premiere of this movie and saw no review, so I will try to write one. I didn't see the parent story (which one is already on my list of anime that I plan to watch), so maybe that's the reason why some things were little unclear but overall even me as a newcomer was able to get ""into action"". Story was pretty typical of this kind of anime but characters are pretty good and the movie itself had many interesting and funny moments. The movie went pretty fastly forward so I have many ""questions"" that will be hopefully answered in season 1 and coming season 2 of anime. I enjoyed the movie, maybe it doesn't bring anything new but anyways I believe it's worth to see it.

          
 
       Helpful One month before the release of Danmachi season 2, they give us a movie preview, I was able to attend, and as i only watched it once, it is not impossible that I might forget details or make a mistake. 
 
First we will start with the scenario, honestly it's a very unoriginal scenario, starting on a new quest from the moment Bell was chosen by a weapon. I find that the plot is also far too predictable,there is also some fan service scene, probably for the comedy side. The movie being released as a preview I do not prefer to give too much detail on the story. 
 
Regarding the animation, it is not bad but also nothing exceptional, the fight scenes are not incredible or even bad, including the fight against Antares (who is animated in 3D) but maybe a certain scene can give more than interest to the movie. The sounds, like the animation, is also nothing impressive, quite trivial OST. 
 
Finally characters, I personally think that this is the biggest highlight of the movie (maybe you do not agree with me), in my opinion, Artemis is the one that gives the most meaning to this movie, it's a character unique to the movie, but also the one I find most endearing of all Danmachi. I hover over the details, just to tell you, where are the interesting points and where are they not, without spoil you. 
 
In my opinion this movie is clearly not to look absolutely, but if you are a fan of Danmachi, you will probably like it so if you had not enjoyed the first season, you probably do not appreciate this movie. 
 
Although it is a review I avoid a maximum of spoil since many people read the reviews to decide to look at it or not. 
 
Story: 5, Art/Animation: 5, Sound: 6, Character: 8, Enjoyment: 7. 
 
I hope I don’t have too much writing error… 


          
 
       Helpful I think many people misunderstand what a non-canon anime movie is. A movie for an on-going series must be a self contained story that does not affect the source material as to avoid ruining the continuity of the original work. With that in mind, most anime movies are nothing more than popcorn-fare that are only meant for the enjoyment of the fans of the series. So walking into a film and expecting the storytelling of Bebop will leave you very disappointed, every time. 
 
The Arrow of the Orion was yet another non-canon anime movie with a self-contained plot and heroine with no real development for the characters. As someone who's watched his fair share of Naruto, Bleach, etc. anime films, I knew full well what I was getting into. Mainly for non-canon movies like this, what I look for is 1. How entertaining is the film? and 2. What does the movie do to make itself unique? 
 
The movie has Bell and the gang help a Goddess in need to defeat an ancient evil, but the quest is not all as it seems as the Hestia Familia begin to unravel the unsettling truth behind the quest and the Goddess who offered it. 
 
This plot is pretty standard. It's doesn't really stand out and most people can guess what's going to happen before it even happens on screen. I was however, very happy that we are finally exposed to the world outside the city of Orario. While most of it was fairly generic backdrops, it was still nice to get out of the city. I would say the plot is the weakest aspect of the film. But for a non-canon film, this isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Personally, I'm just happy we get to spend more time with these characters. 
 
I myself am a big fan of the Danmachi franchise. I like many of the characters and find the world interesting. Even Bell, who can be considered a ""generic protagonist"", is someone I find both endearing and someone I love to cheer on. I very much enjoyed the first season and I can't wait to see where the second season takes us. 
 
With that in mind, I found that this movie did a great job with character interactions; most were fun and entertaining. I love this cast, and seeing them further joke around and talk is something I'll always find enjoyable. Hestia especially has really great screen presence. Jokes hit most of the time and I found myself smiling during the groups' antics. But as I've said, there isn't any room for any real development for characters in a film like this. 
 
You'll be hard pressed to find a movie that doesn't have improved visuals over its TV counterpart, and this was no different. The animation for multiple action scenes was stellar. Danmachi also has a very appealing art style. The design for the movie-only character, Artemis, was as great as the regular casts'. The group also got some nice movie outfits which were a nice touch. The only real downside was the mediocre CGI that was used for the monsters in the film. Unfortunately, this has become an industry norm that I've more or less have gotten used to. Regardless, Danmachi has always had solid visuals in both animation and art, and that continues in this film. 
 
I think one thing this franchise doesn't get enough praise for is its sound design. The sound design for this was outstanding. Some standout sounds came from the final fight, as well as during special powerful attacks. But even more common sounds, like when someone defeats a monster, sounds terrific. The sound is strong and very bass heavy, but some others sound alien and weird; I just love it. The soundtrack was also good. If you're familiar with the TV series' OST, the movie's soundtrack sounds very similar. I think the franchise as a whole has had above average music, especially during fight scenes with the violin segments. 
 
While this movie doesn't break any new ground and plays it pretty safe with its simple story, I still enjoyed myself. If you're not a fan of the franchise, or you dislike non-canon movies, then I'm not sure why you're here. But if you're a fan of this franchise and just want to see more of Bell, Hestia, and the whole gang, then grab your adventuring gear, because this film is worth your time.
