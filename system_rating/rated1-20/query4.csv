4,26349,0,15.26468556,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken,"Though they couldn't be any more different, love has managed to blossom between Hajime Tsunashi, a hardcore otaku who shuts himself in at home while making a living off his blog, and his wife Kaoru—a hard-working office lady who, in contrast, is fairly ordinary, albeit somewhat of a crazy drunk. As this unlikely couple discovers, love is much more than just a first kiss or a wedding; the years that come afterward in the journey of marriage brings with it many joys as well as challenges. 
 
Whether due to their quirky personalities or the peculiar people surrounding them, Hajime and Kaoru find themselves caught up in a variety of baffling and ridiculous antics. But despite the struggles they face, the love that ties them together spurs them to move forward and strive to become better people in order to bring their partner happiness. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Seinen']","The series centers around the daily lives of Kaoru, a hard working office lady, and her husband Hajime, who is an otaku, an obsessed fan of anime and manga culture, and who works as a blogger. Using popular anime and otaku tropes and in-jokes, the characters explore the conflicts and similarities between daily life and otaku culture in urban Japan. The witty dialogue accentuates the animation and sometimes slips into manzai-style humor.
","Since this serial has only 3-minute episodes i'll make a short review 
 
First: this show is realy enjoyable, short and i would recommend it to basically anybody 
 
Its funny and simply has a good feeling. 
The art isnt outstanding at all but the art bascially doenst matter  
The Characters are really well done, especially both main char's 
The girl is looking good but is kinda bored of life and alone  
The boy is an otaku ( speaking for itself) he doenst realy have many friends etc 
 
Throughout the show you'll notice that not only one characters likes the other one but both realy LOVE eachother. its not like these simple teenie loves. its a realistic love where both can rely on eachother and thats why its so nice to spectate their development. 
 
9/10 obviously 3 minutes, sound not outstanding but realy give this a shot.

On a bit more serious note this is too non-ambitious to get a serious critique. An otaku and his wife live together and try to deal with the differences between an otaku's world and a normie's world. 
 
It's too short, and oftentimes passing from one scene to the next without even a transition is kind of jarring, so maybe a bit more effort into making something more cohesive would help. 
 
No backstories, or little of it, and not much in the way of progression, but still, all I can say is that it's cute and that it deserves more. 
 
Overall:

       Helpful This is a cute, humorous, and ultimately heart-warming tale about the daily life of an otaku and his normal wife. This show has pretty strong sexually suggestive content so is probably best served to those over 16. It's an extremely short show, following the recently-popular 4-koma based approach with each episode taking three minutes, end credits excluded. Though simplistic in its execution and animation style, the story is pretty nice and the message even more so. Go ahead and give it a try, a sampling will only take you three minutes! 
 
Animation: 
As expected from shows of this length, don't expect the same quality as what you'd get in a full-length show. Backgrounds are grainy and characters are drawn with very simplistic shading. Despite the slightly comic-book based animation, this work is definitely targeted towards a more mature audience. Expect lots of suggestive references and even some tile mosaics. 
 
Sound: 
The show is heavily dialogue drive and uses BGM sparingly. It ends with a fitting and melodic ED as the couple enjoys each other's company in the tub. Surprisingly, the show has strong voice talent as we have Yukari Tamura voicing Kaoru. You even get Rie Kugimiya voicing a supporting character as well. 
 
Story: 
Each episode has a specific theme related to the particular title, but most of them revolve around a fairly ordinary daily event. What supposedly differentiates this show is that the husband is an otaku. All this really means though is that he will occasionally drop references that only anime veterans will understand (and obviously this doesn't include his wife). The story gets a large boost in the last few episodes as the story of how the two met and how much they mean to each other is revealed. 
 
Though short, this is a well executed and engaging story. 
 
Character: 
Both protagonists are pretty well explicated especially considering the length of the show. Expect some pretty good interactions and an especially nice surprise at the very of the show. 
 
Value: 
There have been a lot of short, 4-koma shows of late. This is probably one of the most engaging and interesting one so far. Though I won't go as far as saying that it has an analogous effect on the viewer as Usagi Drop, it is pretty positive nonetheless. Well worth the ~40 minutes to watch.

4,6351,1,13.84548717,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,"Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen","Included in the 8th and final DVD of Clannad ~After Story~ is an extra episode set in an alternate universe. Here, Fujibayashi Kyou is the main heroine in place of Furukawa Nagisa. 
 
Love can be wonderfully exciting, but also extremely painful. Fujibayashi Ryou, Kyou's sister, is in love with Okazaki Tomoya, the male protagonist. With the help of Kyou, Ryou manages to sum up the courage to ask him out and now Tomoya and Ryou are a couple. However, as things progress, Kyou begins to acknowledge her feelings for Tomoya, and a love-triangle is formed. 
 
As everything is revealed, the sisters learn the pains of love and try to decide between the two loves of their life: Tomoya, or each other. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","
Clannad's story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.
The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a strange girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.
","Well...It was a refreshing OVA after I finished After Story...but it didn't had any big impact on me...maybe because I was thinking that Kyou & Ryou are not a good match...or maybe because I was allready happy for the happy ending in After story...dunno why but all I can say that.....it was difinetley a nice OVA...but it was not good enough to make me cry...nor even make me sad...I just watched patiently until the end and no reaction...it was like [Ohhhh well...I gues this could happen if Tomoya doesen'e meet Nagisa and all his other friends except Ryou and Kyou. 
 
It was refreshing but nothing else...I still like better the OVA with Tomoyo arc...And as a matter of fact I AM a fan of Tomoyo x Tomoya couple...no affence to Nagisa,Kotomi & Kyou lovers...Is just that Tomoya's perfect match is Tomoyo....and that's all I have to say... 
 
Overall...a good OVA...but not as splendit as Tomoyo arc or the 2 seasons....I gave it a 8 [don't go shooting me now -]

          
 
       Helpful Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen in a word: NotClannadEither 
 
It's basically the same idea as Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen so I'm going to give it the same review: 
 
All this is an alternative reality with the characters. It doesn't give more to the main story of Clannad and Clannad After Story. If you have played the visual novel you might enjoy it more than I did, but I didn't gain anything from watching it. 
 
The art was good, the characters were their usual selves, but I adore the relationship between Nagisa and Tomoya and their relationship wasn't the focus of this story. So I kind of checked out on it.  
 
If you want to watch it, just to see the Clannad characters back in action, go for it, but I will probably never rewatch it. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I wasn't a big fan of Clannad (rated 5, 8 for After Story) partly because I just didn't like Nagisa. The way she ended up how she ended up annoyed me personally and I was never really a fan of her personality. I always thought of Kyou as the best girl so this OVA was perfect.  
 
Really, the story was just great. Basically what I wanted to happen in the series but I think it acutally worked better for an OVA.  
 
The romance was good. The characters were swell. The developments in the story were on point.  
 
Like I said before, I'm a little biased because I really am not a fan of Nagisa, but this OVA was great. It did feel a little crammed and if the split it up into two parts it may have been better, but it definitely worked.

Their close bond as children soon grows into something more personal, and Keita finds himself in a real bind that he vigorously struggles to escape from.  
 
For the twins, the transition from little girls to teenagers brought about changes in appearance as well as emotional growth. Their love for Keita became something more than brotherly love, as they were both overcome with romantic feelings and pure lust. These innocent girls, being a couple of honest young ladies, could not help but confess their newborn love to their poor little brother. Hilarity ensues as Keita, who refuses to see the two as anything other than his sisters, then starts getting into embarrassing, sensual and lustful situations with them. Will Keita cross the line of incest or will he be able to protect his family jewels?

[Quick Review (Weighting, Scores)] 
 
Story (*1.5): 5 – neutral score, as this has no story – which works in favor of its purpose. 
 
Characters (*1.5): 7 – no development of any sort but fun characters and bearable male lead. Consider them as means to an end. 
 
Art (*1.0): 8 – very polished, cute character designs (not too childish), normal-sized breasts (TYVM). 
 
Sound (*0.5): 5 – average. If you like cutesy J-Pop you may enjoy it more than I did. 
 
Enjoyment (*2.0): 9 – extremely sexy with certain comedy value. Look no further if you want a quick fix of ecchi goodness. 
 
Overall (Sum/6.5): 7.2 – don’t be fooled : within the ecchi genre I’d consider this one of its finest. Objectively, it obviously can’t compare to shows with ‘real value’.  
*** 
 
Let’s get straight down to business. If you’re looking for something other than ecchi – like heartwarming romance or mind-shattering drama – get the hell outta here. It may seem counter-intuitive, but I have to praise this short series for not trying to establish any kind of story - therefore being incredibly honest about its intention. That is: entertaining us, the viewers, with outrageously sexy moments, scene after scene. Unlike a lot of other shows in this genre, this won’t shove a contrived story down your sore throat that would make you end up in ICU due to whiplash from shaking your head (I’m looking at you, “Rosario+Vampire”, “Sekirei”, “Highschool DxD”, insert more failures of your own choice).  
 
If you care for the premise, it is as simple as that: the sole focus is on brother Keita and his two step-sisters (read: not blood-related) Ako and Riko. As it happens in the fabulous anime world, these two very lovely young ladies are head over heels for their rather wimpy brother (his whiney voice may test your endurance). What ensues are pubertal attempts of seduction to woo the reluctant brother. Everywhere. At any time. At any cost. No-holds-barred. Luckily, the brother most-often ends up going with the flow instead of stereotypically nose-bleeding his way out of the situations or keeping his distance with stoic composure (which would have otherwise killed the fun quickly). It draws the line to hentai by cockteasing you just far enough to leave the possible outcome to your - by then - more than vivid imagination.   
 
As previously hinted, the brother doesn’t completely fall into the stereotype of a pathetic harem lead. Although his voice is irritatingly shaky and his initial reluctance to the sisterly advances makes you question his sanity (and sexuality), he does in fact not shy away from getting it on with the girls once they drilled through his socially imposed (feeble) moral layers. Lo and behold! Let’s put those asexual pathetic male anime characters to the torch, for Keita has arrived! Can you imagine a guy actually exhibiting sexual desire when the time has come with a willing female? Well of course you can, since you are just one of those (an apology to the unlikely female reader(s), at this point I cannot fathom your reasons for watching). But now you can imagine seeing it on the anime screen, how great is that? Hope dies last, or so I’ve been told. High five! (In hindsight, I’ll be fair and say that Keita is still a clueless retard that I’d butcher passionately if I ever had the chance but by anime standards he’s doing pretty well).  
 
Now that the biggest danger of a cockblock is out of the way, let’s talk about the sisters. Remember the good ol’ school days, when pubescent girls grow boobs and discover their power over the male sex? Ako and Riko sure won’t waste a lot of time talking it through. They are (awe-)inspiringly honest about their affection towards Keita. French kissing and breast-fondling inclusive (don’t be naïve thinking that this show won’t have more in store). A comical dynamic is created by the sisters’ rivalry in their attempts to outdo each other. Sometimes you’ll be laughing, other times your jaw will hit the floor at lightning speed. Trust me, it’s a good feeling. 
 
At the point of writing this review, I’ve seen 7 out of the announced 8 OVA episodes. With the exception of the last episode (#6, as the first one was named ep #0), which turned out to be a dull generic school examination episode (with no direct brother x sister action), this series was an oasis in the desert called “ecchi genre”. The animation is excellent, the focus narrow and the narration straight-forward. They did a lot of things right, a tip of the hat well-deserved. 


          
 
       Helpful Lets be honest, kiss x sis is a very generic anime.  
 
the synopsis starts with suminoe, keita a 3rd year in high school and his obsessive sisters WHO ARE NOT BLOOD RELATED. keita starts  to almost kind of starts to lose him self and becomes attracted to his sisters.  the story progresses, but there really isn't a story as his sisters just try to seduce him.  
 
 
The art is very ""moe"" or cute its not half-bad as it makes up for the show overall poorness.  
 
The sound was okay the one thing i really liked is the ending, as the dance just kinda attracts me in fact there are some people on you tube who have performed the dance. the opening for the kiss x sis ova was actually decent and kind of catchy.  
 
 
As for the characters the characters where very generic, i feel like ive seen every one of these characters before in a different anime. but there is one character that i find original and that character is kiryuu yuuzuki. I feel that her role influences the outcome of the story shes also an OTAKU who tries her hardest to hide this from her students.  
 
Now my overall enjoyment of this anime was low and the reason for this is because there was no plot. Story's that have no plot bore me. at least kiss x sis (TV) had some plot as keita was trying to get in the same high school as his two sister ako & riko.  
 
Overall i give this anime a 5/10 or mediocre

I really did like this a lot and it made me understand the character of Yuu a lot more. When watching the TV series I found myself frustrated at Yuu. I could not understand how he could love a girl when they had only just met, plus a lot of the time I would question what Yuu's true feelings for her were. This movie helped me cast away all my doubts about my Yuu and made me really fall in love with the idea of Yuu/Miki. The story is brilliant. It really makes you get how Yuu felt when his family said they were getting a divorce. The shots that were showed helped understand what it is about Miki that Yuu loves so much about her. It was also great seeing other characters and what they were like before the series begun.  
 
I definitely do think Marmalade Boy the Movie is great for those to watch who have seen Marmalade Boy. It was very sweet and funny. 

          
 
       Helpful This movie definitely gave me a lot of closure. Marmalade Boy has entirely been about Miki's point of view, but this movie actually makes Yuu to be an actual person. I mean, for those who have seen or read the series, didn't you ever wonder how Yuu suddenly had feelings for Miki? It seemed all of a sudden. Too sudden. This movie makes a lot of sense of that thought.

In sleepy Enohana, the dirt-poor student Chigasaki Mayuko finds herself living together with NieA, a low-caste (""Under Seven"") alien. While Mayuko struggles diligently to make ends meet, NieA seems to be totally unconcerned with the consequences of her actions. As the odd couple throws off the expected sparks, the wrecked alien mothership looms in the background...  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","Set in a retro-future setting, the series revolves around Mayuko, a high school graduate who goes to cram school in preparation for college. However, due to having no place to settle in, she decided to live in a bathhouse in the countryside, which is in a financial crisis due to having no customers. Even worse, she has to live with an alien girl named NieA, who has no antenna and is considered an ""Under 7"", a class despised by other aliens due to being the lowest of their kind.
The series touches lightly upon issues of discrimination, stereotypes, alienation, city life vs small-town life, and assimilation.  Mayuko, who attends a cram school, is a young girl living away from her family and expresses a lot of melancholy.  NieA, who is apparently placed in an inferior class by her fellow aliens due to being a physical minority among them, immediately accuses anyone who calls her a ""stupid no-antenna"" or the like, of discrimination. Other aliens adopt various stereotypical cultural styles; one chooses Indian dress and opens a convenience store, another chooses to associate herself with the Chinese Revolution. This theme of the outsider alien is carried through in the brief comic live-action sequence which ends each episode, ""Dalgit's Tidbit of Indian Information.""
","A title born from the people responsible for the creation of Serial Experiments Lain. NieA_7 was based of a doujinshi of the same name by the esteemed Yoshitoshi ABe. Apparently, the staff of Lain wanted to create a very light-hearted title to follow up the sever tone found in Lain. In short: this doesn’t really work out in the show’s favor. Why? I’m getting there.The story revolves around a hard-working high-schooler Mayuko (Mayu), who lives on her own and struggles to make ends meet between her three low-wage jobs. Mayu is a shy, introverted, and to make life worse, has an obnoxious, food-swiping, UFO obsessed alien named Niea for a room-mate (ranked as an “under 7 alien as per her alien class system for some reason). Did I forget to mention? Aliens have colonized on Earth years prior and now live alongside humans. I’d have gone on longer with the synopsis, but the fact that I did not points to my first issue regarding the show, the lack of explanation regarding just about everything regarding the setting. Not that I’m implying that leaving a number of questions open for the viewer is bad thing mind you. A later work based off of another ABe title, Haibane Renmei, did “leaving stuff to your imagination” in a way that NieA_7 is far, far off from. In Haibane Renmei, questions are left behind, but not a way that affects the narrative or renders elements of the plot pointless, as is the case with NieA_7 unfortunately. Gaps in information have everything to do with the “alien” aspect of the show. For the most part, this a show that mostly does not really care much for it’s sci-fiesque setting and keeps a more grounded focus on mostly the human characters and their daily interactions.  It’s unfortunate in this case since the show lightly touches upon themes of alienation, discrimination, and the idea of adjusting to new settings that could’ve gone much further then what ended up happening. What we got instead was far less compelling (more on that a bit later since now I’m harping on what the show didn’t do as opposed to what it did). The opening episode leaves behind a number of questions and they only accumulate as the show progresses. Like, why did the aliens come to earth? What’s up with the mother ship? Why does it send out signals to Niea? How can Niea hear the signals even though she’s the only antennae-less alien in the entire series? I could go further, but the point is clear. Have any questions regarding the setting? Well, they’ll likely remain just that, only questions. The show’s tiny focus essentially renders most of the setting as pointless add-ons. I’m still not really sure what the point of the aliens were in this show at all. Even though we hardly learn a thing about their species, they still appear regularly to perform their comedic shtick which I felt to be hit or miss. The aliens also ultimately add nothing to the show and have no involvement in the show’s central conflict: Mayu’s inner conflict (asides from Niea, whose mostly only adds to Mayu’s stress) . The sub-plot regarding Niea and the alien mother ship was not given nearly enough detail since it mostly happens off-screen and no one cares enough to ask about it by the time the show’s over. Easily the biggest head-scratcher of the entire series.  
 
Yeah, so this is a series that tosses some potentially cool elements at the viewers only to say ""screw it, let's do some comedy"". Disappointing maybe, but that's not really what sinks the show. This would not be as big a problem for me if the comedy was actually good, but that's not the case. Mostly the result of one big nasty wrench that was thrown into my enjoyment of the show the titular character: Niea. She's basically Edward from Cowboy Bebop, except she puts all her time and effort into being downright annoying. She consistently torments Mayuko by gathering trash in her apartment, blowing up parts of her property, and worst of all constantly whining about food, or being hungry. Oh god, every time food ends up being the subject you can expect the exact same thing: Niea: FOOOOOD! GIMME MORE FOOOOD Mayuko: NO, THIS IS ALL WE HAVE Niea: FOOOOOOOOD! So much effort was put into making Niea is wacky and annoying as possible that the creators forgot to make her likable. The humor is passable when Niea is not  around (kinda liked Chiaki and Karna, and the Weed Bath house episode is pretty darn funny), but that's nowhere near being enough to make up for when she is. The audio doesn't really much to praise either, asides from the voice acting (watched it mostly dubbed, the voice actors did a good job of trying to sell the humor, but they were fighting an uphill battle to begin with).  
 
The soundtrack, I'm not even sure if there was one, If there is, it's either too muted or extremely unnoticeable since I can't recall taking notice of background music outside of the last episode. The ending theme, however, I found to be catchy and I dug the stringy instrumentals. The opening? Ghastly. Sounds like some dude who walked into a recording studio and tried to sing with strep throat. Lastly, I can't remember having ever given much attention to a show's sound effects, but  NieA_7 is an exception. The creators of the show literally ripped several cheesy sound-bites from the Hannah Barbara library and tossed them into the show to enhance the already weak comedy. The sound effects are often times the closest the show is to being funny sadly enough.  
 
This show does at least have more to it then missed opportunities and mostly sucky comedy. Mayuko herself is an interesting character when Niea is not involved. Her struggles come off as very as very easy to relate to. She starts off as a the ""straight man"" of sorts in an annoying comedic duo, but the later episodes shed light on her surrounding circumstances that are common and cause most people stress in some way or another. Whether it be her monetary troubles, social anxiety, living away from home. I have to give the show some props for appropriately portraying these issues, even in-spite of all the baggage. Don't expect any catharsis though. The show doesn't really end so much as just ""stops"" without much spectacle or payoff.  
 
The strengths of NieA_7 underscore (lol) just what this series should have been all along: A tale of a young, hard working introvert trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. Instead, we have a title that bogs itself down with unnecessary elements before coming to a somewhat unsatisfying stop. If slice 'o' life comedy is your anathema, you'd best look elsewhere since there's nothing here that will change your mind. For everyone else, your probably better of watching stuff like Planetes, a SOL/Drama that succeeds on all both fronts, or Haibane Renmei for mysterious elements that are thought provoking, rather than rage inducing.  
 
PS: You probably shouldn't watch this show if you are Indian and easily offended

          
 
       Helpful NieA Under 7 is Yoshitoshi Abe's (other) slice of life series which I felt pretty lukewarm about and didn't fully appreciate when I first watched it.  
After revisiting it however, my view of it has changed dramatically.  
 
Not only do I think it's a great slice of life series that slowly makes you feel absorbed in its world, but I also think it's a great character study that thoroughly explores its main character's fear of growing up, social anxiety, lack of an objective in life and her daily struggles as a cram student who barely scrapes by financially.  
 
So the series is set in a contemporary Japan where aliens landed with a huge mother-ship and its inhabitants started spreading across the country. But instead of being a hostile invasion they just end up integrating in to society and living as any other human and nobody seems to mind nor does this bring any significant change to Japan. 
These aliens are a thinly veiled allegory to Indians (real Indians, not native Americans) since they have a class system very similar to the one used in India. There's even one alien character that has an Indian skin tone and accent. Their appearance is basically the same as humans except they have elf ears and antennas on their heads. 
 
The main character Mayuko, is a cram student working a part time job who's kind of a loner and socially awkward. She lives in an apartment complex that is also a bathhouse run by a middle aged woman named Kotomi. She also has an alien roommate called Niea who's a deadbeat and a freeloader, constantly making Mayuko's life harder than it already is. 
 
Mayuko's relationship with Niea is the heart and soul of this series. Both Mayuko and Niea are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their class in their respective societies. Niea is an ""Under 7"" which is the lowest class among the aliens and Mayuko is incredibly poor and living hand to mouth. So they basically find comfort in each other.  
 
At its core this series is all about how Mayuko can't stand having Niea around but also realizing that her life is much worse without her since she's the only one she feels comfortable being herself with. We know this because when Mayuko interacts with other characters she's a lot more polite, shy and reserved. This is especially obvious when it comes to her friend from cram school who she likes but doesn't quite feel at home with, even looking for excuses to not go out with her and her friends. Or the landlord Kotomi who'm she looks up to as kind of a mother figure and a role model since she's a hard worker who works two jobs and generally seems to have a hard life while being seemingly unphased by it. 
She's also no different with her work colleagues at a restaurant, which is this middle aged man who's dependent on his cute 8 year old daughter (who's relationship clearly mirrors that of the main duo). 
It's also worth mentioning that Niea is envied by both Mayuko and the landlord since she is free of responsibilities and holds nothing back in every way they can't. 
 
I also want to bring up some of the series' symbolism like Mayuko's watch she got from her father symbolizing her fear of losing her childhood or the apartment complex she's living in (being a place she vacationed in with her dad as a child), being a clear parallel to the alien mother-ship since the things that happen to both coincide with one another. clearly communicating that we should all say goodbye to our childhoods at some point. There's lot's of little details like that which just flew over my head in my first viewing.  This is not much of a sci fi series, the sci fi ideas here are only important for how they are relevant to its characters. It's mostly indirect, but we do also get bits and pieces of information about the alien society and how they function within our own spread throughout the series. 
But I don't wanna get too deep in to that. Since I want this to be a review, I'll just speak in a broader way from here on out. 
 
Narratively, the series starts out fairly episodic comprised of little funny adventures in each episode until it gains more momentum and has more continuity in the second half until it ends with quite a satisfying conclusion. A passage of time is shown to us through the changing of seasons but there's no way to know exactly how much time is passing. Also there's not a single wasted episode, every single one gives you more information about the characters whether it be through dialogue or having their actions speak for themselves. What makes these characters feel so well defined is that each of them seems to have at least 2 distinct relationships with two other characters in which they seem to behave differently with each. And the main character specifically ends up being a very deep and identifiable one mainly through her actions and interactions with other characters as well as hints we get throughout the series about her past. 
 
The series' tone might be hard to digest at first (an issue I had in my first viewing) since it ranges from wacky comedy hijinks to relaxing and meditative to even becoming quite depressing and somber depending on the characters' mood. Most of the wacky comedy comes from Niea who's loud, hyperactive and generally just a useless pest. One thing I'd say in defense of this, is that the show is much heavier on comedy in its first half where it switches from a relaxing tone to a wacky comedic one, but it rarely interrupts the depressing atmosphere that it gains in the second half since it really highlights what's truly important in this series.    
 
Comedy might be subjective but I do think it is well handled here, both in terms of delivery and timing. Very often jokes seem to be set up way ahead of time (and often are an important part of the story) have a clear pay off point and don't overstay their welcome. Even to the point where the director cuts away seconds before is acceptable making the jokes hit harder as well. I didn't think it was always funny but the show does have very sharp dialogue both comedic and otherwise so some of the jokes were able to land and catch me by surprise.  
 
Additionally the series is excellent in terms of atmosphere  and it knows how to make you feel exactly how it wants you to feel whether it's happy, depressed or relaxed. It's all done with great patience. 
 
Visually the show might have a cheap look at first glance since the characters can look a little wonky and off model on occasion and nothing looks particularly detailed. But the reason for this is because the characters have very elaborate motions and expressions quite often. This show goes for a kinetic or movement based style of animation. Although the more the series goes on, and the more depressing it becomes the show does tend to linger on shots more often giving us nicer single images (usually wide shots of empty spaces to convey the main character's loneliness).  
Also the series has Yoshitoshi Abe's distinct character designs, a bright color pallet with lot's of greens and blues, as well as good attention to detail when it comes to the changing of seasons. 
 
In terms of voice acting, everyone sounds like they're giving it their all. As I've said the dialogue in this series is very sharp and character defining and the actors did a good job of selling that. 
Much of the series is quiet and without any music, especially the later half which I quite appreciate. But what music there is are these soft acoustic guitar pieces or pianos. At most you have some wacky comedic music in places and cartoonish sound effects (also there's one insert song by the singer of the OP). 
The OP and ED both seem to fit the series in terms of their lyrics. But the OP just sounds weird and the ED is actually very nice. 
 
Overall this series is brilliant and I feel stupid for not appreciating it when I first watched it only a few short years ago. The characters have real depth, the atmosphere is great, the directing is incredibly efficient and good at telling you exactly what you need to know at any moment without overdoing it. 
It's a little odd and not for everybody, but those who like slice of life should definitely give it a shot. 
 

          
 
       Helpful Ahhhh NieA_7. If you've never heard of this anime I wouldn't blame you. As it is not one of Yoshitoshi ABe's most famous since he is one of the masterminds behind the ever talked about mindf**k that is Serial Experiments Lain. If I had to compare NieA_7 to anything that ABe has done it would be more appropriate to compare it to that of Haibane Renmei as it's not all dark and philosophical, but rather, very calming and easy to take in. This show would best be described as the crew who worked on Lain taking a little break. This show is a very light-hearted comedy that is honestly a joy to watch. I would say I watched it at the perfect time as I got exactly what I wanted out of it since I had watched a lot of anime recently that consist of heavy drama and very compelling storylines. (It was Fate/Zero if you were wondering)  
 
STORY: 8/10 
Some would argue that NieA_7 lacks a constat story, I would disagree. As this anime is about a world where it is the year 2000, the turn of the century, and Aliens live amongst humans. And among those aliens is a girl (an Under Alien) named NieA. She freeloads at the Enohana Bathhouse. The main protagonist of the story is a Cram School student named Mayuko Chigasaki, who works 3 jobs just to get by. She lives at the Enohana Bathhouse with NieA and must deal with NieA crazy shenanigans or just have to deal with NieA constantly complaining about being hungry. The part of the story that I really resonanated with was that it was about Mayuko really trying her hardest to get by and showing all of these overarching depressing themes that ABe throws out there. But at the end of the day, the show is a fun to watch light-hearted comedy. 
 
CHARACTERS: 9/10 
I'll start with Mayuko Chigasaki 
Mayuko is a down on her luck Cram School Student who has to work 3 jobs just to get by as she does not want to bother her parents die money. She barely makes enough to have dinner at night, much to NieA's dismay. While she doesn't make much, she is a very hardworking girl, and never complains about what is asked of her. She constantly is butting heads with NieA wanting to eat all the time or building random UFOs or other contraptions bringing junk into their room. She has another friend named Chiaki (named after Chiaki Konata) whom she hangs out with from time to time. But Mayuko is a generally socially awkward person who would rather stay at home and study than go out with friends. Mayuko came off as a very relatable character and one that I really connected with. While I am not at the same age as her, I just could really feel what she was going through. A lot of the themes presented in this anime are quite depressing and very real. All in all, Mayuko has become one of my favorite female anime characters.  
Now there's NieA 
NieA is an Under Alien (Under 7) who lived in the Enohana Bathhouse before Mayuko got there. She is constantly causing trouble, by gathering random junk in order to make UFOs to sell so she can pay for food that she so desperately covets. When she's not causing trouble, she can be found sleeping on the roof or just being lazy somewhere. She is a very lovable character who just wants to have fun. Her relationship with Mayuko is one that I really enjoyed watching.  
 
ART: 7/10 
The animation was done by Triangle Staff who obviously did Serial Experiments Lain. The animation is what is to be expected from an anime that was made almost 15 years ago. Though the animation can hit some really high points that are very noticeable.  
 
SOUNDS: 8/10 
The sound consists of pretty normal set of tracks with acoustic guitars in the mix. Very calming little soundtrack that fits with the show very well. The opening song features the raspy voice of SION. The OP is an acquired taste but it's up to opinion. Solid voice acting on both ends. In the Japanese dub, Mayuko is played by the same voice actress who did Saber of the Fate/  series.  
 
I would very much recommend this anime for anyone who would like to just take a break with a good light-hearted comedy. Though it is pretty old and the age shows from time to time, if you can get past the older animation, you'll find a real gem of a series.

Fumoffu,"It's back-to-school mayhem with Kaname Chidori and her war-freak classmate Sousuke Sagara as they encounter more misadventures in and out of Jindai High School. But when Kaname gets into some serious trouble, Sousuke takes the guise of Bonta-kun—the gun-wielding, butt-kicking mascot. And while he struggles to continue living as a normal teenager, Sousuke also has to deal with protecting his superior officer Teletha Testarossa, who has decided to take a vacation from Mithril and spend a couple of weeks as his and Kaname's classmate. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'School']","In contrast to the original series, there is little plot continuity between episodes and most of them can stand alone, needing very little recap, if any. The only break from this pattern is a handful of two-part stories which are told over two episodes. Most of the stories in Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu are adaptations of plots from the original Full Metal Panic! short stories written by Shoji Gatoh and published in the Dragon Magazine.
The creators of Full Metal Panic! planned to give the new series title Full Metal Panic? - with the exclamation mark exchanged for a question mark. However, they quickly realized that such a minor alternation was insufficient to properly differentiate between the new series and the original. For that reason, it was decided that the fictional word ""Fumoffu"" would be used.""Fumoffu"" is the sound made by Bonta-kun, the series' fictional mascot, which resembles a human-sized, yellow teddy bear, seemingly parodying Gonta-kun from the educational show Dekirukana. It is a personal armor suit, designed by Sousuke for the purpose of providing aid in tactical situations. Even though only capable of moving with human running speed and limited by its size, the suit is essentially a miniature Arm Slave. However, due to the suit's main computer's malfunction, all syllables uttered by the pilot are changed to either Fu, Mo, Ffu, or Ru. The suit's Operating System immediately crashes if the pilot tries to deactivate the voice changer. For that reason, Kaname has to translate what Sousuke wants to say using a headset radio, which is a frequent cause of humor in the series.
","Ok so this will be my first review ever so I'll try my best!  
Firstly if you haven't seen full metal panic(first season) I suggest watching that before this. Now let's get down to it, this anime was just great I was literally on the floor laughing the whole time because it's all about the COMEDY!!  sousuke sagara is gotta be one of my favorite characters of all time because he so oblivious to everything and he shows it the most in this season. So grab some popcorn and enjoy the laughs Bc It's a masterpiece 10/10

          
 
       Helpful Okay, first things first. One: If you haven't watched the original Full Metal Panic! series, watch it beforehand. Knowing the characters *will* make the humor better. Two, if you didn't like the part of the original series that was about Sosuke and Chidori's everything but normal high school life, turn around, because that's all Fumoffu is about. Okay, let's get to reviewing.  
 
The story in Fumoffu follows, as mentioned, Chidori and Sosuke's wacky high school life, and has none of the mecha aspects that FMP! had. This means that there is room for tons of comedy - given that you liked that part of FMP! You'll see everything from bacteriological weapons to flirt contests in this series, and not to mention, Sosuke's total lack of &quot;street smarts&quot;. There is no continuous story from episode to episode, except two episodes which were tied together. Some of the episodes also feature two mini-episodes at around 10 mins. each instead of one full-length episode. While this system wouldn't have worked with, let's say, FMP!, it works perfectly for an all-out comedy show like Fumoffu. I see some people rate the story with a 4 because it's really no story (and I kinda agree with them on that), but I'm giving it a 9, because I consider what happens in each episode as well in my rating. 
 
The artwork is as great as it was in FMP!. The coloring is better than most series out there, and other effects are okay. And while above average overall, it's nothing really spectacular, and so it ends up on a 9. 
 
The soundtrack isn't much to brag about, and the worst aspect of the series, if you ask me. I hardly noticed it was there, and when I did, I can't say I was impressed. The only exception is the OP/ED themes, which were great, but not good enough to raise the music to a score of 8. 
 
The characters are the same old people I learned to love in FMP!, and that love was enough to cover up for the big lack of character development - they were the same old characters throughout the 12 episodes. But then again, I didn't really expect much character development since it's a comedy show. The side characters that were introduced were really hilarious, especially that crazy police woman. I'm stuck on an 8.5 here, too bad MAL doesn't have the ability to put in X.5 scores &gt;_&lt; 
 
All in all, I enjoyed the show a lot, and I laughed almost all the time. To summarize: If you liked FMP! and it's characters, and most importantly, the comedy aspects of the show, you have to watch Fumoffu.  
 
To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)

          
 
       Helpful I am very skeptical about giving 10 as a score simply because achieving perfection IS NOT POSSIBLE. The thing is, every now and then I come across something that does what it is supposed to do SO WELL that whatever minor mistakes that it have pale in comparison to the rest, and the result is truly a 10... Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu is one of those rare cases. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Story 
---------------------------------- 
 
This will be a bit brief, but not because there isn't any, simply because the show exists of short bursts of story development instead of a coherent big arc, this makes for a ""non continuum"" world but at the same time help flash out one of the best aspects of Fumoffu, it's randomness. 
 
You never know what to expect from the next minute of the show, and when they manage to keep this feeling untouched for twelve episodes it's hard to complain about the plot or the lack of it, specially because this characteristic puts the mood on the exact pace and you are never confronted with one dull moment. 
 
On any other show, I would count this as a bad thing, but since this works so wonderfully in the context , here, it is actually one of the strongest selling points. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Art & Sound 
---------------------------------- 
 
Art wise it is on par with what you would expect from an anime from 2003, but don't mistake this comment as an average one because backgrounds are done beautifully and the animations are simply gorgeous! There is one particular episode where the subject is rugby when the animation really got me breathless, it's VERY good. 
 
Now, when we take into consideration the style of the show we can up the bar a couple of notches, specially on the characters. Each one of them have a special care with expressions, and when we consider each character is rich and detailed, the fact that so much attention went to portraying each one specific characteristics really shows a well rounded job. It is so good that from time to time I had to rewind a few scenes just to take a closer look on their faces, specially Sagara's ones (him jumping on the pool specially comes to my mind right now). 
 
The sound does it's job, and while I didn't like much the theme songs I can't build up a strong enough case to complain about them either, sure enough, it keep up in terms of quality with the rest of the aspects of the show but never outstands on its own. 
 
Now, one thing that the audio department does really well is the VA's. The voice in this show is unparalleled, and even with the insane amount of uniqueness the art manages to portray for each character, the voice of them is never behind and the synergy between the two is really really great. 
 
Anyway, taking detailed backgrounds with smooth animations and astonishing character expressions makes up for a near 10, and since the audio while nothing astonishing in it's own merits (aside the voice actors) manage to keep up, it's hard not to be amazed by the level of quality the show achieved on this category. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Characters 
---------------------------------- 
 
Fair enough, some characters might fall on stereotypes every now and then (moe) but the fact is, each one is unique and vibrant enough to be excused from these moments, specially when the other 90% of the time they are simply groundbreaking. 
 
From Sosuke with it's uneasiness caused by all the attritions between himself and his surroundings to Chidori and her love / hate affair with his actions, going all the way trough Tessa with it's cute and yet somewhat extreme attitudes toward everything (especially Sagara) all of them worth a few paragraphs of text to explain how great each one are, and how much attrition everyone goes by (without exceptions) always being thrown around contexts that doesn't suit them... it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole all the time, it's just priceless! 
 
Luckily since all the characters (main and support) are simply so good I can save some time and resume everyone with one word: outstanding. Even if all the other aspects of the show are top notch, the characters alone are what make Fumoffu so damn good! 
 
...and I don't even have to take my time talking about Bonta-kun, all you need is a picture of him and you will understand why he is so freaking cool!!! 
 
---------------------------------- 
Enjoyment & Value 
---------------------------------- 
 
It's a show to have a blast the first time you see it, and even after a couple or runs still find amazing! Not only that, but it is so damn good, that the roughly 24 minutes of each episode are not enough, and I constantly got myself re watching scenes to take notice of small details I missed on the first way trough. 
 
Sure, it is not a serious anime, but it is probably the best and funniest fanservice anime I have ever saw, and use the term ""fanservice"" with caution because todays iterations of it consist nothing more then slapstick and tons of unnecessary sex... Fomoffu takes a more elegant and yet much better route while also keeping violence, sex and FUN to extreme levels. 
 
It's addicting, and not only that, but one of the rare series that you will end up watching again and again and again but never getting dull or repetitive, and still after your twelve run or so still giggle from it's jokes, still relate to the characters and still want to watch it again by the end of it!

","Three short sentences to describe me watching Clannad: After Story: 
 
Heart is Dead. 
Eyes are Red. 
Going to Bed. 
 
Clannad: After Story is the most beautiful anime I have seen. Clannad was good, I cried a couple of times, but in Clannad: AS, I cried a river. 
 
If you really want the full experience, do watch Clannad. 
 
But before I even watched Clannad: AS, I already knew all the spoilers, but it STILL made me cry. 
I have to say, Clannad: AS is truly, a Slice of Life anime. 
 
But anyway, if you want the full experience of the anime,  
 
Watch Clannad first, then AS, but at ep 16, wait at least a week before watching ep. 17 (Because there is a big time leap in that ep, so it will really feel like time has gone forward) Then after AS, watch the specials, that was my full experience of AS. 
 
Clannad AS takes such a simple and over used concept of life, and turns it into a masterpiece. 
I'm really happy this anime was created.  
 
But you know what else this anime did to me? 
 
It made me super scared. 
Scared for real life. I'm only twelve right now, and seeing as how after highschool/college, you are on your own, Clannad: AS truly gives me that feeling. I'm certainly not going to mooch off my parents forever, and I probably won't be as lucky as Tomoya being able to find your soulmate so soon. 
 
Just the feeling of, 
your on your own. 
 
Now I know I'll have family and friends, but still it's kinda scary for me. 
 
But anyway, 
 
Visuals and Music, 
 
I know, the visuals are hard to get used to, but if you've already watched Clannad, you should be used to it. (But seriously tho, Nagisa's eyes are WAY too big!) 
 
Music, especially the OST is just beautiful! I always notice it, and I love the Dangos! 
Only flaw for me here is the ED, Torch. It's catchy and nice and all, but more times than you'd like it ruins the moment. 
 
Overall though, Clannad: AS is an anime that has gotten me thinking, and preparing, 
preparing for life itself, and what it holds. And I don't know, there's just something about this anime, the small moments make me cry more than the entire series of Your Lie in April did, now Clannad is longer, but still. 
 
Thank you for reading!

          
 
       Helpful I understand. I do understand. Yet all I can ask is why, why is this anime praised by so many people. Why is this anime given such high ratings that it is ranked 8 on MAL's toplist and in the top 20 on almost all other anime fansite toplists. It's ok, you can click unhelpful now, I won't mind. 
 
This anime is ranked higher than Spirited Away. 
 
I said I understand two times, yet it is really a mystery to me. Still I understand why people like this sort of thing, there are many fanboys and fangirls out there who wish they found that special no-personality, clumsy, sweet, IQ=fishstick person that's just right for them, but when people who I share anime preferences with and I think of as respected watchers of anime give this thing 9's and 10's then something is wrong, something is up, probably with me. There must be something I don't see in this, something great, something wonderful, something fabulous... yea I said fabulous. I can't find it, I have tried, same thing with the first season which I found slightly better than the second season, yet I have tried finding what makes this, apparently, one of the best anime ever made. 
 
This anime is ranked higher than NANA. 
 
This is an average romance/drama sprinkled with some supernatural on top to me. I can not for my life understand how anyone, anyone at all can give this anime a higher rating, when it comes to characters, than let's say a 6... and that's stretching it. This is all I'm going to say as I'm sure everyone has seen this anime and can make up their own mind about how wonderfully awesome it is, the engrossing elaborate plot and storyboard, the wonderful screenplay that is oh so breathtaking and don't get me started on that main protagonist who is truly a masterpiece when it comes to personality, he really underwent some serious character development during this anime... yeah! 
 
This anime is ranked higher than Welcome to the NHK!

          
 
       Helpful The continuation of Clannad just gets better. Everyone has now graduated, well all except Nagisa-chan because of her illness. The story now extends up to the next 10 years. And what can I say about this, I’ve never been touched so deeply by an Anime. It’s simply too touching. The whole situation is sad, and yet there’s something good about all of it. After watching it completely, I’d have no doubt saying that Clannad After Story is truly the best romantic anime series I’ve ever seen. 
 
Storyline: 
The story continues from where it left off. At the beginning there are a few more individual story arcs, of Youhei (The Protagonists Male friend), Misae (The Dorm Keeper) and Yukine (The girl from the reference library). All these arcs just keep up the brilliance that began from the start of the season. After then on, it’s pretty much about Tomoya and Nagisa. Throughout the Anime you’d feel for both of them, and Nagisa’s parents. I personally was touched and saddened by many events that occurred later on, while also being happy seeing them live out their lives. It has been executed very well, you’d feel for them. The whole story is simply heart-warming. I absolutely loved it.  
 
Characterization:  
All the list of characters THROUGHOUT the Clannad series are great in their own way. Clannad After Story continue with the story of Nagisa and Tomoyo and have added many elements to their character. It’s not all fairy tales here. It’s real, and it’s perfect. Both of their characters go through a lot in the Anime, and nowhere will you see any nonsensical drama or fakeness. In fact, their characters are what make you cry. A special mention also to Nagisa-chan’s parents, their roles play an important part in this series. Overall, great characterization, even though characters appear nothing different from ordinary. 
 
Animation: 
Animation is fairly well. The production house is the same as the ones who had made Canon and Air, and they have improved a lot. Air didn’t appear that good (as I mentioned in my review of it), but Clannad After Story was a good improvement. Characters appear nice, some are cute. Overall, it’s quite good. ^_^ Couldn’t find anything that I particularly disliked. 
 
Music: 
The opening of Clannad was great, and the opening of After Story is simply amazing. ^__^ I really loved it. Throughout the Anime, the background score has been pretty good to hear. Comparing it to the previous season, I found it better. :) 
 
Concluding, 
Anything above an 8.5 for me is great. Anything above 9 means epic. Just goes to show how good I feel the Anime to be. It’s definitely not worth missing out on. Yes it is kinda emotional, but its nothing like immature love crap you see in many Animes. Its way more serious, and it’s definitely better. Clannad After Story rocks \m/

His background makes it difficult for him to commit himself wholeheartedly to love. The child of a divorced couple, he lives with his father. He has a mother and a sister, but he has not seen them in years. After being dumped by his girlfriend, a chance encounter with a female high school student shakes Koushirou's calm and awakens new feelings in him—but he learns that the girl is in fact his sister, who will now be staying with his father and him. Yet, the feelings in Koushirou's heart... 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Psychological', 'Romance', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","Twenty-seven-year-old Koshiro Saeki, who lives with his father Zenzo, is dumped by his girlfriend Shoko of two years, who claims he was too cold and she had found someone else. While on a train the morning after, he sees high school student Nanoka Kohinata looking at a button and crying. Later, as she is getting off the train, she unknowingly drops her train pass and Koshiro follows to return it to her. Koshiro finds himself watching her sudden smile as she notices the cherry blossoms are in bloom. Later, Koshiro is leaving his job at a marriage-arranging company with a coworker when he encounters the same girl again. Having two free tickets to a nearby amusement park, he gives them to her. To his surprise, she asks him to go with her. While on the Ferris wheel, the girl explains that she was crying on the train because she'd been rejected by a boy she had been in love with for several years. Koshiro ends up telling her about his own break up, and cries while she comforts him.
As they leave the park together, having enjoyed the outing and expecting to part and never meet again, they run into their father and are shocked to discover they are siblings. Nanoka moved to Tokyo just that morning to live with them because their home is closer to her new high school. As Koshiro hadn't gone home the night before, he hadn't learned of her arrival. Since they had grown up living separately, they didn't know what the other looked like.
As the series progresses, Koshiro finds himself unable to rid himself of the attraction that he felt for Nanoka when he first met her. Instead, his love and desire continue to grow, despite his attempts to fight them. Entering womanhood, Nanoka also develops feelings for her older brother, only increasing Koshiro's struggle. In near desperation, he moves out of the family home to remove himself from temptation and attempts to keep his coworker, Kaname Chidori, from finding out the truth behind his brusqueness with Nanoka.
However, the solution is only temporary, as Nanoka begins visiting Koshiro regularly, cooking him meals and spending time with him. Eventually, unable to resist their feelings anymore, they share a passionate kiss and have sex with each other. Unsure of what to do now that they have broken a societal taboo, they visit their parents, before contemplating committing suicide together. In the end, they decide to live, and to continue their relationship.
","INCEST!!!! Let's be real, the only reason why I decided to watch Koi Kaze was because of the incest taboo. I'll admit it. As an identical twin, (no i'm not in love with her, ya nasty) I understand the intense bond that can form between close sibling. Maybe that's why i'm drawn to Koi Kaze's intense romance. I liked how we got to explore a deeper level of romance that cannot exist outside of taboo. I also enjoyed how the show takes a dark approach instead of taking a campy or ""porny"" approach. I was unable to predict the story's direction, which is a good thing for me (i love not knowing how a show is going to end). Even though I enjoyed seeing how the romance unfolded, i was disappointed in the tepid ending. Overall, I recommend Koi Kaze to fans of of the Josei genre like myself. 

          
 
       Helpful I am gonna write this review short. I wanna make some points. 
 
(1) This anime has a very matured, well written story. 
 
(2) The story is worth enough to be written as a Novel. 
 
(3) The story was rich enough to hold my attraction from beginning to the end, even though I am and always will be against the concept of Sibling romance. 
 
(4) The story has no stereotypes. 
 
(5) The story doesn't preach. It only shows. 
 
(6) The ending was satisfying, even though there was no ""happily ever after"". The point at where the anime left us, is perfect. It left us to speculate or to wish. When the credits rolled on, I said to myself with a feeling of satisfaction, ""That's how life works.""

          
 
       Helpful Koi Kaze’s premise is not a conventional romance title. The series is an exploration on incest, one of the biggest societal taboos of humanity and it is sure to make many people uncomfortable upon first seeing it. I went through that feeling when I first heard of the series in 2005. And in an e-mail reply I got back from Koshiro’s English dub actor Patrick Seitz in that same year, it was surprising to him that the title was even licensed and distributed in America. Here’s a passage from said e-mail that I’ve kept for a while now: 
 
“When Liam, the director, told me about the show's subject matter, I was pretty taken aback--not by the prospect of playing such a character, which I relished as the challenge it was, but at the fact that Geneon had slated it for a release in the first place. Like you said, who in their right mind is going to toss a serious anime serious about incest onto an unsuspecting (and largely unprepared) Western audience?” 
 
The major strengths of Koi Kaze are the screenwriting and the lead characters. Both blend quite effectively at creating a believable focus on the awkward developments of Koshiro and Nanoka’s relationship. These two characters are at different stages of their lives and have different levels of understanding on the norms of society. 
 
Throughout much of the series, Koshiro finds himself in an internal conflict over how to deal with the growing feelings he has for Nanoka. He knows such feelings are forbidden in society yet he is trying to be honest with himself. As a result, being around Nanoka makes him feel awkward as he quite often acts coldly towards her to hide how he truly feels. 
 
Nanoka is just starting off high school and comes across as a naive girl at first glance. While not knowing of many of the societal norms expected of her, she is honest and direct with how she expresses herself towards others, especially in tense situations. The girl also has a playful side to her personality that she exhibits on occasion in Koi Kaze. 
 
In regards to the development of this forbidden relationship, Koi Kaze carefully treads a delicate line with the handling of the relationship without giving in to the conventional clichés that are found in many romance anime titles of recent memory. The characters have their imperfections and all their decisions have repercussions that they grow to accept as the series presses on. In addition, Koi Kaze maintains a neutral position in how to make viewers judge Nanoka and Koshiro’s relationship. The series neither approves nor disapproves of the relationship and there is no clear ending to the series. Instead, we are just left to wonder what kind of future that the pairing will have and whether or not we could make the decisions they made if we were in their situation. 
 
Beyond the two main characters, the secondary ones are a mixed bunch. Nanoka and Koshiro’s father, Zenzo, is constantly worried about Nanoka and is quite clueless over the problems between his two children. Koshiro’s co-worker, the lolicon Odagiri, often kills the mood of some of the tense situations that take place. Mother Makie appears quite level-headed with supporting her children, but doesn’t have much time onscreen. Koshiro’s girlfriend and Nanoka’s classmates do their parts at pushing each protagonist towards coming to grips with how they really feel. Koshiro’s supervisor Kaname Chidori is the best of the bunch with her role towards the later third of the series. 
 
In terms of visuals, the artwork seems lacking as scenery is rather simplistic in detail and colors look rather faded. Character designs, while just as simplistic, show a good diversity of looks adding to the real life believability of Koi Kaze. Compare a rough and unshaven man like Koshiro to the innocent beauty of Nanoka to catch my drift. The soundtrack features soft, light tracks that do well to accompany the delicate mood of this series. The show knows when to play its music or to keep things silent during specific scenes. 
 
Koi Kaze is a series that won’t be for all viewers. The themes of the series will keep some viewers from watching it and only those with an open mind would be able to take in what they see. If you are one with an open mind, then you can look forward to a mature, tasteful, and honest look at a controversial issue that has not been seriously explored in anime.

Toshihiko Momota, an expert swordsman and son of the Kifuuken organization's leader, unexpectedly falls in love at first sight with a beautiful girl named Yuka; however, the couple's relationship is much more complicated than it seems at first glance, for Yuka is a Shokujinki.","['Action', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Romance']","Since ancient times, there has existed a race of flesh eating monsters called shokujinki (食人鬼, lit. ""Man-Eating Ogres""), which could either assume a human-like form or otherwise live in the shadows while feeding on humans. The Kifūken (鬼封剣, lit. ""Ogre-Sealing Sword"") martial arts style school was created to hunt down these mythical creatures and its teachings have been passed down through the generations to the Momota family. The fictional story revolves around the forbidden romance between Toshihiko, the latest heir of the Kifūuken school and Yuka, a young woman who is also a shokujinki.
","If there is one director in the anime world who never fails to surprise, refresh and delight me, it is Yuasa Masaaki. Having created popular masterpieces like Ping Pong the Animation and The Tatami Galaxy, it is clear that he does not disappoint. His works are stylistically striking and always seem to bear an overwhelmingly positive and uplifting atmosphere. Kemonozume is no exception. 
 
Story: 8/10 
The story follows a species of monsters that prey upon humans, the Shokujinki, and the organisation that is dedicated to eradicating them - the Kifuuken. The story gains direction when Toshiko, a member of the Kifuuken, and Yuka, a ""Flesh Eater"", fall in love at first sight. META_BODY's review covers the philosophical aspect of this story far better than I could, but believe me when I say that it is excellent, if obscure. It is, without a doubt, highly confusing and somewhat surreal if one stops to think about it. Nevertheless, it was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. 
 
Art: 10/10  
I have seen numerous comments about the art of Kemonozume being its biggest flaw - that it is messy, as though it is a draft and not the final product. I couldn't disagree more. The art is what stood out to me as the most magnificent aspect of this series. The art style incorporates rotoscope and/or live action shots on occasion - these aspects are also present in Masaaki's film, Mindgame, and The Tatami Galaxy. Otherwise, the art makes use of scratchy, scribbly lines, similar to those used in Mindgame and Ping Pong, and the use of colour varies according to the tone of the scene. Sometimes, the palette is muted and unspectacular, and sometimes it is jarring and vivid. What I love about Masaaki's anime is how eccentric and different it is in comparison with other modern anime: you won't find any moeshit here. No two characters look the same. Each character has, well, [i]character[/i]. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The sound, both the OST and voice acting, were another spectacular aspect of this series. The OST was like nothing I have heard in an anime before. Somehow it was jazzy and evocative and interesting, and most importantly, it worked. The voice acting was absolutely excellent. I don't believe an English dub exists, but I'm quite certain one would never do the original justice.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Each character in Kemonozume was portrayed uniquely in every aspect - not only scriptwise, but also through the art and voice acting. Each was distinctive in their own way, and developed adequately throughout the series.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Kemonozume undoubtedly does everything right for what it is - and it is a beautiful blend of fantastically absurd art and sound and a seemingly simple Romeo and Juliet-based story that deviates from the norm. It is refreshing and entertaining to watch, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who feels like something a bit different without having to delve into the realm of dementia. Not only is it an excellent anime it is, dare I say it, a piece of art.

          
 
       Helpful Three words. Piece of crap. 
 
Thought I should give more balance on this load of shit for all you anime watchers out there so here it is. It might give you another point of view from a reviewer who didn't give it a 9 or a 10. 
 
First of all, beware of brain cell damage after watching this anime! 
 
Overall art: 
 
I understand some people are into this but c'mon man, looks like everyone's been run over by a train. Too many distortions and un-proportional animation. Movement angle's all wrong. You can argue that it matches the style of the dark-themed storyline, but the last four episodes look like they plain gave up on common sense whatsoever. That is, unless you enjoy watching ugly heads dancing around, WTF. 
 
Story: 
 
If you enjoy romance that consists of nothing but sex, then this might be your anime to watch. Have to warn you though, the sex scenes aren't even that good- unless having sex with ugly looking monsters turn you on. 
 
The plot is poorly developed. This guy finds sex with a monster and runs of with her. They have sex.Things happen back home. They have more sex. More, boring, things happen back home. They continue to have sex.  
 
They somehow manage to find time from all that sex to destroy a crazy maniac.  
 
Romance my ass. 
The END. 
 
Overall: 
 
Sometimes shit is created with a constipated attempt to seem mature and deep. Some people interpret it as more than it is, and think it to be genius. This is one of those occasions. 
 
If you're trying to dim the lines between what is human and what is monster, then writing about how both human and monster are lustfilled idiots who kill each other is not the way to go. If you're writing romance then give me at least one scene where it doesn't involve sex, PLEASE.  
 
So, yeah. Do not recommend.

          
 
       Helpful To be honest I've been searching some anime non-school-hero-like behaviour. Still this anime comes out with a ""special"" art technique, actually I disliked art a lot, but this thing allowed to hide R+ to a simple R which I appreciated a lot.  
 
Plot is flat, but is there a way to show it other way? Main character (Toshihiko) meets mind-blowing blonde (Yuka) and falls in love instantly. Anime is about difficulties young couple face when literally all people surround you do not support such relations and how they(couple) deal with such life troubles. 
 
Love, lies, troubleshooting and strong will, that's all you should know before watching it.

","- Achievement Unlocked : Completing a Shoujo anime with 76 episodes! -  
 
Marmalade Boy began off as a decent typical Shoujo, Drama and Romance anime. But as time passes, it just got more and more boring from the over usage of the same old cliche we see every time in Shoujo anime. The notable ""Love Triangle"" ( A romantic relationship involving three or more people ). 
 
Honestly, if this show had lesser episode. It could've been better. Okay, okay, I like the idea of having many episode so watchers won't get bored. However. The con of having TOO many episode is if the production can't keep the watchers entertained. Their show is doomed. 
 
..Well, I wouldn't say I totally hate the show. Despite the old ass animation, voice, music and art. Because I'm a Shoujo, Drama and Romance lover. I find this anime an ""average"" show that doesn't really got to my expectations nor below it. In conclusion, it's all right.  
 
Uh, anyways.. The anime was alright overall.. Watch this if you like a lot love triangle. That's it. I'm done. End of review. 

          
 
       Helpful so the truth this is my first review even though I have been watching anime pretty much since I was borne so tell if I need to change anything 
 
Story 10/10  
 
the truth is that when I saw the first episode of this anime I was completely shocked because of how unique the plot was, this story is basically about Miki koichikawa this girl suddenly gets her world turn around when her parents suddenly came home that day and happily said to her that they were going to basically switch partners with the matsuura family, and as if that was not bad enough the other family has a son of her same age, who enjoys teasing 24/7 but the truth that only she knows is that she is actually in love with the young boy, to tell you the truth at first I though that it was going to be the typical sibling forbidden love but it was the opposite even though is true that they do not say anything till the end from their parents they do not really mind showing themselves in public and must of their friends find out what they feel for each other not that far from when the show starts. 
 
Art 9/10  
because this is a pretty old show the art is not as good as an 2019 show but the art is not bad actually when you see how old it is, it is actually really good the truth is that the art is pretty classic which makes me get more into the show and also it does a good work with the romantic scenes, background talking, so actually I would not be able to imagine this show in other type of art. 
 
Sound 9/10 
 
sound is something that i have been wanting to talk about because most people say that the music of this show is not that remarkable, I actually say is true that the endings are not that interesting but I really really enjoyed the opening of the series, I felt like the music really showed the roller coaster of emotions both characters are feeling. 
 
Character 10/10 
well the truth is that this characters are really good for the way the story, Miki is a really main character because basically the anime shows all of her emotions and thoughts referring to yuu, also the other way around yuu is a character even though he shows explicitly his emotions with his actions the story also lets him share his thoughts and emotions, though I would say that  I laughed the most with their parents who keep leaving them alone and do not have a singe care in the world. 
 

          
 
       Helpful MY OVERVIEW: 
 
 
Miki Koshikawa is a high-school girl looking for a change of pace in her life. Little did she know that as soon as she had entertained this thought her parents were downstairs conspiring to reveal something that she would not have expected in her wildest dreams. They had met another couple and are going to switch partners with them. 
 
Yes, you heard me, switch partners. 
 
Miki is entirely against this and will not stand for it. Hearing that they have a son of their own a new hope emerges. She will have someone to assist her who disagrees with this situation entirely. 
 
Boy, was she wrong. 
 
Not only does Yuu not mind what is happening but he is completely cruel to Miki, playing jokes and making fun of her at every chance he gets. Or at least that's what she initially thinks until she realizes that the Yuu is really like.. Marmalade on burnt toast???!? 
 
Now they all live in the same house together but they will go through a lot of trials and tribulations in relationships, both family and personal, as they go through daily school life together with other characters such as Ginta, Arimi, Satoshi, Satomu, Meiko, Natchan, Kei, Suzu and later in the series The American Crew. Who will end up with who, that is the question? 
 
There is way too much that goes on within the series to describe it in words. 
 
 
PERSONAL OPINION: 
 
Once you watch this anime you will never look at another Shoujo/Romance/Drama the same way again. It may have been a couple of years since I completed the series but ever since that day I have not been as entertained by many romance based anime simply because the standards Marmalade Boy has set are too high. I'm completely serious, if you are a fan of this genre and you haven't seen this it is the most entertaining experience you will have. 
 
Whilst there are lots of different things happening at any given time it never becomes overly confusing and the story is generally entertaining with something that happens at the end of an episode that makes you want to tune in the for the next one. Kind of like a Soap Opera setup. 'Tis good stuff. It's not too difficult to follow but at the same time isn't mind numbing. 
 
Some say the Soundtrack has got a 80's or 70's feel to it (after-all it is an anime made in the 90's), I say its pure bliss. The tracks are astounding. They suit the mood perfectly and I looked forward to every time my favorite tune played in the background. The opening theme, ""Egao Ni Aitai"" is upbeat and sets you up for a great time. The slow variations of this opening theme song throughout the anime are a great touch. I'm not going to say there aren't a few lackluster compositions but trust me, you will know what I mean by the amazing soundtrack once you watch it. 
 
Miki is my favorite female character in any anime. She had childish traits yet she comes across to be a genuine, nice and sweet young lady. Yuu is my favourite male character in any anime. He is a nice guy and likes to make fun of Miki but at the same time letting her know that he cares for her. Ginta and Arimi are also both REALLY strong characters by the end of the series. Enough said? Might I also say that the character designs are REALLY good. 
 
 All the females look exactly like the character they are made to portray. Satoshi is kind of another version of Yuu but with a mullet :P He does have his differences but I won't go through them here. Miki and Arimi are simply cute and Meiko has a pretty but mature look going for her, closely reflecting their personality traits. 
 
Whilst I personally love the animation it is a little outdated because of the age of the anime. Although it takes a little getting used to I personally LOVE the style, especially how the characters look.  Don't let the animation quality deter you from the series solely on that though as you will come to appreciate it and even if you don't, the story and just the plain ROMANCE is worth the price of admission in itself. I think the style is really unique with nice colours and it's ultimately nice on the eyes to sit back and watch. If you take a look at various pictures from the art books you will see that they are still vibrant and appealing to look at even by today's standards. 
 
Some of the characters that may or may not have been in the manga can be annoying and a distraction from the main plot. This was the case for me when they were first introduced but it was something that I was willing to look over. This series is amazingly well dubbed and includes the talents of some of my favorite English voice actors (If not before, they are now). The sub also holds up strong.

I've gone to the near end of this anime (9/12 watched), haven't found any end for this tangled love story. Maybe the author want to continue the story in her manga and let the anime ends in a blank (a little bit disappointed though).

       Helpful Love is perhaps one of the most complicated feelings in the world. We may all have experienced sometimes in our lives. Whether it’s platonic, romantic, or parental, it’s something that humans feel because that’s who we are. As part of growing up, people learn to understand these feelings. Yet, there are also people who make stories out of their lives from such feelings, in ways that become so twisted and disjointed that they become scum. Welcome to Kuzu no Honkai, a show that gives the characters a chance to grow up. 
 
As a manga reader, I was already prepared although it’s easy to judge by the premise that the story itself will be saturated with drama. Ever heard of ‘friends with benefits’? That’s pretty much how the premise sounds like. In the beginning of the story, we learn quickly that Hanabi and Mugi are engaged in a “relationship” that seems like those of a happy couple. Yet deep down, both suffers from pain because they are in love with someone else and are only using each other to ease their pain. It’s not hormone that’s driving these young folks into engaging in sex but that they simply want to feel something rather than pain. I have to admit, a show like this definitely takes on a more mature approach at romance than your typical high school rom-com. Make no mistake about it, Kuzu no Honkai is an emotional story that deconstructs romance in many ways more than one. 
 
The character cast is small yet complex because almost every character has their own personal issues. Some are more complex than others as the show focuses on them in their own twisted stories. A primary example is Akane, the seemingly lovable teacher. Yet, as the story progresses, you’ll quickly learn that she isn’t exactly what appears to be. Fans could easily label her as a bitch in sheep clothing and hard to accept. It’s also relatable too as Akane is a type of character that can easily be encountered in real life. That’s what also makes this show more realistic than some others as Kuzu no Honkai demonstrates a lot of realism. Relationships draws a line between love and sex. Can sex lead to actual love? Or is it just sex? 
 
In the meantime, character relationships in the show deconstructs what you’ll find in most romance stories. Yes, there are love triangles but Kuzu no Honkai has characters that uses others to satisfy themselves. Hanabi and Mugi is one but many examples. We’ll also learn in the show of how childhood friends will take the risk of being rejected and hurt. The fact is, no one is really safe of being happy in this series. Happiness is more like an illusionary word in the world of Kuzu no Honokai. Even when certain truths are realized and confessions are made, it is the stone cold truth that brings in even more pain. It doesn’t fall for every circumstance in the show as some characters are more willing to accept reality. However, the truth is still there that makes character relationships in this series seem like a losing battle. That’s a tough pill to swallow. 
 
As you can imagine, the show is drama heavy with a lot of emotions. Jealousy, regret, greed, hopeful, mistrustful, fear, are just a few to name. Action has consequences and this show brings out the worst out of human behavior. Think about it really. Kuzu no Honokai translates to Scum’s Wish as the title references to one’s interest to satisfy their own desires. Most of the characters does this and is drawn by humans emotions. At the core of these emotions is love. However, this show deconstructs love and very few characters actually understands it. Or perhaps there is no real answer because everyone has different perceptions. Narumi (Hanabi’s homeroom teacher) is a rare example in this show where he accepts certain people for who they are even after learning the truth. Still, the truth can hurt doesn’t it? 
 
Yes, don’t expect much comedy or humor from Kuzu no Honkai. It occasionally throws in some comedy from time to time but the majority of the show retains its mature feel. Now, the anime portrays sex as what it is and believe me, there’s a decent amount of it. The manga even has more explicit scenes to illustrate its point. So in essence, this show is not designed for a younger audience but suitable for those looking into a serious yet twisted story. The word ‘love’ doesn’t fit in there as that word is more or less an illusion. Still, I am happy that the adaptation captured the general idea of the original manga. It sticks to its point without derailing from its coming of age feel while inserting human emotions. 
 
Lerche surprisingly did a fairly decent job at crafting the artwork. Character designs look mature especially for the adults such as Akane and Narumi. Ebato has that pure nature lady look that makes her desirable. However, Moca’s character design can be bothersome to get used to as she looks like a child being stuck in a mature world. Be aware that the show has a lot of fan service such as make out scenes, sex, and other suggestive innuendos. One thing I am impressed by the artwork is how there are certain scenes in the show that captures the characters’ expressions at fullest. It accomplishes this with a more detailed visual of their feelings but importantly makes them look impactful. 
 
Soundtrack and music retains a somber tone. It’s a drama heavy story so what else did you expect? It has a feel of melancholy throughout the series along with light instrumental OST. Music director Masaru Yokoyama (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans) does a fantastic job at the directing as expected. The OP and ED theme songs have some symbolism along with a drama-like tone. But in terms of voice mannerisms, this is where it gets sort of mixed. Characters such as Akane and Ebato are really hard not to feel attracted to with their mature voices. In the meantime, I have to mention again that Moca is a source of annoyance whenever she opens her mouth. 
 
Kuzu no Honokai is like walking into a world of twisted desires. It’s like going into a maze with endless doors and no way out. Behind every door is a truth or lie that brings anything but joy. However, I think the show does bring up a good point of showing the realism of love. Examples in this series can really happen to anyone and realistically, it does. It’s part of us being human as there’s no real answer to what love is. Or to put it simply…. 
 
Love hurts.

TLDR; Overall rating:  2/10 OR 8/10 
 
I will try and explain, as clearly as possible, the rationale behind the rating above, everything that this anime does right and wrong, and why you should or shouldn't watch it. 
 
Story:  
Kuzu no Honkai is a breath of fresh air, a new and unique romance-themed anime that will leave you speechless - just kidding. Kuzu no Honkai is a story about a group of kids playing house, featuring wishy-washy characters in that high school setting we all know and love. Apparently they're calling it seinen now.  
 
The basic premise consists of an intricate love triangle featuring a perpetually depressed flake of a girl, an emo boy-toy, a standard issue onii-chan, a cougar, a lesbian, and a loli. In episode 1, Person-X decides to have sex with Person-Y. Repeat this for 12 episodes with different combinations of X and Y and congratulations, you've finished this amazing series. 
 
Kuzu no Honkai is pretty much a hate-it-or-love-it kind of anime. The problem with this series is mainly how pretentious it appears to be. ""I'm 17 and I'm deep"" is the theme of the day. When I was in high school, the first and foremost thing on my mind was passing the university entrance exams. Relationships were important but I never forgot my priorities. Of course, that's only me, and you can't compare an anime to real life, but they wouldn't have made it a high school setting if they didn't want people to relate to it. I'll take the liberty to allude to Golden Time here: a similar romantic-themed anime placed in a university setting. For all its flaws, they at least they got that part right, and that made things a lot more real. Perhaps the setting is an unfair point of criticism, but the incredulity of it all was a dampening factor on my enjoyment of this series. 
 
What does this anime do right with the story? For starters, I find its openmindedness towards love quite commendable. Love knows no bounds in this anime: (low-key) incest, lesbianism, lolicon, student-teacher love. Phew! Raunchy stuff.  
 
 
 
Art: 
Average 2017 animu art. However, one interesting thing about the art is how closely it resembles that of a shoujo anime - the suffocating close-ups, the excessive blushing, the simplistic nature of the backgrounds, fluidity with transitions, etcetera. Unassuming at times, allowing the viewer to focus completely on the trainwreck unfolding in front of them. 
 
 
 
Sound: 
One redeeming quality of the anime is definitely its music. The one thing you'd expect from the music would be to compliment what you see on screen, as opposed to jarr/seem out of place, and that's what the music did here.  
 
 
 
Characters: (Minor revelations/spoilers, proceed with caution.) 
With the exception of Ecchan, pretty much everyone is a flake.  
 
Let's start with Hanabi. Supposed ""honour student"", has a thing for her onii-chan. Is fooling around with three different people at the same time in order to numb the pain of unrequitted love. Enjoys playing the victim card, is easily hussled into sex, and doesn't know how she feels 99% of the time about anything. 
 
Next, the emo boy-toy, who has such a bland personality that you wonder what women see in him at all. 
 
Third, we have a piano teacher who loves sleeping with underrage boys. And yet, Mugi the boy-toy enjoys perpetually jerking his little ding-dong to her, despite knowing what a tramp she is. Attraction to someone's looks is apparently called ""true love"" and entitles you to mope around 24/7 and wonder at how deep your life is.    
 
Fourth, we have a loli who is actually just a stuck up little bitch. Also an osananijimi who you know will lose just based the trope she represents. 
 
As you can see, there really is nothing likable about any of these characters and you can't really relate to any of them, owing to how bland and pretentious they are. There is no real character development either, apart from little revelations about each ones' true colours, which I don't really consider development. 
 
I can, however, appreciate that this anime has some stellar relationship development. The true strength of Kuzu no Honkai, for me, lies in its character interactions. I keep harping on this, but the roller-coster relationships that characters experience with each other is actually quite realistic, and would have felt a lot more relatable in a university/work life setting.    
 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
This anime does not provide an iota of feel-good enjoyability at all. You will feel discomfort, jealousy, cringe, and at times, even disgust. But you'll probably want to keep watching with a grotesque interest that you'd have watching a butcher cutting up a piece of meat. 
 
Overall: 
In the end, Kuzu no Honkai has its good points, but is a painful pill to swallow. Vaguely resembling a B-rate drama, if you derive any more enjoyment out of this than what you'd get from a cheap soap opera, I commend you.  
 
Depending on what parts of this anime you love or hate, you might end up calling this a 2/10 OR an 8/10. I recommend you watch and find out.

        Not the best art for an anime in 2019,  but the girls(figurines) are drawn in a very adorable art style, and I think it will have influence on the anime community.  The scenery is pretty repetitive and borrowed and its borderline a one room anime.  Art [7/10] 
 
      The audio was just the best,  and the OP and ED are quite catchy.

       Helpful 3rd time repost. 
 
Chō Kadō Gāru 1/6 or Over Drive Girl 1/6 an animated series taken from a manga created by a certain Oyster ( Whoever he is), frankly what I see was nothing more than a poor Japanize version of ""Toy Stories"" except that this was more for them Herbivores guys of Japan who also happens to be in the otaku business,  when I say ""Herbivores' that's a Jap's term for a single guy who either was a loser in life or jaz nothing interested in anythibg and jaz wanna live the life he wants. Anywayz, in this anime we see  Haruto Bōida fall in that category, a retard herbivore otaku, whose kind of girls he like were those can be found in anime or in games, and here is where Nona a hot chick in a jazzed up red space outfit come into the guy's life except she is 1/6th of the size of a normal human, and not only that as the episode progress we see newer girls coming into the guy's life like Belenore from the older version of the game world, Subaru Amanohara the martial girl from somewhere, Rū Hitoma the tank girl and Rindō and the genie Kusabi, all were purchase from some store owned by another equally retard otaku guy that has some beef with Haruto, by the name of Seijirō Kanmuri, whom I like to hate...Jaz unlike ""Toy Story"" there isn't a character around here that I like , in fact the story plot of this rely on the guy's relationship with female action figures  that have a life of their own and that was what studio Studio A-Cat does was just to keep our focuse on those action figures which also include the Black Nona and another Nona whose attire was white. Also, the series (both the anime and manga) basically promotes a kinda of  attitude that them real life Herbivores in Japan does where it's ok to live in a fantasy world, where it's just you and your fetishes , cu'z them girls in their 1/6th of their sizes and engages a kind of romance with a loser guy like Haruto was jaz damn stupid for the creator, Oyster and for the studio exec to choose this to have an anime adaptation. Frankly, in terms of watching this show one would feel like going in there to smack that retard loser Haruto in the face and burn up those moving dolls into ashes. TBH I have no doubt that this Oyster dude  himself is jaz one of those loser herbivore with a fetish of that of the character Haruto,  so, here were my rating for this anime: 
 
Story-Poor 3: The plot was just your usual harem based anime. 
 
Art-Good 7: That was for Nona's attire. 
 
Sound- Good 7: That was for the opening theme.  
 
Character- Poor 3: Jaz a retard otaku herbivore, who enjoys being at home, with his games and his moving figurines, that you would wanna give him a smack in face.  
 
Enjoyment-Poor 3: Cu'z the drama and romance were forced and the comedy was just too lame 
 
Overall- Pathetic 1: Cu'z generally speaking this was just like putting salt on the wound, where basically it adds more pain to Japan's dwindling population thanks to the mindset of this manga / anime original creator called ""Oyster"" for making such a dorky work.   

          
 
       Helpful The most underrated anime this season, a really enjoyable lighthearted comedy. 
 
I have no idea why this show is actually so low-rated. It's honestly one of the best shows airing right now. I actually feel sad if you miss out on this masterpiece. Which doesn't make sense because this show is all about otaku life and something I thought most anime fans would be able to relate to: figures and merchandise! A real diamond in the rough, this show is better than any of the other trash comedies airing right now. In these times where the anime industry is dominated with isekai plots and shounen giants, really good lighthearted shows are hard to find, they're all mostly highschool slice of life. This is a breath of fresh air and the best comedy airing this season. 
 
Its biggest flaw is also its greatest strength. The show heavily relies on 3D CGI in its animation, and god forbid anything 3D should be rated anything decent. I really liked the 3D CGI because the characters are figures, they're supposed to look mechanical. And honestly who even cares if they used 3D CGI if it looks good. But I guess some people aren't willing to take a chance on anything that's different.  
 
This is the show I look forward to watching the most which isn't a continuing season. I only wish it was longer. Probably another reason it isn't as popular is that it's only 12 minutes per episode. Although there have been some 12 minute-length anime which have done well in the past like tsurezure children, or even now, isekai quartet, people will tend to watch these shows less because of its length and it's unfortunate since it's a really good show. 
 
Story - 7 
A complete ripoff of toy story, just kidding haha. But it's a comedy so don't take it too seriously. I think people who watch comedies for the story are like people who fish in the desert. Whatever floats your boat. 
 
Art - 7 
Heavily uses 3D CGI but if you can get past that, animation is pretty fluid. Character designs are really nice as well for the figures, I can imagine myself buying them if they actually release figures for this show haha. 
 
Sound - 7 
Not amazing but also not bad. They make use of 8-bit music in some scenes where characters from RPG's appear which is nostalgic for some people who've played those games. I think it's nice they add those little fine touches here and there. 
 
Character - 9 
NONA A BEST! FIGHT ME! 
 
Enjoyment - 10 
I'm really enjoying this show so far. It's really moe. Maybe I like it more because I'm also a hobbyist. I find it fun to build and collect figures so I can relate more to this show. But the show is more of a comedy so really anyone should be able to enjoy it. 
 
Overall - 8 
A really underrated show and I hope it gets more popularity. Especially because I really really really want to buy a Nona figure haha

However, Homura Akemi feels that something is wrong with this unusually pleasant atmosphere—though the others remain oblivious, she can't help but suspect that there is more to what is going on than meets the eye: someone who should not exist is currently present to join in on their activities. 
 
 Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari  follows Homura in her struggle to uncover the painful truth behind the mysterious circumstances, as she selfishly and desperately fights for the sake of her undying love in this despair-ridden conclusion to the story of five magical girls. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Thriller']","In the fictional city of Mitakihara, Japan, a middle school student named Madoka Kaname and her best friend, Sayaka Miki encounter a small, cat-like creature named Kyubey. It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and mysterious magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey. Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe, an upperclassman at the same school who is also a magical girl. Noticing their indecisiveness on whether to become a magical girl, Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka along on her witch hunts so they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.However, after witnessing Mami's death at the hands of a witch, Madoka realizes the life of a magical girl is filled with suffering and pain. This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura, a veteran magical girl whose wish unintentionally caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers magical girls give up their souls to form Soul Gems, the source of their magic, and that when Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, magical girls are converted into witches. Sayaka decides to become a magical girl after learning that doing so would allow her to heal a young musician whom she admires. However, her classmate Hitomi Shizuki confesses her love to him first, causing Sayaka to become disillusioned and fall into an inescapable despair that turns her into a witch. Kyubey reveals to Madoka that he is of an alien race that has been harvesting the emotions of magical girls for centuries to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy, and thus stave off the heat death of the universe. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate. 
Madoka and Kyoko attempt to reverse Sayaka's transformation, but the plan fails and Kyoko is forced to sacrifice herself to allow Madoka to escape, leaving Homura as the only remaining magical girl. Following this, an extremely powerful witch known as Walpurgisnacht approaches the city. Homura attempts to stop it, but is defeated. She begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch when Madoka arrives. With the past month's events in mind, Madoka decides to become a magical girl and makes a wish to stop the creation of all witches in the past, present, and future. The paradoxical nature of her wish causes her to transcend into a godlike psychopomp, and establishes a new ""Law of Cycles"" in which magical girls are purified and disappear into a higher plane instead of becoming witches. A new reality, in which Homura is the only one who remembers Madoka, is formed. Homura vows to continue fighting in honor of Madoka and the world she cherished.
","I love the Madoka franchise. I had a great time watching this film. There's a lot to scrutinize here. My 7 is a high scoring. 
 
According to Urobuchi, ""Rebellion"" has nothing to do with the anime TV series. Seeing as it is, though, a sequel to the recap films it is up to debate whether this film is even canonical or not. Rebellion asks for a lot from viewers. It questions older fans by ""severing"" itself from the main series and develops Urobuchi's central themes in some unconventional ways. Simultaneously it begs the fanbase of the original series to follow along a confusing and often far-flung narrative in a new and possibly pretentious direction. Due to the position ""away"" from the TV series Urobuchi has asserted it leads me to believe that this film is both a belaboring of past concepts and strengthening of a young franchise whilst torpedoing into more abstract territory. Luckily though, the film rarely breaks into feeling dishonest about it's content. As it seems to set the stage for more Mahou Shoujo in the future, it is my opinion while this is not a masterpiece it certainly is a milestone achievement and should be watched. The Mahou Shoujo series may eventually become the centerpiece of Urobuchi's philosophy, and with the help of Shinbou Akiyuki may become a stylistic anime classic. 
 
Let me begin with the ending. Rebellion quickly draws huge and obvious comparisons to The End of Evangelion for it's confusing and jumbled close. Unlike The End of Evangelion though there is extremely little closure. Most of the finale of the film is actually slightly incomprehensible. Sure, we as fans can try and decipher the meaning behind some of the films closing events but we really know nothing definitive yet. The film is rarely abstract in the sense of interpretation, but deals heavily in abstractions. While usually this is a misstep by writers that end up writing conclusions exerting self-importance, Urobuchi manages to keep us feasting on his heroines' misfortune. The difference between the two movies deemed the ""deconstructions"" of their respective genres though is that End of Evangelion reaches a catharsis that was underlying since the first episode. Anno's vehicle for explanation, Shinji, uses his movie time finally deciding whether it is best to live or die, much like Homura.  Shinji's decision did not bring into question anything that was previously canonical, and strengthens the finale thematically. The ultimate flaw here was that by having Homura choose life in the final scene of the film, it is corrupting the original narrative slightly. 
 
Madoka's TV series ending was of course up to interpretation, but it was clear that Akemi Homura was in a powerful love with Kaname Madoka. By having Homura pull Madoka back into the plane of physical beings it springboards a lot of questions about their relationship. Has Homura forsaken her love for Madoka and turned it into a lust? Are we supposed to believe that her succumbing to absence of Madoka put her under so much strain that she would snap? Did her life truly become so dependent on Madoka that she would do anything to keep her around? And if that last question is true, why would Homura want to become the embodiment of evil by theoretically killing God? The hardest to understand is Madoka here, who despite being a God at this point does little to vocalize her opinion of what Homura is doing. The end of the film is a massive cliffhanger. The film does promise more great work, but it does not do what it claims to have been doing. It does not provide a conclusion, neither thematically to the series nor definitively to the story. It leaves much to understand about Madoka and her power as a deity, and about Homura. We understood that Homura was miserable but how does she feel now? The conclusion is steeped in massive mystique, and despite delivering a wonderful character study, seems a bit too convenient. 
 
What do I mean? There's a lot of convenience in this film in the narrative aspect, and it's often glossed over. There's a huge amount of content to unravel here, so it makes sense that not everything is explained, nor am I demanding it is. But there are certain plot points that just seem strikingly convenient - Why is Nagisa hidden the whole time as Bebe? If it was to not attract too much attention to the fact her memories had been altered, why wasn't it still simply obvious enough that Bebe was an extremely strange entity? Why were Charlotte and Sayaka chosen as the witches to guide Homura to Madoka? And the biggest question of all, why did Kyuubey and the Incubators care so much as to push Homura's Soul Gem to the limit? And didn't this twist seem rather non-sequitur? How did we get from the ending of the TV series where Homura was, to this ""world in world"" maze? Without explaining these things, the boundlessness and confusing nature of the Sci-Fi aspect in the Mahou Shoujo series seems to dwarf the tragedy aspect and make it harder to sympathize with. If the film aimed to create less ""twist moments"" we wouldn't be left with so many blatantly unexplained plot points and often paradoxical content.  
 
But that's part of the fun of Madoka too! I mean it! The Mahou Shoujo series is butt-clenchingly entertaining! It's fun to try and follow the zany twists and turns of the labyrinth-like film, even to the point where paradoxes occur. The ultimate themes from Urobuchi transcend the narrative content, and he explains them in an outrageous manner: Selfishness vs. Selflessness, the tragedy of losing a loved one and it's aftereffects, and the paradoxical nature of human love... Urobuchi has created a work of art that is worth trying to understand. He's vocalized his most honest feelings about these topics, and he's done so believably! And through the mouths of 15-year-old girls! Even if this wasn't the closure you were hoping for after episode 12, this is certainly just as exciting. It's a writer really putting himself on the line, questioning his diehard fanbase by challenging them with new questions and innovating and debunking all sorts of anime cliches. He is doing something unexpected yet not contrary. How easily he could have put this series to rest. It may be convenient that Homura's motives are up to question at the end of the film, but thankfully it means more work from a great writer who loves what he is doing. 
 
Also remember this film is about Homura. Is Sayaka the lead? No. Is Kyouko the lead? No. Is Mami the head? Hue. The other characters remain mostly static in the film, but that is okay. We have to remember that the other characters technically weren't even in this film. It's a one-man and one Incubator and one God show. 
 
As for the animation, Shinbou Akiyuki really out does himself here, and the age-old complaint regarding Studio SHAFT's budget can be completely ignored. This movie has the production and innovative genius to outshine most all animated films before it. The use of stop-motion, interpretive setting, and distinct and disturbing imagery all help catapult this film leagues ahead of it's contemporaries. It's an ambitious thing, this direction. The sparsity and seemingly obsessively exact backgrounds leave each shot a photograph. And by the time the film has reached it's second half the quick cuts bring powerful imagery together by linking each frame. Even without dialogue this film would have an incredible visual narrative. I'd like to praise a particular moment when Madoka descends into Homura's maze and there's a rapid blast of shots showing the two together. An ethical tour-de-force brought on by the cunning direction. Not only a visual treat, it's a visual feast. The cinematography is outstanding, especially for an animated film. And by the time you get to the transformation sequences, you're very aware that SHAFT is simply showing off. I love it. 
 
The original soundtrack draws on it's predecessors heavily, and for the most part uses that incredible score to liven and darken the mood. The new arrangements are all on par, not a tune out of place. Or should I say all but one. The Round Cake song. It's charming and gleeful, but at the same time... I definitely haven't been so disturbed by the series at any other point in the film. Good work keeping me baffled, SHAFT. The opening and ending songs were both nice. It seems SHAFT decided to play it safe in an experimental film and use the same bands to open and close. It's nice for a nostalgic effect but really these two songs add nothing of value to the film, as opposed to The End of Evangelion where Tumbling Down is the emotional height of the film. The soundtrack is still very strong, but the ""dark"" pop of Kalafina at the close gave a highly artificial feel. I don't even think the end of the film needed music. 
 
So should you watch Rebellion? Absolutely. It's a movie that is going to get a lot of buzz, and not simply in the anime community. It's a strong film, and joins the ranks of other baffling anime films like The End of Evangelion and Adolescence of Utena. It leaves a lot to chew and can be re-watched several times and still feel fresh. Though it remains a confusing piece of history in the Mahou Shoujo series, it will no doubt be an important pivot in Urobuchi Gen's canon of writing. 

          
 
       Helpful I love the Madoka franchise. I had a great time watching this film. There's a lot to scrutinize here. My 7 is a high scoring. 
 
According to Urobuchi, ""Rebellion"" has nothing to do with the anime TV series. Seeing as it is, though, a sequel to the recap films it is up to debate whether this film is even canonical or not. Rebellion asks for a lot from viewers. It questions older fans by ""severing"" itself from the main series and develops Urobuchi's central themes in some unconventional ways. Simultaneously it begs the fanbase of the original series to follow along a confusing and often far-flung narrative in a new and possibly pretentious direction. Due to the position ""away"" from the TV series Urobuchi has asserted it leads me to believe that this film is both a belaboring of past concepts and strengthening of a young franchise whilst torpedoing into more abstract territory. Luckily though, the film rarely breaks into feeling dishonest about it's content. As it seems to set the stage for more Mahou Shoujo in the future, it is my opinion while this is not a masterpiece it certainly is a milestone achievement and should be watched. The Mahou Shoujo series may eventually become the centerpiece of Urobuchi's philosophy, and with the help of Shinbou Akiyuki may become a stylistic anime classic. 
 
Let me begin with the ending. Rebellion quickly draws huge and obvious comparisons to The End of Evangelion for it's confusing and jumbled close. Unlike The End of Evangelion though there is extremely little closure. Most of the finale of the film is actually slightly incomprehensible. Sure, we as fans can try and decipher the meaning behind some of the films closing events but we really know nothing definitive yet. The film is rarely abstract in the sense of interpretation, but deals heavily in abstractions. While usually this is a misstep by writers that end up writing conclusions exerting self-importance, Urobuchi manages to keep us feasting on his heroines' misfortune. The difference between the two movies deemed the ""deconstructions"" of their respective genres though is that End of Evangelion reaches a catharsis that was underlying since the first episode. Anno's vehicle for explanation, Shinji, uses his movie time finally deciding whether it is best to live or die, much like Homura.  Shinji's decision did not bring into question anything that was previously canonical, and strengthens the finale thematically. The ultimate flaw here was that by having Homura choose life in the final scene of the film, it is corrupting the original narrative slightly. 
 
Madoka's TV series ending was of course up to interpretation, but it was clear that Akemi Homura was in a powerful love with Kaname Madoka. By having Homura pull Madoka back into the plane of physical beings it springboards a lot of questions about their relationship. Has Homura forsaken her love for Madoka and turned it into a lust? Are we supposed to believe that her succumbing to absence of Madoka put her under so much strain that she would snap? Did her life truly become so dependent on Madoka that she would do anything to keep her around? And if that last question is true, why would Homura want to become the embodiment of evil by theoretically killing God? The hardest to understand is Madoka here, who despite being a God at this point does little to vocalize her opinion of what Homura is doing. The end of the film is a massive cliffhanger. The film does promise more great work, but it does not do what it claims to have been doing. It does not provide a conclusion, neither thematically to the series nor definitively to the story. It leaves much to understand about Madoka and her power as a deity, and about Homura. We understood that Homura was miserable but how does she feel now? The conclusion is steeped in massive mystique, and despite delivering a wonderful character study, seems a bit too convenient. 
 
What do I mean? There's a lot of convenience in this film in the narrative aspect, and it's often glossed over. There's a huge amount of content to unravel here, so it makes sense that not everything is explained, nor am I demanding it is. But there are certain plot points that just seem strikingly convenient - Why is Nagisa hidden the whole time as Bebe? If it was to not attract too much attention to the fact her memories had been altered, why wasn't it still simply obvious enough that Bebe was an extremely strange entity? Why were Charlotte and Sayaka chosen as the witches to guide Homura to Madoka? And the biggest question of all, why did Kyuubey and the Incubators care so much as to push Homura's Soul Gem to the limit? And didn't this twist seem rather non-sequitur? How did we get from the ending of the TV series where Homura was, to this ""world in world"" maze? Without explaining these things, the boundlessness and confusing nature of the Sci-Fi aspect in the Mahou Shoujo series seems to dwarf the tragedy aspect and make it harder to sympathize with. If the film aimed to create less ""twist moments"" we wouldn't be left with so many blatantly unexplained plot points and often paradoxical content.

       Helpful A summary of my opinions, if you don't want to read the actual review: 
-The plot is either nonexistent or straight-out dumb 
-The characters are even flatter than they were in the original 
-Homura, the only half-decent character, becomes an utter ideological shitstorm 
-Shaft has a giant fucking budget and really wants you to know 
-The art is not as cool as it should have been because it lacks thematic/symbolic backing 
-Rebellion is a pretentious acid trip of a movie 
 
 
 
Plot 
 
To be completely honest, Madoka Magica has never quite had a conventional plot. Instead things are stringed together with bits of loose thematics and messages that, at times, encapsulate well the insanity occurring. Rebellion spends no such effort, either on an overarching story or on themes.  
 
The vast majority of the movie presents no apparent storyline or structure to follow. Instead it flaunts its prodigious budget with meaningless scenes. Several moments could be considered ‘climactic’ or monumental to the story’s and characters’ progressions, but with so many happening they become drawn-out and bland. Instances do not relate and cannot be cohesively connected. Rebellion awards nearly every frame with some sort of immense philosophical translation, therein forming an unintelligible array of alternate meanings that don’t adhere to anything in particular. 
 
While Rebellion was supposed to have ‘tied up loose ends’ for Madoka’s unsatisfactory ending, in truth it complicated the situation with the lacking plot of the final section of the movie. Homura discovers that she in reality is comatose, the new Mitakihara City an alternate universe she had created. Yes, it does attempt to shove down your throat a ridiculous story, and one that doesn’t exactly add any sort of precision. An absurd quantity of bizarre visuals pertain to this one fragmented plot point? Seriously? It tries, but doesn’t succeed, to create relevance for the previous events of the movie.  
 
Characters 
 
Yay. Another horrible aspect of Madoka Magica; Rebellion. 
 
Evidently Homura is the main character - the movie is shown entirely through her perspective. This is to say, she’s the one who first realizes that shit is going on, and she’s the only one who actually aims to resolve the issue. All other characters are, while present, completely useless. 
 
Poor Homura endures something of a development, beginning as a naive, sensitive girl to the terror she ends up as. This is reminiscent to her progression during one specific episode of Madoka Magica, though executed far worse. Her entire character arc comes across as choppy; it doesn’t retain any of the same, well, sense. Homura constantly makes frenzied and downright awful decisions that never seem to reflect her strategic intelligence. Instead, her inconsistency contributes *shock factor* that doesn’t refer to her personality in the slightest, only the pretentious air Rebellion is determined to sustain.  
 
What about the other protagonists? Well, there’s an irrelevant Madoka, a violent Mami, a watered-down Kyoko, an especially incompetent Sayaka, and best of all, a random witch-girl who fulfills no legitimate purpose. To sum it up, all other characters are oblivious, shallow, and utterly futile. They exist only to perform exaggerated transformation scenes and gape in shock at all the bullshit Homura does. It really is impossible to ascertain what the girls know and don’t know, as Rebellion likes to ‘keep you on your toes’ with their motives. Even though it’s safe to assume that they realize absolutely nothing, being the most impervious 14 year-olds on the face of the planet. 
 
Animation & Sound 
 
Well gee. If it isn’t something positive I can say concerning this trainwreck. Shaft, surprisingly, did take advantage of one of its many assets and utilized their gargantuan budget once every 0.05 seconds. This is to say that Rebellion is incredibly appealing, as far as animation and art go. Visuals are fluid to a ludicrous degree, making action scenes remarkably interesting, even if nobody really cares how they end.  
 
Madoka Magica’s intriguing use of symbolism amidst witch labyrinths is lost, but optically mirrored, in Rebellion. It possesses the same, if not higher, level of asinine graphics. Coupled with the unabridged void of plot, characters, and general sense, one intense acid trip of a movie is formed. Basically, Shaft has the resources and lack of care to do whatever it wants, and does it.  
 
The sound isn’t especially noteworthy. It’s on par with the original Madoka, hence enticing, dark music and squeaky loli voices. Decent enough sound effects and background noise.

4,35413,14,10.14591914,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Imouto sae Ireba Ii.,"Itsuki Hashima is a light novelist obsessed with little sisters, strictly focusing on them when he writes his stories. Despite his personality, he is surrounded by a tight circle of friends: Nayuta Kani, a genius yet perverted novelist who is in love with him; Haruto Fuwa, a fellow male author whose work has seen considerable success; Miyako Shirakawa, a good friend that he met in college; and Chihiro, his perfect younger step-brother who takes care of the housework and cooking. 
  
Together, they play strange games, go on spontaneous journeys, crack silly jokes, and celebrate each other's successes. However, each individual must also deal with their own issues, whether it is struggling to meet a deadline or coming to terms with traumatic events buried in their past. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance']","The story follows the novelist Itsuki Hashima who is surrounded by various people, including a beautiful genius writer who loves him, a big-sisterly college classmate, a fellow male writer, a sadistic tax accountant, and his editor. As the story progresses, the underlying conflicts of dreams and goals surface, as each character attempts to achieve their dreams, in their own way. One such example is the rivalry between author Itsuki and his friend Haruto. Itsuki's stories are driven by a passion for stories about little sisters with praise from a selective yet strongly supportive fan-base, whereas Haruto's stories are driven by victory and romance through more common, yet popular cliches. Each of their stories are riddled with common light novel themes and concepts, such as romantic comedy elements and erotic illustrations. They are all looked after by Itsuki's younger ""brother"" Chihiro, who in fact is his younger stepsister.
","Disclaimer: I do not have any problems with fanservice. It's just that the fanservice in this anime is not executed well and detracts from the better parts of the show. 
 
 
Imouto Sae Ireba Ii is an anime that excels in what it shouldn't excel in and fails at what it should succeed in. What a normal person would expect out of an anime like this is minimal storytelling and plenty of raunchy scenes full of little sisters. However, there are no little sisters to be found, and instead the view is given a minimal yet powerful and melancholic overarching story and fanservice scenes that feel overdone and boring, providing nothing else besides fap material.  
 
Story - The plot in this anime is practically non-existent with there being a basic premise and fun hijinks between college-aged friends. Despite this, individual episodes have the capacity to give off a melancholic yet beautiful vibe. On the other hand, there are fanservice episodes that give no effort whatsover and that beg for the viewer to buy a BD. These two balance out to a 5.  
 
Art - It's pretty good and the girls are cute.  
 
Sound - BGM is upbeat and fun, the OP is pretty good, and the voice acting is good. Nothing much else to say.  
 
Character - Like the story, the characters can be generally split between fanservice and melancholic. Miyako and Fuwa particularly pull at the heartstrings at times as they realize that they're missing something that Kanikou and Itsuki have. Kanikou and the manga girl are lackluster, on the other hand. However, unlike the story, the Characters are generally better with even the fanservice characters having decent development.  
 
Enjoyment -  Once again, the fanservice/melancholy dichotomy comes into play here. The enjoyment of the show shoots up when the writing really delivers, but is canceled out a week later when a meaningless episode made to make blood rush to the lower body airs. But hey, if you love that kind of stuff and like good character development here and there, enjoyment would be an easy ten.  
 
Overall - As said above, this show is for people who crave fanservice. Its excessive nature at times will deter possible viewers away, especially in the first episode. However, if you are willing to endure this, you are in for a real treat. Tissues may or may not be needed. 

          
 
       Helpful First, if you haven't watched ... skip to 1:42 of the first episode, you will probably thank me. 
 
The series isn't a Bakuman for Light Novel authors, but it gives you a good approach at the industry and allows you to learn about how things go in their ""normal"" days. 
 
I put this series on hold, some weeks ago, but then against my better judgement gave it another chance and I'm kind of glad that I did, the enjoyment from the first part of the series wasn't much so I put it on hold, but ...  
 
I rewatched ep 4 and went with 5 instantly, the 4th was funny but it was the same as the other, but ep 5 was super interesting and you can see how the mind of an author works, then ep 6 was even better a really strong episode, I would even say it was the best of the series (Haruto turned to be my favorite character)... and ep 7 happened, it was rising really good my interest and then a full 100% fanservice episode, it made me remember why I put on hold the series, the rest of the episode were interesting too, but they had the same faults, going up and then down between episodes and even in the same episode.  
 
in the specific section: 
the story isn't something out of this world, we have our average harem protagonist ""in college"" (well...), at least that is something more new. He's a novelist (works in light novels, *cough eromanga-sensei *cough) and has a big ass fetish on imoutos (little sisters), but he doesn't have one, instead he has a ""trap"" little bro that really cares for him. He isn't that bland as a protagonist, he has some complex (it's a japanese series so you can easily guess what's going to be), with just one day he can grew hair really fast, it's not a bad one, but I wouldn't call him the best MC of the season.  
 
the series goes for the slice of life with a tint of gags each chapter that makes you think it's a 4-koma (seitokai yakuindomo), but the series is based on a LN, it has a manga adaption in neither of them have that style, so it tends to feel really flat when overused each chapter and it was used every single episode, it also has a side A and B of stories, that one tends to be a tabletop games and that trust me, are pretty funny most of the time, except ep 7 that went too far though, but most of the time they don't give you much detail in the characters, but I would probably play with friends some of them. 
 
art isn't bad, music isn't bad, OP is fine, ED is great, and they have a little music to announce each chapter that is pretty nice, and appears from time to time each episode (the same as with the gags, it can be easily overused, and probably will -and it was-). 
 
characters are pretty much stereotypical, but ochinchin girl is cute and except for the boxers scene, she's charming and she kept her style all season, you can love her or like her (and you can notice the original author fetish *cough nun dress *cough), she doesn't get annoying. already talked about the MC, the best friend got his episode and he used pretty well, since ep 6 I really liked each time he appeared and how he acted was the most realistic one of the bunch, he's pervy too, he can fall in love, he isn't dense, feel envy, sadness, joy and complements pretty well the MC and it's good that he's there so he doesn't have to monologue as other protagonist.  
 
this series is pretty much binary, you like it or you don't ... I don't know how I found me in the middle and kind of glad I did, but if you can put up with the innecesary fanservice and want to know more about the characters in another LN adaptation of the creator of Haganai, do it, it's on your own risk.

          
 
       Helpful ""But wait! There's more, really!"" 
 
Yeah, like everyone here I agree that the first few quotes of this series are incredibly off-putting, if not at least polarizing. 
 
BUT, after buckling down and watching the first few episodes, I've come to really enjoy the shameless cast because they aren't afraid of who they are. They're dynamic, they feel real, and the relationships are relatable. For those of us who know nothing of the writer's profession, this is also a pretty nice peek into that. 
 
This is an example of a finely written slice-of-life. There are no action scenes; the humor isn't all ecchi; in fact, most of the humor isn't roll-on-the-floor-funny. BUT (yes, but), you'll keep watching. Why? Because the show is well-put together, the writing can be witty, and the show will very subtly get you invested in the cast. Before you know it, you've finished S1. 
 
TECHNICALITIES: Animation is a solid 8. The music reminds me of Oregairu, so a solid 9. Watched subs first which was good, then dubs which was GREAT because of the voice actors. Ended on a cliffhanger so eagerly looking forward to S2.

","My first review so i am gonna keep it short :) A bit of spoilers* 
This Anime series takes the elements of Classical Shakespeare Story of Romeo and Juliet from a manga by Kaneda Yousuke , with the story of the two main characters Persia Juliet and Inuzuka Romio belonging to opposite factions ""The White Cats"" and ""The Black Dog"", who fall for each other and have to overcome difficulties on a daily basis to keep their relationship a secret from their factions and maintaining it while achieving their common goal which is achieving peace between the two factions and change the world while developing and working on their relationship. 
 
The story is a mix of your generic Highschool romance and Comedy, also throwing in some serious moments at times and adapting elements of ancient time traditions and culture as its derived from the classical romeo and Juliet. 
Characters: 
Inuzuka Romio : A strong minded Mc with an angry,stubborn mindset at times, can be dense and clumsy. but caring for others and also most importantly honest and strong headed, also possess qualities shown time to time which is refreshing to see. 
 
Persia Juliet : A smart, skilled and a maiden figure, who leads by example, has a shy and loving, caring nature and wants to change the world starting by peace between the rival factions.  
 
Hasuki : Inuzuka's Childhood friend who is cheerful, smart, and really caring for the faction members and especially inuzuka and possesses many qualities to be one of the best girls. 
 
Char: Persia's friend who shows a dominating and sadistic side on the outside mostly but is really caring for Persia and in a way obsessed over her.  
There are more side characters too but have not stand out that much till now.  
 
Art: Studio LINDELFIELDS have done a really great job in terms of animation, keeping it Bright and colourful , great work in the detailing of the drawings, especially as many of the scenes contain old school type of buildings, romantic scenes and views.The depiction and presentation of an old school scenario where the series is taking place can actually be felt and it goes well with elements of the story.  
Music and soundtrack : Not much to discuss there but the background tracks are pretty well done, considering it blends well with the scenes in the anime. The Intro and outro songs are sung by well known artists Fripside and riho lida which are pretty good.  
 
Finally i would just like to say this is again a rom com series with a adaption of romeo and juliet a classic. if you like something to sit back relax and enjoy, with a bit of drama and emotional touching scenes with the main element of romance and comedy, then this anime is really worth the watch.

          
 
       Helpful A Romeo and Juliet love story re-interpretation that is actually good. No seriously. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet takes a Romeo and Juliet story, add in a harem that makes ""some sense"" for the main couple and combine all that with the basis of Romeo and Juliet's family dispute to a school setting, as much as these statements makes it out like cliche, but it's in the details. 
 
Our titular Romeo and Juliet are taking place in Dahlia Academy Boarding School where there are two rivaling countries known as the White Cats where our Juliet Persia voiced by Ai Kayano is factioned where as the Black Doggies is where Romio Inzuka voiced by Yuuki Ono is factioned. Romio and Persia both drives the plot forward, with Romio having a crush on Persia since childhood and wanting to help Persia to change society but their relationship is taboo in the eyes of the school to say the least. Persia trying to keep their relationship a secret and seeing both sides of society so she can change society and in a ways grow their relationship through it as well. 
 
Now the anime has a harem aspect, mainly with the harem element focusing on Romio and most of the time they are either allies or rivals turn support characters, like Hasuki Komai voiced by Ayane Sakura, Romio's childhood friend, Weslia Chartreux voiced by Yuu Shimamura being Persia's childhood friend and finally Teria and Kochou Wang voiced by Yui Ogura and Rina Hidaka as Black Doggy Prefects. Now Hasuki and Weslia probably gets the most development for the harem element as they aren't stereotypical childhood friends THOUGH they go through the same dilemma especially for Hasuki however Weslia gives us something unique especially towards her relationship with Persia making her actions rather unpredictable throughout the anime making things interesting, Hasuki is undyingly loyal to Romio unfortunately she goes through the typical childhood friend dilemma just under differing circumstances. Kochou and Teria however arrived a bit too late and get one focused episode in which they become an obstacle for Romio trying to get a date with Persia go awry. Nonetheless the harem aspect might be tacked in, nonetheless Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does make good use of it. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is best when it looks into Romio and Juliet's growth as a couple and heck even using the harem aspect to show differing aspects of Romio and Persia through their strengths and weakness about themselves, like Romio sacrificing his desire for the happiness of others, Persia's desire of changing the school through their relationship as a linchpin to see both sides of the White Cats and Black Doggies, but for both wanting them to grow their relationship to further both their goals to change the world as a result and because of that, strengthening the main couple further. Because of this, LA sees Persia as LA's favorite character in the series, with Hasuki being a close second and Weslia third. 
 
In terms of animation done by LIDENFILMS, the animation quality from the backgrounding was pretty decent, the character designs are polished and detailed throughout the anime and the few battles are decent as well due to the decent sword choreography but tends to do moving still speedlines at times. To say the least LA feels like the character designs are the best part of the animation, as most of the characters look exotic and distinct even in uniform!. LIDENFILMS did decently overall. 
 
In terms of voice acting, LA will say that voice work was very well done, from Ai Kayano to Yuu Shimamura to Ayane Sakura. The majority if not all the voice cast was pretty well handled. LA LOVED Ai Kayano as Persia but Ayane Sakura as Hasuki was just meant to be, while Yuu Shimamura just owned as Weslia with her intentionally smarmy trickster ojou cadence. It's also been a while since LA saw an anime where Rina Hidaka and Yui Ogura were in the same anime AND both being twins at that. Yuuki Ono also did pretty well as Romio and Hiroshi Kamiya as Scott Fold. LA loved this voice cast to say the least. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does have the notion if the names of the characters are anything to go by and that is of the ""White Cats"" , ""Black Doggy"", Romio and Juliet, Persia, Scott Fold, Hasuki...yes the rivalry countries have their own social hierarchy because of it. The White Cats are aristocrats and work off that notion, they also represent the West, right down to their Western regal attire and mannerisms, while the Black Doggy represent the East, many characters having Japanese names at that and also wearing Japanese school attire. It goes deeper when we see the White Cats and Black Doggy's hierarchy and how they function...LA doesn't know LA really liked that dynamic and how Persia herself wants that to change as a result. 
 
However Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet has some flaws through all this however which LA DOES need to mention. LA brought up Hasuki having the childhood friend dilemma as well as the many cliches that has the harem elements, BUT as much as Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet does follow many cliches of the harem genre, Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet still does it's cliche WELL and better yet uses it's cliches to better the main characters and the harem themselves making the majority of the characters likable and memorable. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet's cliche though they use it well it is nonetheless using cliche and that might annoy some people, not to mention the fanservice of Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet gets extremely risky though that is only happens once, but LA will defend the fanservice as they use it sparingly. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet's flaws does have it's flaws but alot of defense to outweigh it all. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet's finale does have similarities to the classic Romeo and Juliet though through the typical famous event and if your wondering, the finale does the ""read the light novel"" type ending but not in a unsatisfied way as the finale does make Romio and Persia go through hurdles and hurdles in order for them to keep their lie hidden harder and harder and almost exposed and to progress to their ultimate goal of changing the world and with all the tension to this finale and really with how this finale resulted in, well LA was satisfied by it even with this ""read the light novel"" type ending, a resolution from both main focused characters and a somewhat good climax. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet for LA was a pretty well done retelling of the classic Romeo and Juliet story but taken to anime standards. Sure Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet has lots of typical flaws that the harem genre it entails but nonetheless Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet's strengths definitely outweigh all this, from the likable relationship of Romio and Juliet and it not being the relationship being the sole focus as both Romio and Persia grow individually with the harem elements added in and through the harem, they too grow with them be it if they know of Romio and Persia's relationship or not especially with Hasuki and Weslia, thus incorporating it's harem elements well. Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet may be a typical harem anime just with the Romeo and Juliet setting, but man was it done well and one of the more surprisingly good harem anime of Fall 2018 but also good romance anime as well.

          
 
       Helpful Romeo and Juliet the name is no stranger to us, right? yes they are a pair of young brides who love each other but his love does not go smoothly and is opposed by his family. Romeo Juliet himself has a variety of storylines ranging from sadness and end to happiness. 
 
Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet tells of two young couples namely Persia Juliet and Inuzuka Romio who have secretly established love relationships. Series adapted from ""Manga"" written by Kaneda Yousuke is very interesting because it takes the legendary romantic story of Romeo and Juliet not surprised many spectators were deeply moved, and wrapped in comedy elements that made the audience laugh out loud making this RonCom series became popular among teenagers. 
 
Nowadays, technology has begun to evolve rapidly as time goes by, anime began to develop in terms of depiction and graphic design. This series takes the story of antiquity where ancient buildings have their own charm. Color selection in this case also has a very significant effect. the action that makes this series even better the process of drawing an action-themed series is difficult because it requires more frames to come out and this series is already good in its drawings, but what makes this more interesting is the depiction of ancient times which makes it more realistic and has a characteristic distinctive. 
 
incomplete if the storyline and depiction techniques are good if not supported by good voice actors and music background. Studio LIDENFILMS brought Kayano Ai as the voice of ""Persia Juliet"" while the duo Oono Yuuki played the role of ""Inuzuka Romio"". Love With You sung by ""FripSide"" became the opening theme while the closing part was Itsuka Sekai no Kawaru made which was sung by ""Riho Lida"". 
 
In this series has the first three character play ""Persia Juliet"". Persia herself is a girl who wants to change the world for the better but the one who is the barrier is her little cook and the one she loves, ""Inuzuka Romio"". the nature of being angry, caring for others, and most importantly being honest. In the midst of their romance a girl who honestly likes Romio Inuzuka she is ""Komai Hasuko"" she is a cheerful and passionate girl who cares for her friends. 
 
the story of Romeo and Juliet is a romantic story that was legendary years ago until now with the Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet series that has a storyline that is a bit similar to the legendary story to honestly make some people carried away but unfortunately in this series it has no drama which is good but for some people it is good enough than the series that is full of drama and makes some people touched and full of emotion.

LOVE!,The older boys are graduating school and recount their memories together. The next day everyone defends the graduation ceremony against Zundar and Dadacha's Second Button Monster but Yumoto struggles using his love power.,"['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Magic', 'School']","The Earth Defense Club at Binan High School (Yumoto Hakone, En Yufuin, Atsushi Kinugawa, Io Naruko and Ryuu Zaou) who regularly attend a local bathhouse run by Yumoto's brother, are approached by a strange pink wombat-like being from another planet who charges them (rather involuntarily) with the task of saving the world. Using a set of ""Loveracelets"" he gives them, the group transforms into Battle Lovers (バトラヴァーズ, Batoravuāzu), who use the power of love to combat foes intent on spreading hate and discord. As they battle, they encounter the Earth Conquest Club under the influence of a small green hedgehog-like creature named Zundar; student council members Kinshiro Kusatsu, Ibushi Arima and Akoya Gero become their enemies who are also responsible for creating the monsters the Lovers fight.
","While listed as an OVA, it might be more accurate to describe LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! as an event anime, something we rarely see exported out of Japan. Originally screened at select theatres in August 2017, this just barely feature length final episode feels made for being watched in a room full of fellow LOVErs who know the songs, can quote the catch phrases & are probably just a wee bit drunk. 
 
But chances are you're not in a packed Japanese theatre, but sat at home, alone; hoping for one final adventure with the Battle Lovers. Does LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! provide this? Yes, but YMMV (oh & it's definitely not the place to start for newcomers). 
 
Because to reach the feature length needed to get theatrical screenings, it's fair to say they cheated a bit. Opening with the Battle Lovers playing hack sack & then chatting in the Kurotama bathhouse, it looks as though their final episode will be spent mostly soaking in the tub while shooting the breeze. 
 
Which would be fine, if what they talked about weren't the events of the previous two seasons. As the cast slowly gather at the bath, they reminisce about how they first met, then proceed to sing all (& I mean all) of their character songs one after the other. It is, as En glibly remarks, “that kind of episode,” consisting almost entirely of recycled footage & generally feeling like a glorified recap episode. Some of the new banter is fun, but unless you really like looped animations or were hoping for a karaoke session, it's bit of a tough watch. 
 
But just as frustration might be about to boil over, the real episode begins. It's Springtime for Hit...I mean Binan High School, & that means it's graduation day for everyone in the Earth Defence Club but Yumoto. Naturally, things don't go smoothly, as Zundar & Dadacha create one last monster, which the VEPPers, Conquest Club & Earth Defence Club must team up to defeat – though not in the usual way. Then it's on to the goodbyes, as the graduation ceremony finishes & Wombat returns to his home planet – not dying on the way. 
 
It's not the best episode of the series, but as a final goodbye to our favourite magical boys it's about as good as one could have expected, the only disappointments coming from PonyCam (who want you to know it's their 50th anniversary) not stumping up for a lavish production & the aforementioned slow, sing-along start. 
 
But maybe you do know the songs. Or maybe you have a group of LOVErs who can gather with optional but recommended alcohol to see the boys off with a sing song. If that's the case, you will have a very good time with LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! If you're just looking for one final episode, you'll find it; but you might have to skip the first 30 minutes to get there. 
 
Love Making!

          
 
       Helpful This OVA had made my cry. I started crying when the opening theme started and that made me cry throughout the ova. Even the ending theme song had made me cry a lot. This was a sad ova and to make even more sense, I had cried a lot and I will miss these boys. This is the first ova that made me cry. I really have strong feelings for this anime. Ever since March 2015, I had fallen in love with this anime and I really loved it so much it hit me right in the heart. I'm such a huge fan of animes with hotter guys and that made me so happy that I love boueibu so much that I have sronger feelings for it.

          
 
       Helpful I cry a lot. I'm a very emotional person. However, this OVA didn't really bring me to the point of tears, which was baffling for me. Usually, anything related to graduation in animes usually makes me cry. I'm one of the stupid people that's cried watching Winnie the Pooh.  
 
Regardless of the fact that it didn't even bring me close to tears, this OVA made me sad, and mostly in a good way.  
 
The story was pretty good. The nice recap at the beginning was cute, especially with the songs (which I will talk about later). I also really loved the real 'episode' later with Yumoto's reluctance towards his senpais' graduation and a real powerful monster for once.  
 
The art, as always, was pretty, neat, and nice to look at. No complaints there! The illustrations during the end credits were also gorgeous.  
 
Now the song-- this is where the songs come in. Each characters has a 'theme song' during which they recount some awesome shots of themselves over the past two seasons with hilarious lyrics to back it up. All the songs were relatable and made me laugh, making the first half of this OVA worth it, even if it did drag on a little bit. En's was hands-down the best one.  
 
The characters weren't really developed here, but we got to see more feelings than we usually do with this show, which was pretty nice. We also got a little bit of development for Yumoto, though as the protagonist, the other characters probably needed more than he did.  
 
Overall, I enjoyed this way too much.  
 
I would recommend this if you: liked either of the first two seasons, like a little closing episode, like gag songs 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like the first two seasons  
 
Have a great day everyone!

(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Historical']",none,"The adaptation the manga deserved. 
 
Just some context: Hi no Tori is a manga by the great Osamu Tezuka, who is unfortunately primarily known as the creator of Astro Boy. I say ""unfortunately"" because although Astro Boy may be a seminal work and an important stepping stone in the history of anime & manga, it does not come even close to rivaling the sheer brilliance and philosophical depth of Hi no Tori, which I would class as one of the ten greatest works of fiction I have come across. Anyway 2 adaptations had been tried before Hi no Tori: Houou-hen: the live action film Hi no Tori: Daybreak Chapter, and the loose anime adaptation Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, both of which I have had the misfortune of watching. Daybreak Chapter was directed by the usually fantastic Japanese auteur Kon Ichikawa in the low period of his career, the film itself being his nadir, for its cringeworthy effects and unconvincing performances. Ai no CosmoZone is just a pathetic attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the manga which is not worth discussing any further. After these two failed attempts, the sometimes great Rintaro stepped onto the scene and delivered what would be, to this day, the best adaptation of Hi no Tori. 
 
Hi no Tori: Houou-hen itself near-perfectly captures every element that made the manga so awesome. It recreates the wonderment of the original story as well and the intense feeling you get deep in your gut as you get to the end of this particular part of the manga. 
 
Characters 
The characters are fantastic, though I would add this caveat: other than the two leads, characters should be considered merely foils or ways to advance the plot. That said, the two leads, Gaou and Akanemaru, are some of the most interesting characters I have come across in years of watching anime and other media. Gaou's transformation in particular fascinates me (but I won't talk about it to avoid spoilers). 
 
Art 
The art is amazing, although this is perhaps the one part of the movie that does not capture the greatness of the manga, which boasts drawings of the highest quality. One potential reason for me having this problem (other than Rintaro's slightly worse art direction) was that the only quality I was able to access this relatively obscure film in was quite low in both frame rate and resolution. 
 
Sound 
Oh boy that synth heavy soundtrack/score really makes the movie. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the manga and adds elements of mystery, wonder and suspense. 
 
Story 
It's Hi no Tori. of course the story is mindblowing. 
 
Overall a masterpiece for the ages.

বাংলাঃ 
কিছুদিন ধরে আমাকে এক নেশায় পেয়েছে। ৮০-৯০ দশকের Madhouse এর OVA দেখছি। তখন খুজতে গিয়ে এই OVA সিরিজটার সন্ধান পাই। এটি বিখ্যাত মাঙ্গাকা Osamu Tezuka রচিত মাঙ্গার আডাপ্টেসন। মাঙ্গাটির প্রতি ভলুমে একটি করে গল্প আছে। একেকটি গল্পের সেটিং সম্পূর্ণ আলাদা। তবে গল্পগুলোর মধ্যে যোগসূত্র স্থাপন করেছে ""Hi no Tori"" বা ""Immortal Phoenix"" এর আবির্ভাব। 
এর আগেও অবশ্য এইটার খোঁজ পেয়েছিলাম, তখন ম্যাল এ লো স্কোর দেখে আর আগাই নি। এবার সাহস করে দেখলাম। ভাগ্যিস দেখলাম!! এটার স্কোর এত কম হতেই পারে না। কেন?? কারন এতে আছে দৃষ্টিনন্দন আর্ট, সুথিং মিউসিক, আর সর্বোপরি চিন্তা উদ্রেককারী ম্যাচিওর গল্প। একেকটি OVA শেষ করার পর আপনি অবশ্যই কিছুক্ষণ গভীর চিন্তায় ডুবে যাবেন, গল্পের পিছনের অন্তর্নিহিত দর্শনের খোঁজে। 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: সারাজীবন দুষ্কর্ম করেও একটিমাত্র ভালো কাজের সুফল যেমন পাওয়া যায়, তেমনি একটিমাত্র অমার্জনীয় অপরাধের সাজা থেকেও মানুষ মুক্তি পায় না। এই শিক্ষাটি আপনি এই OVA থেকে পাবেন। ৩টির মধ্যে এইটা সবচেয়ে বেশি Thought provoking। 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: রোমান্টিক ফ্যান্টাসির আড়ালে পাবেন আরেকটি অসাধারন দর্শন। এটার এন্ডিংটা আমার খুব পছন্দের। 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: স্পেস ড্রামা। ৩টার মধ্যে আমার সবচেয়ে প্রিয়। অসাধারণ সাসপেন্স আর এন্ডিং আছে এটাতে। 
যারা হাল্কা স্বাদের আনিমের খোঁজ করেন, এই জিনিস তাদের জন্য নয়। বাকি সবাইকে আমি এই ৩টি OVA দেখার অনুরোধ করব। 
এই ৩টি OVA ছাড়াও TV series আছে, মুভিও আছে। টিভি সিরিজটা Tezuka Productions এর বানানো, আর্ট কোয়ালিটি অত ভালো নয়। 
 
English: 
For a while I've got an addiction. I'm looking for OVAs of Madhouse in the 80s-90s era. Then I came across this OVA series. It is an adaptation of the manga composed by the famous mangaka Osamu Tezuka. There is a story in each volume of the manga. The setting of each story is completely different. However, the stories are linked up by the advent of ""Hi no Tori"" or ""Immortal Phoenix"". 
Actually I came across these before. Then I dared not to try these out, looking at the low scores. This time I dared. Thank God I did!! The score cannot be so low. Why ?? Because it has wonderful art, soothing music, and above all, thought provoking and mature story. After completing one of the OVAs, you will surely be in deep ponder for some time, looking for the underlying philosophy behind the story. 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: A single good deed may save a human immersed in a lifetime of evil deeds. On the other hand, humans can't escape from the punishment of a single unforgivable crime. This is the lesson you will get from this OVA. This is the most thought provoking of the 3. 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: Behind romantic fantasy lies a spectacular philosophy. The ending is my favorite. 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: Space Drama. This one is my favorite of the 3. It has excellent suspense and ending. 
This is not for those who seek light anime. To everyone else, I would request to see these 3 OVAs. 
Apart from these 3 OVAs, there are TV series and movies. But the art quality of the TV series made by Tezuka Productions is not that good.

4,34902,18,9.970937344,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Tsurezure Children,"Young love—it takes many unique and fascinating forms that flourish as children begin to mature into adults. From being unable to confess to not knowing what real love actually feels like, various obstacles can arise when learning about romantic attraction for the first time. But underneath all that, young love is something truly beautiful to behold, leading to brand new experiences for those young and in love. 
 
 Tsurezure Children  depicts various scenarios of young love coming to fruition, along with the struggles and joys that it entails. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","Tsuredure Children tells various romantic stories about how it is hard to say ""I love you"", between young students attending the same high school, in an omnibus format. The characters in each story are connected to each other through their various friendships.
","Another example of a brilliant short anime. The ""Love, Actually"" for otaku. 
 
The overall premise is very simple: high schoolers learning how to fall and stay in love in their own different ways. Within those different ways, though, there comes the fragmented short stories carried by different characters whose one thing in common is they all happen to be pursuing education under the same roof. Admittedly, the whole thing may seem sappy at first glance but with excellent execution, the saccharine could become something genuinely sweet-- and Tsurezure Children did just that. 
 
It is difficult to pick the best pairing out of the bunch because each pairing is relatable in their own way. However, Gouda-Kamine pair does manage to be the most grounded and realistic because it deals more into what happens after the classic love confession. Chiaki-Kana pair is totally represents that hilarious phase in life on which no matter what one does, friendship can truly ruin the possibility of romance. Takao-Chiyo pair is probably the most adorable as the two of them navigate the life irony of which ""what is unlikely is not necessarily impossible"". Nonetheless, there are pairs that, unfortunately, do not deliver the equally satisfying sweetness. Takano-Sugawara pair takes more screen time than other pairs but somehow their stories ultimately feel more anticlimactic. Kaga-Nanase storyline feels exciting yet it ends very abruptly. Lastly, there is that Casanova named Katori who, as more episodes roll in, feels like he has overstayed his welcome. 
 
Is Tsurezure Children a good fixture? Yes. However, the fragmented structures may not be for everyone. Like a double-edged sword, the more we as the audience invest ourselves into one of the pairings, the more we crave for longer screen time for our favorites. Funny enough, this anime truly captures the reality-- that sparks always fly all too fast and that more romance always requires more time.

       Helpful This is a solid, romcom show. 
 
It's certainly not your normal, slow romcom. In fact it flips many of the common tropes on it's head. Slow development? Nu uh, how bout they're all mostly in relationships already. Holding hands??? Well yeah, but how about kissing too!!! This show is cute, funny, has great pacing. Tons of cute couples and couple hopefuls. My details are a little fuzzy so I'm being vague. As I remember it's about multiple couples who are loosely tied together one way or another. Most scenes only featuring one or two couples at a time. A loose thread holding the show together is good enough though as the characters really do carry the show on their own. I feel like i didn't enjoy this show as much as some people, it's probably deserving of an 8. To me it's a passable show with many tropes turned on their head. It's sweet, short, and the ending is cute. The manga is probably recommended as it's longer and complete, but this show does what it wants to accomplish, and does it well. Fully recommend for romcom and slice of life lovers!

          
 
       Helpful Was watching this while each episode came out each week. I ended up forgetting about it and just now finished it.  
 
But this was a fun show that has some pretty awesome moments in it. Such as one of the characters sister being messed around with by the girlfriend. 
 
While i do enjoy this and it's fun . The issue i have with it is two things. 
 
1. The story doesn't have an actual ending for a lot of the characters. Such as the Student Council President and the Delinquent and more.  
 
2. While it isn't really bad. It can be annoying how its not just one story in a row. We get one story chopped up into pieces over multiple episodes. This can be alright but for me i just wish we could watch all of one duo's story with it not being over the span of 12 episodes.  
 
The show also has in my opinion two of the greatest couples in anime of 2017 
AkagixRyouko and TakanoxTakurou  
 
I really love these two groups. I would honestly love to see AkagixRyouko have their own story. They are really good on screen and funny. The other Duo is also pretty good. I don't know if they could do their own story by them self. 
 
Really good story and is fun to just watch.

Katri wants to help and finds work in a neighboring farm; for a girl of hardly nine years of age the work of a farm is hard and tiring even with all of her enthusiasm and good moods, which is what keeps her standing.
","[Spoiler free review] 
To summarise Makiba no Shoujo Katri, it's an anime about an endearing and diligent young girl, who is put through the many trials of adult life in and early 20th century Finnish setting - but through hard work, she manages overcome her issues. You witness the many other well crafted and unique characters in the series slowly fall in love with her through observing her zeal and dedication, but in the end, you'll be the one who has developed the strongest sense of paternal love for this sweet girl and will be gasping in horror at the mere sight of her tripping. If you want an anime with the same mood as popular iyashikei anime like Natsume Yuujinchou, with significantly more progression and realism, this is the right anime for you. 
 
After finishing Romeo no Aoi Sora I was ready for my endeavour into more older anime series, to find the gems that dwell within. I had a whole list of pre-21st century anime I wanted to try out, and Makiba no Shoujo Katri was the first one my list. I honestly just wanted something that I wouldn't binge watch or get too addicted to, something I could just watch on the train ride home for the next few months, but it became clear I made the wrong choice. It was very hard to resist the urge to watch next episode of the series, because there was always some intriguing progression forecasted in the next episode and my attachment to the main characters kept growing. The thing about this anime is that when it felt like the story would stagnate, it pulled a new rabbit out of it's had and and introduced something new into the story or completely changed the setting.  
 
If you're anything like me, you would assume this anime was simply about a girl living in her home village, herding animals and playing with locals, but there's a lot more to it. Each episode introduces you to something new about early 20th century finish life, with mentions of their politics, customs, culture, hierarchical system, social norms and much more. It does all that and manages to spend a lot of time developing characters and deepening your feelings towards them. The only issue with the plot is how idealistic it can be, with the main character always being left in a recoverable position after facing a dilemma. Nonetheless, this aspect of the story is admitted to be a part of it's premise by the narrator, whom occasionally makes an appearance and explains some of the details of the plot from time to time. The problems the main character faces are not minor either, as I mentioned in my summary, she is exposed to many of the cruel aspect of adult life - despite being not even being in her pre-teens yet. There's a lot of realism involved in the plot, and not everything ends happily. But you get to witness the recovery after such an event, so the anime is never dark for too long. Through the cycle of dilemma and recovery, you get a lot of character development which further improves the immersion of the anime as you end having the same level of familiarity with the other characters, just as much familiarity as the main character has with them. Nearly every character is unique and has a quirk, so it's always interesting when a new character is introduced.  
 
Nearly every episode begins with a show casing of Katri's current setting, with drawn images of the Finnish countryside, villages, cities, etc. The show gives you some time to admire the art, which isn't the usually computer generated backgrounds you see in modern anime. They're comparable to the hand drawn backgrounds in Ghibili's productions and have a good amount of detail present in them. The fine details shown in the backgrounds significantly improves your immersion. The way the characters were drawn are, again, comparable to a Ghibili anime, with the outlines and details being simple, but the physics and movements being above average. Considering this anime was made in the 90s, I was surprised by how little the art an animation bothered me. It was better than many older shows made after it, like the Black Jack TV series and even some modern series airing this season (at least when you forgive the fact that you have to watch it in a low resolution). 
 
The music in the series was always a joy to listen to. It wasn't mind blowing, but it fit the setting and was well utilised to set the mood. I really enjoyed listening to the music on my train ride to work, it was chirpy and endearing and not at all as generic as some of the sound tracks for many of the anime I've been watching recently. However, I would say the music was of the same quality of most pre-21st century anime, with the standard array off quality autistic instrumental songs. The voice acting was also quiet pretty standard for the time this anime was made - albeit it void of static sounds that you can hear in some anime when a character starts talking without background music to hide the poor microphone quality. Nonetheless, the voice acting was convincing and not at all bad, even by modern standards. 
 
All in all, I really enjoyed the series. The story was constantly engaging, the characters were interesting and lovable and the show really immersed me in the setting and plot. I would have happily scored this anime a 10/10 if the ending was rushed. I felt like there could have been more episodes dedicated to the ending and other sub-plots. As a result of the show being quiet progressive (with 3 years of Katri's live being portrayed through the whole series), there are many time skips, so as to avoid dwelling on something too long. I was fine with this for the most part, but on occasion, I felt like there was a missed opportunity to add a new sub-plot or expand on an on-going one. The show would introduce a lot of new topics and details that seemed interesting, but would on occasionally not address them future, which always felt like a waste. Nevertheless, I have to accept this was an enviable constraint, as series can't go on forever. Regardless of this issue, I think this Makiba no Shoujo Katri is a really good anime for those interested in other cultures before the 21st century, or those looking for a relaxing anime with progression. I enjoyed every episode and I hope to enjoy it again if I have time to re-watch it a few years later. 


          
 
       Helpful This is a story of a girl named Katri who lives along with her grandparents in a remote village of Finland. Her grandparents are poor and she lost her father at the age of 3 and to support the family her mother leaves her to work a far. Mostly she is away from her mother. 
 
This story has 2 parts one is where she works with Raikkoku farm and another arc with Ms.Lotta's farm.Personally i gave 7 only because of how well the story was in the first part at Raikkoku. Here you can see herding cows, wheat harvest and especially weaving. I wished that the second part is not there after i watched the entire series. 
 
Supportive Characters: All the characters in this anime are supportive characters to Katri. 
 
This story had less miserable situations compared to all other World Master Piece Theatre anime series. 
 
Voice quality of this anime is as same as  classic trademark World Master Piece Theatre anime series. 
 
Overall Opinion: When you have seen all World Master Piece Theatre anime series and left nothing then only see this. NO REAL-LIFE PROBLEMS WERE SHOWN IN THIS ANIME. You will be left with pleasant feeling after watching this series.  Katri is the girl favored by luck who come from meadows to city.

4,37623,20,9.781697433,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen,"Modest Heroes will consist of three shorts by three different directors: ""Kanini & Kanino"" (""Kanini to Kanino"") by Hiromasa Yonebayashi will be a 15-minute fantasy adventure story of two crab siblings, and will be long. ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" (""Samurai Egg"") by Yoshiyuki Momose will be a 15-minute ""human drama"" showing the love between a mother and a boy. ""Invisible"" (""Tōmei Ningen"") by Akihiko Yamashita will be a 14-minute ""action spectacle"" that centers on the lonely struggle of one invisible man. Studio Ponoc describes the shorts as ""tales of modest heroes of our times."" 
 
(Source: ANN, edited)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","
","""Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen (Modest Heroes)"" is Studio Ponac's second movie project after their debut film, ""Mary to Majo no Hana (Mary and the Witch's Flower)"". The film is a collection of three non sequential shorts that each tell a unique story about a heroic character and his or her respective journey. ""Modest Heroes"" is obviously not going to beat ""Mary and the Witch's Flower"", but it's still an enjoyable watch and it did certainly kept me interested the whole way through. 
 
Short One: ""Kanini & Kanino"" 
""Kanini & Kanino"" surrounds the tale of two crab siblings whose life of living underwater becomes drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river. One night, one of the siblings attempts to travel to the surface, only for something dramatic to occur, ultimately leaving the two siblings to fend for themselves in the vast river environment. I can't really say much about the short. I enjoyed the visuals way more than the characters or the plot, with its fantastic blend of 2D animation with splashes of CGI for the river environment that is eye-catchingly beautiful to say the least (despite the CGI fish, but whatever). I'm not really invested in Kanini or Kanino, as forgettable as they are, and the fact that the short doesn't have any dialog hurts their dynamics as a whole. For the story and characters to be lacking in depth, the visual did make up for it to be considered for an enjoyable one-time watch. 
 
Short Two: ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" 
""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" is about the relationship between a mother and her son, Shun, who has a severe egg allergy that in-contact, could cause a life-threatening case in which Shun only has minutes to live. The short is based off a true story (claimed by the director) and it does a pretty good job keeping me interested in the characters and how they deal with Shun's condition. The mother is overly protected of Shun and tries her hardest to protect him from any harm, just to amend for all the times that she isn't there for him. Shun himself quickly learns to stay strong and formidable despite his unfortunate state and is eager to overcome any obstacles in his life to prove that he isn't frail and weak. The characters in this short are way more realistic and the hand-drawn artstyle complements it by having a sort of nostalgic feel, reminiscent of a children's storybook. The animation is fluid and the movements are more expressive that doesn't distract you from the overall atmosphere of the short. The intriguing aesthetic and the lovable character makes this short exceedingly enjoyable for anybody to enjoy, and this, along with the next short, produces a well crafted compilation if it weren't for the first short.  
 
Short Three: ""Invisible"" 
""Invisible"" contains an interesting and ingenious concept that is explored in a very creative way. The short follows an invisible man, whom others cannot see. The man is required to carry a heavy object since he could easily be carried by a gust of wind without it. The short basically surrounds a day of his life, in which he ponders about his identity in life and his struggle of loneliness. What makes the short especially unique is through several brilliant action-packed moments that is exemplified by the gripping animation and the spectacular choreographer of the whole segment. Aesthetically, the short is bleak and almost depressing with its dimmed colors and almost dreary tone that sets it apart from the bright and colorful visuals of the previous two shorts. The Invisible-Man himself carries a dispirited mood that I can't help but feel sympathetic for. These design choices overall make the conclusion of the short extremely satisfying and makes the whole experience well-worth the watch. 
 
So what can I say? Studio Ponac did a fine job producing these shorts and I highly recommend this to those who are fans of their previous film. Creatively impressive and tremendously entertaining, ""Modest Heroes"" is huge step for Studio Ponac to work with other directors and their consistency in quality has me anxiously waiting for their next project. 

          
 
       Helpful Modest Heroes consists of three shorts aimed at children. The first short is about two brothers braving the dangers of the river to save their father from a fish. It is a straightforward story that children will enjoy and adults will not be too interest by. The second short is about a boy that is allergic to eggs. This has more application to adult life because it shows how the mother must change her lifestyle for the safety of her son, and it shows how there could be any number of unknown threats with such a common food as egg. The best short is about an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible. It is my favourite anime short because of how it handles this premise. The art style is not smooth and fluffy nor sharp and edgy, and has a particular aesthetic, helped by the animation style, to visually explain what sort of a person this invisible man is. Although he is invisible, he still does the right thing and helps people even when they don't even acknowledge his existence. He is the most modest hero of all.  
Modest Heroes is primarily for children, and while not all the shorts may appeal to you, The Invisible Man is the best short ever made and deserves your attention. 

          
 
       Helpful Appearance and technicality is not everything in an anime : These 3 short movies produced by the Studio Ponoc seems more a beautiful technical demonstration of the studio pure animation capabilities than real narrative works, in-depth reflections or compelling/original stories.  
 
The first one is a mildly fantastic family friendly scenario with superficial events, classic stereotypes and extremely predictable outcomes.  
The second one is an ordinary slice of life story about allergy. 
The last one which seems at first the most original of the three was obviously inspired by John Carpenter's version of the Invisible Man and ends up in an ordinary fashion instead of bending to the mystical symbolism or spiritual side (which would have been more interesting to my opinion). 
 
Therefore, everything looks like very superficial and do not offer much aside from the beauty of the drawing, lighting and animation.  
When compared to other Japanese short movies such as ""Memories"" or simply recent anime series such as ""Mob Psycho 100"" or ""Mushishi"" which features unusual scenario, strange and disturbing symbolism, ambivalent emotion, and unpredictable events (and beautiful animation as well) you can realize the huge difference in terms of narrative and reflective qualities. 
 
  Therefore, unless you are interested solely in animation technical details, I do not recommend watching these very ordinary and somewhat trivial short movies.

4,586,21,9.74574421,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,"A collection of three classic Japanese horror stories: ""Yotsuya Kaidan"", the story of a wife betrayed by her husband who seeks vengeance even in death. ""Tenshu Monogatari"", the story of forbidden love between a goddess and a human, and ""Bakeneko"", the story of a mysterious cat monster with a vendetta against a certain family.  
","['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Fantasy']","
","When I started watching Ayakashi, I did not have any high hopes for it. Horror as a genre is not easy to pull off successfully. But Ayakashi was pretty good at what it does. It is not the kind of horror that scares you or disturbs you, but it does leave a strong impression on you. It is probably more reasonable to classsify it as an anthology of tragic dramas than a work of horror. All the stories are set in the classical Japanese period and they accurately portray the cruel and harsh conditions of that era. The horrifying elements are not that of the paranormal monsters but rather of the violence and cruelty that is part of the humans. 
 
The animation is pretty good, especially in the ""Bake Neko"" segment with some pretty unique artwork. The background score is pretty much on the mark, creating the appropriate atmosphere to complement the plot. ED track is among my favorites. I was instantly hooked the first time i heard it. The Characters are what make the story intriguing. It becomes all the more significant during the ""Bake Neko"" part which is more or less a whodunit thriller. Can't wait to check out ""Mononoke"" which is a spin-off from ""Bake Neko"" segment. 
 
If you are a fan of anime set in edo era, be sure to add Ayakashi to your collection. It is binge-worthy in my opinion. 
 


          
 
       Helpful It's difficult to provide a single rating, considering the series consists of three separate arcs of unrelated stories. They even have differences in their art style, making it even more difficult. So I'll just mention my opinion of each story below. 
 
 
The first arc, a famous revenge story named Yotsuya Kaidan, is my least favorite. I can say, however, that it is dramatic and that revenge is served in the end. It has an overall grim and depressing tone, and if you're not in the mood for that I would suggest you skip it. It's definitely horror to the core. 
 
 
The second arc is more of a tragic love story between a human and a spirit. This one is quite depressing as well, but it has moments of comedy thanks to a pair of side characters and there is more positivity in general. The art and colors are less grim than the first arc and is definitely an upgrade from the previous episodes. 
 
 
The third arc is most likely the reason people watch this series. The story about the bakeneko and medicine seller is a leap above and beyond the previous two. The artstyle and colorful decor and outfits more than make up for the darkness in the previous two stories. Not only that, but there is some mystery and tense dialogue that carries the episode along. The character and style proved popular enough to warrant an anime of its own called Mononoke. 
 
 
All in all it was entertaining enough, if only because it's different in content from most animated series I have seen so far.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
In this anime the story is based on three different short traditional folklore stories from Japan. They are mostly horror stories, however I would say the the last two ones were dealt more with mythical phenomenons and were not so scary. Specifically, it is not as scary as Japanese horror movies are a days. However it is kind of psychological and revolves around issues that have some kind of melancholy into them. It is definitely a very good way to learn about Japanese literature while getting entertained.  
Art:  
The art is not manga art actually. It resembles ukiyo-e, which is a type of traditional Japanese way of drawing. Nevertheless the last story has a different type of art and is a prequel to the anime Mononoke. The last stories art is more like manga art but it seems as if the surface in which it was drawn was some kind of wrinkled paper, I don't really know the reasons which the artists decided to make it seem that way but in my opinion it doesn't really look attractive that way, though the characters design was quite pretty. 
Sound: 
The sound was mostly Japanese traditional music which made the story more intense and interesting. On the other side I found the ending really nice, because it wasn't completely traditional music, it also seemed to have some elements of more modern music. 
Character: 
There wasn't any character development at all, but it seemed like at those times folklore legends/stories didn't really deal with character development (maybe there was some in the second story). Generally these types of stories concentrate more on the topic of revenge and hatred encountered in the plot. 
The characters were kind of similar between them, I must state that all the stories deal with women that have been deeply hurt because of some man, in one way or another. 
Enjoyment: 
Finally I found this show really enjoyable because I learned new things about Japanese culture and their traditional stories while I experienced some of the Japanese classic horror aura which made me think about how it evolved to Japanese modern horror encountered in movies such as Ringu or Hanako-san.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","The story follows everyday lives of a girl named Akomi Natsuki and her boyfriend Ponta Ninomiya. Ninomiya is a super idiot who has no redeeming qualities aside from having a very handsome face.
","First thing I gotta say about this anime: wholesome.  
 
There is just something about this anime that is so wholesome, and I don’t think I can quite pinpoint exactly what makes it seem this way to me. I think it has something to do with the fact that most of the characters are not smart. This show definitely pulled off the “dumb, but the kind that’s cute” well, and I can tell that was one of the huge the goals of the story. It’s an over-the-top and innocent comedy. 
 
The opening was also, from my limited anime-watching experience, quite original. You would have to watch the opening in order to get what I mean.  
 
Now, on to the reasons why I rated this only a six. 
 
First off, despite the opening being quite original, it does get a bit repetitive after you’ve watched a bunch of episodes. As a result, it kinda loses what made it funny, because well, you end up already knowing what’s going on in the opening after seeing it a couple of times. 
 
There are also times when the humor is a bit predictable to me, so it doesn’t end up as funny to me as I think it could have been if there were some tweaks to the timing or presentation of the humor. Since this is supposed to be primarily a comedy anime, I think that’s kinda important in terms of what to improve in this show.  
 
Another reason is that there were a couple of interesting characters that were sort of mentioned or introduced, but they never really got much screen time nor explanation about their personality. I really kinda wish there were more episodes in this anime that introduced these characters further (such as the male lead’s master and grandmother).  
 
Finally, there’s the problem that is quite common in a lot of anime: you watch an anime, then realize that the anime is basically telling you to go read the manga if you want a continuation of the story (and you know this anime is telling you this because the last episode just isn’t satisfying). The last episode of this anime is basically just like the other episodes in this anime (meaning it doesn’t feel like a “last episode”). But I guess that makes sense since this anime doesn’t really have much of a overarching conflict that needs to be solved nor any plot. There’s only so much of a story you can show with only eight episodes that each are only five minutes long. 
 
Despite me rating this a six however, this does not necessarily mean that it’s a horrible anime. I actually started really enjoying it after a couple episodes in because it really is such a cute anime.  
 
The art is simple, but it’s clean and easy on the eyes. It fits well for the shoujo demographic. The animation’s not terrible either, for a comedy anime.  
 
I was able to be invested enough in characters like the male lead and his interactions with the adults in his life. I also haven’t personally watched many over-the-top comedy anime that were aimed towards a teenage female audience, so it was a pretty refreshing experience for me. 
 
In addition, I liked the idea of this whole story having a male lead that is good-looking, but, instead of intelligent and perfect like many other shoujo male leads, a dumb guy. This is a great set up for an awesome parody of shoujo manga tropes. 
 
I wouldn’t say that this comedy anime is going to fit everyone’s sense of humor, but personally, I did enjoy it. It’s not an anime I would scream at everyone to watch, but I suppose it’s an alright anime to pass some time with if you want something comedic and shoujo-y, yet not drama-heavy. 


          
 
       Helpful This is like watching a train wreck or a bad accident. You want to look away but you can't stop watching it.﻿ 
The word that describes the anime best is: Idiotic (like Ninomiya) 
Not in a bad way, though. 
 
There is no special story line, it's like a bunch of filler episode.  
 
I know the anime is supposed to be funny, but it the level of stupidness made me feel uncomfortable. 
Although it was still enjoyable enough for me and I had to laugh a few times. 
 
The opening reminded of that ""Trololo"" song and I liked it. 
The ending is also quite refreshing, because of the lyrics. 
 


          
 
       Helpful A simple-minded comedy with outrageous punchlines. That opening gets me every time. ""Lalalalala, laaaa, nnnyaaaaah~"" 
 
This girl has a boyfriend with a pretty face and literally the brain of an 8 year old. Apparently it's to make her classmates jealous and to look good to everyone-- you're not gonna NOT have one right? It's unTHINKABLE, the horror~! 
 
I saw this show point out different ways people can behave stupidly, and do idiotic things. 
Whether you're intellectually challenged, culturally insensitive, air-headed, judgmental, or just weak to peer pressure and care too much about the opinions of other people. Different roles played, flavors of idiocy presented.

","FULL DISCLOSURE: This is a repaste of my review of the first season, since the series is so short I reviewed both together. The differences are at the bottom. I have not read the original 4-koma. I strongly recommend watching this as it is really short and enjoyable. 
 
ART+ANIMATION: 
It’s a 4-koma based anime, so the art won’t be amazing. That being said, everything looks purposeful and there are no outstanding omissions. There are moments within the story with strongly different art / animation to match the situational comedy and they all work well. 
 
The animation is standard-issue for this genre. However, there is one episode that uses its own dreary feeling animation style for a character development flashback - I think its use was well-suited. There are even a few scenes where the animation functions well as a metaphor for the situation. 
 
Nothing worth mentioning about sound or music. As is the norm, the music merely fits the moods. 
 
STORY: 
The story is about a mid-20’s couple consisting of a nerdy guy and a ‘normal’ girl. Thankfully, the husband’s nerdiness for the most part only influences his personality so that it doesn’t get too old too quickly. It’s very episodic with the general contents of each episode not having much effect on the others, but there is also a lot of continuous building of the plot.  
 
Of course most of the episodes are about their antics or daily life activities, no surprise there. What’s new at least to me is that the situations are much more interesting than the plethora of middle-/high-school student SOL, thanks to the mid-20’s couple. Being in that stage of life, many of the situations are relatable to me personally. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
The character design in a SOL 4-koma is very basic, but I like the faces and expressions. Definitely moe-style but here it’s not a bad thing.  
 
As fitting for a 4-koma, many of the supporting characters exist only to suit a certain running gag or two, but nothing is too overdone. There are some other good, normal interactions within them and the main characters. 
 
Despite being episodic, there is some real character development going on, and some of it really hits home hard. Both husband and wife have real life problems, and you learn that the wife is not nearly as normal as you were earlier led to believe. 
 
Kugimiya Rie is a voice actor in the show (not too often) – I like her in case you can’t tell. Aaanyways… the voice acting is well-fitting to the characters, so no bad marks there. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
There are some pretty good jokes and references included, and the way some of them are portrayed in such a mundane setting makes it even more entertaining. Of course, some references fly right over my head either since I’m not Japanese or familiar with many of the reference material, but thankfully I don’t feel too left out.  
 
Despite the episodes only lasting three minutes each, they are not sped way up to fit everything which was the right decision for the content and mood. Having a show of this format include some pretty serious character development was a welcome surprise. 
 
OVERALL: 
Great short story with some good character development. The humor is right up my alley. The art is nothing special but the focus is more on the main characters than anything else. 
 
COMPARED WITH 1ST SEASON: 
Humor is just as good, but the story turns more episodic with a general focus on the couple becoming ready for parenthood. Feels more somber, first season was better. 
 
TL;DR: 
Cute, funny, with some deeper, young couple topics. Watch it. 


          
 
       Helpful Basically everything that I said about the first season rings about the same for this season, as its more or less the same as last season, but with different antics and such going down. However theres a lot less screentime with the titular husband dude, so that kinda bogs things down a bit. Either way this anime is still pretty good, and the episodes are still all under 5 minutes, which is good if you want to just watch shit to watch shit. Also the baby that was so important during the last episode of the first season is nowhere to be seen until the last episode of this season, so rip that baby being a story device. If I were to finally describe this anime, this anime's description would be ""this anime is so great, that i would reccomend this anime to everyone"", so thats what this anime would be. = this anime. 9/10.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wow, I'm really good at reviewing things!

          
 
       Helpful This heart-warming series about an otaku's amazing marriage to a mostly-ordinary girl continues into season 2. Like the first season, the majority of the show is composed of 4-koma like short events, which are often humorous. The show doesn't exploit the discovery in the last episode of season 1 as much as I thought it would. Regardless, it does a great job of continuing the feel-good relationship-based atmosphere of the first season. As usual, the first season is mandatory as there isn't any character exposition. 
 
Animation: 
Expect the same as the first season, not really the prettiest thing out there but it does the job. Like the first season, expect the subject matter to be a bit on the mature side- including quite a few dirty jokes. 
 
Sound: 
Also very similar to the first season, the show has a nice ED and average BGM. The voice talent is very good for something this short. 
 
Story: 
What really matters in marriage? Is it okay that other people say that it won't work? How do you get through a bad argument? The show gives some playful insight into life after marriage, as well as some of the characters' pasts previous to their vows. The overall message is very positive, and it feels like an attempt to get more Japanese folks to marry and also the next step. 
 
As with the previous season, expect episodic episodes each with its own theme. There isn't much in terms of episode dependency so don't worry too much about spreading it across multiple viewings. There isn't as cute of an ending surprise as the first season, unfortunately. 
 
Character: 
There's some nice episodes that focus on character flashbacks, expanding on how they met and other meaningful events in their past. Their relationship is already very well established compared to, well, every other show out there, so don't expect too much dynamic progression. Still, there definitely is great chemistry here. 
 
Value: 
The entertainment to viewing-time ratio is very good, if you liked the first season there's no reason not to pick this up.

why? we all knew adachi is the writer who mostly likes to kill off one of the characters, i have expected this but I never imagined how he would present the character in such a worst way that is about to die. 
 
kazuya and tatsuya are twin brothers who are madly in love with minami a childhood friend who grew with them and is also their neighbor, if I have to say kazuya was the one who is more in love with minami than his brother.He played baseball and worked hard to become an ace pitcher just to get appreciation and win the heart of minami even though he is not a naturally talented like his elder brother. 
 
On the other hand minami is in love with tatsuya who never shows interest in anything and is a lazy bum. but has natural talent. 
 
i didn't like the character of minami, the female lead of touch. from the first we got hints that she is in love with tatsuya but whenever there scenes of her and kazuya, they have shown her flirting and way her character representation around kazuya always secured hope in kazuya heart that one day she will fall in love with her and not only that she asks kazuya to fulfill her dream to koushien. it gives him further hope that she will love him one day and he works all his life to achieve her dream. 
 
while this continues, kazuya and tatsuya are aware that they both are in love with same girl, for the world kazuya had better chance with minami but kazuya knows his brother had the potential to steal minami away. so he works harder and harder for this girl, while tatsuya doesn't try to show any interest for sake of his brother. 
 
now after you reach 20 episodes later, minami is been shown she is completely aware of kazuya feelings towards her and is also aware she is love with tatsuya. so now no matter how many times kazuya throws hints of her love she never comes to him with a clean reply that she doesn't love him and is in love with his brother instead but still asks kazuya to fulfill her koushien dream and in turn rising much hope in kazuya. 
 
before kazuya died, he gets to know minami is in love with his brother tatsuya and yet he doesn't give up and challenges his brother on this matter.  
now this got worse, when he challenged everyone expected to be a love triangle and rivalry comptietion but the next episode itself kazuya who is on the way to final match which leads him to fulfill the dream of minami's koushien gets killed by a truck. now what the fuck is this I have to ask. 
 
i felt really sad and sympathy with the character. from the beginning kazuya was shown giving all his life for a girl he is in love, while she is completely aware of it and is also aware she will never love him back and yet asks him to fulfill her dreams in name of friendship or childhood friend (which I say is really bitchy of her part to use him like that). she should not rub of her dreams to a guy just because he is in love with her and give him false hopes. 
 
kazuya death was so meaning less and pathetic, i felt sad for the poor guy who lived all his life for this girl only.  
 
later the anime showed that elder brother tatsuya will adopt dream of kazuya which is going to koshien, but seriously I have to ask when it is kazuya dream. it was a dream he just inherited from minami and he died for nothing and the day before he died he even got rejected indirectly by the minami who he loved all the years of his life. 
 
it was quite a injustice, story wise you may cope up and think it is best anime, but I can't bear how unnecessary was the death of kazuya was. without his death too you can create an heart touching anime, it is just his death was meaningless and really sad for viewers.. i hated this anime after kazuya death and I mostly hate minami who is like a two timer bitch and uses the useigi boys to fulfill her dreams just because they are in love with her. 
 
overall I say the characters foundation is itself weak, the brothers had a beautiful relationship which was destroyed in episode 26 by killing one of the brother. 
 
but if you can get over kazuya death you can enjoy anime, I could not because I liked kazuya and feel sympathy and I hate minami for being so flirty with kazuya when she is completely aware of his feelings. 
 
and I also say the the main lead is now achieving his brothers dream to koushien and it is the center pillar concept of touch, but like I said when it is his brothers dream, his brothers dream is always to be loved by minami and marry her which he couldn't because he is dead. 
 
All i say is the central concept is itself a fact less and lie and that is why it is much annoying and I couldn't bear to watch touch.  
for those who didn't watch just watch up to 24 episodes and you will understand what I am saying. 
 
  


          
 
       Helpful I started watching thinking I would only watch a couple of episodes of this sports anime in old fashioned drawing style, but unexpectedly I finished it rather fast and wishing there were even more episodes. 
 
The story is slow paced and character development driven, it is all about the relationships between the main characters. Before I knew it I was sympathizing with each one of them, as they all have a lot of depth. 
I don't care about baseball and have no clue about its rules, but the baseball parts are never boring, on the contrary, they were very exciting to watch and I really got into them. 
The voice-acting was good and I thought the sugary music suited the anime really well. 
 
It was 101 episodes long, yet surprisingly enjoyable from start to end. 
 
Hotness: Although the anime is not packed with huge amounts of romantic scenes and over the top sweet lines, there is nevertheless a lot of electricity in the air and it has its hot moments. 
 
Bishounen:  I'm not a fan of the character design, but somehow I got used to it. Together with the character design, the twins grow on you. Later in the story Akio Nitta, the star batter for Sumi Tech, comes along.

","Not much to report on what we see on the show. 
 
 Some comment ""This is a bad story, it didn't entertain me enough in those 38m"", but look ...What is an original work is that in its planning was to tell a drama surrounded by much war and blood, where it was seen or made a little clear why this case is occurring.  Due to this, both in the animation, as in his commitment to develop a little history and its characters that would finally stand out more in the show, so as not to be white at all. 
All those explosions and gunshots were great, but they were enough to be bothering. 
 You see!!!!! 
In the middle of the house frame / explosions / shot / blood, we see animation interlaced and well placed in size and visibly suited in the middle of the sequence. 
Finally, it is a work that leaves something to be desired, as the initial approach is quiet, and in sequence it is already good for the rapid development and not very viable, I say that if there were a much more explanatory series in its narrative, and adequate and well-suited characters.  worked in the business, Under the Dog would be a good anime on his action list, sc-fi, Thriller. 
 I don't know what rating to give for this OAV, a 5 should be one more than not suitable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Under The Dog, An OVA episode that was not worth the hype. From the first PV and the $900,000 they were funded from kick starter, it was a disappointment. 
 
Story: The story was not incredible, fairly generic with the ""Pandora"". IT centres around a high school raid for no apparent reason, would have been better if it was done in a different place like a shopping mall or a stadium.  
 
Art/Animation/Sound: Art and animation were incredible in the fight scenes but alright in conversations and long-shot. The designs were typical and the colour scheme was too pale but got better in fight scenes. Explosions, Guns and effects were animated beautifully but that's about the only thing that was animated well. 
 
Character: Characters were underdeveloped, something that you would expect from an ova episode but could have done better. 
 
Overall/Enjoyment: The fights were cool, Characters and story were rushed in a way and was different to what i expected from the PV. I guess its worth the watch if you want to see some nice action scenes but other that it's not worth.

          
 
       Helpful It's fine.  For something trying to tell a story in under 30 minutes, it does okay.  As a concept, Under the Dog isn't bad at all, it's actually rather intriguing. 
 
Story:  There isn't much of a story, but for an action short it manages to have a few implications that are at least interesting despite, or even because of not being explained.   
 
The next paragraph you could consider spoilers, though there isn't much of a story to spoil and it's just speculation. 
 
From the OVA, we can assume that the idea is that there are these monsters throughout Japan and maybe the world that are extremely powerful and deadly.  The only way to kill these monsters is with assassins called Flowers whom we can infer have a more limited set of powers than the monsters, but are still the only things that can stand a chance.  In order to get rid of the monsters (I assume), they need a person who has the power of the monsters within them, but which has not manifested itself.  And the story here just follows an instance of trying to get  one of these people. 
 
Like I said, it's fine.  It's a sort of insta-plot that you've seen a thousand times, but if the show is tagged as Action, chances are you aren't looking for a deep intricate plot that requires lots of analysis.  All it is is a way to make things go boom and have cute girls with guns, and if that's what you're here for, it gets the job done fine. 
 
Art: Also fine.  Now I can understand why some people might be upset because in an action show with the most basic plot of all time and the most unexplored characters as well has pretty middle of the road animation, but once again, it does it's job.  The show has explosions, it has guns, it has some little parkour bits, it has scenes of people running through a hail of bullets, it has big monsters.  It's not supremely smoothly animated, which I feel like there could have been more effort put into that considering that it is only a half hour long and there isn't much else to come for, but it's fine.  To the average viewer, like myself, it works.  It didn't blow my ind, it didn't have anything that I wanted to watch over and over because of how cool it looked, but it''s passable.  Just because something isn't exceptional, doesn't mean that it isn't solid. 
 
Sound:  I believe in the idea that sound is done well when you don't notice it and done expertly when you have to take note of how well it fits.  Here, the sound is done well.  There was no music that took me out of the show for any reason, there were no sound effects that were bad or out of place, and while I can't say a ton about Japanese voice acting, it was fine in my opinion.  There were a couple slips in the English voice acting, but not to the point where it took me out of it, just maybe 2 spots where I chuckled a little at the line read.  While I can say that it caught me off guard a little bit when I first heard English acting in the Japanese dub, it certainly isn't a bad thing, just an unexpected one. 
 
Character: Now normally a show with no character development at all would bother me, considering that almost all I care about in any story is the characters.  Here though, it's fine.  It's only 30 minutes long and the emphasis is on the action, so I can't blame them for wanting to just present cardboard cutouts and have them fight.  If this show were 12, or even 6 episodes at 20 minutes a piece, I would be pissed that it had so little character development even though it's not as much of a priority because of the amount of time they had, but here?  It's fine. 
 
So overall, it's a waste of time.  But it's not a bad waste of time.  Currently it has very little substance, but with more time it could turn out to be something good with the plot seeds this OVA planted as well as the lack of explanation of the characters, there is room to work with.  It's not great, but it's not bad, and it's only 30 minutes long, so why not give it a watch?

4,209,26,9.563035812,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,R.O.D: The TV,"Anita King, Maggie Mui, and Michelle Cheung are the Paper Sisters. They run the Three Sisters Detective Agency in Hong Kong which is dedicated to solving cases involving books. They are hired as local guides for Nenene Sumiregawa, a Japanese novelist who has been struggling with writer's block following the disappearance of her longtime friend, Yomiko Readman. The sisters are all Paper Masters—individuals with the power to control paper—and with their abilities, they save Nenene from the dangerous terrorists targeting her at a book signing. But in case they strike again, the sisters remain as her bodyguards to protect her from further harm. 
 
This is a dream come true for bookworms Maggie and Michelle who love Nenene's stories, but the young Anita cannot stand books despite her powers over paper. The three struggle to adapt to their new daily life in Japan, guarding Nenene while continuing their detective work under a mysterious organization, Dokusensha. However, the more they get to know Nenene, the more they discover the link between her, the disappearance of her friend Yomiko, and the mysterious books Dokusensha sends the Paper Masters to investigate. What began as a simple job ends up a bigger case than they have ever had before. Are these girls really willing to risk their lives over literature? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Drama']","The series begins in 2006, five years after the ""I-Jin"" incident detailed in the Read or Die OVA. Yomiko Readman (a.k.a. ""The Paper"", agent of British Library Task Force) has supposedly gone missing, and Nenene Sumiregawa, her former student and best friend, is still in Tokyo after her parents moved to the United States. Nenene has not written a book since Yomiko disappeared, as she has become lonely and frustrated that her sensei has never read her last book, and she feels she can't write again until she hears Yomiko's reaction to the book, so Nenene often disappears for long periods of time searching for Yomiko, and has been periodically doing so ever since her ""disappearance"".
During a trip to Hong Kong, Nenene meets the three sisters, Michelle, Maggie and Anita (from the Read or Dream manga), who are supposed to take care of her during her visit. However, the hotel at which Nenene is supposed to stay at is bombed, and at a press conference Nenene is briefly held hostage by a jealous rival in her industry. The three sisters end up becoming her bodyguards and join her back to Tokyo.
Each sister has paper manipulation skills similar to Yomiko, although less powerful and more focused in scope. After the initial action-filled adventure, the first several episodes take on the feel of an odd-couple comedy which focuses on tension between Nenene and the sisters, who move into her apartment and mooch off her, all while dealing with various crazies and psychos in their everyday lives. The sisters also perform odd jobs as agents of the Dokusensha (ostensibly a Chinese publishing company, but more like an Illuminati-type organization focusing on the collection of rare and powerful documents). This eventually puts them and Nenene in direct conflict with the British Library and the protagonists of Read or Die (Dokusensha is established as the British Library's rival in the Read or Die manga).
Events grow more serious as the series progresses as atrocities are committed by both sides, thrusting the main characters into the middle of a conflict between literary superpowers, the British Library and Dokusensha, who are both trying to collect ancient artifacts (books, of course) to control the entire world and even rewrite history. After a horrific collision between the two superpowers, Nenene and the Paper Sisters set out to find the missing Yomiko to learn the truth about the conflict and save the world from literary terrorism.
","ROD gives me an impression of creativity, using paper as a weapon, clothes and practical stuff is impressive. also having these characters like anita to find a family in the likes of michelle and maggie. nenene for trying to find the precious person that keeps her inspired and also for yomiko and nancy who in spite of their clumsiness still charms the viewers. i like this anime because of its story, action scenes and unexpected love story between friends

          
 
       Helpful Remember last time last year, when I watched an OVA called Mezzo Forte and I thought that was one of the many entertaining anime I had ever saw and then after that, I’ve reviewed Mezzo DSA, the TV series to follow it and I thought the TV series was very bland and vanilla compared to the OVA, offering nothing to the table aside from a few basics from the OVA. Well, I was very cautious when going into the Read or Die franchise as I know a few friends of mine said that OVA is very underrated and I wholeheartedly agree about. Now with this TV series, that might say the opposite that it isn’t as good as the OVA but hey, who knows? I might find a different opinion on it.

As I watched the series, I will know there will be additional characters made into main characters from the aforementioned manga and the plot expands to more than just 3 episodes (to a full 26 episodes) and I only have half enthusiastic  when I was watching this. The plot of this is as like the OVA but it’s sliced and diced to either the average bad guy of the week to these character pieces that are more akin to the slice-of-life genre with one part being Anita in middle school (or it is high school? I couldn’t really tell. They looked way too young to be high school.) but it just feel odd and jarring as most characters from the first half disappears and then appears from out of the blue and/or a long time period for forced character development, which just puts me out of interest altogether. 
  
  
  
Funny thing about the main 3 sister characters, all of them are named after Hong-Kong action actresses, hence Anita King (Anita Mui), Maggie Mui (Maggie Cheung, part of Anita Mui) & Michelle Cheung (Michelle Yeoh, part of Maggie Cheung) but yet, the fact is the only thing that is interesting about them as they aren’t that strong as characters but more of anime archetypes: Anita being the youngest but the most capable and often more focused on than the other sisters, Maggie being the quiet and silent one, and Michelle is the cheerful, older yet ditzy sister. Throughout the show, they do go through this sisterhood bond with another new character in the mix, Nenene Sumiregawa and yet, she is a very irritable and screechy character, whose only reason to appear in this is because she has a connection to the earlier master Yomiko Readman and yes, most of the characters from the OVA do appear in here, including Joker, Drake & Nancy, but if you’re expecting the femme fatale Nancy was in the OVA, prepare to be disappointed, as it was explained that she did suffer some brain trauma that had her in a childlike state. 
  
  
  
The animation here as in the OVA, Studio Deen did the previous one, while in the TV series, they are replaced with J.C. Staff for this time and it was just……average. The paper battles were very spot-on with the previous installment although they appear within long periods of time. Character designs are actually faithful as I can’t spot the differences of how they were designed. The music is still the best part of the franchise as it still retains the spirit of the OVA and it even got more funkier when the opening theme for the show. Plus, the original themes from the OVA among other pieces are heard in there. I can say less for the ending themes as they are standard pop songs that seemed forgettable. 
  
  
  
Fuck it, this English dub is bad and I mean it was grating as like the animation, the voice actors from the Manga dub was replaced by company Geneon / New Generation Pictures and most of them tried to do British accents and some can’t do it well, especially the replacement actress for Yomiko (Hellena Taylor), Joker (J.B. Blanc) & Junior (J.D. Stone) and some of the main female character voices are often shrilly and screechy, mostly Nenene’s voice.  However, I’m not going to fault the dub that much as they did hire kid actors to play the younger characters and if you try to find some recognizable voice actors in there, the only people whose voices I got from there are Hunter MacKenzie Austin (playing Michelle), Carrie Savage (replacing Amanda-Winn Lee for Nancy Mukahari) & Patrick Seitz. 
  
  
  
FINAL VERDICT: The show isn’t wholly unfaithful to the OVA, the spirit of that is still present in the TV series but I just don’t think it was ready for a TV format, even the plot as ridiculous in the OVA seems better suited to that. Mainly one character left somewhat of an impact of the show, only 50% less than Yomiko. I wouldn’t say it’s inferior to the OVA but it’s nothing that most people would say when talking about most anime out there. By any chance, you should stream or rent before buying. 
  


          
 
       Helpful R.O.D the TV soars above it's manga equivalent, Read or Dream, in terms of strong story and well developed characters, even bringing back several popular characters from the past.  While the two host the same primary characters, the plot line of the tv series takes on a whole different path from the manga, and I must say that it was a brilliant choice.  Although the series overall is rather slow to develop, it all results in an amazing ending climax and resolution that is well worth viewing for oneself. 
 
Do note that it is not necessary to know anything about the Read or Die setting previous to this series to be able to follow it, although many elements do tie in with the past. 
 
Story:  9 
This story centers around several bibliophile sisters (and one who hates books) who are able to animate paper, and their various day to day life, as well as the missions they go upon.  Later on in the series, the story takes on a much more epic scale, and everything involving the sisters and the people they are involved with all comes together in a grand fashion that has the potential to all fall apart, but manages to stick and finish well. 
 
Again, I'll try to avoid comparisons to the manga, but first I shall mention that I found the character designs to be greater in the anime series; the portrayal of the Paper Sisters is better executed and personalities are well defined in a manner that the manga lacked. 
 
In terms of story progression, the first episode should give you a pretty good feel of what the series is like.  The first few episodes are somewhat uneventful in terms of heavy action as they're used to introduce you to the main characters and their personalities, but the pace starts to pick up around the fourth ep. when they start taking on some missions and Anita starts school.  Episode 12 marks the start of the real focus of the story, and after a recollection of the events that were involved in the original Read or Die and tie in with R.O.D the TV in Episode 14, the true plot line unfolds (as well as the return of a certain Paper Master).  The series definitely takes its time in delivering the full story, and although many episodes could easily be cut, overall, I found the shifting between the slower, more character development-centered parts (edging toward the slice of life genre) and the more story-driven, action oriented parts to be appealing and rather enjoyable. 
 
R.O.D just has this really relaxed feel to it, which blends well with the action sequences surprisingly.  The main characters maintain their personalities well whether relaxing reading books or animating paper on a serious mission. 
 
The way that the plot progresses is comparable to a train starting up; it starts out really slow and slowly begins to pick up speed, until it progresses into an all out (I'd feel rather awkward saying 'full steam ahead') race to the finish that is just impossible to stop watching.  While the story does take quite a few rather creative liberties when the real action begins, overall the story packs a solid punch that delivers in the end. 
 
I should mention that the series does contain a small amount of nudity, but nothing too major (namely Episode 9). 
 
Art:  9 
If the animation for the series has one thing, it's consistency.  The animation is fluid and well done throughout the entire series; the flow of hundreds of sheets of paper everywhere is quite a sight to see.  The series delivers on the action scenes, and is easy to follow and impressive to watch.  Character design is clean and simple, although they are defined aptly, and it is easy to distinguish one character from another.  The anime refrains from using any super deformed styles such as simplified faces or chibi to convey emotions, and rather uses dialogue, superb voice acting, and well drawn faces to create an effect.  However, they do sometimes use blush spots on cheeks to make the characters look cute at times, and while it is a bit out of place, it is far better than the common use of &gt;&lt; eyes and such to translate feelings.  The backgrounds at times are simply beautiful, as are the cloud designs.  Overall, the art is rather solid. 
 
Sound:  8 
One thing I should mention, regarding voice acting, I watched the english dubbed version for a while, and I have to say that it wasn't too bad.  It takes a bit of getting used to at first, but some voices are just spot on, such as the brilliant voicing of Nenene, which provides a perfect fit to her character.  In fact, when I went back to subs, I found that I actually preferred the English voices, with a few exceptions (i.e. Hisa's voice).  And that's saying something, as I generally prefer Japanese with subtitles to dubbing. 
 
The ending theme is very fitting to the series, as I find it reflective of the relationship of the Paper Sisters.  The ending changes after Episode 13, halfway through the series, and although I liked the new ending, I found that it did not fit quite as well as the first. 
 
The OP is a lyric-free jazz piece similar to ones found in Cowboy Bebop, or something that you'd hear in a James Bond-type movie, and is also used several times during action scenes.  The music played throughout the series fits the atmosphere and helps to define it, and although the music is sometimes started awkwardly in some scenes, it is all very fitting. 
 
Character:  10 
Perhaps R.O.D's strongest point is its character relationships.  The chemistry between the three sisters is realistic and gripping, as are the friendships they form with many of the other main characters of the series.  Every character possesses strong unique qualities that define each, and they stick by them consistently throughout, while simultaneously developing and growing as people.  The characters' traits and the way they act are deeply ground in reality and it is easy to visualize any of them living in the real world (minus the supernatural elements, of course).  All have vastly differing appearances; there is no risk of ever mixing up characters for one another.  While many of the characters' pasts are not deeply delved into, although at the moment I cannot confirm, I believe that they are addressed in earlier installments of the Read or Die universe.  However, the three main characters receive plenty of background information that is slowly revealed throughout the story and make them stronger as a whole.  The characters of R.O.D are part of what makes this story so great. 
 
Enjoyment:  10 
R.O.D the TV delivers a unique story that any anime fan should check out.  The story is unique and refreshing and the characters are both memorable and likable.   The general atmosphere of the series may not be for everyone, but I feel that this is a rather under-appreciated anime and everyone should at least give it a chance.  Despite its slow and steady pace, this series manages to stay compelling and kept me hooked all the way through up to the end. 
 
Overall:  9 
Although I feel that the series does fall a little short as it takes a bit too much time in the beginning, those who are patient will be rewarded with a great story and characters if they stick with the series.  My best advice would be to at least check out the first episode and see what you think as it gives a pretty good idea as to what R.O.D is like.  If you happen to like the Read or Dream, or Read or Die manga, then you should check out this anime for sure.

As the story unfolds it encompasses the tangled human relationships of many characters, including Maya's mentor, Chigusa Tsukikage, who discovered Maya's tremendous talent for acting during her search for a successor capable of performing the role of ""The Crimson Goddess"", and Masumi Hayami, the young president of Daito, who often interacts with Maya as a crafty and cold-hearted entrepreneur, while giving her faithful support and warm encouragement in the disguise of an anonymous fan (""The Purple Rose Person"", or ""murasaki no bara no hito"" as Maya calls him for his trademark gift of purple roses). Hajime Onodera, a director for Daito, wants the rights to ""Kurenai Tennyo,"" which were given to Tsukikage by the playwright; since Tsukikage refuses to sell him the rights, Onodera tries to drive Tsukikage's acting school out of business through a series of nefarious schemes.  Since Onodera is working for Hayami, Maya (unaware that Hayami is ""The Purple Rose"") hates him. Though there is an age difference of eleven years, Masumi falls in love with Maya and gives her encouragement in subtle ways.
","If the art is in the way, get over it.  
 
now moving on to the story itself. I'm a Glass Mask fanatic. I've watched both this and the 2005 version, plus the tv drama and ova, and I've read the manga, which is still continuing for those who don't know. 
 
You have to watch the story, especially this older version, with an open heart, not as a critic prepared to voice your opinions.  
 
I thoroughly enjoyed the story. In fact, there isn't another story that I enjoyed as much as this one. Skip Beat comes next. 
I'm not someone who's into showbiz, so the showbiz factor is not the reason why I enjoyed the story.  
 
The story is centered around Maya. Maya is the soul of the story.  
There is a great amount of character development throughout the story, not just in Maya, but in other characters as well. There aren't really any weak characters in the story. In the showbiz world, it's all about putting darwinism to the test.  
Maya is one of the strongest yet kindest female lead I've ever stumbled upon. A character as beautiful as Maya is really a rare find. 
 
I don't recommend watching this version first though if you are used to modern drawings and animations. I watched the 2005 version first then this one. Honestly, I love them both so I can't say which is better.  


          
 
       Helpful I've heard of Glass Mask being one of the more popular long-running titles of the shoujo demographic thanks to its focus on Maya's budding acting career, thus had interest in wanting to see how this adaptation fares and must say this got rather frustrating to watch. 
 
A major barrier to this adaptation of Glass Mask for me was the heavy dependence on melodrama to add conflict into the series. There were a few ways that this 1984 adaptation of the series does this. One way consists of Maya being encouraged by her mentor, Chigusa Tsukikage, to adhere to understanding her role to a rather extreme degree. In acting, emotionally identifying completely to a role is called method acting. I've heard of behind-the-scenes stories where actors like Leonardo Dicaprio, Christian Bale, and Jared Leto did quite a bit of method acting to get into many of the major roles they would become famous for. However in the world of Glass Mask, method acting is milked to a rather ridiculous degree for Maya to get immersed into any roles she takes on for theatrical performances, enough as such where it usually causes physical and psychological abuse to her. In one particular case where she is learning to take on the role of Helen Keller for The Miracle Worker, Maya resorts to sensory deprivation by blindfolding herself and stuffing her ears with cotton balls to simulate living life being blind and deaf while tripping and falling into things. 
 
The second way was that many of the plays that Maya participated in faced some sort of sabotage through different events or jealous rivals. This is a recurring plot device that Glass Mask milks in a forced attempt to create drama and test Maya's abilities to improvise over the sabotage and win over the crowd during her performances. I didn't feel these did anything to aid in developing Maya's character growth as an actress, as they felt tacked on in a lazy attempt to add forced drama to the plays that Maya participated in. 
 
The third and worst way that melodrama gets milked is the heavy amounts of angst that Glass Mask likes to milk. Any negative situation, regardless if it's minor or major, leads Maya to get way too overemotional in response to it. Rather than this angsting having me sympathize with her, it made me want to slap Maya since she takes every little thing happening to her way too personally thanks to the anime's rather questionable choices in story direction. 
 
But perhaps the biggest problem I had with this adaptation of Glass Mask as a whole is that it doesn't do a good job of having me convinced that Maya grew as a character in her experiences as an actress. The series gets too immersed into the emotional extremes that she goes through to overcome any major hurdles as such that it doesn't devote enough focus to lighter moments that explore the motives of other characters supporting Maya's growth or Maya reflecting on the events within her present crisis to learn how to overcome it, thus allowing audiences to connect with her as a character. A rather noticeable flaw with Maya's acting throughout Glass Mask is that she gets too immersed in her role as such where she isn't conscious of the nuances and actions of the other performers she is supporting in the advancement of a play's plot. This does get addressed at a few points in Glass Mask, but the series never devotes time to having Maya learn how to overcome this flaw and still unconvincingly tries having you believe she was a budding actress with strong potential. 
 
The series also tries to play up a romance angle for Maya with a couple different male characters within Glass Mask. One character gets too limited development and screen time to make that potential relationship mean anything. While the potential with the mysterious ""Mr. Purple Rose"" is a little more convincing and nuanced in its developments, the series regrettably ends inconclusively before it can get into this relationship any further. 
 
If there is one plus I can give for Glass Mask, it would have to be Ayumi Himekawa. Her character as a friendly rival of sorts to Maya is a deconstruction of the ""rich girl"" character type seen in many anime titles. Ayumi isn't portrayed as a haughty character with bitter jealousy for Maya's increased fame nor does she exploit her wealth for personal gain or to get an edge over Maya in any way. She sees Maya as an equal to her and a source of motivation to improve on her own abilities as an actress, and there are a few points where she reprimands a few jealous crew members who attempt to sabotage Maya's performances in any capacity. Ayumi's character had quite a bit of dimension compared to Maya and it's a shame that Maya's character is rather flawed in this adaptation of Glass Mask, as the chemistry between the two could have made for interesting developments if Glass Mask wasn't too focused on the emotional extremes of Maya's developments. 
 
Overall, I find this adaptation of Glass Mask to be quite flawed. The series dabbles too heavily into melodrama at the expense of Maya's development to have me convinced of her character's growth and development as an actress, and could have been a far better series if not for this. I've heard that there's a 2005 remake of Glass Mask that is a superior adaptation of the shoujo manga compared to this adaptation. I might be tempted to see that one down the line to see what it's like. But as for this 1984 adaptation? I wouldn't bother watching it again due to the many issues it has with its storytelling. 

          
 
       Helpful Glass Mask is an interesting piece of animation. It all begins with Mayas will to fulfill her dreams but quickly turns so a story filled with angst and hurt feelings. This is the kind of series you watch when you are tired of the old &quot;everything will turn out ok&quot;-stereotype. 
 
The story is quite good and the pacing is excellent. It is basically about Maya who would like to be an actor someday. One day she is promised to get a chance to se a play if she delivers all the orders for a resturant she works at before midnight. Her entusiasm is discovered by the former queen of the theater Tsukikage and she becomes a student at her acting school. After this her life could seemingly only become better, it doesn't go so smooth as she expected. Mayas will to succed and her constant struggle agains the odds is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The only (and major) weak-point is that the story is left unconclusive and the endig that the whole series build up for never became realized. 
 
The art looks very dated but it remains true to the original manga (which I unfortunately haven't read) and the classic shoujo-style gives away a quite nostalgic feel. The animation is nothing amazing either but it is on par to other mid 80s tv-shows. Meaning that the framecount are low (you can count the frames as you watch) and the backgrounds are a bit generic and &quot;normal&quot;. Overall the art and animation is nothing spectacular but it doesn't take away from the feeling of the show either. 
 
When it comes to sound the voice actors does a good job in capturing the feeling of the characters and Mayas VA really does a good job in changing her voice to fit the role that Maya is playing (which is different for each different play). The music, however, never goes beyond ok. 
 
With an ok soundtrack and story it may not sound that interesting but the characters and their depth makes it all worth it. Mayas struggle is interesting and the choices she makes are quite interesting. Whe supporting characters are quite good also, they are all two-faced and Maya has a really hard time to know who she should trust. 
 
To summarise, Glass Mask is interesting but filled with angst, betrayal and unhappy moments. It is not something you should watch if you are already feeling down but if you are looking for a serious shoujo-drama Glass Mask may be just the show for you.

(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Martial Arts', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","On a training journey in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fall into the cursed springs at Jusenkyo (呪泉郷). The cursed spring causes any afflicted to assume the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water, which reverts on contact with hot water but resumes with exposure to cold water. Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl.
Soun Tendo is a fellow practitioner of Musabetsu Kakutō Ryū (無差別格闘流) or ""Anything-Goes School"" of martial arts and owner of a dojo. Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo. Soun has three teenaged daughters: the polite and easygoing Kasumi, the greedy and indifferent Nabiki and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing Akane. Akane, who is Ranma's age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that they are the older sisters and can dump the duty on her, and that they all dislike the arranged engagement and think Akane's dislike of men is the right way to express it to the fathers. At the appointed time they are surprised when a panda comes in and puts a girl in front of their father. The Tendo girls all laugh. It takes several more pages for the situation to be explained to Soun Tendo and his daughters. Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but the fathers are insistent and they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions. They are frequently found in each other's company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.
Ranma goes to school with Akane at Furinkan High School (風林館高校, Fūrinkan Kōkō), where he meets his recurring opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also falls in love with Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters eventually knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately fell into the Spring of the Drowned Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of a little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also fell into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Genma and Soun's impish grand master, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.
Ranma's prospective paramours include the martial arts rhythmic gymnastics champion (and Tatewaki's sister) Kodachi Kuno, and his second fiancée and childhood friend Ukyo Kuonji the okonomiyaki vendor, along with the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, supported by her great-grandmother Cologne. As the series progresses, the school becomes more eccentric with the return of the demented, Hawaii-obsessed Principal Kuno and the placement of the power-leeching alternating child/adult Hinako Ninomiya as Ranma's English teacher. Ranma's indecision in choosing his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life.
","Though not as funny as the first three OVAs, these are definitely fun and well worth watching. Ukiyo, Ryoga, and Shampoo fans will enjoy the first episode and fans of the Ranma/Akane pairing will love the tenderness in the last arc.

The background music and OP/ED themes were also very good (as always with Ranma 1/2) for this set.

","After the depressing trainwreck that was Nana, I really wanted a lighthearted comedy that stayed funny the entire series. Zombieland Saga was my first try, but while it had its moments it ultimately couldn't maintain its humor. Shinmai Maou no Testament was a worthy try, and while it has some pretty nice ""plot"" moments, it rapidly digressed into melodrama and I stopped being interested after five episodes. Would Renai Boukun do the trick and remind me of why I liked New Game so much? 
 
No. 
 
The first ten episodes were exactly what I needed to pull me out of Nana's forced malaise. It was cute, cheery, the characters all had great personalities, and there was just enough world building to give me the impression that it was a well-crafted comedy--while not subtracting at all from the gags and goofs. I know the nods, homages, and parodies really made some people salty, but I thought they all fit right in with the general cheery atmosphere. And besides, the production values here were high enough that it never felt like a rip off, only a good time. 
 
And then episodes 11 and 12 happened and the show got cut off at the knees. 
 
""Comedy? Nope, let's add in mopey moments with a shitty subplot that's both generic AF but also entirely out of place"" -the producers. 
 
""Well fuck this series right into space"" -me 
 
I know I'm extra sensitive to tone shifts in my entertainment, but I refuse to accept that it's impossible to just allow comedies to be comedies and dramas to be dramas. Genre-melding is always a failed endeavor because it alienates both sides in a compromising middle ground that's way too familiar in real life. Is escapism really that lofty a goal? 
 
Anyway if you're willing to only watch the first ten episodes you'll probably enjoy this. I wish I'd done that. On to the next ""comedy"" that will probably succumb to the same problem.

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers. 
 
Renai Boukun (also known as Love Tyrant) is practically a parody to the ever so popular Death Note but in the form of a RomCom. Oh boy.  
 
Seiji Aino meets Guri and is told she'll die if she doesn't kiss someone in 24 hours, he goes for the power play and kisses her. Which wasn't the right move. At all. From here on out, he's forced into an unreasonable relationship with the self-proclaimed angel and now they're on a mission to make couples. 
 
Along the way, Seiji ends up picking up Akane and Yuzu to add them to his harem of girls. All three girls are in relationship with him. Guri is a mischievous girl who wishes to ship yaoi couples. Yuzu is an earnest girl who wants the love of her sister, Akane, whom would kill for Seiji. Literally. With this cast of characters, a fun RomCom would be ensured, correct?  
 
Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
 
Many episodes are just filled with repetitive scenes of the same slapstick-esque gag humor that everybody seems to love. You can't go twenty seconds without Yuzu falling into Seiji's arms, Akane stabbing something, or Guri getting distracted to something she found interesting. The only time this isn't ensuing is when Seiji screws something up, so he gets monologued for about a minute by somebody (usually Yuzu) and then they set off to fix the problem. This in turn makes for a rather bland RomCom. Too much overused comedy, with the added fake and heavy romance they attempt to display is underwhelming. I guess it's worth mentioning that Shikimi, a girl who was surprisingly not added to the harem, was a major sadist.  
 
TL;DR: Renai Boukun attempted to be a funny, wacky RomCom that strayed off the beaten path at times. With really simple characters, the humor isn't as impactful as it could've been. I wouldn't say the show isn't worth watching, but don't expect this to be the funniest show you'll ever watch.

          
 
       Helpful I am loving it so far, especially after the fourth episode, where it takes an amazing turn. When I first started watching it I thought, hey, a normal romantic comedy, quite enjoyable. But after the fourth episode, I fell completely into it. . I really hope this new girl is common in the anime, because she made it fantastic.  
 
-Art- 
 
The art is pretty great too. Though sometimes it tends to get loose, the dialogue makes up for it.  
 
-Character- 
Okay, so first we have the yandere, Akane. Honestly, quite a shocker but I was glad she did turn out to be one, added some spice into it. After episode 3, she doesn't seem as Yandere though, maybe accepting the harem a little bit? Guri, pretty standard character, but she enjoys yaoi, so she s pretty much a yaoi fangirl.... Akane's sister, I can say I don't find too annoying, since I usually hate sister types(such as Oreimo), but she doesn't seem to want to get in the way of anyone in the harem, so I don't mind her. She is quite sweet as well. Shikimi(watch episode 4), just.. damn. She turned the tables on this anime with her personality, and I completely fell head over heels for this character. The main character is quite enjoyable as well, with his gags and all.  
 
 
The story is fairly harem-type, but it is still quite enjoyable.  
 
--Add on since I've watched the whole series now. 
 
I don't understand why people compare it to death note, at the beginning it has that ""Kiss Note"" but honestly the rest of the anime is not even similar. I do wish that Shikimi got more screen time, since she only kinda got added to the harem in the last episode. That's the only thing I would change. I also liked how they all loved each other at the ending as well, which made it more of how it is supposed to be, they're all in a relationship with each other.

This series portrayed her as a cookie-cutter anime girl: Complacent, shy, easily embarrassed, who spends her days doing little more than hoping the guy she likes will notice her...nothing like her original personality at all.  
 
The plot was dull and uneventful. The art was lackluster compared the the original; even the colors were a lot duller.  I really don't understand why this was created, and I kind of wish it hadn't been. 

          
 
       Helpful I have absolutely no idea why does this even exist. It has barely anything to do with Di Gi Charat universe. It's not bad, but I think this should have been own anime in itself. But I guess nobody would care about it in that case. 
 
The story is incredibly average at best and very predictable. Yet, the pace is really good and it's pretty interesting how many things they were able to squeeze into two 24 minutes long episodes. And while I knew how the story would end, I will admit that I was at the edge of my seat at the end, which definitely delivered. 
 
When it comes to the characters - Dejiko was stripped of any personality she previously had and became a very flat character. It's hard to imagine that such a temperamental, assertive and over all not-to-be-screwed-with girl would turn into such a shy girl that only hopes that senpai will notice her. I am glad that at least Puchiko kept her sarcastic and sassy personality, which I loved. There is also a Rabi~en~Rose in few scenes, but she doesn't talk or interact with main characters in any way, but it was nice to see her. 
 
The art style is pretty cute, but veeery simple. It can't match the art style used in Di Gi Charat Nyo. Colors were not so vibrant and some things reminded me of original Di Gi Charat - especially the use of simple sketches in crowded scenes. 
 
So, nothing that special, really, I'm afraid. I am giving an extra point for absolutely amazing and catchy music, as is always the case with Di Gi Charat. And another extra point because I am currently in love, so it had a slightly bigger impact on me - reviews are subjective after all.

          
 
       Helpful ===Foreword=== 
As you might know, this is a spin-off from Di Gi Charat, which I have never seen or read about in any great detail, so there is some stuff on which I just can't comment or write enough detail about. 
 
===Animation=== 
Not the strong point. The colours are simple, without any gradients used. The backgrounds are simple as well, but nicely drawn. The character designs are quite simple too, but they are cute. The notable thing is that as soon as there many characters on scene, like crowds, they are just drawn plain white with black lines. Something that doesn't actually ruin the animation in any way, or doesn't annoy the person watching it. Running animation is I think one of the better points. Sometimes there is a chibi scene thrown in, but they are done fairly well and are not annoying in any way. Overall the animation is poor, but I don't think it's a factor that affects the overall rating by much, but I was expecting something more complex than this. 
 
===Sound=== 
This special features quite a nice OP and ED, and fairly good background music, which is a bit on the simple side. There is also a French song in the second episode, which is quite good as well. 
 
===Story=== 
Since this is only two episodes long you can't expect anything complicated. It's a simple story about a girl who meets a boy. An unexpected encounter which starts off everything, and a misunderstanding as well to create some drama. It's a rather light and sweet story. Considering the fact that they had only two episodes I think that it was done quite well, with a good conclusion. 
 
===Characters=== 
This is a section on which I won't be able to comment too much since I don't know what the characters were like in the original Di Gi Charat. Overall they were good. Though this special lacks characters, but what would you expect from a two minute special? We barely get to know the names of four characters, and the rest is there just for comic relief. Overall the characters are good, and some are cute as well, like Puchiko. :) 
 
===Enjoyment=== 
I enjoyed watching this, since it was nice to take a break from all the other serious anime around which fills my mind with questions and useless answers, and also had a laugh over some light comedy which fits in well. However don't watch this if you want to see something serious. Watch this if you want to take a break and need something light, then you'll see the hidden beauty of this...

I don’t believe it myself. An entire anime series devoted to showing off the various ways a couple can knock boots… and even more. 
 
Well, let’s back up a bit. The series is only four episodes long, so that doesn’t qualify as an “entire anime series”. (Way to state the obvious).  I think that’s one of my biggest issues with anime of recent years-- much like this one, these anime are so generic in production and mundane when it comes to length that there is little entertainment value. It’s not even worth watching something so short, and it’s almost not worth reviewing and finding fault in it. But don’t worry because there are PLENTY of flaws in this piece of vomit. 
  
As for the story of the ova, “Step Up Love Story” I HAVE TO ADMIT that the initial opening to the show was not bad. Ignoring the first two minutes (please), the series begins in modest with the young, perverted and clumsy Makoto, and the silly and cute Yura.  It was very raunchy, but even for this anime, the opening episode starts the Onoda couples’ relationship off very modestly, and I expected it to continue to be decent, BUT BEWARE! It takes a nosedive in quality real quick. The manga’s redeemable factors are that it (somewhat) contains appeal and an involving story with the characters, even if it is all about S-E-X. This is not so for the ova. 
 
One note I might add is that, the sheer amount of gratuitous sex and imagery, along with the explicit nature of the sex scenes and dialogue in this anime are so bad, it’s almost vomit inducing. I honestly thought for a few moments that I had stumbled upon a hentai. And I have a zero-tolerance rule with hentai. Not that all hentai series are bad, but that just it: I’ve never been prompted to watch two characters have sex with each other, so I’ve never seen a hentai, therefore I have no right to judge the genre and I never will so don’t misunderstand me here. This one seems to be very close, but I’ll let others decide on that. Right now, I AM the judge for this putrid, raunchy anime. 
 
Speaking of judging, I also want to talk about the characters for this “anime.” If I were a real judge, I’d lock them up, because they aren’t likeable and unappealing and have nothing to do with the plot outside of sex……. But again sex is the only excuse for a plot here. If that was the aim, then job well done. Normally, I’d end my review here. Unfortunately, that isn’t going to fly this time. Since “Step Up Love Story” is indeed a seinen anime that is taking itself and its audience seriously and is not a hentai, I have the right to seriously pick the anime apart and critically review every aspect of the show. 
 
Starting off, we have the newlyweds, Makoto and Yura. Makoto is very……..estranged…and finds himself in very unfortunate places when gorgeous women are around. Although he initially comes off as respectable and even funny, because you’d be laughing at him, not with him, his character falls flat in the span of one episode. Once he marries Yura and the story begins, he has sexual fantasies of many of the women he comes across. His delusions of grandeur aremeant to be this anime’s attempt at echi comedy, but unfortunately these scenes come off as really…unnecessary in hindsight, since the show has enough ecchi, not to mention that it is typical to have the titular male character in the series  be tempted by fantasies. 
  
Yura is possibly my only likeable character here. Outside of the fanservice, Yura is still very sweet and naïve and has more personality than the rest of the cast. It may be favoritism, but you’d have to watch for yourself, and I hate that I have to say that too. I’m not a fan of ecchi, and I dislike this anime’s constant need to throw nudity in almost every scene, but I will fess up to my puckish self when it comes to Yura. It’s very…hard to look away sometimes. She’s everywhere, so even if I try to avoid it, there’s no chance I’ll succeed. 
 
Makoto and Yura have sexual tension constantly over the course of every episode. Once the characters are finally in each other’s presence, the heels are immediately thrown off, the pants come down, and the wife is playing rocking chair with the husband’s face. It’s impedingly sick. This anime’s excuse for a plot sickens me. It’s mundane, too, because it happens every episode. I am reiterating myself, but that really is it. Not once is there ever a break from the sexual tension, the disgusting scenes, or the crude dialogue. 
  
All the other characters only ramp up the sick sex talk, constantly ecchi and sexual references even more. There’s Kikuchi Miyuki, who is a minor character with a MAJOR desire to be Makoto’s playmate. In addition, there is the character, Kyouko, who is Makoto’s cousin and a gynecologist. In this show, her occupation says enough. These characters merely exist as “characters” so that there are identifiable voices to match with the characters when these couples go to the bedroom and under the sheets. All the characters, though Yura appeals slightly, are uninteresting and only sex livens them up… in other words, outside of sex, and despite Makoto’s…”imagination” no character really stands out. 
  
I’m moving on to the sound quality, but honestly, I don’t care about how the anime sounds. I’m sure that people didn’t pick up this particular anime for incredible music anyways. It’s not even watchable to begin with, but for the sake of those who will attempt to watch this ova, you’re not going to find a superb soundtrack. It’s composed of generic tracks that may suit the mood, but that’s all these songs do. The voice actors do a lot of…moaning and screaming throughout the show. For some reason, it happens particularly during the night scenes, in beds, bathroom stalls and off-screen sometimes. I guess the voices are suitable. If you like characters that whimper, scream and moan A LOT, this ova is right up your alley in that department. 
 
All in all, Futari Ecchi doesn’t have any aspects of an entertaining anime. It’s a horrible excuse for a romantic comedy, (unless romance is supposed to be a free-for-all for the spouses and sex is all you need to make a good story), not to mention the humor leaves a lot to be desired.  I desired humor when watching this filth and that’s what the premise of the ova initially gives off, but my hopes of ever receiving that become dashed quickly. It’s raunchy, sick, mundane and a waste of 100 minutes you could be spending watching a better ecchi romance comedy. I’m sure there are many. With Futari Ecchi, there are MANY factors made me give this the lowest possible score. The production value is (not shockingly) cheap, the story is just one big excuse to show off two characters having sex, and that is not my cup of tea. Especially when it comes to the “comedy” aspect of it. 
 
The worst thing about it is that this was one of the earliest times in my anime viewing life where I honestly felt like it was a waste. I felt like I should SERIOUSLY should be doing something better with my time. I felt like I had to get away from this anime—FAR AWAY. Overall, this ova is too insignificant since the presentation of the anime is piss-poor and moderately similar to a hentai anime, and like I stated previously, I have a zero-tolerance for things of that nature. No one will change that. 
 
Creator-Kun’s Score: 
 
Story: (1) It is an excuse to throw sex everywhere in the story. Some might say that is supposed to be the aim of this ova. If it’s a fact, that only proves me right and gives my score much more meaning … 
 
Art: (3) It’s bland and characters move oddly, in whatever they are doing and wherever they do “it.” Art style is poor, but the animation does its job…“barely”. No pun intended… 
 
Sound: (3) No song stands out with the soundtrack. The voice actors get boring quickly since all they do is moan and scream moan and scream. Even describing it is bad and redundant. 
 
Characters (1): Name one important character in this entire ova that does not have any relevance to the innumerable amount of sexual themes…(pause) AND is still relevant to the story. 
I thought so. 
 
Enjoyment: (1): I detest this ova. I don’t even want to keep reviewing this ova. 
 
OVERALL: I graciously grant the Futari Ecchi with the score of a 1. It is one of the greatest anime where it has been my displeasure to watch.  
 All jokes aside, it’s time to wrap this up simply. It’s just THAT BAD. The ova, “Step up Love Story,” is a “step down” in quality. A romantic comedy anime should be about romance and contain SOME humor (even if it comes off as cheesy). Instead, this anime is a raunchy sex-fest that is absent of humor; it is sickening, and the romance is only present because of sex. Sex shouldn’t take prevalence in a comedy or a romance story and definitely not as explicitly as it does with this ova. Do you know where sex should take prevalence? It should take prevalence in a hentai series, not an actual anime.  People who have tolerance may like this series. I can only speak for me. Obviously, I'm ranting now, since the purpose of a review after all, is to present my view and whether or not I’d recommend and/or praise the series. Sorry, I cannot praise Futari Ecchi in almost any aspect. Even if you are into this type of stuff, I plead with you to take up the manga rather than this horrid ova. Still, if you have a soft spot for bad romantic comedies and ecchi anime, you came to the right one, so go ahead and try this anime. Take in all in. Be my guest.  
 
 
 
I never want to talk about this series again. 


          
 
       Helpful That awkward moment when you are expecting a romantic comedy and the softcore porn rolls out... but what the hell right? Lets just talk about it. 
 
Makoto and yura are both 25 year old virgins and they just got married and are now realizing ""oh shit, I have no idea how to have sex."" Now there's a line between being a virgin and not knowing alot about what to do, and just straight-up sexual cluelessness and these two are really pushing into the latter category. However these two troopers just keep on trucking (or fucking as the case may be...) and these two crazy kids eventually get the hang of things. 
 
Along the way Yuras younger sister comes along and decides to give some sage wisdom (because shes a total slut ands gone around more than a nascar race), a few others offer advice, and at some point about halfway through they must just figure it all out because by episode three the focus is off of them not knowing what the opposite genders' sexual organs are, and moves onto all the crazy kinky adventures they can get into.  
 
Time to actually say what I thought, well, I thought it was good. It represents the sexual awkwardness that is very present those first times and how you really dont know a whole hell of alot, and its good for that. It also makes reference to the fact that when you havnt had any or much sex, you feel like everyone around you is a pornstar or something cuz in your eyes theyre experts(yuras sister, her friends, etc.) Yeah though, its good, you might as well watch it since its only two hours of your life.

          
 
       Helpful Futari Ecchi is an Adult ecchi comedy about people who really love each other. During the course of the series, they are learning to accept each other for the good and bad about themselves. Yes, there is some ecchiness in the 4 OVA's like the title suggests. However, very few animes have ever captured what it is really like to be married in the way that it has done. Off the top of my head, probably only Onegai Teacher did as good of job as Futari Ecchi in portraying the awkwardness of two people coming together in marriage for what ever reason in Anime during the last couple of years. It may not be a title for all anime lovers, but I would recommend it for someone wanting a romantic comedy that you can feel good about after you watch it. Just be sure to watch with someone you love by your side.

My overall rating for Ongaku Shoujo is 7/10. Is it good as a slice of life movie? Im not sure but its definitely a nice comedy.

          
 
       Helpful So I heard that an anime called Ongaku Shoujo was going to be made this year. Then I saw it was a 25-minute OVA before that, and I sat down to watch it. But I won't lie, this OVA is really bad. 
 
I mean, seriously. I've never seen something so absolutely insipid, vapid, and downright annoying. It's basically about two girls, a shy blue-haired girl and a perky blonde haired girl, who run into each other thanks to singing, decide to become idols, and a lot of drama happens. That's it. There's absolutely nothing about its storyline that makes any effort to stand out, it doesn't even try to make use of its potential or be interesting in any way. It's just a cookie cutter cutesy idol drama anime with no substance to it at all. Many anime I've seen that were similar to this one happened to pull off the premise much better, and the ham-fisted drama near the end really didn't endear me to it at all. It doesn't help that the characters are bland, empty, and have no substance to them at all, and their voice actresses overact to hell and back, and every single line that comes out of their mouth is hammy, screechy, high pitched, and downright grating on the ears, which is a shame because I know these actresses can put on MUCH better performances. 
 
Honestly, the only good thing about this OVA is the animation. It's bright and colorful, very stimulating to the eyes, and the character movement is very fluid, almost KyoAni-like in its smoothness. Unfortunately, that's where the OVA's good qualities end. 
 
But all of its flaws absolutely cannot compare to what I feel is the biggest detriment of this OVA: Haru. 
 
She alone basically ruined the entire OVA. Simply put, she is annoying as hell! Not only is her design really stupid-looking (Why does she have that big bow in her hair, along with all those other hair clips?! They're not necessary, and it looks way too tacky!), the show tries to present her as a fun, perky, enthusiastic, cheerful girl who wants to be friends with Eri, the blue haired girl, but the way the anime executes her overall character makes her come off as unrelentingly bratty, self-entitled, selfish, and almost creepily parasitic in her persistence in attaching herself to Eri in some of the worst, most dangerous ways possible. She's also a complete idiot who not only does stupid things, but never gets punished for them. For example, when she goes to school, she brings a cat with her, and the teacher doesn't even call her out on the fact that she brought a cat with her. Aren't cats not allowed on school property? She also has absolutely NO respect for privacy and boundaries whatsoever. She goes through Eri's belongings, goes after her in the hot springs, and worst of all, when Eri is struggling with reading a book out loud in class, what's Haru's solution? Why mess with her body without her consent and physically UNDO HER BRA RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! Oh, and at the end of the OVA, her solution to making Eri come up on stage is to put every embarrassing photo she took of her on display, on a big LCD screen, IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE AUDIENCE, EVEN NUDE PHOTOS, THEREBY HUMILIATING HER IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! 
 
You see what I'm getting at here? If someone did that to me, I'd report them for sexual harassment! But does Haru get in trouble for it? Nope! Well, to be fair, Eri does call out Haru on everything she's done, but it doesn't stick because it's all played for comedy, and Eri is meant to be seen as just a prude who won't accept Haru's so-called ""friendship."" Sakura, Eri's friend, is even worse in this regard because not only does she completely ignore Eri's discomfort and never makes any attempt to help, but outright encourages Haru's dangerous behavior! Seriously, if this were a horror or a Lifetime-drama movie, I'm pretty sure Haru's behavior would be presented in a much more dark and serious light, as it should be. But the anime doesn't realize the ramifications of Haru's actions and tries to make the audience see it as nothing but cute and endearing!...which it seriously isn't. At all. Honestly, I wanted to jump in there and save Eri from that parasitic little brat. She deserves better than to be their target. Also not helping matters is that Haru is extremely egotistical and self-entitled, convinced that she's hot stuff and is a great singer...when she actually sucks really bad at singing. Eri even tells her such. 
 
So...yeah. This OVA really could have been something good. Unfortunately, it's just not good. At all. This, my friends, is the prime example of how a really, really bad and badly written main character can completely ruin a show in its entirety. Thankfully, it seems like the creators realized this as well, since from what little they revealed recently, the upcoming TV series features a completely different storyline with a plethora of new characters, with Eri and Haru being just side characters now. I hope to God that the TV series doesn't make the same mistakes that this OVA did. Then again, Birdy The Mighty Decode turned a flawed OVA into a great TV series from what I've heard, so it can happen. 
 
But in the end, though, Ongaku Shoujo is utter crap, all because Haru's a little shit.

       Helpful Science fiction is arguably one of the most diverse genres in visual media, with series like Stargate, Farscape, and Babylon 5 enjoying a fair amount of commercial success. Even more than this, both the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises have become household names, and the impact of these two franchises dwarfs that of more recent shows.  
 
However, while television has enjoyed several successful science fiction franchises, it is anime that has produced more sci fi tales than almost any other medium. From space opera to cyberpunk, from utopian dream to dystopian future, from aliens to mecha, anime has, throughout its history, produced some of the most iconic and influential science fiction works in visual media (one example of this is the original Ghost in the Shell's influence on The Matrix).  
 
There's one small problem though. While there is a wealth of great sci fi tales in anime, there is one type that has largely been ignored, and that is science fiction in the classical style (i.e. Arthur C Clarke instead of Tengen Toppa). Imagine my surprise then, to find not just one, but two ""classic"" sci fi tales, and both are TO. 
 
Based on the manga 2001 Ya Monogatari (2001 Nights - a play on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""1001 Nights""), by Hoshino Yukinobu, the series was originally adapted as an anime in 1987. Unlike the previous iteration though, the story for TO is an adaptation of chapters 12 (Symbiotic Planet), and 14 (Elliptical Orbit), of the manga, with each episode being dedicated solely to that chapter. 
 
The first episode, Elliptical Orbit, is about a giant space station in orbit around the earth. The station is, for want of a better term, a giant gun that ""shoots"" cargo containers to the moon, but on this particular day there are unexpected visitors. 
 
Episode two, Symbiotic Planet, involves the potential colonization of an alien world upon which a myriad of species of fungi and symbiotic lifeforms grow. Two competing teams of scientists have been sent to study these species before any colonies can settle on the planet. 
 
One of the reasons why I like TO is because there is a very clear focus on the plot and, unlike many recent sci fi offerings, there is no attempt to curry favour with the audience by adding action where none is needed. While each episode does involve some form of combat at times, there is far more relevance placed on the human relationships, and any action is treated as nothing more than a product of the circumstances. In addition to this, the time dilation aspect of Elliptical Orbit is handled rather well, while the romanticism of Symbiotic Planet reminded me of nothing more than Romeo & Juliet. 
 
Unfortunately, while I consider the pacing of each episode to be pretty good, there are those who consider the series to be a little on the slow side, and although I can somewhat understand the perception, the speed and manner in which the plot develops is central to each tale. Given that each episode is an individual story in its own right I found that the pacing works very well, and draws the viewer into the tale in a very firm but gentle manner. 
 
In terms of looks, TO is one of the few anime made completely in CG. While this may not seem like a good choice at first, the use of CG allows for some truly breathtaking scenes, and adds a certain realism to structures like the space station in Elliptical Orbit that normal animation methods simply can't match. In addition to this, the animation is good throughout both episodes, with character movements being particularly notable for their fluidity.  
 
There is, however, one small issue. While TO may look great and have some quality animation, there is a remarakable lack of emotion from the characters. Granted there has been some effort put into facial expressions, but unfortunately this doesn't really work out too well, and in some cases can make a laughing character look psychotic. The sad part of it all is that full 3D animation has successfully managed to provide expressive characters, while CG still seems to be lagging behind in this department. 
 
This lack of expression is, thankfully, not reflected in the acting, a fact which makes the lack of emotion on the character's faces all the more noticeable. Elliptical Orbit features the vocal talents of Paku Romi and Ootsuka Akio in the two lead roles (Maria and Dan), while Symbiotic Planet has Hirano Aya and Fukuyama Jun playing the, pardon the pun, startstruck lovers Elena and Aon. The acting in both episodes is very good, and if the facial animation matched up to the quality each seiyuu displays, TO could have been truly excellent. 
 
As for the sound effects and music, the choregraphy in both departments is not only well executed, but surprisingly detailed, and while every scene is not dependent on atmosphere enhancing music, the tracks that are used are well chosen. 
 
While TO may have many good points in terms of audio and visuals, the same cannot be said of the characters. Elliptical Orbit, for example, really does warrant a more detailed look at the extremely complex relationship between Dan and Maria, in particular because of the time dilation aspect, while the lovers in Symbiotic Planet could really have done with more development and background. 
 
That said, TO is effectively a snapshot in time, and because of this the viewer is only privy to a small glimpse into the character's lives, especially given the running time of each episode. While there are those who wish for a little more in terms of detail and development, if one considers the show as nothing more than a glimpse into someone's life, then the lack of any real growth ceases to be a hindrance to one's appreciation of the anime. 
 
In all honesty, TO managed to surprise me, not just with its quality, but also in the areas it lacked. That said, the stories themselves are both intruiging and engaging, and hark back to the ""classic"" science fiction of yesteryear. Truth be told, I would recommend this to any sci fi fan as it is a singular example of how good ""classic"" science fiction can be when modern techniques are used to bring the story to life (unlike the mediocre Lensman movie and series). 
 
Hopefully there will be more shows of this type, especially as Planetes has already proven that ""classic"" sci fi anime can be very popular.

          
 
       Helpful When I picked TO up, its MAL rating was at 6.75 (and is probably going to get even lower).  Daunted by this low score, I didn't know whether to watch it or not. 
 
Thank God I did. 
 
 
==[Pros]== 
 
- Art/Animation.  Though this show may be 100% CG, it's 100% good CG.  The second episode proves that.  Save the characters, everything is so beautiful.  There's no glitches and mishaps you might see with hand-drawn works. 
 
- Soundtrack.  A lot of the time, the show simply pans out to let you soak in the art.  And it plays some great background music at the same time.  I usually don't take much note of a show's BGM, but TO really brought it out with minimal dialog and maximal (?) music. 
 
- Sci-Fi.  The best sci-fi (except mecha) stories make the technology seem both believable and commonplace.  TO accomplishes this.  It combines the new, creative ideas of light-speed traveling and planet colonization with the age-old plots of ""man waits for woman"" and ""Romeo and Juliet.""  The sci-fi puts a fresh new spin on the plots, and the plots make the sci-fi believable.  It's a win-win-win combination: the sci-fi is improved, the plots are un-cliched, and the viewers are guaranteed a great show. 
 
 
==[Cons]== 
 
- The design of the Bazooka in Episode One.  Honestly, that looks like a giant phallic symbol.  It looked wrong the moment I saw it, and I couldn't unsee it. 
 
- CG'd characters.  The animation only slips up with the characters.  Though normal people fidget and move around, most anime don't show that.  CG is different - if you don't make a CG character move around, it looks eerily unnatural.  However, TO goes overboard, making the characters move around TOO much. 
 
- CG in general.  A lot of people claim to be hand-drawn purists, but CG is in just about every anime (except for Miyazaki works).  TO just takes it to the next level.  I will admit that it took a while for me to get used to the CG, but it wasn't much of a problem after ten minutes or so. 
 
- Physics.  A lot of the stuff that happens doesn't follow the laws of physics.  People can't change direction in space by swimming.  You can't break through a window in a space station that easily. 
 
 
==[Conclusion]== 
 
I guess a lot of people must have dismissed this show as CG crap after watching one minute of it, or brainwashed mecha fans like more action with their sci-fi, because this show is clearly underrated.  I suggest you look past the CG and see the true value of TO.  You'll be glad you did.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"This season is every bit as enjoyable as the first two, for me. I like pretty much every character and really have fun watching this series. If you're expecting any huge character/relationship developments to happen in this season, they really don't.. and it's really frustrating.. though there's a little. But if you have fun watching the show, this is still definitely worth it. Maybe spoiler-sh ahead? idk but if there's a 4th season they better not keep dragging out this whole thing with Misaki acting like Usagi is just the perverted roommate most of the time or whatever. As always very cute art though not the best attention to detail, decent music, pretty good voice acting, and as always, great if you don't want something with tons of plot and character development but a generally light-hearted slice of life/romance and very fun watch.

          
 
       Helpful I'm not going to beat around the bush; Junjou Romantica is an absolutely fantastic anime. And season three is no exception! However, I believe that it is a must-do to watch the first and second seasons beforehand to fully understand the plot. Also, minor spoilers will be mentioned within this review. Without further adieu, let's go! 
 
First off, the character design. Studio Deen managed to capture the essence of the characters from the original 2008 anime, and further improved upon them. That is to be an expectation though, considering the seven year gap between the first and third seasons. The animation is fluid and well-produced, and didn't leave me disappointed. It really is magical to be seeing Junjou Romantica in 720p. 
 
And now onto the story. It was as enjoyable as the previous seasons, and introduced a new and intriguing love interest. There were lots of heartfelt scenes between Usagi-san and Misaki, which was more than satisfactory for me. I also loved seeing the though processes of each character elaborated upon, as I found the psychological aspects of each character to be of great interest. It made for a very enjoyable experience. 
 
However, I most certainly did have some issues with this season. In particular, my frustration was towards Misaki, Usagi-san's love interest. At the end of the OP, Misaki is shown blushing and shy, but then he jumps on Usagi-san and kisses him. That gave me high hopes that Misaki would finally be true to his feelings and also initiate things with Usagi-san for once. However, I thought wrong. The most that is shown of Misaki being assertive is him saying he should ""molest"" Usagi-san, and then some failed attempts to try and top him. Like seriously, what the hell even happened to Misaki's character development? In the second season he was able to openly express that he loves Usagi-san, yet in the third he can barely mutter it to himself? It's aggravating to say the least. 
 
In conclusion, Junjou Romantica is a fantastic anime and one that all fujoshi and romance fans in general would enjoy. The pros far outweigh the cons. Each episode was so drama-filled that it constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend all three seasons of this anime.

          
 
       Helpful Story (7/10): 
First of all, in this Junjou Romantica Season 3 is still continuously relationship of 2 men and new improvements such as grown ups, meeting new people and new expressing way of true love of both 2 men, it's quite fast pacing. However majorly focused on couple of Junjou Romantica, but from couples of Junjou Egoist and Junjou Terrorist are only appeared in 1 episode as minor focus, it's so disappointing, it's really pending to me the couple of Junjou Egoist and Junjou Terrorist, which is Junjou egoist is one of my favorite couple. 
 
Art (10/10): 
I am very impressed and happy of the animation which is very highly improved as high quality of animation, unlike from season 1 and 2 it's looks like old, of course they keep on keep improving the animation in these generations. Also I'm so flattered the art of the characters, to be honest it's really hot men I've ever seen! 
 
Sound (9/10): 
The background music is finely new and I love the 3rd season of opening song! 
 
Character (9/10): 
All of the characters are quite improving new, some a bit of personality development I've seen, also not quite over dramatic characters like from season 1 and 2 they are over dramatic, and now from season 3 expressing so comedic faces! Then, very unexpected one character appeared from anime of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi and wow really crossover! 
 
Enjoyment (8/10): 
From my enjoyment, commonly I enjoyed where the romantic scenes of both men and more lovely kisses, I really melt myself seriously! But I'm so disappointed again from couples of Junjou Egoist and Junjou Terrorist only 1 episode appeared. 
 
Overall (8/10): 
Lastly in my overall of this season 3, it's quite good improvement and finely showing the story, hopefully I wish there could be a season 4, next time from couples of Junjou Egoist and Terrorist should be appear at least 2 episodes. After this Junjou Romantica Season 3, and now I'm waiting for the next crossover anime of Junjou Romantica which is the 3rd season of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi.

Seemingly all of the girls want to have sex with him because the school only recently started admitting male students. Takuro seems like a normal student, but what the girls later realize when they try to take advantage of him is that he has a secret. Takuro has an ""Ultimate Sex Power"" that becomes the focus of St. Arcadia's sexual power struggle.","['Hentai', 'School', 'Yuri']",none,"I watched Discipline because it was done by the same guy that was behind Bible Black. Now, I had played the computer game first, and I while the sex scenes were a little extreme for my tastes, the story wasn't too bad. When I watched this, I was highly anticipating seeing how it would unfold in anime form.  
 
Boy, was I dissapointed.  
 
This is Discipline-In-Name-Only. Same characters, and while some scenes from the game are maintained, it's a totally different story.  
 
First, there's the bastardization of two of the characters, antagonist Leona/Reona Morimoto (I'm calling her Leona from this point on) and Maiko Kaneda. In the game, Leona was this incredibly well done villain where nothing was sacred when it game to humiliating her enemies. She's described in the game as a demon-child, though unlike Bible Black this is just a way of describing her. In the series, she's still quite twisted, only she seems a lot more tame, and not nearly as twisted, and this I feel kills the character. She's also not quite as smart.  
 
Maiko Kaneda, the other character from the game I enjoyed, goes from being a seemingly heartless girl (who's cruel but not as cruel as Leona) to actually growing into a more supportive role. In the game, Kaneda seems to care only about school, and is colder than a body on ice. In this series, she's warmed up a bit, actually helping people out. Again, this kills what I liked about the character.  
 
The plot is also totally different, and some of the scenes they added in just completely defies the original game. While the game had some totally absurd scenes (like Leona showing up at school first in a Ferrari and then a frickin' Harrier jet), this has some things that go even beyond that on the absurdity index.  
 
If you played the game, and you liked the game, STAY AWAY FROM THIS. This is like watching the Super Mario Brothers movie, or Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. Even if you have a casual interest, STAY THE HELL AWAY. You'll thank me for saving you the time, and possibly money and or/bandwidth and hard drive space. 

          
 
       Helpful Discipline: The Record of a Crusade is based on a game by the same team that produced Bible Black a few years back. However, the Ero-Animes were produced by different companies. Personally, I prefer Discipline over Bible Black due to the complete absence of the occult material that the Bible Black was based on. It's just not my cup of tea. Discipline is more a comedy/action/myster&shy;y series with very heavy sexual themes, after all, it's Hentai. The characters are what one would expect from it's source, very well drawn and most sex scenes are very detailed in the 6 episodes that the OVA covers.

          
 
       Helpful Being a big fan of Bible Black, I approached Discipline with both anticipation (it might be good) and caution (it might be grossly inferior, being done by a different team at the same studio or something like that). After watching it through once, I have to say I still have mixed feelings, but of a different nature. 
 
To simplify it, Discipline is inconsistent. At some points, the animation is stellar and the characters are deep... but in others, those same characters aren't draw as well, the dialogue and story descends into absurdities, and I wonder if those parts were really from another anime but spliced in.  
 
Although some similarity can been seen between this and Bible Black, I don't think it is an appropriate comparison. They may have a few details in common sometimes, but BB was self-consistent and high quality... this, was all over the place in terms of pacing of story, details of plot, and mood (serious/comedy).  
 
Moreover, there is too much random sex in this anime.  
 
Not that they are too much sex scenes, but rather, they are too random and arbitrary. There's not much opportunity to gain any appreciation or knowledge of the characters, and the tension that was build in the graphic novel is lacking here.  
 
For that matter, the art in the graphic novel (a slightly interactive PC game) was better presented. Given that the characters there had much more depth, it seems key members from the graphic novel team were missing from the anime planning and production team.  
 
I can only guess, but, overall, I still have to say that it has mostly good points (I did rate it 7/10 overall), so I'll describe them briefly: 
 
Excessive Ero Content:  
 
I never thought I'd say that an ero/hentai anime has ""too much"" sex, but because the sex rudely interrupts the story and feels forced much of the time, and in addition, the characters have beyond-human sexual endurance (sometimes due to ""special medicine"", apparently, without spoiling what little plot there is), and that means for tons of long sex scenes, orgies, and a string of encounters that seems never-ending.  
 
Excessive Unique Plot: 
 
I won't spoil the details, but, the plot goes from a fairly typical school setting quickly into odd, and by the end, is totally unbelievable. I'm not sure if they meant it to be funny, or believable if you stretch your imagination, but I just laughed at it... I get the impression that the writing team just went crazy and put in whatever they felt would be potentially entertaining, forcing the various parts of the plot to link together, even if they didn't fit.  
 
Excessive Sex Scenes: 
 
Oh, wait, I mentioned this already. But, I should mention this again, because it seems that the only thing these characters do in this anime is have sex, dream about having sex, set up organizations in order to ensure they can have much more sex, and scheme and plot to force people to have more sex. 
 
Summary: 
 
This is a lot of mindless sex, with an over-the-top plot which is impossible, even for an imaginary world, and can be treated as entertaining if you don't worry too much. 
 
However, the overall quality is inconsistent, and the story was better presented in the graphic novel. So, comparisons to said novel, or other anime (esp. Bible Black, by the same studio apparently) will show this as coming up short.

Rin grew up in a remote village with her family and was taught to keep her power secret, while Finis lives and performs in the royal palace. 
 
Rin's happy and peaceful life is shattered after she saves an injured knight named Henry Leobort with her song of healing. She was seen by soldiers who proceeded to attack her village in hopes of capturing her. With nowhere else to go, she and her inventor brother Al begin a journey to the capital. 
 
Finis finds herself falling in love with Henry and, knowing that the greedy and spiteful Prince Lood Bernstein IV desires her, must hide their relationship. She wants to help people with her songs, but with war on the horizon, she worries that Lood will order her to cast her magic in the battlefield. Only time will tell how her destiny and Rin's will intersect, as the two of them struggle to find their paths.

Guided by destiny, the two young women each face an arduous journey as the shadow of war looms over the kingdom, tainting their miraculous songs with the blood of innocents. Loved ones meet their deaths as silent screams echo through a stone prison, and Rin and Finis hope that their last song will be one of hope.
","Lost Song is very cute but also a average anime. 
 
For the first 5 or 6 episodes this show carries itself very well with the lovable main charterer with the cute supporting cast and songs  and has a very cheerful story but after the plot twist in episode 6 the show gets very confusing and doesn't explain the change very well and expect you to just adapt to the new change in statues quo.  
The plot twist in episode 6 also ruins on of the relationships that a pretty large amount of screen time decanted to it too and try match up the guy with one of the supporting cast which I could see someone drop the series because of that although that really isn't a flaw but it could be handled way better then it was and for anyone invested in that relationship it was pretty annoying but it did make sense on why they did that. 
And this is probably more of a personal preference kind of thing but I wish it had a bigger verity of songs instead of the 6 or so that we had. They started to get repetitive by near the end of the series but besides that they where all very good. 
 
Despite how much I enjoyed Lost Song it still has some very big issues and I wouldn't be surprised if someone dropped Lost Song by the 8-9th episode but I would recommend watching it

          
 
       Helpful If there's one thing I have to say about this anime: It's incredibly generic. The music and art is very nice and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it seemed like the anime played way too safe to the point they're not taking any risks. 
 
Story: This part is its weak point. The story felt like those generic original stories you find on Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev trying to be the next Disney movie. Because it is. It's very predictable to the point that you can just go in blind and able to make an accurate picture of what's going to happen next, plays way too safe and the context of the story has been done a million times over every media you can imagine. Now, that doesn't mean they screwed up the most generic story a 5 year old can think of, which thankfully they didn't, and I do like to watch it when I get home from uni, there is this plot twist that kinda got me off guard and I thought this anime starts getting interesting, but other than that, it doesn't have anything that'll excite me. 
 
Art: I find the art style to be pretty good. The environment is pretty and the characters look nice. Although that chest on Pony is distracting and out of place for this anime. The animations, I had to say is alright. Most part, the animators did well, but there's some part that are choppy that my eyes snap to and I get distracted because of it. Like someone disappearing on a horse out of thin air. I didn't know how that happened since it's 2D. 
 
Sound: The music is pretty good. Konomi Suzuki's and Yukari Tamura's singing were pretty excellent and I do find the OP and ED catching and got me in. But compared to other animes of the season, the music is generic. As for the sound effects.... ehhh alright I guess. 
 
Characters: Just like the story: incredibly generic and you can predict their personalities just by face value. That glasses boy? An aspiring scientist and the smart guy of the group. The knight guy? Knight in Shining Armour that's always good and the princess falls to. That General? General Ripper. Hell, even the two main characters? Pretty much Anna and Elsa in anime. Hell, you could tell their personalities just by their attractiveness. If they look good, that's because they're good. If they look dark and/or ugly, expect them to be against you or dicks. That doesn't mean I don't like them (in fact I do like the glasses boy who wants to be a scientist and the smart guy of the group, and Anime!Anna), but nothing about them is any original. I've seen these tropes applied to these guys with slight variations. 
 
Enjoyment: While the genericness of the story and characters distract me a lot, I do enjoy the anime especially for the music and maybe the art. I've heard that this is Konomi Suzuki first take on being the MC of the anime and honestly, she did alright. 
 
Overall, this anime is generic and doesn't stand out in that season. It tries way too hard to be a family friendly Disney anime, but it comes off as a team of amateurs trying to write a story that's BEING a family friendly Disney anime. If I wanna watch something similar to this, I'd go and buy a ticket or stream some Disney movie like Frozen, or go to Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev and read their stories there.

          
 
       Helpful When I watch Lost Song´s first episode,I describe it as ""If Disney and Netflix made an anime"", because the first episode is just like that. (SPOILER BEGINS) Rin is a girl who has a ""superpower"" of making diferent kinds of spells just by singing, the power of singing. She lives in a town with his sister Mel, his friend Al and his grandfather, who doesn´t let Rin sing and use his power. One day, away from the town, Rin and Al find one of the best swordsman of the Kingdom, Leobort, who it has been hurt. Rin uses his powers to heal him, but one of the soldiers of the Kingdom hears her and informs to their superiors, who then traveled to the town to search for the girl who has the power of singing, and when they don´t find out were she was, they destroy the town, killing the grandfather and the sister Mel. Here is when the adventure of Rin and Al begins, with the objective of finding another woman with the same power of singing Rin has. (SPOILER ENDS). The story is not something we´ve never heared of . The artistic part is great, with a dedicated animation expected from ONA. The soundtrack is very good, expected from a anime of singing. The characters are good, but they could be better, but I´m only at episode 7, so the show must go on. My personal enjoyment was a very good experience, specially when the show evolves (and omg episode 7, what a crazy episode). And now, for Overall, I give this anime an 8. The show starts very slowly, for like 3-4 episodes, but at this moment, in episode 7, i can just say, (SPOILER WARNING): HOLY SH*T IT´S RAINING METERITES!

4,2071,37,8.730512277,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Hana yori Dango (Movie),"Set in an alternative timeline to the TV series and manga, the movie features a classic Cinderella story told through the medium of 80's dance. Tsukushi Makino is a trainee dancer in a New York Performance group, struggling to become the star of the show with the help of Rui Hanazawa and Tsukasa Doumyouji. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Eitoku Academy (英徳学園, Eitoku Gakuen) in Yamanote, Japan is a prestigious school that caters to children from upper-class families. Hence, Tsukushi Makino, who comes from a middle-class family, fulfills the literal meaning of her name, as she is initially considered to be the ""weed"" of the school.
The school is ruled by the F4 (""Flower Four""), four young men from Japan's wealthiest families. Tsukasa Domyoji is the son of the wealthiest, most powerful family in Japan. They initially bully Tsukushi when she stands up to them. However, Domyoji eventually takes an interest in her because she is the only girl in the school who stands up to him.
Tsukushi, however, is repulsed by his hot-headed nature and bullying demeanor, falling instead for soft-spoken and sensitive Rui Hanazawa (Tsukasa's best friend since childhood). This love triangle forms the basis of the entire series.
The other two members of the F4 are Akira Mimasaka, the laid-back peacemaker of the group, and Sojirou Nishikado, an unrepentant playboy. They both usually have at least one girlfriend at any one time; Akira prefers older women because the women of his household (his mother and two younger sisters) are quite childish. Sojirou is happy to be in casual relationships with many women, although we later discover that at one time he was in love with a childhood friend.
Over time, Tsukushi's feelings towards Tsukasa evolve, as she begins to appreciate the degree of change that occurred in Tsukasa once he fell in love with her. However, because of the difference in social class, Tsukushi and Tsukasa's relationship is blocked by Tsukasa's mother, Kaede (but supported by his elder sister, Tsubaki, who becomes friends with Tsukushi).
","Ok, so I binged watched Boys Over Flowers (anime), binged the Manga, as well.  So, I decided I had to suffer through this. 
 
It's so bad.  They used the name of Boys Over Flowers to tell a completely different story, in a different setting.  ""Alternate timeline"" crap always annoys me.  The only thing that this ""movie"" shares with the manga/anime is the name and characters.  That's it.  Just a way to make money and milk a little more out of the cow.   
 
The storyline was bad, and as I mentioned, the characters only LOOK like those from Boys Over Flowers, other than that, no real resemblance.  The used the same opening theme.  It's like someone saw the anime opening and decided to write a bad fanfic based on it.  On an opening animation!  
 
Highly disappointed.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Ok So the original movie is broken up into 3 parts on YouTube -- with no subtitles, there is also a Fan Dub Version of the movie, which definitely soften my feelings of the original series -- that left me feeling disappointed and I may write a review on why, but the Fan Dub Version of this on YouTube Made me LOL so hard, that it soothe any disappointment I may have gotten from the original series.  
 
The story line of this movie actually matched the intro, As I watched the series I wondered when the intro and story line would over lap it never did -- which makes me wonder why they didn't just create a new intro, I mean if your advertising dancing I assume that dance will be a big part of the series, since I watched to experience then, to review what it is I feel for a certain anime.  
 
After finishing the anime that I felt was extremely dragged out, I was happy to see a 30 mini-movie that actually went with the intro, the fan dub was the best out of watching all of the series & the original ova video b/c it's funny, and contains a bit more substance to it. This review is for the Fan Dubbed version on YouTube.

          
 
       Helpful Well let me first start of by saying that as much as a big fan I am of Hana Yori Dango, I give this movie an overall 6. Well, mainly because this movie was wayy too short and completely off track from the original plot, which by the way~ is why I loved HYD in the first place. Also, this was a condensed movie of only 30 minutes long, which is why I felt it was missing more material. It was quick paced and not as developed as I would've wanted it to be... However, if your a MAJOR fan of HYD, enjoy short length movies, and dancing!! then maybe you might like this movie.

                        Kaguya,  love is war,  whatever you take to calling it,  is one pleasantly surprising anime.   This show,  its what happens when a studio takes different hand fulls of cliche mess that we would normally roll our eyes at,  and converts them into a perfect ratio of  ingredients for creating comedic gold.   
 
 
              While the story for love is war isn't overly complex, this telling of two tsundere in love, was done with a snipers precision.  The anime through its execution sports an impressive list of sins: one room settings, limited supporting roles,  scenario specific perspectives,  over abundant interior monologue, low brow humor,   flip flopping character directives...     I could go on.   All these things have historically led to sub par entertainment.  So, WHY couldn't I stop laughing?  I can only assume that even though the head games of love between a ""princess and a pauper"" was the theme,  comedy was the drive.   From the back and forth scenarios, and sketch comedy panel type schemes,  almost every moment induced laughter.    Once in a while the story would dip into the ridiculousness of their situation,  leading to some somber moments; but almost always, the low points were used as a set up for a punch line.    Even when the show begins to tug at your heart strings, it immediately lets them go ever so gently.    All my laughing till I cried aside,  the story is a little to conveniently ridiculous..   so I feel pretty fair in awarding it an [8/10]. 
 
 
                 The art,     I feel like the illustration level of this show could have been achieved for the better part of the last decade.   It was kind of lazy, as compared to the hundreds or so shows released in that time period.  Contradicting that,  I believe they took that ""level"",   and conveyed their visual intentions perfectly.   While it was ""simple"",   there were one or two sequences that were mechanically hypnotizing,  and their use of visual aids to support their gags was artistic comedic timing at its finest.  That balanced use of weak sauce levels out my art score to [7/10]  
 
               Winter 2019 was a season of tasty tunes,  and this show was no exception.   Sporting a supper funky opening song, a highly energetic closing theme, and the clever variety of other scene setting sound effects do nothing but raise this show up into the spotlight. To stress my next critique, I want to point out there is a danger in having a limited cast for an entire season. If there is any weakness in the performance or execution of a limited cast, it will be easily identified.  The voices actors of Love is War, and the editors, never dropped the ball, not once.   You can tell a lot of effort went into bringing that silly little lot to life.    The impartial yet slightly judgmental narrator, paired with all the other audible bits,   earn an extremely rare ((outside of enjoyment I rarely give a)) [10/10].  BRAV-Ohhhhhhh. 
 
 
              Characters were great.  If I tried explaining them outside of the show,  they wouldn't sound very impressive.  ONCE AGAIN,  elements of the mundane were forged into greatness.  You will have to check the show out and get to know them for yourself to understand.  While I did for the most part love the characters, there were a few supporting individuals that kind of flopped.   Not the performance of,  just their existence as a whole.   I'ts not as terrible as I make it sound,  and was only so bad to lower my Character score to a 9/10]. 
 
 
            My love for this show is a [10/10].  I was watching scenes on repeat, and I rarely do that.   I know I just spent a few paragraphs backhandedly complimenting the program, but i sincerely meant all of it.   A good analogy for this Anime would be,  They took everyday car parts, and built a race winning formula one car. It shouldn't have worked, but it did. As kaguya-sama races around the 5 point rating system,  it earns an impressive  8.8 that I have no issues rounding up to a overall [9/10].

the exact time of me writing this review 
 
after watching the last episode, i'm not sure if everyone felt the same thing as i am but truthfully, i'm filled with mixed feelings of happiness, sorrow. 
before that, let me explain this series in a bigger picture. 
 
kaguya sama is just a normal romantic comedy, we have 2 main characters who is naive in their own way. im not saying this is a bad thing. in fact, their naiveness of love is what makes this anime worth watching. it takes me back to my high school life where love life is such a beautiful thing. as i watch both of the mc doing their best to have their crush love them back, it really makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. im happy because i get to see their hilarious everyday life as they encounter each other, but at the same time i felt sorrow because it REALLY takes me back to high school life. to be honest, reminiscing high school life is a pain. i just can't get over the fact that the best time of my life is over. the care-free life and seeing all friends in the same place is such a beautiful memory. 
welp, enough with that, lets get right to the point. 
 
like i said, kaguya sama is just a normal rom-com. but what really makes me love this anime is their comedic narratives. here we have some kind of moderator who explains everything in such a hilarious way, we have funny everyday skits thats full of surprises, we have the other 2 mc who makes everything even more hilarious and many more. i don't know if im just having lack of research materials but i feel like this is the only anime that has done something like this. in the end, kaguya sama is funny in it's own way. 
 
[SPOILER FREE] this paragraph is something that doesn't really need to be here but i just feel like i should write something about the ending.i watch this anime just for fun, nothing serious, just to have a relaxing time on the couch. but seeing how they concluded the anime is just amazing. i was smiling on my own and damn wasn't expecting to feel this way with this kind of anime. i just can't think of a better ending than what we got, it was perfect. with that, my post-anime depression is back.

       Helpful Kaguya-sama: Love is War is what every modern adaptation of an episodic series should strive for. There are significant changes, but if anything they add to the spirit of the adaptation. It is no stretch to say that these changes provide something genuinely charming for the old readers and new viewers alike. Perhaps the episodic nature of the series (Scenes are broken into ""battles"") offers some degree of lenience from serious consequences, but what the staff have chosen to do with that leeway is impressive.  
 
Story: 9/10  
The story is an episodic romantic comedy which consists of multiple battles between the student council. These battles transform the mundane into the magnificent. Despite having heard the jokes a second time, they are still amusing in the same way that one might find the witch's trial scene from Monty Python amusing. There is a great degree of polish to the dialogue and the characters development is interwoven competently. The one flaw is that much of the humor in Kaguya-sama is constrained to the genre. In spite of this, its execution in subverting expectations and inventiveness is first rate.  
 
Art: 10/10 
A-1 Studio delivers a strong impact and precision with its visuals, the animation is consistently good. Scenes are sometimes adapted in ways which even further show off character animation and deliver the narrative more effectively. The staff has made a lot of effort to exceed what was expected from the source material and above what is expected from the industry.  
 
Sound: 9/10 
Most of the set music is fine and properly matches the setting. My reason for withholding a point is based on my lack of fondness for the opening song. General reception is that most people like it, so take my quibble lightly. The voice actors are very skilled in delivering lines which cover a huge array of human expression. 
 
Character: 8/10 
Despite the series episodic nature, there is still tangible advancement of character from episode to episode. That being said, it is slow and the characters are predictable. After one episode you should know what you're signing up for, so I think one episode is enough to judge if this series is for you.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
My opinion is that I could not conjure anything as imaginative as this show up, and that makes it entertaining for me. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
At three episodes in, Kaguya-sama Love is War is poised to overtake Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun as my favorite entry in the subverted romantic comedy genre.

During the party, Yuuta notices Rikka has gone missing and searches for her. When he finds Rikka, he notices that she is acting strange and quickly figures out that she and Sanae are both drunk! How will this Christmas party turn out for the budding couple? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Yūta Togashi is a boy who, during junior high school, suffered from ""chūnibyō"", believing that he possessed supernatural powers and calling himself the ""Dark Flame Master"", therefore alienating himself from his classmates. Finding his past embarrassing, Yūta attempts to start off high school where he does not know anyone, free from his old delusions. This proves to be difficult, however, as a delusional girl in his class, Rikka Takanashi, learns of Yūta's past and becomes interested in him.
As the plot progresses, Rikka becomes more attached to Yūta, who, despite finding her delusions irritating and embarrassing, accepts her.

","This short episode is the continuation of the first season of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and after watching it you start to wonder why it wasn't just included with the rest of the season. 
 
Considering it's only one episode, I shall try to keep this review rather concise. 
 
The story progresses a tad further than the original season did, although ultimately leaving you with the feeling you were wishing for more. The character development wasn't really apparent, but then again, nothing really happens in a single episode, so I can't be too harsh on such a matter. 
 
The art is pretty impressive, and makes the overall experience a whole lot better. The soundtrack in this single episode wasn't really striking, nor did it leave an impression, so I'd say it was rather forgetful. 
 
Overall you get exactly what you'd expect. If you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy this as well, just don't expect anything different. 


          
 
       Helpful This is a nice little extra episode. Slowing down after the finale, Christmas is here and the friends are trying to get Rikka and Yuuta more romantically close. They through a party for just the few of them. Things happen and mistakes are made, but in the end its just Rikka and Yuuta that control their relationship and progress at their own pace. Rikka is nervous about love and does not fully understand it and Yuuta is patient, willing to wait as long as possible to give Rikka time to understand her feelings and what she wants to do. It's a sweet episode, full of laughter and happiness. 

          
 
       Helpful Hey, another episode of Chuu2, isn't it cool? Yeah. Before I start, just want to let you know that I never read the light novels, and I don't really know what will happen in the aftermath, and of course, SPOILERS ALERT. So please read at your own will. (And BTW, review-virgin here, so please be kind until a good review comes out, lol) 
 
Good episode. And that's how at least I can describe it. Got rewarded for what I came for. Classical Chuu2. 
Had my laughs with Sanae and Nibutani, had my dokidokis with Yuuta and Rikka. But again, that's it. 
 
STORY: So we start sometime after the last episode from season 1, with the same things going as always for the Chuu2 gang, until they decide to host a christmas party. Since no one can do it, Deko steps up and offers her house, and so the OVA goes. 
 
Aside from our favorite number 1 christmas anime cliche (accidentally drunk girls) everything went okay, giving highlight to the ""femslash"" (as Commie would put) and the RikkaYuuta ""so close yet so far"" moment. Not bashable, though, as you couldn't expect for DAT development to happen on an OVA, after all. If there are any character development let's save it for season 2, thus earning a steady 6 on my CHARACTER and another 6 on my STORY review. 
 
SOUND AND ANIMATION; since the studio animated this right after or during animating the first season, you couldn't expect the powerful Kyoto Animation to disappoint. And they didn't. Everything from the animation part was nice and it maintained the same feeling of the original work. Soundtrack was good as we expect from KyoAni, even though the return of ""seizure OP"" does manage to be a bother, but it's nothing too big. Pretty much an 8 for both. 
 
Should you take your time to watch it? Sure! Since you can consider it as a prequel to the second season, with Yuuta and Rikka growing together as a couple and overcoming their problems (or so as I hope it will play out). If you are someone who didn't really like the first season, you should skip it as it doesn't add much.  
If you didn't like the announcement of the second season and the movie, don't be mad though. As a fellow fan of these other animes I'm sure as hell Haruhi, Hyouka, FMP or even Rewrite will get their own spotlights in the future (maybe Rewrite is just a big dream? lol) 
 
Since good things and ""bad things"" are even, and it felt normal, I'll leave it as an 6 (fair) OVERALL and ENJOYMENT for me, since the whole episode was just an opportunity for us to see the gang again, and perhaps have a sneak peek at the future season. It was pretty nice.

4,134,40,8.690950895,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Gunslinger Girl,"In the heart of Italy, the Social Welfare Agency rescues young girls from hospital beds and gives them a second chance at life using the latest in cybernetic advancements. With their artificially enhanced bodies, the girls are brainwashed and trained as assassins to carry out the dirty work of the Italian Government. Despite all the modifications, they are still just children at heart, struggling for recognition from those they love, even knowing the love they feel is manufactured. This tragic tale unfolds as these girls grapple with their emotions in an agency that treats them as nothing but ruthless killers. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Psychological', 'Military', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']","Set in Italy, Gunslinger Girl follows the exploits of the Social Welfare Agency (often referred to as simply ""the Agency""), ostensibly a charitable institution sponsored by the Italian government. While the Agency professes to aid the rehabilitation of the physically injured, it is actually a military organization specializing in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism. It is composed of two independent branches: Public Safety, its surveillance and intelligence-gathering division, and Special Ops, the anti-terrorist division.
Special Ops is itself divided into Sections 1 and 2, the latter of which employs young girls who have experienced traumatic and near-death experiences fitted with cybernetic implants as agents. The implants, which consist of synthesized muscles and carbon fiber frames, result in heightened strength and reflexes as well as high resilience to damage and pain.
Each girl is paired with an adult male trainer, or ""handler"", and together they are referred to as a fratello — Italian for ""brother"". The handler is responsible for the training, welfare and field performance of his charge, and is free to use whatever methods he considers suitable. While these methods vary according to the handler, a common part of each girl's regimen is brainwashing called ""conditioning"", which produces a deadly assassin with unquestioning loyalty to her handler but, if used excessively, also limits her life span.
Each fratello exhibits a unique dynamic. Most of the handlers have police or military backgrounds and were recruited directly into Section 2. Most also chose their own cyborgs from a list of candidates, though some appear to have been assigned a cyborg. The Social Welfare Agency primarily concerns itself with dealing with the Padania Republic Faction (PRF or RF), an organization seeking an independent Northern Italy through acts of terrorism and bribery.
","Despite the title, Gunslinger Girl is far from an action title. On the contrary, it is actually a drama that focuses on character relationships. While it does contain action, it is far from the main focus as there are only a handful of action scenes throughout the 13 episode series. 
 
The show focuses on the Social Welfare Agency which, on the surface, is an Italian government sponsored charity organization. However, this is a front for the real purpose of the agency, a sort of anti-terror/anti-crime organization. A branch of this organization that directly handles these problems employs not only well trained gunmen, but also cyborgs that happen to also be young children. The reason for this is simple, the mechanical modifications would be difficult for an adult to bear, but a younger human is able to adapt to these changes much more easily. Along with training they are paired up with a handler (the team is called a fratello, or sibling), and undergo a brainwashing process called conditioning. Conditioning is a process that allows the cyborgs to be more efficient and loyal in battle, but also shortens the life of the cyborgs. 
 
As was said, the show is a drama, not an action title. The majority of the season is spent introducing and developing the relationships between the handler and cyborgs in each fratello. Some handlers are stricter with their cyborgs, while others are more coddling and there are those in between. The show explores the moral, psychological and social consequences of not only the fact that young girls are being used to fight terrorism, but also the entire concept of conditioning.  
 
This is almost to the show’s weakness, though. The show is indefinitely slow paced to a fault and there isn’t any sort of overlying plot. The show spends the first nine episodes giving us character introductions and developing the concept, but the final four episodes are spent with two separate incidents. While this is treated as the ending to the show, it lacks any sort of proper climax. That being said, the show does a decent job with the characters and development. The show as a whole manages to tug at the heartstrings, though it never manages to really pull at them. 
 
The animation is good, working best in the few action scenes given, though the action is usually one sided almost never inspiring much danger towards the protagonists. The music is wonderful, using a variety of orchestral pieces to slightly upbeat jazz for a few dire scenes. The soundtrack is beautiful and is the key in helping the atmosphere of the show. 
 
In the end, Gunslinger Girl is definitely not for everyone. The show is slow, and fails to have build tension when needed. However, it is above average and should be watched by a viewer who is in the mood for a short drama. 


          
 
       Helpful I've seen a lot of 10/10 reviews on this site, and I think that's a pretty big stretch, but Gunslinger Girl is nevertheless a solid, good to very good but not great show that I'm glad I watched. I think the proper rating is about 7.5, but this site only allows whole numbers so I'll be generous and round up as opposed to down, as I guess it's SLIGHTLY closer to an 8 than a 7 if you held a gun to my head and made me choose. 
 
Art- 
 
I liked the art style a whole heck of a lot. The presentation as a whole is likely the strongest point of the show. From the gorgeous opening sequence to the sharp, crisp character models that superbly convey the omnipresent melancholy and desperation of the story to even more subtle touches such as the expertly crafted and beautiful clip that plays in the background on the blu ray episode select screen, you're in for a visual treat free of CGI and over the top special effects from start to finish. This show is truly beautiful in its presentation. 
 
Sound- 
 
The music, which to me is also part of the presentation, is GORGEOUS! This is seriously some of the highest quality and most gorgeous music you're ever going to hear in an anime and it's always super fitting to the scene and the tone of the current situation. The composer, Toshihiko Sahashi, has a lot to be proud of. 
 
Likewise, the voice acting was covered by a team of established and accomplished professionals who, as always, nailed it. Rico's voice in the dub is a bit annoying in my opinion but that's a minor nitpick as opposed to an actual problem with the show. Again, not to be a broken record, but the presentation of the show is excellent and there is very little to complain about in this department. 
 
Character- 
 
The main cast of five Gunslinger Girls are all likable, sympathetic figures and they're all badasses. Likewise, most of the handlers, especially Jose, are likable and believable. This anime doesn't have a blatantly obnoxious or blatantly unnecessary character the way many others do.  
 
The problem here is in the length and structure of the anime. With only 13 episodes, which is definitely too short for having so many main characters and so much potential in the core concept of the story, and with each of the five girls having an episode devoted almost solely to introducing and developing them, very little room is left (only eight episodes after taking away the five ""special to this character"" episodes) for an overarching story or for further character development. Other than the continued day to day, week to week operations of Section 2 and the continued relationship developments between the girls themselves or between girls and their handlers, there really isn't much of anything in the way of an overarching plot. There simply isn't enough time with the low episode count to properly develop five main characters PLUS their handlers, nevermind characters beyond that. 
 
Enjoyment- 
 
I liked what I watched, as the presentation was gorgeous from start to finish and most of the characters were really likable and believable, but the episode count is simply too low, in my opinion by quite a lot, to properly develop the characters and build a proper story. The anime as a whole felt incomplete to me. I got a glimpse into this world and these relationships and then it was over and it felt like there was still so much more to see and so much more that could/should happen. We don't get any closure whatsoever as to what happens to any of the girls. The anime simply ends without answering a whole heck of a lot of questions and that felt very unsatisfying. And don't even tell me ""there's a season two for a reason""- it came out five years later, was made by a different studio and is a significantly worse show overall. It's not the continuation of what they'd already built that it needed to be. 
 
Overall- 
 
A unique and tragic story with all the potential in the world and one of the most gorgeous presentations I've ever seen in an anime significantly diminished by a far too low episode count (should have been in the vicinity of 24) and as such a feeling of simply being unfinished. 
 
+Exceptional, gorgeous presentation and music 
+Unique, tragic story concept 
+High quality, professional voice acting 
+Likable, sympathetic characters 
 
-Far too low episode count 
-A feeling of being incomplete- lack of answers/closure 
 
OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5 ish, rounded to 8 because I'm forced to choose a whole number and the presentation is just that damn good 
 
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9 or more throughout, but 6 or less at the end, as it simply felt incomplete.

          
 
       Helpful Gunslinger Girl is, yet, another Madhouse Studio made anime. The story follows a different types of girl who have suffered traumatic or near death experiences. These girls are given to an agency and turned into robotic-like humans, who have trainers that help them take down certain people. 
 
PROS 
 
Thanks to Madhouse, the art of this anime is top notch. Everything in the anime, including cities and humans, looks very realistic. This is, unfortunately, all taken away in the second season of Gunslinger Girl. I don't want to get too far into it, but I just really hated the turn of visuals that the second season took (which wasn't made by Madhouse).  
 
Now, I would say that the character development is great here, but I can't completely go that far. The thing is that the character development for the girls are all great. Each one of them has a personality that differs from the other, which makes all of their stories very interesting. The males, on the other hand, don't really have much personality or likeability. Besides Jose, the trainer of Henrietta, everyone else is pretty stale. That's not really a bad thing since the characters that are the center of most of the stories are the girls, but it does, at times, feel a bit odd. 
 
The story here is really complex and unique. It touches to the human heart in ways that many anime shows cannot express. By the end, you really feel like you've been on a long Journey with all the girls and understand them better than you did at the start.  
 
CONS 
 
Although I loved the sounds used in Gunslinger Girl, the shooting of guns seemed a bit loud at times. Perhaps this was the fault of my t.v., but I felt that the guns were way too loud in certain episodes. I would regularly have to change my volume up or down whenever shoot occurred or stopped.  
 
OVERALL 
 
Gunslinger Girl is a must see for anime lovers. The story lines of each girl are very intriguing and you learn more and more about the characters as the story goes along. Beware though, the second season is atrocious and should be avoided at all costs.

Each episode tells a story of a different federation soldier that is cursed by a Death God that came down to earth with the Zakus and shows the desperate struggle against mobile suits with only conventional weapons such as tanks and missiles. Each soldier, fueled with revenge, and a Death God looming over their backs, fights against the odds that is the terrible might of a Zaku. ","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"MS Igloo 2 is an improvement on the original, but doesn't manage to live up to the rest of the MSG franchise. The biggest change this time around is a focus on more personal stories, the story happening exclusively on Earth, and the introduction of a spiritual aspect - each main character is haunted by a Shinigami (although this is easily seen as metaphorical).  
 
What I liked: 
 
- Better animation. MS Igloo 2 boasts very nice looking mobile suit animation, and a lot of love went into characters' hair. The shinigami looks great with long flowing locks.  
 
- Cooler Mobile Suits and fights. The original MS Igloo suffered from a dearth of interesting Mobile Suits and relied on weird new designs like the Oggo to draw Mobile Suit enthusiasts. Fortunately MS Igloo 2 has possibly the coolest Guntank yet, as well as plenty of incredible Zakus, GMs and other assorted weaponry. The battles are dynamic, strategic and fun to watch. Since all the fights are on land it's a lot easier to understand everything's relative location, which was harder in the original when most fights were in space.  
 
- More personal plots. MS Igloo 3 focuses on three individual stories with plots very personal to the main characters. This makes the series more emotional than the original (although that's like saying it's more emotional than a rock). 
 
What I didn't like: 
 
- The facial animations. Little has changed in this department. Facial expressions are distorted and ugly, to the point of ridiculousness. This can ruin suspense and make serious scenes look very silly. The female characters interestingly don't suffer as much, while still displaying strong emotion. 
 
- Extremely unlikable characters. Many of the characters are snide, aggressive and rude to each other. Some of them even seemed verging on insane. I would have preferred a more creative take on the emotional toll of war. 
 
- The contrived shinigami aspect. The shinigami felt very out of place in MS Igloo. The UC timeline, especially events like the one year war, are known for being more realistic and technology driven than later timelines, so throwing a god of death in there felt like an odd choice.  
 
Should you watch MS Igloo 2?: Yes, but only if you're a diehard Gundam fan. My preferred watching order would be: 
- episode 1 of MS Igloo: the Hidden one year war for that sweet Char cameo 
- then skip the rest and watch MS Igloo 2 in its entirety

          
 
       Helpful As a fan of MS Igloo I was excited to finally see this in its entirety and was not disappointed. 
 
Story and Characters 
 
The year is Universial Century 0079 at the start of the war when Zeon has just landed on earth. These 3 OVAs are the stories of 3 common soldiers, their weaponary and revenge as their motivation in fighting for the Earth Forces during the period.  
 
OVA1's protagonist is the conflicted Ben Barberry, notorious as a death god for sucking the life out of his unit but somehow surviving. At the start of the war, Zeon's Zaku's held the tactical advantage and Ben's anti tank unit is hastily renamed the anti Mobile Suit unit with their weapon of choice being a modified bazooka that fires (larger) anti Mobile suit missiles. Ben and his new unit of fresh recruits are sent to hunt Zaku's while providing cover for the Earth Forces Retreat - in other words, a suicide mission. 
 
OVA 1 was reminiscent of world war 2 movies where everything is in black and white - the color, the landscape, good/bad, right/wrong, strong/weak. You felt like you were there with Ben struggling to survive and keep his men alive, and if nothing else it drove home 2 messages for me. First, it SUCKS to be ground troops against Mobile Suits. Second, technological superiority DOES matter. 
 
OVA 2 had the most tactics as it was a cat and mouse game between two old enemies. Earth Forces tank Ace Herman Yardell survived against the Zaku ace Elmer Snell, the ""White Ogre"" and has sought revenge since. Both men have somewhat of a bushido code, wanting to fight only the best, and go to great lengths to achieve it, including feigning mechanical failure to get out of ""Boring"" fights.  
 
At this stage in the war, earth forces tank has clearly somewhat bridged the technological gap to the Zakus and it is a pleasure to watch the genius Yardell (who is nuts) fight. 
 
OVA 3 is the story of Arleen Nozen, a technical lieutenant unjustly imprisoned for leaking information to Zeon on the RTX-440 Ground Assault type Guntank. Arleen lives for revenge against the true informant, her ex (lover) because he not only betrayed her but the information leak resulted in her guntank program's development being halted with only 3 being produced. The Evil General offers a chance of amnesty to 3 prisoners in exchange for fighting in the battle of Odessa - Arleen accepts. By Odessa, the earth forces now have their own mobile suits so Odessa is the battle to push Zeon back into space. 
 
Of the 3 OVA, this one had the best weapon. I thought the Guntank was phenomenal in it's flexibility! It had awesome maneuverability, high speed, ability to transform into 3 form factors and a TON of armaments to boot! Oh my god, information on this is truly worth stealing. If development continued this would surely have become a Mobile Armor. This OVA as a standalone would deserve a 9 because of the beautiful plot twist at the end. 
 
All 3 ovas had easily identifiable and likeable characters developed in a short period of time, one could even consider their weapons as characters which grow in importance from OVA 1 to 3. The OVAs succeeded in making me cry. However, I felt like the death god theme was misplaced or could have been left out and the story would have been much better. The death god certinly wasn't ""needed"" and it seemed like it was put in just to showcase the beautiful animation of this character. 
 
Art/Animation 
 
The Animation was incredible from a technical standpoint (10) but weak in characterization (6) for an average score of 8.  
 
One thing that cannot be denied is CGI has made great strides in a short time. I am continually amazed by the level of detail rendered - you can see individual strands of hair, eyelashes/eyebrows, even the pores on the skin of an individual's face! Compared to MS Igloo I they've also made great improvements in movement and explosions, these no longer look chunky/block/fake but are instead smoother, rounder and more realistic. 
 
The problem is with characterization. The shots of a character acting surprised by widening/opening their eyes bigger is overused and looks artificial. Cel drawings don't have the same issue as we are accustomed to exaggerated facial reactions. Igloo 2 suffers from this problem because the art is so good you tend to compare it with what real life people would do and if it isn't a realistic reaction or expression in live action it looks artificial in CGI. Now, the women are rendered very lovingly and their expressions are for the most part realistic, but not so for the men in OVA1 and OVA2.  
 
Sound 
 
Igloo 2 has no OP, but 3 different EDs, all of which tie to their stories so I thought this was inventive and clever. The voice acting wasn't as good as I hoped, some of the voices just didn't seem to mesh with the character personalities. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall 
 
I loved how realistic this was. Each OVA was a look through the eyes of a small common soldier, but the overarching theme is Earth eventually caught up with Zeon's technological superiority and the entire course of the war changed. All things being said I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone. I hope to see more MS Igloo.

However, when a couple cyclists spy his skill in riding the bulky mamachari bike he's had since youth, they attempt to convince him to join the bicycle racing club instead.

In middle school, Onoda did not have any friends with whom he could talk about his interests, and hopes to change that by joining his new school's anime club. However, he is crushed when he discovers the anime club has been disbanded due to lack of interest, and in order to reestablish the club, four new members must join.
Since he was a little boy, Onoda has ridden his city bicycle (referred to as a ""mamachari"", meaning ""Mommy Bike"", in the anime)—a simple and bulky bicycle designed for short rides—for transportation and fun. A fellow freshman, and much more serious cyclist, named Shunsuke Imaizumi notices Onoda riding his mamachari and mocks him inwardly until he sees Onoda riding up a steep hill with little effort. Another student named Naruko visits Akihabara to get some plastic Gundam models for his younger brothers and meets Onoda, who catches his attention because of his cycling skill on the mamachari. Later on, both Naruko and Imaizumi try to convince him to join the bicycle racing club at their high school, Sohoku.
","In this ""Episode"" you will be watching a small portion of the schools training, (mainly focused on Sohoku) a little while before Inter High at Hakone occur. Should you waste time to watch this? Well why not, you get to know a bit more about Onoda's anime merchandise and relationship with his ""Climber Senpai""! 
Also if you still did not watch the anime, this episode might be a bit spoiler so check the first 20 episodes, before you come watch this! 
 
Good points of this special episode is that you get to see a little morel development between a Senpai and Kohai's Friendship, I'm referring to Makishima and Onoda the Team Climbers of course! Is something that got me curious about, since both characters are way to different one from another and they must tag along for almost half a day. 
 
For a moment I  though, maybe I should not waste time watching this, but half way I though opposite, glad I did. 
 
Regardless my score give to this episode, I must say, I did not get hooked up for another anime so much has this one in the past couple of months. If you don't know if its worthy or not, just give it a try! And if I may add, I'm not much of a Anime Sport's Fan myself and nor I like to watch ""ongoing"" anime.

4,1142,43,8.566613605,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Hachimitsu to Clover II,"The sequel and final installment to the highly popular series once again delves into the life stories and love lives of Takemoto Yuuta, Mayama Takumi and Morita Shinobu. The story continues where the first season left off, after Takemoto's self-discovery journey around Japan. Of course, the love triangles and tribulations they face will continue, and eventually decide the paths to their future. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Josei', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Yūta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live in the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo. One day, they are introduced to Hagumi ""Hagu"" Hanamoto, the daughter of a cousin of Shūji Hanamoto, an art professor, who has come to live with Hanamoto and has become a first year art student at the art school that everyone attends. Yuta and Shinobu both fall in love with Hagu, but Yuta hides his feelings and tries to be a friend to Hagu while Shinobu expresses his love in ways that seem only to scare Hagu, such as calling her ""Mousey"" and constantly photographing her. Hagu herself, though initially timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up to the three.
The group comes to include Ayumi Yamada, a master of pottery who is well known by her nickname ""Tetsujin"" (Iron Lady), who becomes very close to Hagu. When not at school, she helps run the family liquor store. While Ayumi is popular with many young men, she falls in love with Takumi, who does not reciprocate her feelings and considers her a very dear friend. Instead, Takumi pursues an older woman, Rika Harada, a widowed friend of Professor Hanamoto who runs an architecture studio she founded with her late husband. The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about themselves.
","Ah, Umino Chika's masterpiece, Honey and Clover. I first saw this more or less two years ago, initially thinking it was just some generic romance anime. Needless to say, I suddenly fell in love with it from the moment in season one, episode two, near the ending, when Takemoto was carrying Morita on his back. Cue. The piano stopped. And right after that, he said, ""It hurts"". From that point on, I knew I was watching a different kind of anime. I guess remembering that random scene from an episode proves that it had an impact. 
 
Season one ended gracefully, you could accept it as ""ending"" and it can have a sequel as well. Either way, we've got a lot of questions left, like what happened to Mayama, Rika and Yamada, or is Shinobu really that much of an idiot that he couldn't fight for Hagu, as well as what would be Hagu's answer after ""I'm glad you're back"". I was literally jumping with joy when they decided to make another season. Everything was concluded at Honey and Clover II. 
 
These kinds of anime is the reason why I still love the medium animation. 
 
Color pastel-type work at its finest. They're at an art school, after all, so the art should be top-notch. JC Staff is enough said; almost anything they make delivers, and delivers well. I love how they abused the blurry, almost-dreamy look of the show. Some may find it a bit ""girly"", but, well, it fits the opus. It stays loyal to the manga's designs too. 
 
One of the BEST parts of watching Honey and Clover is listening to its wonderful, wonderful music. ""Dramatic"" and ""Waltz"" got us in season one, the piano renditions of the songs were especially amazing. Now we've got ""Fugainaya"" and ""Split"", which are really blessings to the human ear. I may be wrong, but almost every episode has a different insert song with it, which was brilliantly scored to match the scene it goes with. I especially liked the song at episode nine and the song playing on the last scene. Epic. 
 
The factor that propels Honey and Clover to its fame is its characters, and the story that they individually have, interconnected with each other. It's a story about growing up, maturity, and coming-of-age (jobs, decisions, etc) after all. Maybe it's my age, but I find its story stunningly touching and awe-inspiring. Before Honey and Clover, I thought most modern works lost the magic of storytelling. Characters were easy enough to identify with. Themes of unrequited love, talents, ties, lifelong goals, finding oneself, hardships and trials; they're all there, wonderfully packaged.  
 
Takemoto's still the unsure, melancholic character that he was at season one but you could see he's grown up a little and learned more about how life goes. He's the banner of H&C, he represents adolescence. Morita lost most of his eccentricity and we get to see the deeper side of him, as well as the people he's closest to. Yamada, well, is Yamada, still with her unrequited love, but of course, with a twist at season two. We get to see more of Rika, Professor Hanamoto, and Mayama. But, definitely, Hagu's part on the succeeding story is probably the biggest plot point of Honey and Clover II. 
 
What really makes this a modern gem is the way it was presented; it was music, characters, and story weaving in and out of each other in perfect harmony. At times I really find myself asking why is aging this bittersweet. Honey and Clover II is the right way to end the nostalgic series, and if you want to watch something that isn't flooded with moe, giant breasts or extreme harem, and instead want to see something of a mature slice-of-life anime, see this. 
 
One thing's for sure. It did have meaning.

Title: Honey and Clover II 
 
Anime: Honey and Clover II was once again produced by JC Staff (famous for their work on Revolutionary Girl Utena and Excel Saga), and directed by Tatsuyuki Nagain (famous for his work on My-HiME and iDOLM@STER XENOGLOSSIA) this time around.  It aired on Japanese TV from June 29th to September 14th, 2006.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside. 
 
Story: Honey and Clover II picks up where Honey and Clover left off, and finishes up the remaining manga material. 
 
I like this follow-up.  It answers questions it left unanswered last season, and resolves all the relationships that were left hanging at the end of last season.  And there are some absolutely heart-breaking scenes in here. 
 
Something just seems to be missing here, though.  I just can't really put my finger on it.  I think it has something to do with the mood -- it seems less centered around the realism than it was last season.  Not that it's not realistic, because it still is, but... I don't know how to explain it. 
 
It's good and all, but it's just not the same as it was last season.  Probably comes with the director change. 
 
Art: Just as beautiful as it was last season, though it seems that they used brighter colors than they did last season than some of the more muted colors that they tended to use.   
 
Music: There's another piano version of either the OP or ED that plays a lot and is really beautiful.  Background music is about the same as last season. 
 
The insert music is still done by the same artists, from what I can hear, and still appropriately fitting. 
 
The OP is still done by the same wailing banshee lady, but the animation for it is pretty neat again.  The ED's not all that remarkable, again, but I can live with it. 
 
Seiyuu: All the same actors as last season, except for the twelfth and final episode, where Kenji Nojima replaces Hiroshi Kamiya as Takemoto's VA, due to an accident that the latter had that rendered him unable to record the episode; Nojima does a pretty good job of staying as close to Kamiya's performance as possible, but you can tell that it's not Kamiya.  Good performances though, as always. 
 
Length: Twelve episodes was the perfect length to take care of everything they left untouched last season, I think.  Any longer, and it would've started to drag a bit. 
 
Overall: A good follow-up to last season, but it's just not the same.  If you want to find out how everything eventually resolves, then definitely watch it.  Just be aware that it might not be quite the same impact as the first season made on you.

       Helpful My first time writing a review, I stumble upon this anime while searching old anime since I thought that, most current anime are mostly fanservice. 
 
Excluding the actual story, it have a totally (even though not direct) Life Lesson specially for those who are currently in a existencialism (did I spell that right?) crisis. 
Since it is a sequel I was actualy expecting something more like Season 1 but I was wrong and totally shocked me. 
 
Story 10/10 
It's ok to judge me since I started watching anime at about 2010 so I was already used to action animes and fantasy genre, though I've watched a few normal one but this is currently one of the most wonderful story I have known this date. 
 
Art 9/10 
I can't actually put it into words but, I think it's pretty smooth or something near that word. 
 
Sound 9/10 
Honestly, most of the male voiced song that I heard this past few years was alright, thought not really that much touching, except for this, even though I can't understand the language, without reading the subs it sounded wonderful to the ears and heart.

There where even moments that I started to punch the wall while watching and my mother taught I was fighting with somebody.

4,31109,44,8.50732563,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Hatsukoi Monster,"Freshman Kaho Nikaidou is from an influential family, and as such, no one has ever said anything even remotely mean to her, for fear of incurring her household's wrath. Wishing to be around people who will not treat her as special because of her background, she leaves home to live at a dormitory for her new school year. Shortly after arriving, Kaho accidentally wanders into traffic and is saved by a tall, handsome stranger. When she asks for his name, he tells her she is weird and walks away. Having finally met the only person to ever say an unkind word to her, Kaho falls head over heels for her savior. 
 
After meeting her rescuer yet again and discovering that his name is Kanade Takahashi, she confesses her love to him. Kanade says he would like for them to be a couple, but that Kaho may not want to date him after she finds out his secret. To her shock, Kaho discovers the startling truth: Kanade is a fifth grader! 
 
Deciding that she can't date a fifth grader, Kaho intends to break up with him. But as she spends more time with Kanade, she begins to care for him even more and continues dating him.  Hatsukoi Monster  follows Kaho's first steps into love with Kanade, her immature, yet kind, fifth grade boyfriend. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The story follows 15-year-old Kaho Nikaidō as she leaves home to live in a high school dormitory. Almost getting hit by a truck, she is saved by a boy named Kanade Takahashi. She falls in love with him, only to discover that he is her landlord's son and a fifth grader.
","When it comes to romance, one thing you must keep in mind is that appearances aren't everything. I'm not just talking about personalities, either; what I mean is that chances are that a hot guy you've seen before is actually WAY younger than you. Let me get one thing straight; I knew all along that Hatsukoi Monster wasn't going to be good. The manga already isn't all that well-received, and when I read a few chapters of it myself, I found myself getting more bored with it than a lot of other shoujo manga I've read. Just for the sake of writing a review, though, I ended up watching the anime adaptation, and.... well, you'll understand when you read this review. 
 
Ladies and little boys who look like gentlemen, here's my review of ""Hatsukoi Monster"", a.k.a. ""First Love Monster"". 
 
Hatsukoi Monster follows a girl named Kaho Nikaidou, who is from a rich family and moves to an apartment building at the start of high school. When she arrives, she is almost hit by a truck and is saved by a handsome ""young man"". As it turns out, the ""young man"", Kanade Takahashi, is living in the same apartment building as Kaho; soon enough, Kaho confesses her newfound feelings for him. Kanade accepts her confession.... only to reveal to her the next day that he's a fifth grader. From there, a slightly chaotic story around their relationship forms. 
 
As you can see, everything about the story of Hatsukoi Monster is cliché, even the fact that Kanade and two of his friends, Tomu and Gin, are elementary school students who look older; I can easily name two other anime that do the same thing (Recorder to Randoseru and Yoiko). However, it's the fact that all of the elementary school students who actually LOOK their age who are more mature than them, even their friend Kazu, that especially bugs me. Yes, they're young, but these three behave the most immaturely out of everyone, making poop jokes and other things like that; honestly, it's kind of cringey. Speaking of jokes, while a select few of them did manage to get me to grin a little bit, none of them actually got me to laugh. This anime plays itself off like a parody, but there's a right and a wrong way to do a parody; this isn't the right way. 
 
As I mentioned before, Kanade and his friends have got to be some of the cringiest characters in anime history, and I wasn't really a fan of any of them. I'll give Kanade credit for one thing, though; he has said some pretty deep things throughout the series for a fifth grader. I still wasn't a fan of him, though. I really didn't like Kaho, either; except for one scene in the last episode, she spent the whole series as a wishy-washy Mary Sue (okay, maybe not exactly a Mary Sue, but the word just happened to come to my mind) with something obviously wrong with her brain if she's going to stick to loving Kanade with that age difference and his extreme childishness. The rest of the cast comes out either bland or just plain annoying; I will admit, though, I did kind of like Kazu at first. 
 
The voice acting was decent, considering the fact that one of my favorite seiyuus, Yui Horie, is part of the cast - and as the protagonist, no less! (Too bad her voice couldn't save her character.) The opening and ending themes, ""Innocence"" and ""Kimi ni Sasageru Chinkonka"" both by Shouta Aoi, were skippable yet not bad songs. Hatsukoi Monster does have one thing I can honestly praise, though, and that is its animation. This year, Studio Deen gave us Konosuba and Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto (with the former getting a second season next year), two favorable anime with good animation. Despite this one not turning out as well over all, the animation quality manages to survive; it's bright and colorful, and it's overall pretty to look at. 
 
Unfortunately, despite its few up-points, my overall opinion of Hatsukoi Monster was not a pretty one. If I were to recommend it at all, it'd be to someone who is looking for a cliché only someone who has seen enough anime would be able to spot. Oh, and someone who finds all kinds of poop jokes funny! You can't forget the poop jokes!

          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
My friend and I started watching this anime for shits and giggles due to the absurdity of the idea that a high school girl falls in love with a fifth grader that looks like an adult. While the plot was pretty much nonexistent and the last episode was objectively terrible, the jokes and absurdity of it all was what really made this show memorable and enjoyable. 
 
 
 
Story 
 
Simply put, there really is no plot. There are some absolutely insane events that occur in every episode that make you question what the hell is going on and what you are doing with your life. The main plot points of the anime would be the romance between the main characters and the question of why Kanade and his friends look like high schoolers. The romance was something that I just could not accept. It is just not right for a high schooler to date a primary schooler. Now the answer to why Kanade and his friends look like high schoolers was never given, which really annoyed my friend, Kaho, and myself. The last episode, to put it bluntly, was a shit show. The first part was a fever dream that made my friend and I believe that Kaho and Kanade were hallucinating because of rabies. Then the episode continued like usual and was just an unsatisfying ending to the series.  
 
Art 
 
The art was good. I really appreciated the dedication that the artists had for every episode putting in crazy details like a missing crab leg, partially worn tights, and writing on a character's chest. These little details seen throughout the episode were hilarious and really added to my enjoyment.  
 
Sound 
 
I was not really fond of the opening and ending because I believe that it was a bit too serious for the show. I kind of wished that it fit the tone of the show better, kind of like Lucky Star's opening. I would have ranked it a lot lower if it wasn't for the beauty of ""The Crab Song"" and Kanade's song for Kaho, which easily made episode 10 the best episode of the show 
 
Characters 
 
Kaho was honestly kind of a dull character. Other than being in love with a fifth grader, there's nothing really interesting about her. Kanade was definitely more of a dynamic character. The juxtaposition between his grown up appearance and childlike personality was quite amusing and definitely original. This also applies to Tomu and Gin, but particularly Gin because he has an incredibly deep voice and plans on taking over his family's OB/GYN. Atsushi, the second male lead, is a piece of shit. I honestly have nothing good to say about him and I can basically he is a sadistic jerk that needs to be slapped. Kota and Kaz are so precious and deserve the world. Hands down the best character is Ren Ren.  
 
Enjoyment 
 
This show was just so ridiculous and hilarious that it is hard to not be able to enjoy yourself. The show really does not take itself seriously and that made it so you were able to laugh with the show. That being said, the humor used in the show is quite crude and may not be for everybody. It really brings you back to elementary school, and I really believe that one must be in a elementary school kid's mindset in order to enjoy it. 
 
Overall 
 
This show is absolutely insane. Do not take it seriously. Once you disregard the romance and put yourself in a childlike mentality, this show is amazing and absolutely hysterical. I highly recommend watching it with a friend. The absurdity of the show makes it a great talking point and without someone else watching it with you, you might lose your mind. Thus, though this show is objectively not very good, the humor and craziness makes it quite enjoyable which makes me rank it higher than I probably should.

          
 
       Helpful this show is a monster itself 
 
     Story: to be honest the first episode wasn't that bad in fact it was setting up for an interesting show although right after the first episode everything was beginning to go south with thing getting weird and a bit mess up like i think the series knew what wrong with it and tends to mock itself. i like romance series but this isn't romance this is more like tempting the boundaries now don't get me wrong this is a fantasy i i like forbidden romance or star cross lover types but here it hard to believe especially when a elementary kids looks like he is in high school or can pass as an adult and so that make it fantasy but the romance is awkward and bit out of sort. 
 
      Character: the MC she never been outside her home and so she doesn't quite understand how everything works nor knows what right and wrong but yet can't help and fall in love with a kid i can see how this could happen but even then she knew what she was doing and knows it wrong but can't help and do it anyways. i know part is the brother fault since he really into incest with his sister and just plainly love her way to much. there is this one character i kinda like and dislike at the same time she does this kinda of exorcist thing and she is scary so props for that. 
 
     ART/SOUND nothing special nor unique about the artwork or design and the music alone is dreadful so i don't why they were trying. 
 
         Overall: i feel like this series had a potential to be good but the writing and script were just so bad the it was literally mocking itself. i'm all for forbidden fantasy like and older girl falls in love with a young and young fall in love with a older person as to put into a different prospective and views and exploring the idea now i don't condone of pedophilia although the show may not come across like one but it does act like one and that where i think everything including myself didn't like this show for that reason as well as the story wasn't very good and so i would not recommend this to anyone. as for the side note i i may be a bit generous with the overall rating of a 4 when it could be easily a 1 or a 2 however i have seen worse shows than this and also like i said it had a potential to be good and the idea was interesting and plus i like forbidden romance i'm just sad to see this one fail as it did

This is a drama about the romances, friendships and conflicts of six girls from Hokkaido and how the diamond dust affects them and eventually links them together in the search for happiness.  
 
(Source: ANN) 
","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The player, a second-year high school student (17 years old), travels from Tokyo to Sapporo in Hokkaidō (hence the basic title of the game Kita E (To The North).  There, he encounters eight different girls, including the lead character Kotori Haruno, whose family he stays with during his time up north. In the game, the player explores the island, plays video games, does karaoke, goes shopping—and most of all, tries to find that special someone to share his heart with. The main period of the game is set during summer vacation (August 1 to August 14), by which, at the end, the player returns to Tokyo. The conclusion of the game falls around December 28, when the player returns to Sapporo to witness the ""White Illumination Countdown"" on New Year's Eve (similar to the New Year's Eve Times Square celebrations). To win the game, the player must meet his chosen one at the Countdown on New Year's Eve, then kiss her at 12:00 midnight on New Year's Day.
The story is about six different girls from different lifestyles living on Hokkaidō in Japan. They each live in a different city on the island. Each girl believes in a myth of snow turning into diamond dust, and if one makes a wish on the diamond dust, their wish is 100% guaranteed to come true. Another myth about diamond dust is that if a boy and girl meet under the dust, they're guaranteed happiness and marriage later in life. Each of the six girls have some stubborn moments and awkward stages in their lives, but looking into themselves and others will help them get back on their feet. When these six girls meet, their lives will change dramatically for the better as the snow begins to fall.
","a TL;DR review by Nerpco 
 
Story - individual love stories revolving around six woman (each getting their own two episodes) and a myth about diamond dust during the winter season. Some are done very nicely and others being fine. 8 
 
Art - Has a nice style, good amount of detail. But their faces have a weird shape when at an angle. 7 
 
Sound - Nice soundtrack with soothing pieces that remind me of the season. Provokes and influences emotion. 8 
 
Characters - Each one of the main characters (and most of the supporting characters) are fleshed out nicely, which is impressive to do with only two episodes each. 9 
 
Enjoyment/Verdict - For me, this was a nice feel-good romance/josei that has nice characterization and emotion. 8 
 
Overall: 8.0/10 
 
Recommendation: Buy it, you can find the cute looking 3-Disc thinpack set from ADV Films for less than ten dollars. Go for it!

Kita e.: Diamond Dust Drops is broken up into various 2-3 episode vignettes that follow various female characters and their lives in Hokkaido. They all center around romance.  
 
First things first, because this anime is broken up into these vignettes  it is EXTREMELY hit or miss. At times I wanted to give certain story arcs an 8/10 overall but others a 3/10. The setting of the show is probably the best part. Not enough anime are set in winter/Hokkaido. To be honest, I would skip the story arcs that you don't enjoy and watch the ones you care about as a mini-series. 
 
Ultimately, I'd recommend it as a light, romance show with great art and music. It's mediocre at best as a whole but some story Arcs (Akari, Suomi and Shoko) are worth it. 

          
 
       Helpful A very simple minded and poorly done anime. 
 
Story: The anime is broken into separate story lines following several different characters.  All of the stories are obnoxiously cliché and simplistic.  If you are looking for food for thought your brain will starve to death with this anime. 
 
Art: Basic and not terrible but nothing that would count as high quality.  The female characters all look very similar with kind of masculine odd-shaped jaws.   
 
Sound:  Bad synthesized background with a few acoustic overdubs.  A kid could come up with this on his $80 Casio keyboard form Wal-Mart.  Wasn't even good when this anime was new. 
 
Character:  This is really the killer for this anime.  If you are going to do 2-3 episode story arcs you have to have noteworthy character development in that short period to grab interest.  Every character is as vanilla and mundanely boring as it gets.  Watching this is like driving in neutral.  
 
The overall experience of this anime is just mind numbing boredom.  Soon you will just want episodes to be over so you don't have to listen to more mundane dialogue with crappy midi music in the background.  I wouldn't wish this crap on my worst enemy.

In the meantime, he lives together with his cousin Urara Kasuga, who has a crush on him and is willing to do anything to help him (including being that call girl in the first chapter). Urara encounters Mieko and Touma at karaoke, but pretends to be his sister. However, romance rival Tatsuhiko Mashu suspects something is up, and after sleeping with Urara's friend Komi Natsuki, learns that Touma is not a university student. Mashu tricks Touma into revealing the truth to Mieko.
The heartbroken Touma starts a sexual relationship with Urara. The ""happy couple"" angers cram school teacher Kugenuma, who conspires to break the two up by framing Touma with harassment. The rumors force Touma to leave cram school, but Urara tries to work a deal with Kugenuma for him to return. But when Touma learns about the deal and that it involved sexual favors, he breaks up with Urara.
When Urara discovers that she is pregnant, she joins Natsuki at an escort service to raise extra money. Suspsecting that Mashu has cheated on her, Mieko makes advances on Touma, and they finally have sex. Urara, Natsuki and another girl named Mizuki hustle a client, but it backfires when the client then beats Urara up (and gang rapes Natsuki). Urara suffers a miscarriage, but reunites with Touma.

The incense is actually speed, to which Touma becomes addicted as he prepares for his next mock exam. Urara gives him an ultimatum to stop using the drug.
When Mizuki collapses and is hospitalized, Touma learns that she is his best friend Kouji's little sister and that she has been battling leukemia. When Kouji gets in trouble for shoplifting, Touma talks some sense into him. Urara takes on extra jobs to get a Christmas present for Touma, but when one of the hostess club patrons gets raunchy, she is saved by Ryuichi Kazama, a childhood friend who is ordered by Urara's father to be her home tutor and to secretly spy on them. When Ryuichi learns that Touma and Urara are living together, he kicks Touma out without telling Urara, and then tries to make a move on her. After Urara declines, Ryuichi conspires with Mashu to kidnap and to beat up Touma, but the plan goes awry when he pushes Touma in front of Mashu's car. Touma survives with a broken arm, but Urara does not know about it until later, as she breaks ties with Ryuichi. While Touma tries to recover, Akimoto learns Mashu is involved and attacks him, however, he is stabbed in the back and is hospitalized as well.
Touma's arm heals in time for the real exams; his test scores place him with S Shuu University, but he misses the school's deadline to enroll because of his attention to Akimoto's hospital bills.

","First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.

✦Story 
Story had actually got quite fairly enjoyable development. I did hate the story/thematic itself though. Which I ought to mention more under ""characters"" section. To be honest, I cannot remember much of this Anime as some time has passed since I watched this a.k.a didn't review with fresh memories. But I do know I started skipping at some point, I was intrigued with the development but really hated characters there for various reasons. The way it was wrapped up was also quite unsatisfying. 
 
✦Art & Sound 
For it's time I think it had good enough style to it. Fanservice was as well good enough looking. 
 
Music & OST I think had some good tracks, but mostly I didn't notice them or was not impressed. 
 
✦Character 
Main guy - fell in love with a chick who was quite a loose c**t and player. Probably even a gold digger. 
That same chick also pissed me quite off. Playing with feelings and then playing the ""I'm hurt card"" then wants to change stuff thus does various bollocks and things get wrapped up in a moronic way. 
Now another girl, the ""main girl"" who fell in love with main guy, even though after meeting each other again, main guy doesn't even remember her. Anyhow.. girl attempts to console or in generally make the guy look at him with innocence card whilst being lewd. Meaning that the was she reveals herself and teases the guy constantly in the most annoying possible ways. Like the first re-encounter was basically her being a call-girl. Then it just goes on, main guy looks at another woman, main girl still tries to get attention or is hurt when guy is even more into another woman. 
 
I could rant even further, but I can't as some things would be spoilers. So my point is, I found characters absolutely horrific annoyance. Pissed me off in various aspect and even the main girl who really bad and was actually quite innocent. The way she attempted was just infuriating. Point here, characters had some development, which was good party. But characters as characters themselves, were just absolutely something I could not enjoy. 
 
✦Enjoyment & Overall 
Only reason I actually finished this Anime (even though I did fast forwards at some point) is because It had intriguing development. Everything else I did not enjoy. 
 
So yeah, overall, fair enough Anime. Probably if you like such characters or not get annoyed to an extent I did, they you will quite likely enjoy this Anime more than me.

          
 
       Helpful Sakura Diaries really pulls at the love strings the entire way through. 
It really is an amazing story touching on taboos, reality and the difficulties of life in general. 
 
The art style is your typical 80's and 90's look. 
What grabbed my attention was how the artists paid so much attention to detail. The backgrounds were fully drawn, the frequently visited environments did not change at all detail-wise. It's as if they had a fully drawn out environment for every scene. 
There is frequent nudity in this show, although you don't ever get to see anything ""too"" revealing or inappropriate. 
This show is a very impressive work of art. 
 
The sounds were great. The English dub is surprisingly good for this show. The music was great and sometimes I felt that the voice-actors understood the emotions the characters were feeling. There isn't a lot of extra unnecessary dialogue and there isn't paragraphs and paragraphs of explanations, it makes things feel realistic. 
 
The story is outstanding. Tonma goes to Tokyo trying to get into any college or university that he can. But the night before his important entrance exam, he is interrupted by his cousin Urara. She acts like a call girl (because he didn't remember her), getting Tonma both excited and upset, making him get sick with a cold. He fails his exam and runs into a beautiful woman named Meiko who is also taking the entrance exam. But he doesn't want her to know that he failed, so he lies and tries to go out with her anyway. 
Along his journey's he will fail in virtually everything from obvious everyday things to big romance and important events. Disappointment after disappointment, it makes me wonder if he'll ever find love or find what he needs the most. 
 
The main character Urara seemed to get the most character depth in the show. Although she is a high school girl, she is apparently very deep and her love for Tonma is also just as deep. Meiko has a surprising background to her and she turns to not be as bad as I thought she was. The other supporting characters get very little depth. But surprisingly enough, Tonma the main character this show is about, doesn't get as much depth to him as I wanted. Even until the very end, he seemed like a shallow-shell of a person. 
 
I really enjoyed this show. The love strings were constantly being pulled and making me want to watch the entire show in one sitting. 
I literally lost sleep over this. 
 
Overall, a great show, something I wish was longer than just 12 episodes. But what I didn't enjoy was the ending. It left me confused and wanting more. The show ended with me having so many questions and so many things unresolved. I want more! More! More! More! More!

          
 
       Helpful Usually when I watch an anime that has a large following I can understand why people might like it even if I dislike it. This on the other hand is one of the few times that I don't understand what the appeal might be at all. 
The art and animation is decent, it's not outstanding by any means, but it does the job, isn't stilted, and doesn't have a ton of animation errors.  
The sound work is ok, the ending and opening music was really my cup of tea and there were spots here and there where the music didn't really match the scene but I didn't find myself getting angry over any of  the sound choices. 
What I did find myself getting angry over was everything else about the anime. The story it's self was a frustrating jumbled mess. It almost felt stubborn in a why, like it was refusing to budge, refusing to go anywhere. It felt almost like the first few seasons of Natsume's Book of Friends, where there would be deep character progression and then it would all be forgotten next season. Though in this case after every episode, that love confession last episode? yeah, nope, doesn't matter, it's some how shocking again next episode. Character figures out that uncle isn't living in the apartment anymore episodes ago? OMG, better move out because the uncle isn't actually living there anymore. Not only that, the story it's self is very poorly written, people will reference major plot points that won't even be explained until an episode later. Not really in any way that's supposed to be mysterious, but in a way that's pretty much ""oh, yeah, we better explain that"". Where in the mean time you are confused as to why the female lead is just casually talking about something that the show hasn't even referenced yet.  
Well, you might be thinking, if the writing is so bad, then the characters must be likable, relatable, or charming. Nope, not at all, we have a main character that I'm pretty sure was supposed to be your standard naive country bumpkin but instead just comes of as a just plain idiot. Then we have the female lead, who is probably supposed to come off as a teenager in puppy love, but instead comes off as a near psychotic stalker. Finally our secondary female lead is a stuck up bitch that uses people. The only character in this anime that I found ever remotely likable was the ""more wise than you would assume"" character who has been in cram school for numerous years.  
So all in all I would not recommend this anime, it was a painful experience and not in the least bit a rewarding watch and I don't understand how so many people can like it.

4,8426,47,8.450373868,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Hourou Musuko,"Effeminate fifth grader Shuuichi Nitori is considered by most to be one of the prettiest girls in school, but much to her dismay, she is actually biologically male. Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, transexuality, relationships, and acceptance. 
 
Lauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's  Hourou Musuko  is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","At the start of Wandering Son, Shuichi Nitori is a student in the fifth grade who transfers into a new school. She quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, he confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages her to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who is also a closeted transgender girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult named Yuki, who is a trans woman living with a cis man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Satō and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.
In junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased her about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as she begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing which causes her dysphoria to worsen. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.
Shuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that he no longer wishes to be seen as male and has decided to continue living as a girl. He also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi who rejects him, causing him to lament that his lack of gender affirmation hurts more than a rejection from someone he loves. The pair briefly hold hands before saying goodbye. Shuichi informs Anna of her true gender identity, and much to her surprise Anna decides to stay in a relationship with her. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title The Boy Who's a Girl (ぼくは、おんなのこ, Boku wa, Onna no Ko).
","Okay, first things first: I am a straight man, reviewing Hourou Musuko. 
I'm quite open to these topics because they are interesting to talk about sometimes. Anyways: 
 
This show boggled my mind;  
We have a boy who likes to dress as a girl (and be one),  
and a girl who likes to dress as a boy (and be one). 
Then, we have a friend of the boy who is gay, and a girl who has a big crush on the boy (and she also knows he crossdresses). 
Also how dafaq did he get these friends in the first place?? 
 
What got me confused was the questions I was asking myself while watching, that kept me entertained: 
if he has a crush on a girl who wants to be a boy and dresses like one, does that make him gay? Which version does he like more, the fact that it is a GIRL dressing up as a boy or JUST as a boy? 
 
If the boy who dresses like a girl, has a crush on a girl, that makes him straight right? Not lesbian? Even though he wants to be a girl? 
The characters in the show don't ignore these questions, they answer them later, which I'm quite glad about because it would drive me nuts if they didn't bring it up. 
 
Gender can't really be put into categories such as gay and lesbian or bi, and this is what the show was trying to get across.  
Equality? Yeah sure, the fact that girls can wear boy clothe and get away with it, but if a boy even THINKS about wearing a skirt, he is dead to society. Girls can stream cleavage and get $1000 worth of donations, pretty cool huh. 
 
Now, I'll have you know that the boy is a swag master, he has like 3 chicks or whatever that likes him, and he is only in middle school (one including a model). Like WTF? And they all know he cross-dresses! This boy is swag on another level, like if I knew I could get these kinda chicks like this, i'd cross dress in a heart beat! Just kidding, or am I..  
 
Anyways, the show is slow-paced, but actually I didn't mind it because it just makes all those cringe-worthy awkward moments so much better. There weren't so many cringe scenes, but the awkwardness was so real. It was fun watching some character's reactions, and there is a bit of suspense when you try to figure out how they would act like if they ever found out. This boy is brave, and as a character who likes girly things, this boy is a trooper. Always speaks his mind, and is chill about anything that might have ruined his life.  
 
The bullying in this show wasn't accurate enough, this was child's play compared to reality. Just wanted to point that out there. 
 
The boy's friends are really interesting. If anyone is being open to everything, his friends definitely are. He picked the right friends! 
 
For the art, it is all water-colory, reminds me exactly of Usagi Drop. 
 
The sound was pretty generic, it has that generic chime and what not. I don't remember the music ever standing out. Just average joe to me.  
 
If you were to watch this show, you'd watch it for the character interactions and the real awkward moments. Also relationship/love interest are relevant too. 
 
I rate it 8 out of 10 genderly confused people. 
 
---Tiny spoliers-- 
 
I wish the ending didn't stop there, I wanted to see the struggles of his teenager years, such as voice changing and growing beards, does he get surgery, etc. Also my best girl that I was rooting for technically won, I think.. 
I found out the anime show stops half way through the manga so I will start reading!  
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Hourou Musuko starts with questioning what little girls and boys are made of. It illuminates the role of sex in the construction of “natural” or coherent sexuality and gender, and the disheartening repercussions that the individuals, who fail to conform to what is socially accepted, experience. Further, the plotline sensibly uses the onset of puberty to intricately and realistically show that in this socially constructed world, we are bounded by to what has been “normalized”—boys must wear pants and girls must wear skirts. Together with the simple clean art and easy melodies, this series is crafted in a remarkably sensitive and moving way. 
 
Nitori and Takatsuki are the two main characters, who both struggle with gender crisis. Nitori is feminine by nature but trapped in a male body, same with Takatsuki who is masculine by nature however ensnared in a female body. Both clearly demonstrate the challenges of having binary sex system or the society's practice of heterosexuality. The plot visibly shows that the supposed blatancy of sex as a natural biological fact indicates to how intensely its production in discourse is concealed. For instance, Takatsuki agonizes girlhood because no matter how hard she flattens her chest, she cannot avoid wearing a bra for she can never stop her breast from growing. Likewise with Nitori, he vacillates boyhood because as soon as his body hairs grow, it’ll be harder for him to wear skirts and dresses. Moreover, the predicament of the storyline exists not just because of characters’ inner conflicts, they are also suffering overtly from being alienated and discriminated because their desired sexed bodies and gender roles are beyond what is “naturalized” by the society. In these scenarios, I like how these dilemmas are beautifully illustrated by the characters’ portrayal of genuine human emotions. 
 
I recommend Hourou Musuko for those who want to see a simple storyline but yet complex depiction of transexualism, and question humanity. If you find this subject offending, then this is not for you. Also, when watching this anime, try to perceive as if you’re sexless and genderless to fully discern how society materializes bodies to create boundaries and differentiate what is accepted from not. 

          
 
       Helpful I was really interested in this series' premise, because it doesn't happen often that an anime decides to deal with gender identity disorders, but I was disappointed with the way the topic was developed. 
 
Sometimes I have the feeling that, both in anime and manga, authors decide to discuss challenging topics but then don't have the courage to do it thoroughly. This is what I felt watching Hourou Musuko as well. Actually, I don't know if it's because they lack the courage, because they fear the fans' reaction or because they just don't know enough, I guess it depends on the case. In this story it feels like they just wanted to use the idea because of its originality and not actually to discuss the topic realistically, though up to a certain point I used to think they were trying to be serious about it. 
 
The protagonist, Nitori, is a middle school boy who likes to dress like a girl. Takatsuki is a girl who likes to dress like a boy. Nitori is presented as being in love with Takatsuki, though she doesn't seem to feel the same. The fact that the two might be in love could be seen as excessively coincidental, but I guess it makes sense that two people with the same ""issue"" are attracted to each other. 
 
With such a topic, you cannot but wonder about one thing: do Nitori and Takatsuki really feel that they were born the wrong gender? In other words, are we talking about an actual gender identity disorder? At the beginning it looks like it is, since Nitori really seems to feel like a girl, and the topic of sex change surgery is also brought up once. However, as the story progresses, his feelings start to become ambiguous, to the point that he actually starts to date a girl, likes her, and is even portrayed as manly. This didn't sit right with me. What is the point of having him crossdress and behave like a girl, with all the social problems this involves (people thinking you are a weirdo, your parents having to come to terms with it, your own feelings about yourself), if then all this is completely reset? Was he just crossdressing randomly, without any deeper reason? I was quite disappointed with this. 
 
I like the characters of Takatsuki and Chiba more. Takatsuki is more coherent. She really seems to have an issue with her being a girl, and is also more determined when it comes to dressing like a boy. Like Nitori, she doesn't really seem to develop an interest in other people of her own gender, but we don't see her as much so we don't really delve deep into her head. 
The reason I like Chiba is that I find her very human. Her behavior seems excessively cold at first, but the way she feels about other characters and her reasoning are believable. 
The other characters were OK, though most of them we didn't see enough and we only knew them superficially. 
 
The art is simple but fitting for the story. The music is also simple and doesn't stand out, but I guess it's fine in this kind of anime. The seiyuu were good. They chose a real boy to voice Nitori, and I think it makes sense. I don't really like it when crossdressing characters have a voice actor of the same gender they're crossdressing as (as in, crossdressing guys being voiced by women etc). It makes it ""too easy"", in a way. 
 
All in all it's a lighthearted, enjoyable anime, but I wish they didn't just discard what seemed to be the main point of the story.

","This is a fun series in the spirit of the original. It is a little more toned down for children though there are a few adult themes and humor scattered. The most aggravating issue in this is that the american release never finished the series. It is worth checking out though even if you need to download the last 30.  

          
 
       Helpful As a fellow fan of the DGC franchise, I actually discover Di Gi Charat through the Nyo opening “Dynamite I-N-G”, and yet, Nyo is the final DGC anime I viewed upon. What do I think of this anime? Despite being aim more towards kids, Di Gi Charat Nyo is a decent remake of the original series. 
 
Story: 
 
Okay, this is not a ground breaking story but on its own, it is decent. Yeah, it's not the greatest story in the world but I believe it's just as good as the original series' story 
 
Characters: 
 
Luckily, characters like Dejiko, Puchiko, Usada, Gema, and the BGG gang return. Heck, even Mike and Rinna from Panyo Panyo appeared in this series. Rather they were cameos or not is debatable but that's a story for another section. As for the new characters, they're pretty alright. I like characters like Aqua and Yu-Rei, I very glad to see them. They are some characters I didn't like (Kumagaya Kintarou) but hey, those are the type of characters that aren't meant to be liked. 
 
Music: 
 
Outside of the OP, ED, and some insert songs (Usamimi Chan for example), majority of the background songs aren't that memorible. Now here's the kicker, the songs I did mention are really catchy. 
 
Animation and Artwork: 
They're decent. Yeah it can go into “WTF are you doing animators?” territory at times but Overall it's decent 
 
Sub, Dub, and Licensing: 
 
Yes, I'm adding licensing into this and you'll see why...  Anyways, in the Japenese dub, the original cast for the characters return, which is nice to hear them.  
 
As for the dub... I gotta be honest... I don't hate the dub *avoid sharp objects being thrown* HEY! Hey! Listen to what I'm going to say next! Yes, I know this dub is consider to be the weakest of the Di Gi Charat dubs but it's not as bad as some people made it out to be. Okay yeah, the who “Akari” as “Akali” can be annoying but other than that, it's not that bad of a dub. I've heared worse... much...worse....  
 
ANYWAYS, onto to the licensing, and BOY there is a lot to say bout this and the way it was handled. During the time, Bandai only licensed and dubbed 72 episodes.... I am not joking when saying this. They left the other 32 episode unlicensed. That has to be the dumbest thing I have witnessed from a company like Bandai. And it's mind boggling because it's Bandai! The same people that gave us Gurren Lagann pulled this move! *sigh* This is why it's debatable rather Mike and Rinna were cameos. I'm hoping that Sentai Filmworks re-license this series and get all 104 episodes. It doesn't have to be re-dubbed. A re-license is all I'm asking. 
 
As for subtitles, well here's a quick one. 1-72: Good 73-104: Not Good. (No thanks to ARR fansubs kinda screwing with the character names) 
 
Overall: 
All and all, Di Gi Charat Nyo! is a entertaining anime overall. If you like the original series or want to see something funny, I suggest giving this a try. If you're looking for a ground-breaking story with heart throbbing emotions, this is not for you. 
 
I'm just happy to finally see the anime that introduce me to the Di Gi Charat franchise

Although I love this movie, there is little story until towards the end, which is why I gave it a lower rating. The art and music is absolutely amazing.

       Helpful Okay this is my first review :3 
 
Well, I think it's missing a review in Portuguese for the community about this incredible OVA. 
 
Asagao to Kase-san é simplesmente diferente de tudo que eu já vi (Sakura Trick, Strawberry Panic, Citrus, Bloom Into You). Retrata de um jeito espontâneo e sem exageros a relação entre as duas meninas principais. Não tem cenas desnecessárias, não tem situações revoltantes como Citrus (""Não podemos porque somos irmãs."") e a animação é simplesmente divina.  
 
A única parte que me decepcionou um pouco é que a menina mais alta parece ""o homem da relação"". Os pensamentos mais ""atrativos"" vinham sempre da Kase e a Yamada é mais envergonhada, inocente, o que causa um certo desbalanceamento na configuração dos personagens. Por que não pode ser duas meninas ""normais"" do colégio para se apaixonarem? Como ""Bloom Into You"" ou ""Strawberry Panic""? Uma sempre precisa ser masculinizada, algo que é um estereótipo na nossa sociedade atual. 
 
Então aqui fica a minha recomendação. Assistam, porque, realmente, vale muito a pena e o final é emocionante.

       Helpful It's short, it's yuri, it's beautiful.  
 
First off, you have to be aware of 2 things: 
- It is a promotional OVA for the manga with only a bit less than 1 hour. It basically summarizes/adapts a portion of the main story from like the first 11 (?) manga chapters.  
- It is purely romance, and yuri at that. So if you can't accept lesbian romance, this won't be for you. 
 
Other than that, it's simply a nice fluffy romance. There is no deep tragic drama (but it isn't completely plain either), it's the kind of romance you simply can lay back and enjoy the adorableness. 
 
The story revolves around Kase and Yamada, which are dating at this point. Kase being a tall, athletic, somewhat tomboyish and popular girl, while Yamada is basically the opposite by being small, clumsy, naive and insecure. 
__________ 
 
If you liked this OVA I highly recommend the manga, you get to see how they get together, many stories in between those 3 shown here, and also how it actually goes on after Yamadas resolve to go to Tokyo with Kase. That, and Yamada learns what a lesbian couple can do apart from ""only"" kissing... 
 
Personally, I hope that they will make a full anime adaption of this series. The characters are great, and the manga has enough content to cover.

Her biology teacher, Ms. Sonehara, has a peculiar interest in the birthmark, and it fires up when her childhood friend, Shin'ya Mizushima, tries to make a move on her. Not only that, Rinko also notices her eyes glow purple. The next day when Rinko is sexually assaulted, she finally discovers that her birthmark causes her to turn into a leopard.
","Cipher’s older, weirder sister. 
 
Purple Eyes in the Dark is a weird and confusing mess.  It’s basically a 25 minute trailer for the manga that only makes you want to read the manga so you can understand the trailer.  The only exposition comes in the form of gibberish lyrics.  Even when they’re in English, it still sounds like a foreign language.  And I swear somebody said “No more kitty litter for you” as if it implied kitty litter was a snack.  Why. 
 
I assume Purple Eyes is about a girl who can transform in a leopard.  What she does as a leopard, I have absolutely no idea.  However, the last three or so minutes have something that resembles a plot slightly.  I think there’s some scientist who captures her to study her, maybe?  But aside from the first and last three minutes, it’s just a series of manga art and volume covers in the most literal sense.  Go to the manga page for this and you’ll see that picture somewhere around the 17 and a half minute mark.   
 
There’s a bunch of characters but I don’t know who any of them are.  Some of them I can’t really tell if they’re supposed to be different people but at different points in time.  Is this short blue hair chick supposed to also be the long white hair chick?  I don’t understand.  And is the main girl a black leopard or a not black leopard?  Are there even two leopards?  I still don’t understand. 
 
In conclusion, Purple Eyes is just a less enjoyable Cipher.  Where Cipher shamelessly played Footloose over and over with terrible English to break things up, Purple Eyes just sort of bores.  Cipher was confusing fun, Purple Eyes not so much.  Don’t expect so-bad-it’s-good, only bad.

          
 
       Helpful Well uh.. That is a thing. That was sold in stores. For real cash.  
 
To clear a few things up, I actually found this MV (I guess) pretty relaxing and entertaining, so with that, why a 3? The biggest reason is because it was sold for real life money. You could purchase a 30 minute Manga Music Video in 1988 on VHS. At the time, sure It might have had some material value, but since free and common video sharing websites exist now (and since the Internet became a thing), it's value became basically zero for the normal consumer. Only collectors would find any value in the physical release.  
 
With that said, it is pretty well made for 1988/87(sources differ) and for being a MMV but even so it feels cheap in the grand scheme. It has fluid animated parts as well, so I don't know why they wouldn't just animate one short chapter in 30 minutes. This feels more like a university club fan project or a modern day Niconico MMV than -you know- a retail release OVA meant to advertise and sell the manga itself. I would definitely feel cheated out of my money if I had bought this in the late 80s/early 90s with the 'Toei Animaton' logo on it, expecting a nice, actual OVA made by the company behind Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. 
 
So overall it definitely is nice to see/listen to if you're a fan of relaxing music, but don't actually buy it unless you're a crazy VHS collector or something like that.  
 
One could argue that the 'Very Bad/Poor' in 3 references a 'Very Bad/Poor' business practice.  
At least it got me mildly interested in the manga so that's good I guess?

4,1762,51,8.12160936,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Arslan Senki,"In the medieval kingdom of Pars, young Prince Arslan confronts the hostility of his father and the disinterest of his mother, and yearns to learn more about the world. Despite being surrounded by poverty and slavery, Arslan persists in seeing the possibility of a nobler world. Everything changes when the neighboring nation of Lusitania invades Pars, and Arslan is forced to grow up in an instant. 
 
 Arslan Senki  follows Prince Arslan to war, where he struggles to save his nation and family with the help of a small but devoted circle of advisers. Along the way the young prince finds secrets around every corner and faces enemies who hate him because of what he is, but also finds friends where he least expects them. The story of nations at war,  Arslan Senki  is also the story of one boy's quest to stay himself in the most trying of circumstances.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Historical']","
The story is set in a legendary vision of an indistinct amalgam of over a thousand years of ancient Persia and nearby other countries. While the world in which it takes place is one where magic obviously exists, said magic is of an extremely limited nature. Until the middle of the anime, the only magical happenings involve a few spells and a giant, humanoid monster. There are many evil monsters such as ghouls and winged monkeys, appear in the second half of the novel series. Especially the first half of the series is, at the core, a war story taking place between human nations. In addition, there are underlying themes exploring the repercussions of slavery on a society, having an absolute monarch who treats the poor as cattle, and religious obsession.
The story follows the exploits of Arslan, the crown prince of the kingdom of Pars (""پارس"" or ""فارس"" is equivalent word to Persia and what the land of Persians ""پارسیان"" was called), and it is divided into two parts. In the first part, Pars is taken over by the neighboring nation of Lusitania after Arslan's father, King Andragoras III, falls victim to a treacherous plot led by some of his most trusted retainers. After barely escaping with his life, Arslan rejoins his loyal servant, Daryun. Backed up by only a few more companions, including the philosopher and tactician Narsus and his young servant Elam, also Farangis, an aloof, cold priestess, and Gieve, a travelling musician and con-man, Arslan stands against overwhelming odds to assemble an army strong enough to liberate his nation from the Lusitanian army which is led by the elusive warrior known as ""Silvermask"", who is later revealed to be another contender to Pars' throne. In the second part, Arslan, now king of Pars, divides himself between defending his country against several external threats, including Silvermask, who is still at large, seeking to claim the throne for himself, and addressing the needs and hopes of his subjects.
","I enjoyed Arslan Senki, but it definitely had a few oddities. Firstly, it seemed to have extreme time lapses - so much so that I felt like character development really suffered. That's not to say that the characters aren't likeable or fleshed out; they are, but some of the main cast are largely ignored. 
 
Take Firen Gaysis for example; she appears out of nowhere to protect the crown prince. After she joins him her story is pretty much non-existent. Her role in the story is basically limited to chiming in every time Geeives says something, which is a shame. 
 
Imagine how awesome it would have been if she, a warrior of the Goddess fought the religious fanatics directly? The blood-shed and suicides could lead her to question the divinity of the Gods -- giving her character more than just one dimension. 
 
Arslan Senki: highly watchable but full of untapped potential and cursed with an abrupt end.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is one of the very first I've seen back in the days, and to this day is probably what got me into the genre. 
 
Great story if your into fantasy and some sword play, I only wished the series was  a little longer and more fleshed out but I loved in none the less.  
 
The originial english voice actors at the beginning are quite good, no idea why they changed the VA's towards the end... I think it was a long time between releases.. but still, watch it in japanese and you should be fine if you hate inconsistencies there. 
 
Shame for them to do that otherwise i'd give it a perfect score. 
 
Definately reccomended to the old skool anime-goers.

          
 
       Helpful The unbeaten army of Pars finds itself lured into a trap during a battle. The troops get slaughtered, the king captured and their capitol is taken later on. The crown prince, Arslan, escapes with his loyal fighter, Darün/Daryoon (I watched G_P's release ""Darün"", but here he is listed as ""Daryoon""). 
 
From there Arslan allies a handful loyal companions around him and marches to castle Peshawar at the border to plan his strike on the capitol to retake and free his parents, the King and Queen. With a few side-stories going on, this anime never got me bored and always got me hooked for one more episode, although I was running late for work. 
 
The art and sound sure are not near up-to-date, but to be honest, I don't care. In the end you have to judge something by the standards of that time. Otherwise you could claim to be better than Galileo Galilei, because now we know more than he did. 
 
The story, characters and the overall enjoyment were outstanding. This isn't just a companion-rallying medieval fight-anime with some magic to it. No, it has deep political (how he got that elephant-riding troop to join him and other very clever moves), deep moral (his childhood and therefore his hatred for slavery and some other things, but don't want to spoil), funny (Gieve/Guibu always making me smirk with his highly intelligent and eloquent verbal punches towards anyone), and of course captivating, because this story is well-written. 
 
I would have liked to see more than 6 episodes, but I think leaving the rest to the imagination of the watcher isn't half-bad either. I liked how Gieve/Guibu started picking on the people in the castle and left the party after that, because as a ministrel/bard he is just too much of a free spirit to be ""caged"" inside a castle for too long. I am sure in other anime, they would have made him stay or even not pick up fights, but this anime is very authentic and that is one of few factors, which made me give this anime 10/10 and boost it on the top of my list. 
 
10/10, most favourite anime!

In order to save his love, Rama goes to Lanka with the help of an army of monkeys and friends of the forest.  
 
A feature film based on a story of true love, friendship, and trust, this anime is about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, with musical elements from Indian cinemas in between. ",['Adventure'],"
","An adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayan. The story follows two brothers, Ram and Lakshaman,  as they try and rescue Sita, the wife of Ram, after she is kidnapped by the king of Lanka Ravan. Along the way, many legendary figures come to aid Ram, such as the great Hanuman. The story is pretty accurate to the original story told by Hindu people. 
 
The art is somewhat outdated but still very fluid and life like. The fight scenes are greatly choreographed and animated. 
 
The characters are greatly adapted and complex. almost no main characters moral in this anime is truly black or white. The characters are greatly written. They feel real since the bad guys don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, and the good guys have a motivation and reason to do good things. The antagonists can't be characterized as evil people, since they show emotion, empathy, and love. The protagonists are shown to kill, but also regret and  grieve even over the deaths of the antagonists. 
 
I enjoyed this anime greatly. I finished it in 1 sitting, which is more than I can say about other  movies. 
 
This anime deserves an 8/10. Definitely would watch again sometime in the future.

          
 
       Helpful In 1992, Japan and India were celebrating 40 years of strong diplomatic ties. A part of the celebration was this project. Which was worked on by Japanese & Indian animation studios alike and based off of the Hindu epic, Ramayana.  
 
I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with the epic. As such, I probably won't notice if the film gets some details wrong. You'll have to wait for the anime versions of The Iliad, Beowulf & Journey to the West to see me get into heavy scholarly detail about adaptation differences. 
 
Story:  
 
We open with a countryside being terrorised by demons. Or maybe they're just British imperials in funny outfits. In any case, a Hindu holy man beseeches Vishnu for guidance. A golden light tells him to go to Ayodhya and bring Prince Rama who can defeat the imperial demons. He does as he asks and Prince Rama handily saves the countryside and finds himself a pretty young bride, Sita, during the journey. Everything is looking up for him until his father sends him into exile to keep a promise and his wife is kidnapped by the demon Ravan.  
 
The biggest issue with the film's narrative is that scenes don't always flow smoothly. Take Sita's abduction for example. We see Rama chasing a demon disguised as a golden deer. He seems to barely move out of sight when he shoots it. We then watch his brother, Lakshman, get fooled by the demon faking his voice. So, he pours holy... salt around Sita to protect her. He leaves. Ravan disguises as a priest tricks her into crossing over the salt and has time to escape before they return. The point I'm making here is that, as presented, this sequence doesn't work. It looks like Rama should have enough time to return about five times, maybe six, before Sita is taken. There are other scenes like that too. Hanuman's trip to the Himalayas is really abrupt. 
 
It's also a bit weird that there's a musical interlude in the middle of the film where all we do is stare at a vacant screen. I don't mind them having musical numbers but at least give us something to look at while they play. But on the subject of musical numbers, Hanuman gets a kind of weak song where he repeats that he's Rama's emissary for around three minutes and it's just kind of a boring, overly repetitive number.  
 
That being said, the film is presented in a very old fashioned epic style that works pretty well. It comes complete with great, heroic deeds, imposing trials, fallen heroes and divine intervention. I'm not sure how accurate it is to the source material, but it does have that aesthetic and it is pretty interesting.  
 
Characters: 
 
I can't say the characters are very complex. Rama and his people are those kind of generic, heroic characters you get in these old epics. His villains are demons who are there more to be strong imposing threats than fleshed out characters but some still get sympathetic moments. Kumbakharna when greeting Hanuman being the big example.  
 
Art: 
 
The monster designs are pretty interesting and the action sequences flow pretty well. It is a little weird when they show Ravan flying a plane with a dragon motif or they show monkeys in mechanical siege towers. Somehow, I don't think that's fully accurate to the source material. And the ordinary human characters themselves don't have the most interesting designs. But I will credit the people who made this for picking an art style that does capture the feeling of an old epic.  
 
Sound: 
 
The voice work is fine. They got some pretty well known Bollywood actors like Arun Govil, Amrish Puri & Namrata Sawhney. Their performances are good but there's an unfortunate issue that crops up from time to time with the sound levels being mixed awkwardly. Which can result in a character's speaking volume changing quite drastically from one scene to another or the sound effects overpowering the voices.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Let the scenes breathe. Maybe this would result in a musical sequence or two having to be cut or just in a longer film, but it would help the pacing to have more build up in some key scenes.  
Give some visuals to go with your musical numbers. Maybe something as simple as Rama's army preparing. You could even get away with a slide show if you had strong enough stills but when you have a five minute musical number give us something.  
The sound mixing. I think the performances would come across as much better if not for the mixing problems and that would make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ramayana is not one of the best children's films out there but it still manages to be pretty solid. If I was watching this as a kid instead of as a cynical adult, I'd probably be absolutely riveted. Still, I'll give it a solid 7/10. 

          
 
       Helpful It's an epic story based on the Indian epic poem written by Valmiki(Ratnakkardah).Lord Ram is beleived to be 7th incarnation of Indian God Vishnu.The joureny starts when Lord Ram was  just 15 and the devil King Ravan was at peak of his powers.The character shown By Lord Ram is definitely one to be thrive towards.The story is well written and every character is important.Story just doesn't revolve around Ram,Sita,Lakshman and Ravan.There is subtle importance  of all the characters.Sound effects considering the technology present are very good.It is overall very good story with happy but incomplete ending.Overall it is worth watching once in a life.

","STORY - 6 
 
The story is the same as the 12-episode anime's first episode, with minor differences in the script. It sets everything up very nicely. The ending of this version is much more dramatic than that of its counterpart, but in a good way. The downside, however, is that it discontinues; you would have to watch the 12-episode version to find out what happens next. 
 
ART - 4 
 
Being an ONA, I cut it some slack. It's on par with low-quality GIF art, which I can excuse in exchange for the decent job on the characters themselves, and the recycled backgrounds are understandable. However, some of the conversation scenes include stationary characters at a long-distance shot that was eye-hurtingly bad. One thing I did like about it was that it maintained the feel of a visual novel, with unusual clip splicing (usually with character profiles). 
 
SOUND - 5 
 
Nothing good or bad in particular about the soundtrack. The OP and ED are typical anime music, and the background music is elevator-worthy. I suspect it was taken directly from the game; it did lend to the visual novel feel. The voice acting was decent. 
 
CHARACTER - 6 
 
The characters are presented much the same as in the 12-episoder. Makoto is a little more obviously violent, and Katsura seems to have more personality immediately evident. The lack of complicated character animation, however, failed to bring them out. Particularly in Sekai's case, the focus was directed on fan service. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 5 
 
Watching this was sort of a novel experience, no pun intended, due to the very visual novel feel. However, the animation quality was off-putting, and the familiarity of the script made it a little boring. 
 
OVERALL - 5 
 
Not a bad anime, but there are better things to be watching, including the other version of School Days. I wouldn't recommend this except to diehard fans or to those who haven't yet watched the other version- in the case of the latter, I will say this does make a good way to sample the anime.

          
 
       Helpful OK, to get it from the top: 
This episode is a game promo, so it may be treated only as its commercial, or the anime series preview. It perfectly fullfills the requirements, but nothing more than that. Actually, it's slightly rescripted first episode, or vice versa, doesn't matter. If you seen the ONA, you don't need to watch the first episode, if you seen the first episode... you know the rest. Its benefits just like the first episode's — it catches you and doesn't let until the next dose of series 
 
It cannot be taken separately so if you've watched this, just know — you're on the hook 

          
 
       Helpful Back in the starting era of my anime (or rather, my anime days ;)), I would binge-watch WatchMojo's crappy TOP 10 lists in hope to kill some time, that until I stumbled across the infamous “TOP 10 anime characters deaths”. 
It was then when I picked up interest in anime for the first time, and it was all thanks to Makoto's featured death. School Days ONA is a pointless retelling to the first episode of the original series, just a complete replica with no extra effort put on neither the animation, not the audio work and the reason behind it is still just as oblivious. 
Now I like my School Days as much as the next guy (probably not), but this, this was just utterly despicable to put as a standalone release, unless you haven't seen the show in ages and just wanted a quick reminder on how it all started, I'd suggest keeping all the distance you can from this low-level trash. I'm still haunted by how awful the animation is that I'd swear the pixels are easily countable within the range of any first-grader. And let me raise “another” exclamation mark on the low-quality voice acting, besides Kotonoha's, everything sounded like seagulls screaming at a potato webcam's integrated microphone.

Hatsukoi limited I don't have a damn idea why I loved it so much ...

I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes) 
 
I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(. 


          
 
       Helpful ""Are you in love right now?"" 
 
Well with this anime..it's more divisive than ""in love"" actually... 
 
Hatsukoi Limited follows several unrequited relationships and each of the earlier episodes focuses on one set of relationships while developing the ones from the previous episode in tandem, which makes one elaborate love dodecahedron. 
 
Well since this is a relationship-based romance naime, LA needs to start off with the characters themselves and their relationships. Let's start with Ayumi Arihara voiced by Mariya Ise, one of the genki ditz of her girl group who has a crush on Mamoru Zaitsu voiced by Miyu Irino but his older brother Misao voiced by Kenji Nomura also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality. Next we have Rika Dobashi voiced by Minako Kotobuki a calm yet athletic member of the girl group who has a nice romance with Haruto Terai voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in which they have this superiority inferiority complex towards each other. Next is Nao Chikura voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, one of the more shy member of the girl group and Hiroyuki Sogabe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai had a crush on her BUT she also has a fleeting romance with one of her former art club seniors by the form of Yukito Renjou voiced by Akira Ishida. Next (YES, there's still more!) is Misaki Yamamoto voiced by Rie Tanaka and Mamoru Zaitsu has a crush on her BUT Misaki likes Ayumi's older brother Yuuji voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino (in which HE has a sister complex and doesn't really have feelings for Misaki), next is Meguru Watase voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in which she and Gengorou Takei voiced by Kazuya Nakai DO have feelings for each other ALONG with their love of swimming but Meguru has other worries but that a bit later. Second to last is Koyoi Bessho voiced by Aki Toyosaki who has a brother complex to her older brother Yoshihiko Bessho voiced by Satoshi Hino in which he has feelings for Misaki and FINALLY we have Kei Enomoto voiced by Shizuka Ito, the alpha *ahem* bitch of the girl group in which she has a violent tsundere relationship with Etsu Kusuda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma the local pervert of the series and friends of Sogabe and Mamoru and later on Enomoto gets a rival in the form of Sumire Fudounomiya voiced by Ayako Kawasumi. Did you get all that??? 
 
Ok in all honesty, the relationships ranges across the board and even the ""great relationships"" has skewed priorities to the ""horribly awful relationships"" have a silver lining. In terms of favourites and worst romances in the anime itself, LA thought that Chikura's and Dobashi's were some of the best one-shot romances with hardly a gleam of skewed priorities to them. Misaki's, Meguru's and Ayumi's were ok relationships with a few problems to them (Misaki's due to the fallout results concerning Mamoru, Meguru's for skewed priorities such as -sigh- her big boobs and Ayumi's for not being developed enough not just to Mamoru but to Misao as well and it's NEVER resolved...completely). LA would place Koyoi's relationship to be of comedic relief in a ways and NOT meant to be taken seriously, even if it's incest and you know LA rule with incest in anime (as long as it's their completely serious about it's subject matter of incest or it plays it up for the sake of comedy with no seriousness and dignity towards it's characters and Koyoi's is essentially this) thus Koyoi's only focus episode is a bit grating but it's only for the sake of comedy. -sigh- here we go...LA REALLY didn't like Enomoto and Kusuda's relationship, Enomoto for always having her belief that they need to be handsome and rich in order to even START dating her (see what LA means by alpha bitch?) AS well as Enomoto's CONSTANT tsun and violent verbal and sometimes physical abuse to Kusuda just because he's being perverted and eyeing someone else, Kusuda is no better as he's one of the main source of pervertedness in the anime besides the stray panty shots. Relationship-wise it's one of the most destructive relationship in the anime and by the end of it even with Enomoto and Kusuda's realization LA still hated the both of them by the end of it. 
 
Well here's also the thing, be it relationships that has no flaws and it's the perfect romance or one of the most destructive ones and LA didn't like them one bit, the perfect romance will have quips of completely idealistic to the destructive romances to be too harsh or unbelievably pessimistic and because of that LA chose Ayumi as LA's favourite she's in the middle of having flaws in her relationships but she's also idealistic in a ways. 
 
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the character designs were pretty to typical designs for the vast amount of characters in this anime and sometimes LA mistook characters for other similar looking characters (see Yoshihiko and Mamoru...no seriously...one time LA ACTUALLY thought this at one point), the backgrounding is typical but nothing to gawk at either. Finally the comedic moments does use the chibi visuals (both facial expressions and their entire body at times...Koyoi and Ayumi being the main culprit what with both of them being the comedic reliefs). The animation overall is decent with some level to detail on it's character designs but not much beyond that. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well this voice cast is JUST amazing, from Mariya Ise to Ayako Kawasumi and even Sayuri Yahagi!. Yes, LA did have a HUGE problem with Shizuka Ito's character but it is her CHARACTER LA didn't like, her vocals were still suited to Enomoto nonetheless. LA's favourite voice actor would go to Mariya Ise along with Ryoko Shiraishi. Nonetheless fantastic vocal line up!. 
 
Hatsukoi Limited for LA's experience in watching this anime ultimately depends on how you view the characters and their relationships in which they entail, you might hate some of the characters or you might love them and their relationships for the one true pairing or you see both the good or the bad towards one of the relationship. LA overall felt VERY divisive about this anime due to this but ALSO thought it had shades of wasted potential towards some of the relationships it had going for it.

          
 
       Helpful Usually I am not a huge fan of 12 or less episode series, but this was among one of the few that I really enjoyed. Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there. 
 
As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females, and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two. 
 
After the first few episodes I wasn't really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series.  
 
I'd suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure.

The protagonist is a seventeen year old boy who transfers into the school and meets various major players on campus, such as the outlaw teacher, the soccer captain, and a childhood friend whom the protagonist has not seen for seven years. The school presents opportunities for friendship, love and conflict, and changes are now bound to happen in the main character's life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"Parodies are always a pleasure to watch, because we know that the authors themselves aren't serious at all. ""Gakuen Handsome"" wonderfully parodies the vast world of Boy's Love (BL or yaoi), exaggerating everything and taking the parody to a whole new level - from the art to the non-existing plot with ridiculous situations, and even adding references to poop. 
 
I first learned about BL parody when playing the BL parody game ""Kusoge"", featuring the same parody type (and ridiculously long chins) than ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
It was so funny that I searched for more BL parodies of this type, and I stumbled upon a walkthough of one of the ""Gakuen Handsome"" games by a Japanese YouTuber, and it was so good that I watched the entire thing, along with the two MVs of the official character songs that were as funny as the rest. 
 
I was so charmed by this unique and strange... thing, that I was overjoyed when an OVA was announced. 
So here is my review, though I don't really know if it can be called a review because the ""Gakuen Handsome"" franchise is so out of this world that it... it honestly can't be reviewed. But I'll try my best :> 
 
[Story & Characters] 
The plot of ""Gakuen Handsome"" parodies the undying scenario of the average naive young transfer student, entering a new school to be almost immediately surrounded by a harem of bishounen ready to die for him (thumbs up for the headmaster and his little sister pairing up to encourage him in his love life). 
All the situations were very funny, and ended up with such enormous nonsense that I laughed a lot. 
The characters, that remained just the way they were in the original games, are such enormous cliches that it's hilarious. The kind childhood friend, the dangerous young teacher, the serious class representative and the cold classmate, among others, were perfect in their respective roles. 
 
[Art] 
""Gakuen Handsome"" being... well, ""Gakuen Handsome"", you obviously can't expect much from this wonderful parody, and The Animation kept this same crappy Flash animation used in the previous games and MVs. The poor animation serving the non-existent plot is fully part of the enjoyment, along with the ridiculously pointy bishounen chins and the strange moves and dances that pop up for no reason at all. 
 
[Sound] 
Unfortunately, and at my despair, the production staff entirely recasted the voice actors, leaving behind the hilarious voice acting of the games (bye bye, Sakuya's voice that made me cry of laughter). Instead were, among others, the well-known voices of Hanae Natsuki (Kaneki Ken@Tokyo Ghoul, Arima Kousei@Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and Kahikara Tetsuya (Natsu Dragneel@Fairy Tail). 
The new seiyuu, being pros, did an excellent job with voice acting, but I feel that they made me laughed way less than in the games, because even there the voice acting sounded so unprofessional that it was used as a parody feature. 
In a way, I felt that the new cast was too professional for an unique license such as ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
About the rest of the sound - honestly, I was so focused on wondering what I was doing with my life that I didn't pay much attention to it. 
 
[Overall] 
I can safely say that I laughed way more with the original games than with ""Gakuen Handsome: The Animation"", especially because of the cast change for the anime. But it was still great to watch, and I recommend to every anime viewer who wants to have some fun and gently make fun of the BL genre. 
If you're interested in more things like this, I recommend the visual novel ""Kusoge"" (lit. ""shitty game) <3

","This is actually one of those anime which is  more relatable to an actual cartoon with a little more depth,drama and hint of  manga styled comedy the violence is just hilarious  half of the time they're just shooting and blasting everything on sight. 
 
This show sadly never made it outside Asia or at least in any eng speaking region so this isn't much popular on the web only thing you can actually find about this show is some bootlegs VCD's or youtube videos no torrents or live streams sorry. 
 
Story:7/10 
 
The story in this show opens and ends in a very old styled fashion like ranma1/2 story isn't really cohesive as it is chaotic like tom&Jerry you know its  just about a housecat its not going to break new grounds. 
 
No matter how crazy the premise gets there isn't really much to the story other than kuro getting into constant trouble and saving his elderly owners which ensures hilarity. 
 
Animation:7/10 
 
It is very basic&simple  but its not too cheap either simple character designs make it easy for comedic purposes and the animation studio didn't really have good funding considering that they got bankrupt and cancelled the show so give them a break. 
 
Sound:7/10 
 
Japanese voice acting is good as far as i've seen in subbed episodes Kuro chan is actually voiced by the same voice actor as Agumon from digimon besides the music is very catchy and lighthearted. 
 
Characters:7/10 
 
Kuro: He's the main character who has a short temper and skills to build something from complete scrap yep just like Wile.E.Coyote he can build a giant turbo propelled car out of simple hunk of scrap. 
 
Grandparents: Kuro's owners who are quite simply are not aware of anything going around and are constantly getting kidnapped because of kuro,kinda like Eustace&muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog. 
 
MI-KUN: Well i'm not Japanese so i thought his name was just ""Mikun"" turns out ""Kun"" is a Japanese honorific he's the cat who can shapeshift by attaching metal things to his body and and he can even fuse with kuro he's very gentle and shy unlike kuro. 
 
Nana: An eccentric table lamp turned into a girl robot who's lovesick with a Housecat.. LOL the hilarity  
 
Dr. Go:He's the cliched evil scientist who made kuro into a cyborg though he's not really that evil and actually ends up helping kuro all the time and all the villains are mostly just goofy except for one that is a devil virus. 
 
Matatabi:Well he's a ""Rough"" kitty who has a history with kuro and is  actually NOT A cyborg and yet can talk.. yep its very much like a cartoon now. 
 
Kotaro: A boy Genius who for some reason is obsessed with Kuro and usually hangs around with Dr.GO 
 
Overall:7/10 
 
If you're a fan of anime like Tokyo pig or shinchan or  just a fan of old school anime/cartoon with some comedy you can have plenty of fun with this show. 
 
Well if you find a complete DVDset for this anywhere that is.... >_> well atleast you can still watch some of it on youtube.

","The things Marchen Madchen actually got wonderfully right 
 
I swear this is a review but I first have to start off with a bit of background of this anime since I believe people are a bit too harsh in their mocking of this show.  
 
While 2018 brought us some terribly animated anime such as the likes of My Sister My Writer and Master of Ragnorok, Marchen Madchen became known as the biggest disaster of the year and is likely set to become the next metaphorical warning pillar of how badly things can go during anime production since the Beserk remakes. The show's suffering is fairly well-documented thanks to no small effort by the likes of anime news sites and industry reporters like SakugaBlog who have written a great piece on Madchen Marchen and the larger allusion to some of the unsustainable practices of the anime industry. I highly recommend a read through it so you can gain a better understanding of the inner workings of our much-beloved industry.  
 
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/03/24/marchen-madchen-a-production-postmortem/ 
 
In summery, Marchen Madchen was an unfortunate victim of a well-known snowball-effect in animation production where small problems - that are notably intrinsic to the framework of the production line - build up and start causing massive scheduling issues which all but broke the already delicate and hard-pressed machine. These production problems are often experienced with most anime series but Marchen Madchen seemed to be hit especially hard. Production was so bad that the studio was forced to take the infamous two-week break between episodes 8 and 9 under the pretense of ""fixing animation"" but they were, in fact, running around panicked and blind trying to find a production assistant for episode 9. The time and budget were all but ruined even before that break but episode 9 surely put the last nail in the coffin and the originally one-cour plan was scraped and the series was forced to end its television run at only 10 episodes. Everyone who knows about Marchen Madchen knows whats wrong with it. Just have a quick read through most of the reviews on this site and the problems are all but apparent - terrible animation, generic and bland story, forgettable cast, confusing tone, pacing issues, the lot. So I'm going to do something different and talk about the things that Marchen Madchen actually does WELL at.   
 
To start off the review, I just want to confirm that I genuinely like Madchen Madchen. I went in with very little expectations with only the knowledge of the incredibly low MAL score and that the animation was a disaster but the show managed to charm me in a way that I haven't felt in a long time and it compelled me to write this review. The show tells the story through the eyes of our main character - Kagimura Hazuki - a shy girl with little self-confidence. Upon following a mysterious stranger, she stumbles into a world of magic where she finds herself in a magic school where girls use the power of Origins - classical stories that grant the wielder powers in an allegorical fashion related to the story. She finds that she has become the wielder of one of the strongest Origins- the tale of Cinderella and sets forth on her adventure. Yeah yeah I know this synopsis is one you've probably read a million times by now but I feel this anime has just the right amount of heart put into it by its creators that Hazuki is often criticized as a bit of a wussy character by most people but I believe she is so much more. Her character has a level of genre savviness that allows her to not only create a level of comedic self-awareness but also as a force to drive the themes of the show. Case in point episode 6. The episode prior had Hazuki go through a phase of self-doubt and Hazuki arrives to save her friends from trouble and unlocks her hidden power that is so spectacular it wins them the fight. This sequence of events is incredibly cliché and predictable but for me the scenes worked incredibly well. In a single speech Hazuki managed to become one of the most badass characters of all time as she managed to perfectly cap off the build-up of the shows themes up until that point.  
 
The show's thematic and symbolic elements rose far above the mediocre writing and world-building. We are told time and time again that the Origin's the girls possess are given preferential treatment over the girls themselves and much of the conflict in this show focuses on the fate the girls struggle to fight against. What Hazuki did in epsode 6 perfectly ripped into the high and mighty traditional view of abusing the Origin's at the cost of the girls who wield them. Not only that but she also tore into the way stories are told and how people cling too desperately to an untenable tradition in her criticism of the fairy tale of Cinderella - her Origin and a story she herself adored. This was a powerful and immensely satisfying moment that had genuinely great build-up. Add to that the great performance by Hazuki's voice actor, Kusunoki Tomori, and this scene almost singlehandedly saved the previous bland 5 episodes. Hazuki is easily the best character of the show and a strong character in general even if she is somewhat generic. Small sub stories such as the friend of the Academy’s principle leaving her Origin behind and the struggle for Shizuka to hold on to and protect her mother's legacy all contributed to a powerful narrative theme. Even if the show's production was falling apart I get the feeling that the writers and planners were desperate to at least get this one theme through to the audience and I think they did a damn fine job. They never created a heavy-handed and overly-direct manner in which to carry out their message which they really could have done under the excuse of the shot pacing.  
 
After the first serious arc concluded, the show took a bit of a breather with our characters facing the Russian team. I had Vietnam-esque flashbacks to just how poorly something like this was handled in a similar show that featured cute girls in a knock-out tournament- Girls und Panzer (in fact, that show also went through production hell almost on the same level as this one but that's a story for another time). I want to be the first to say that episodes 7 and 8 were genuinely funny comedic episodes and that the Russian team were a hilarious gang that gave me a good chuckle more often than not. The level of comedy in this mini-arc is not particularly great nor is it that original but it is well-executed. The situations that were created were clearly thought up by competent writers. In one scene, in a comedic attempt to sabotage the main character's team, the leader of the Russian team sends an e-mail to Hazuki asking her to arrive at a fake meeting in the basement where they can lock her up. How does she get out? Easy. Just use her phone to call her friends thanks to the available Wi-Fi that was used to send the e-mail in the first place and was completely overlooked by the Russian team. I know explaining jokes is in poor taste if there's no context but these types of situations gave rise to a charming, short, easy-to-watch breather arc before we were treated to the disastrous episode 9. Heck, I even found the more serious tone regarding the tainted Origin of one Tatiana from the Russian team to be a pretty good addition. It was short and sweet with a likeable character and that's all you need sometimes. How fortunate we were in getting this arc in the first place since apparently the original light novel (which is clearly much better written) downsized this arc and its comedic parts in place of more serious plot points.  
 
Of course, I had to take incredible amounts of liberty in ignoring the implications of the plot points that made me like the anime so much. These would be things related to world building (which is terrible), the rules of the magic system (which were poorly explained), the horrendous pacing (packing an amount of material that could easily fit into 2 cours into just one), the sloppy presentation of the main conflict in the show, and the character writing (which, apart from maybe the main pair of Hazuki and Shizuka and the whole Russian team, were pretty lackluster and bland). Honestly, there's a lot wrong with the show. Even if everything went perfectly fine in the animation production I doubt I would give it more than a 6/10 since everything is mostly bland and simple. But I like this show. I don't exactly know why. Perhaps its a blend of personal reasons and managing to notice legitimate praise-worthy aspects to the show when everyone else pushed it aside. Marchen Madchen is a show that just managed to hit the right notes with me and I think that sits well for me.  
   
So what lies ahead for Marchen Madchen?  
 
Episodes 11 and 12 were cast into a dark limbo after the series was canned off TV and they face an uncertain and anxious future. The most likely thing that will happen to them, as agreed by most people, is that they will be released as direct-to-DVD and bluray sets for anyone still willing to watch the show. That's if there's anyone on the staff who's still willing to make it, of course... Youtube has some videos with comparisons between the TV and Bluray version of some of its most infamously awful scenes and the improvement in quality is so apparent it's almost like watching two completely different anime. This improvement is certainly most welcome. Marchen Madchen was the last hurrah of the light novel author Tomohiro Matsu before he tragically passed away in 2016. This anime and the controversy surrounding it may probably be the biggest insult to a deceased person. Despite this, at least I found his message that he left behind in this anime.  
 
EDIT: After another series of delays to air the episodes during December 2018, they're now trying again for during or after April 2019 ""due to circumstances""...yeeeeaaaaahhhh this doesn't smell good...  
 
UPDATE (APRIL 2019): They're finally releasing the final 2 episodes. Hope the animators, directors, writers, and producers have worked things out...  
 
UPDATE (NOVEMBER 2019): Finally got around to watching the final 2 episodes. It didn't fall outside of my expectations. It was extremely messy, rushed, and convoluted especially since I forgot a lot of the plot threads that were brought up in the series. Also, I have no idea whether how mothers of the MCs were related to each other. Weird twists happen a lot too. Animation and direction-wise ep. 11 is really underwhelming. I can see that they hardly had much time to go through with polishing the show despite the long gap. It just looks pretty ugly at times. Episode 12 actually has some nice moments of animation and cinematography which was definitely fresh for this show. Doesn't fix everything, of course, and it's a shame seeing that this is how the series could have been but it's nice that they finally stuck it in the end. Overall, despite how messy everything was (like, really, who the fuck is Arthur? I want the real female Arthur Pendragon *looks longingly at Saber in the distance*) I still like this show. It stuck with it's themes which I personally resonate with me and it still had genuinely good, albeit transient, moments of comedy I enjoyed and chuckled at. Nothing ostensibly bad here and a much welcomed and deserved final rest to one of the most troubled productions in recent memory.  
 
Thanks for reading! 


          
 
       Helpful It's not a bad anime but it's not an excepcional either. It's a pretty much clichê anime but despite that it's still interesting. 
 
The MC is strong but not strong as in ""I can kick every one's arses"" but in a loving way, treating other people's wounds as we could see on the latest episode (episode 7).  
It's a funny anime with cute girls. despite missing a bit of actual story, it's a good anime to watch while it's releasing. 
 
It's just sad that the team behind this anime gave up on the idea. They took a two or three week break in order to improve animation (since a lot of the episodes had really bad drawings) that resulted in no improvements and, a week after that, they totally shut down the anime, which killed the entire story. This anime as no ending, leaving us, the weebs, to imagine what would happen to the characters, if they'd succeed in their fight or if they'd lose and accomplish nothing. 
 
 
(This was an old review that I made when the anime was releasing and was at episode 7, but changed a couple of things. Sorry if it's confusing in some way).

       Helpful To all dear MAL users who will read this review of mine will must know this note: i'm not really good at reviewing an anime and if u had seen my first anime review then u appreciate it  
 
Now this is my 2nd anime review and this review is about the messy yet dreaded and also the nearly forgotten anime that was Marchen Madchen. Ok here are a few details of this anime that i rage quitted watching at: 
 
Case no. 1 The Story: 
 
Anyway this anime is about a girl who sink herself with books (she reads fairy tales rather than world history or a book that tells the famous battles in history) rather than contacting or make friends with people until she met a stranger that became her friendly not much to say about the story for now. 
 
Case no. 2 The Art/Animation: 
 
The animation in the first 8 episodes started from being decent to nearly critical level and after the 2 week break of the staff of this series it ended in a bad direction ( which i got nearly predicted with ) also add of couple of yuri cliches, fanservice extravaganza,and random transformation sequences that i myself felt angered (seriously use a magical book known as Origin to transform into a fairy tale character? That's totally wierd) anyway again i drop this one after 4 episodes 
 
The 9th episode was the worst in the series and it ended with the following: 
 
1.Inaccurate animation 
 
2.Weird facial animations 
 
3.Bad timing action scenes 
 
4.Disfigured-esque character appearance. 
 
 
Case no. 3 Sound/Music: 
 
The BGM in the anime sounds ok-ish but the only thing i feared about is both the OP and the ED ( Which i think of this myself is the OP of the anime related to the late author's unfinished story of his life? or the ED which is a slow one but give it a title like ""Sleepland""? That's one weird title for an anime theme ) 
 
Case no. 4 Character: 
The Characters in this anime are ranging from decent looking to the most annoying ones in the show ( Especially the Russian characters who likes4 to make jokes which i considered myself unfunny in my opinion) well not much to say about it for now 
 
Case no. 5 Enjoyment: 
 
My enjoyment on this anime? It was bad and really worse tbh some animes can pull off a decent or better animation and this one might be just not of them. 
 
Case no. 6 Overall: 
 
Marchen Madchen is more like a military mishap in terms of bad anime staffing ( i already think of this as an anime version of the Battle of the Little Bighorn where Lieutenant Colonel George Custer refuses to use a newer military equipment and got killed in battle as a result. ) also most of the other staff members who work on this had worked for another anime made by Hoods Entertainment ( i'm talking about 3D Kanojo ) and this studio should act themselves together to prevent a disaster like this and make a new anime that was not a bad and dreadful as this ( P.S : If u want more info about the disastrous result of Marchen Madchen read the article that was posted in the forum page related to this anime) also this review might be late but i created this as a safety precaution that a mahou shoujo anime fan should decide: 
 
1.If u want to watch this anime i respect ur decision 
 
2.If u had dropped this anime in the 3 episode rule or halfway there then u had read this review  
 
THANKS FOR READING THIS REVIEW wether u like it or not and sorry for my bad typing here. 
 
May Peace in this site exist :)

This series is a highly emotional love story about the relationship between young Stephen Foster, who later becomes a famous composer and author of children's songs, and young Jeanie MacDowell, who becomes Stephen Foster's wife.","['Drama', 'Historical']","The story begins in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1838. Jeanie MacDowell is a cheerful and beautiful girl with light brown hair (although this could be perceived as being blonde hair). Jeanie enjoys playing the piano and loves taking piano lessons from her mother.

","(Mostly Spoiler Free minus one thing that happens at the very beginning of the show.) 
 
Kaze no Naka no Shoujo Kinpatsu no Jeanie, or Girl in the Wind: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair, in English, stars Jeanie MacDowell a young girl living happily with her parents and best friends Stephen and Bill in a small town in Pennsylvania around 1838. Considering the title it's kinda odd that she has very much so blond hair in the anime but that's a small nitpick I'll mention just for the fun of it. 
 
 
The show pretty much starts out like an Worldmasterpiece Theather show with a girl going through her day-to-day life as her father the doctor from the town helps patients together with Jeanie's mother. Tragedy however strikes not too long after when Jeanie's mother dies which changes Jeanie's life forever and drives her to discover her dreams for the future and find her own path in life. 
 
_________ 
 
 
Characters 
 
_________ 
 
 
The main three characters Jeanie, Stephen and Bill are overall strong written characters with their own will, hopes and dreams. 
 
Jeanie herself goes through quite a bit of character development throughout the series and never breaks away from her beliefs and certainly isn't afraid to open her mouth. 
 
Stephen however is a bit of a mixed bag as he tends to sometimes lean more towards his flaws than his stronger sides. Ultimately however he serves for a good love interest for Jeanie and isn't just a handsome boy for her to swoon over. 
 
Bill is the most impressive of all, considering the time this anime takes place it was very refreshing to see what they did with his character and his struggles were very believable. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Good 
 
_________ 
 
 
The anime has several strong parts throughout the 52 run episodes where it feels quite realistic and introduces problems for the characters to solve that give quite some character development. 
 
Also what I especially liked was how the show would introduce side characters in a way that made them seem like bad people but then would turn around and show in quite realistic ways that every person in the world has their own reasons for their behaviour and actions and that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone who seems to be a bad person is a bad person. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Bad 
 
_________ 
 
 
Sometime mid-way into the series an unexpected plot twist arises which honestly makes the series far worse than what it could've been. The series does however recover after awhile but then falls in the pitfall of repeating the same type of problem in a different fashion all the way up till the last few episodes making the ending feel less satisfying than it could've been. 
 
_________ 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
_________ 
 
I enjoyed Jeanie for what it was, but I think that if I had known beforehand that the show's strength went down in the second half I would've enjoyed it more for the simple fact my expectations were higher after the first stronger half. If you're looking for an old-school anime with enjoyable characters and like anime such as the Worldmasterpiece theater ones then I whole heartedly recommend you give this one a try!

so saintia shou is like none other  of the saint seiya anime series why you may ask? 
 
simple, saintia shou feels like a bad fanfiction created by a girl.any type of manly bravery is gone, reduced to atoms, instead we have beautiful men with luscious hair and in sparkling armor coming to save young ladies in trouble, from athena to shoko.  
 
most of the saint seiya entries never had amazing plot, but this one is just histerically bad, the villains never felt good , not enough development on their side and eris is just a joke, the worst she ever did in the entire series is that she made some saints fight and some already dead souls come back to life. noone died, noone got injured, nothing, absolutely nothing. 
 
The worst though is probably the saints, these ""saintias"" almost never work as ""athena's shadow"" as the story wants to believe, and they are saints they are not something else since they were a saint's cloth they don't wear a special saintia cloth,yet almost none of them wear masks, the only new character we saw that is a female and wears a mask is the peacock saint. and probably the most reasonable character in the entire series. these santias never really feel like a normal saint wood that would trade their life at any point if it meant to save athena, they are all very soft and without much reason to fight. for some reason they were stronger than silver saints although seiya and the others were getting absolutely destroyed by silver back in the original. and this anime makes you want to believe that the events happen simultaneously but there are so many issues in terms of the timeline it really makes no sense. 
 
This version of Athena is the worst it has ever been, really week, really vulnerable but dumb and trying to go alone in the place of the main enemy. enough about the characters that both lack the depth and the motivation to even be there, especially that more than 80% through the anime, it sends in a saint we have never seen on the screen before and wants to care for her, and feel like ""they have come so far to get here"" where besides 3 which we saw relatively early we really don't know anything about them, i would say we barely know anything about any of the characters. And enough about the females the males were not that great either, they do their job well enough as golden saints at being strong and stuff but almost all of them lack any of the complex and more serious nature.  
 
Now to talk about the art, this is by far the worst looking saint seiya entry, and what is really sad is that during the pauses at the middle of the episode we see the manga art of the girls, and it looks, so so so much better than the anime, Athena in the 1988 anime looked leagues better than this Athena in the anime, the special effects for stuff like the attacks are also very lazy and boring, only in episode 9 i saw just something a bit better in the punching move of the MC, but it's still worse than any of the other ryu sei ken's i ever saw. the animation overall of the anime is also pretty boring and bland, the character designs all look really weird. it feels like a 1 girl team made everything in this anime. the fact that i think at parts the 1988 anime looks better than this says a lot. 
 
probably the best thing about this anime is the mediocre soundtrack, worse than most of othe saint seiya entries from the past,but still good enough that you don't mind watching the anime with sounds on. 
 
enjoyment: the worst thing about this anime is that it doesn't even carry on the feeling of the original saint seiya in anyway, you could maybe argue that the golden saints are not that far away in terms of character, and that still mostly carries on to saga, milo and aiolia, besides 1 of the saintias none of them really care for athena and/or following her around as a shadow. i have heard that the manga is better but i review the anime a 4/10 since it lacks almost everything the original had and it is no doubt the worst entry in the saint seiya animated series.

          
 
       Helpful If you're a Saint Seiya fan I recommend watching this. Saintia Sho revolves around female saints known as Saintias. What's the difference between these female saints and the female saints that wear masks? well these Saintias are Athena's personal body guards who work in the shadows. It perfectly fits with the timeline of the original series. Its gives you a new story revolving the Saintias while giving you iconic and nostalgic scenes from the original series. Believe me, keep watching and you'll enjoy it.  
 
This is my first review because the creator of the manga needs help. The manga did not sell as much as she intended it to do and therefore the animators are working with very little and under extreme conditions to bring us new episodes. Even though this is the case they're doing an awesome job. Many people do not know this and are complaining about how fast paced each episode is. I am trying to do my part and write a review in order to increase its popularity because I truly enjoy this series. Anyway's, be sure to give it a shot.

Because seriously, how much longer is this franchise going to suffer? Hasn’t it been humiliated enough? At this point it almost seems like it has been victim of a curse, since after the utter failure of the Heaven’s Overture movie in 2004 the franchise never knew again of a new installment that had been both successful and satisfying. Acts #2 and #3 of the Hades arc were mediocre with a bullshit conclusion coming right after a fantastic and spectacular act #1, and then the show was followed by a series of bad spin-offs which mostly only contributed to sink the reputation of the original. Omega with its excessively kiddy approach didn’t do it any favor, Legend of Sanctuary movie was almost like a terrible CGI version of Seiya’s equivalent to Dragon Ball Evolution, Soul of Gold was just a bad excuse to sell more shiny and expensive action figures, and the single time they hit something right with the competent Lost Canvas, the japs just didn’t give a fuck and the prequel series was cancelled probably forever. Now, Saintia Shou is the latest attempt to put the franchise back in track but unfortunately it has turned out to be the complete opposite; it gives yet another stab wound to an already badly injured franchise and has made it hit a new low. (Ironically, I’m convinced the only way to “save it” or really redeem it is precisely making what always has had to be done; the Heaven’s Arc, precisely the continuation of the movie that started the bad-luck streak!).  
 
First of all I can’t say I’m disappointed since after so many mediocre offerings, I never had many expectations with this one and I just watched it because well, it’s another addition to the universe that bears the name of one of my all time favorite shows and I just watched it out of curiosity. It’s not like I was genuinely excited from the beginning. So instead of disappointment, what I’m really feeling after completing this is only deep lamentation and regret for the bad luck its name and reputation have had to bear… once again. I really can’t believe what I saw. This is by far the worst adaptation of Seiya I’ve seen, and judging by the awful overall score it currently has in the site, I think I’m not alone here. When I thought nothing could be more awful and insulting to the legacy and reputation of the original series after Omega and Soul of Gold, well, I was wrong, it could! So much that I don’t even know where to start from to explain, nor how. 
 
Simply put, the story is plain bad and the execution even worse. The latter is just so mind-bogglingly horrible that it almost feels like the staff wanted to troll the fan on purpose. It almost feels like an utter joke. The low budget assigned is no excuse. Many shows have been made with low budgets and their staffs have come up with creative ways to overcome that constraint in order to anyway make them at least acceptable, but this wasn’t the case. You just can almost tell like the staff just never really cared about this show and put very little effort. Heck, even with early Dragon Ball Super you could tell they were giving something more than a damn! 
 
**Some spoilers of the original series**. 
 
The story expands the original Seiya’s universe by introducing a new class of female saints known as “saintias”-who are not the same as the traditional female saints presented in the original work by Kurumada- in an attempt to create the female version of Saint Seiya featuring 5 female warriors protecting the Earth and the goddess they swear allegiance to from the threat of other gods because wouldn’t it be sooo cool to make female versions of action shounens with female heroines instead. Saintias are not saints strictly speaking; they are just maids/bodyguards serving and protecting Athena and are not forced to use masks unlike traditional female saints, which seems to be really the only difference, since “normal” female saints well, also train, serve and protect the goddess. So, why having a different, new class now? The reason is one and only one: because it obviously would have looked so weird to have a cast of main heroines all wearing a mask all the time without ever seeing her real faces! Obviously, from a commercial perspective it wouldn’t have worked at all. It’s understandable, so it can’t be an issue really.  
 
But what is an issue and what comes as inevitably annoying is how bad the story tries to fit with the events of the original, since it chose to chronologically take place within them. We are in this occasion asked to happily believe that at the same time Athena was carrying out her Galaxian Tournament (who now we are told had assumed her role before this event, not after it), she was confronting the threat of goddess Eris and that this totally didn’t interfere with the celebration of the former since it couldn’t be the case since in the original obviously this never existed and we don’t wanna establish inconsistencies, right? It now inevitably feels weird that in the original Athena had never ever mentioned anything about Eris and neither the golden saints and the Pope that were similarly aware of her existence and threat and also how the bronze saints seemed to be totally unaware of both the conflict and the saintias themselves who were also protecting Saori considering how close they were to her. It just makes things harder to believe, since the original now makes it look like all this had been something going on in secrecy when it didn’t have to be the case. It’s hard to believe now that the Pope was also concerned about Eris when in the original it looked like he was dedicating his whole time to the recovery of the Sagittarius golden cloth and her conflict with Saori from the distance. It also looks, while feasible, so convenient that Eris had been seemingly defeated right before the start of Sanctuary’s assault under the orders of the Pope only to show up again and make her comeback right after the conclusion of the same Sanctuary conflict because -obviously- it couldn’t be another way if we didn’t want to introduce more questionable circumstances. 
 
Athena vs Eris round was yet another Athena’s classic damsel in distress countdown, this time lying in between the Sanctuary and Poseidon clashes. What looked so funny is that now Athena had to face another one of these death curses, in a matter of just hours right after she had miraculously survived the previous one! It looked so silly, please, somebody give this lady some time to breathe! I know this was also the case in the Asgard to Poseidon transitions, but at least in those arcs there was more creativity regarding the type of threat Athena was facing (in Asgard she’s not really running a risk of dying, she was only slowly losing her energies) and it wasn’t THAT immediate! It comes as surprising that after 3 decades and several installments, the amount of creativity here is this low, and that they had opted for this way when the original already presented creative ways to showcase the same plot-structure. Additionally, some other elements of the conflict looked quite laughable. A floating temple under a giant tree about to collide with Athena’s Sanctuary? Memories and regrets of the dead become “alive” under the awakening of Eris thanks to how much blood was spilled in the 12 Houses’ fights? Really? Not to mention that Eris herself is a terrible, lousy enemy to begin with. While her motivations are interesting enough to consider her a decent villain, it can’t be helped that she literally looks like an evil Disney fairy-tale movie witch that doesn’t inspire a single pinch of true intimidation and authority unlike other goddesses like Artemisa or other previous female enemies like Hilda and Pandora which were portrayed in a much more respectful and serious way. Laughing maniacally with this “I am so evil and I seek destruction, muahahaha!” voice and face totally goes against the more serious nature of all the enemies of the franchise. The voice actress behind seems like she thought she was playing the evil witch role. It’s sad to see how Shou sells itself as something to take seriously, but at the same time takes these tactical decisions that are more suitable for a kids’ morning cartoon. I don’t see here the same adult tone of the original which is what I and most of the fans think when thinking about Saint Seiya. 
 
It didn’t help the fact that it also unnecessarily depicted in different ways some events in the original just because it wanted to be more faithful to the source. For example, now it turns out that Saori and Saga had already met before the conclusion of the Sanctuary arc like it was the case in the original, partially ruining the great sense of tension and suspense this decision established by making the two parts not knowing each other until the very end and fighting in blind since the start. It also turns out now that instead of the bronze and gold saints beautifully meeting, taking a bow and walking with Athena all the way up to the Pope’s house and lastly everyone involved confronting Saga in Athena’s temple, Athena this time just walks alone, meets Saga in the middle of the road, there’s no Gemini cloth abandoning and testing Saga’s will, no one-last-time Saga’s evil side trying to win while explaining what drove his actions to everybody followed by Athena’s inspiring, compassionate answer, and no Gemini cloth’s helmet crying! And the final suicide moment comes as totally uninspiring as opposed to the gripping one we saw in the original. This show doesn’t make justice to that fascinating final encounter. While Shou’s version of the events is the real manga version, honestly, I feel the first anime version pulled it off way better and improved upon the source by caring to make the moment more thrilling and memorable, actually managing to make a powerful impact. Also… no Seiya being hit by Saga while he was aiming the shield to where Athena was lying at the last minute! Like, come on! If something already worked great, what’s the need to make it work not so great!? 
 
Oh, and finally…now it also turns that Milo and Aphrodite always knew about the truth regarding Saori…and still stopped and delayed the bronze saints in their way up! Making honestly no sense. I can’t help but feeling this new story would have been a better idea had it not developed in the same universe as the original but rather in another new one. That way none of the aforementioned issues would have ever been a thing.    
 
Moving on to the execution, the series is just too god-damn short for its own good. One of the most notorious and main problems in the series is that they decided to make something that should’ve lasted at least 25 episodes in… 10. There’s just so much relevant stuff going on in such a small amount of episodes that at the end it feels like you’re watching in 3x unintentionally. The rushed feeling of storytelling is so damn high that at the end the whole series feels like it was just a very long recap of something bigger, and as a result hardly the viewer can give a damn about anything that’s going on because it utterly fails to immerse him in the story at all (especially regarding Athena vs Eris supposedly grandiose clash between the saintias and the dryads and ghosts armies that lasted the grand total of… 3.5, yes, 3.5 episodes. How could they really expect to build and develop an exciting and memorable clash in just 3.5 episodes? It’s virtually impossible to do so, and at the end the conflict is rendered as something only anecdotal, like a forgettable, short non-canon extra movie).  
 
Everything from beginning to end feels like a quick fulfillment of a checklist. Have you ever seen one of those short franchise-specials that quickly summarize an entire arc or storyline of the parent series? Like that Rurouni Kenshin Kyoto-arc that ridiculously squeezes in 1 hour a 30 episodes long story? Saintia Shou feels virtually like the exact same thing…except that this is a normal series, not a special! It totally lacks a sense of natural progression. You can really tell like if there were some missing scenes that naturally connect all the events of the story and that ultimately are the ones that actually can make the viewer care about what he’s watching. The amount of time to develop the story was so little that as a result there was no space to properly build the tension, the digestion after its release and the viewer's immersion into the world that would have made this at least minimally interesting and entertaining. Fights and conflicts also, given this, do not feel thrilling nor impactful enough (even the ones involving the popular and beloved golden saints) something the original series knew how to pull off so well. Every single event here, be it from the introduction, development and conclusion, like just…come and go! Without trying to leave a proper impact, a proper trace, and do not carry a single bit of emotional weight at all. To such an extent that even Soul of Gold looks like a masterpiece regarding this in comparison! 
 
But obviously, there was no budget for 25 episodes, so they had to do the best they could, but honestly, if the result was going to be this bad, it would have been better not to adapt anything in the first place. 
 
In addition, in Shou everything, how can I tell this?…feels so incredibly and annoyingly.. fake! In Shou everything is depicted like if it was a fucking children’s school-break game. Nothing feels remotely real. There’s no sense of realism. No sense of seriousness. Everything feels so IN YOUR FACE. No sense of watching something that at least TRIES to feel real. Many characters here behave and talk like they were actors not giving a damn about the fictional work they were realizing because they were being underpayed or not payed at all! Or because they didn’t feel it was “relevant” enough…like one of those high school festival plays nobody involved takes seriously enough. It feels that amateurish. It’s embarrassing and painful to watch to say the least. 
 
The series, again, due to the extreme rush and compression of events, also fails to make us care about and relate with all the set of new characters, including the protagonist Shouko, who essentially is the female version of the determined, kind-hearted and impulsive Seiya by mirroring -and paying homage- to his themes (separated from her sister at a young age, a mythological-horse as a guardian constellation, the same iconic technique, among others). With the exception of Shouko, virtually all of them felt like empty shells. All the rest of saintias that were not Shouko, how can I put it? were just…there. None of them is introduced properly, and given the short run there was no time to do anything remotely engaging with them, which is what was seen. Not even their cloths look distinctive enough from each other. I’ve read that the series omitted a lot of relevant content present in the source in this regard. The only one that matters here is Shouko and all the rest are almost shown like they were just the backup singers, as opposed to the original which brilliantly knew how to make relevant all of the 5 main members, even from the start. Here, we don’t get to care nor get along nor feel anything for them. Consequently, why should I care what happens to them if the show does nothing to make me care for them to begin with? Here, the all-time fan (who is honestly the only one that was going to watch this show) will only care for the characters he always knew from before, this is, the golden saints and Saori.  
 
There were also some elements that felt so out of place for a “Seiyaverse-based” installment that made me feel I was simply watching another franchise. A saintia riding a frickin’ motorbike like she was taken out from a cyberpunk movie? A vampire loli enemy that looks like taken out from a dumb fantasy show? A chinese girl acting like she was taken out from a Rumiko Takahashi comedy? And a fight against a fuckin’ giant TEDDY BEAR, among others? None of this feels appropriate in the very serious mythologically-based universe of Seiya, more so if the installment takes place in the same original timeline. In fact, it is quite annoying. A saint driving a motorbike doesn’t look “mythologically” romantic, it looks instead quite… mundane.  
 
And I haven’t even mentioned anything about the god-awful animation yet! While the show is in most of the episodes beautifully drawn, using again the beautiful artstyle by Shingo Araki in (most of) the character designs, the same can’t be said about the animation. How can we feel true excitement from battles when movements are limited to showing a character’s body just stiffly shaking in a corner of the screen in front of a sea of fast moving parallel lines and that’s it? With no sense of realism at all and looking incredibly boring to watch? We don’t even see any type of minimal scratch or body damage after any character has been hit by an attack! This is quite curious considering this was not even shown by TV! 
 
Music didn’t help either. How can I describe it? Most of the BGM here feels like taken from a kiddy Marvel comics' videogame. Really. Completely failing to set the proper serious and fascinating moods like it was the case with the original. I just couldn’t believe it when I knew that the same guy that gave us the amazing, captivating and full of personality score of Hunter x Hunter (1999) could make in this occasion a score this uninspiring, generic and forgettable. The opening wasn’t bad, but didn’t feel fitting either, since it looked like an opening from something like frickin’ Madoka Magica. 
 
Despite all of the above, I have to recognize the show still presents some points that I liked and that were nice additions to not render it a completely worthless experience from an all-time fan perspective. It was good to see for example how it is mentioned here the realistic outcome that not every boy sent to train to foreign locations to become a bronze saint got to achieve it and came back with the cloth, and that some of them developed an understandable disdain towards Saori after years of mistreatment in the foundation, as brought to light in the figure of Toki. It was good to see how Saori feels guilty about this and overall how the series explores much more in depth how does she actually feel in regard to her role as a goddess and protector of the Earth, its meaning and implications, her anxieties, and how her actions in the past have impacted the world she’s supposed to defend, making her a better developed character, something we never really got to see in the original. I also liked the explicit inclusion of the conversation among Shion, Saga and Aioros regarding the future of the Sanctuary and the new Pope. And that the golden saint that got the most screentime and participation this time had been Milo; he has always been to my eyes one of the coolest golden saints of all and it felt very welcome to see him enjoying most of the spotlight. Nonetheless, obviously all of this just isn’t enough to compensate an overall terribly executed story and show.  
 
Rushed, horribly directed, horribly animated, uninspiring, unexciting, unpassionate, unmemorable, devoid of any soul and made by a staff that looked like they just didn’t care, Saintia Sho only served to sink even more the reputation of the franchise after the streak of entries ranging from mediocre-to-terrible like the conclusion of the Hades arc in the original, Omega, Legend of Sanctuary and Soul of Gold. Watching adaptations like Shou honestly made me want to go back to the time when I wasn’t caring about anime anymore (which was a long time span), so that I didn’t have to be curious to watch entries like this one, spoiling my good memories in the process and missing the old staff of the original series who actually put love and care in their work. 2/10.

The movie was an incredible way to put certain characters at peace. It was a great way for us viewers to see what was taking place after the ending of the first season. I loved to see how the characters have developed after the happenings of the first season. As much as I loved the plot, the development and the ending of the movie, it wasn't quite worth the 10 masterpiece rating. It is hard to explain but, a lot of users didn't give it a 10 because it ended with a cliff hanger hinting the second season and fights between people weren't concluded and seemed to have been left for the second season; however, I don't rate things down when movies or anime hint for a second season at the end because I find it clever to do so because it keeps us looking forward to the next instalment.  
 
I believe I didn't give it a 10 because I felt like the movie, although putting questions to rest and developed our characters, I felt like the movie didn't have it's own unique purpose. So hard to explain but what I mean UGH. I just felt like after watching almost 2 hours of the movie I felt like the entire movie was based off of Mario seeing peach get captured and Mario had to defeat Bowser to rescue peach but although peach was rescued, Bowser got away. That kind of unfulfilling uniqueness in the plot. (the ending of the movie was great though)

Wow, just wow. The first season of K had an incredible art style but this one blew my mind. So many beautifully stunning and bright colours everywhere. Be it the colour of the enviroment, the visuals of the fight scenes, the sword of Damocles, everything was just drawn beautifully. I rewatched one of the fights like 10 times because of the visuals and the SOUND <3.

The music is outstanding. The sound effects are amazing. I love how they brought back the sound track from the first season of K as well as remixing them during certain scenes. There was a fight scene with Kuroh vs Yukari, when i heard one of the OSTs play, i knew shit was about to hit the fan.

Everything about this anime was fantastic. I wish I could give it a 10 but the story just needed that extra uniqueness. 

          
 
       Helpful Even though it came out in 2014 and the new season just started in 2015 I can tell you now that for whatever reason this movie, K: Missing Kings was meant to be watched after the 1st episode of K: Return of Kings. In the first episode we see Mikoto as the Red King, but as soon as the 2nd episode starts we are introduced to a new Red King with Anna.  
 
The events in the movie about an 1 hour and 12 minutes is roughly 2-3 episodes of ""missing"" information and story line that are crucial elements to the new season. In order to truly appreciate what is going on in K: Return of Kings, as it is only in it's 4th of 13 episodes you need to watch the first episode, the movie, then the second episode in order to follow what's going on in episodes 3 and 4.  
 
It will clear up the murkiness between the movie and the new season. If you watch it in that order. Honestly it's worth the extra effort and re-watch. I'm totally loving this anime. It's exciting, action packed, awesome fight scenes and cinematics. I'm reviewing both the movie and new season as a package deal. Because you'll totally be lost in the new season if you don't watch the movie. Thanks for reading! Enjoy the show! ^_^

          
 
       Helpful This is my second time reviewing on an anime so bare with me. I'm still getting used to this. When I had preordered the tickets for this movie I had no idea if it'd be a recap of the anime. To my surprise it wasn't! It actually continued from where the anime had left off. They did a very nice job continuing but also bringing back a few flashbacks to refresh your memory on what exactly happened in the anime.  
 
Story: 7/10  
Yes this movie was fabulous but the cliff hanger at the end. The story gave somewhat of a closure on what the anime had left off on Mikoto's death and The silver king's disappearance. However, it just left more questions, and hopefully a hint that a second season would be made. I really liked how they brought in Mikoto and Tatara in a scene, that gives you closure on their deaths. It was hard to accept they have died, and it brought me to tears, but you get to see them happy hanging together. I love how this movie introduced a new clan and had some funny jokes mixed in with the seriousness.  
 
Art: 10/10  
The art was beautiful as ever. They had kept the same art style as from the anime and more sparkly effects. It was an emotional thing for me. That it'd been awhile since the anime and here they come out with a movie with the same art style. It was beautiful and seeing it on the big screen, it's a moving experience. Especially since that was my first anime movie watching in the theater.  
 
Sound: 10/10  
K project has beautiful OSTs. I know some of the OSTs played in this movie were from the anime and it was majestic. Again, considering I saw it in theater, the sound was amazing. The audience was quiet, and it was like you were watching it in a dark room at your house. Except for me, the screen was bigger and better sound. The voice actors are original with a couple new ones.  
 
Character: 10/10  
The characters are amazing as ever. The new rival as well, Yukari Mishakuji. He is one smoking hot swordsman. He has a very distinct personality. Very nonchalant and sly type. As mentioned on his bio, he is Kuroh's former senior. Yata, Mikoto, Anna, Kuroh, Neko, Tatara, Fushimi, Seri, all of the old characters and new ones are fabulous. Though one thing I wished was that they would have made the HOMRA clan more real. The only ones they really put time into was Yata, Anna, Kusanagi, Tatara, Mikoto, and Rikio. I read K:Memory of Red and it introduces the other clansmen in HOMRA. I felt they should have made the other members more than just a clansmen who is just there apart of the team. In the manga, it shows how they all joined, they all are very lovable.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10  
Overall, I love K so much. This movie and anime. The cliffhanger sort off left me like ""That's it?!"" It had wonderful animation, beautiful background music, touching characters, and it was just great. I really suggest people to watch this movie. It will give you a huge rollercoaster ride of emotions. Plus also make you laugh.  
Thank you for reading my review, I hope I get better at these. I just was really passionate about this movie, I had to write a review. I went to see it twice.

This is the story about a one-year campaign among the candidates for the next students government leaders, who are also chosen by the lot (kujibiki), in order to gain the position.

But as someone both enjoying Genshiken and always interested in Anime trends of a time I personally wasn't around to experience, I thoroughly enjoyed this OVA and recommend it to anyone matching my description - although probably not more than once.

          
 
       Helpful These are 3 episodes of Kujibiki Unbalance which were the 1st, 21st and 25th episodes. This is the fictitious anime that the Genshiken guys were always watching, and after watching these 3 episodes, I think I liked it as much as the Genshiken guys did. These OVAs are definitely a MUST WATCH for people who liked Genshiken. 
 
The 3 episodes I watched were just like previews of the show so I'm not so sure about the story. As from what I've understood in these 3 episodes, the story is about a boy named Chihiro that got into Rikkyouin High School, his encounters with people there, a reunion with his childhood friend he promised to marry, and the Kujibiki, a school tournament, festival or tradition thing in which all the students face all kinds of battles for a whole year, be it sports, cooking, and silly competitions like enduring extreme temperature (synopsis says it's a battle for student government positions). It's a pretty fun and interesting story. 
 
The art is really good. Everything looks great and the original character designs are nice. Problem is, only the designs were nice, most of the drawings seen are unattractively non-proportional and makes the characters look bad. Still, the animation is great, the characters move well and the action scenes are impressive. 
 
The sounds are great. All the characters' voices are perfect. The soundtracks are nice and well fitted, and so are the effects. It has an attractive OP song and the ED song is good as is. 
 
All the characters are great and likable. They have all kinds of fun personalities which makes the show comedy-funny and action-cool at the same time. 
 
People would enjoy Kujibiki Unbalance as much as the Genshiken characters did. It's an anime of almost everything just like Seto no Hanayome. These 3 episodes are so good that viewers would want to check out the Kujibiki Unbalance 2006 alternate.

4,1169,62,7.910686099,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Green Legend Ran,"A story of future Earth - A warning for mankind: In the future, our planet will be transformed into a strange new world where human life struggles on an Earth without rain or oceans - only vast, parched deserts. 
 
Two youths fight for survival on our hostile planet and find hope. The sea, the sky and the land had been completely polluted by mankind when mysterious objects fall from the heavens. These titanic vessels smash into the planet and suck up the air, water, and most living creatures into their womb, stealing away the very essence of Earth`s nature. 
 
The few remaining inhabitants struggle for survival against a hostile environment and an oppressive ruling race known as the Rodo. One young, hot-blooded human named Ran, fights against the Rodo and a world in which rain is only a legend. He strives to join an Anti-Rodo group known as the Hazzard, not only to defeat the Rodo, but also to hunt down the man who killed his mother. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']","Green Legend is set in a science fiction-style post-apocalyptic Earth, which has turned largely into a vast desert after an alien invasion, in which six of the ""Rodo"" (a race of what appear to be giant monoliths) crashed onto Earth from space, somehow effecting massive climate change which has completely wiped out the oceans and rain. At the time, mankind was ruining the environment, making an apocalypse of some sort inevitable (similar to other environmentally-focused anime like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind; in general style, Green Legend is much like Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water and Future Boy Conan).
In this brutal new world, two polarized factions have arisen: the first faction, the ""Rodoists"" are a fanatical religious sect who worship the Rodo while practicing hydraulic despotism; all communities are clustered around one of the monoliths, as they are the only remaining sources of water and food - most of which is gathered quite close to the monoliths in what they call the ""Holy Green"". Travel between communities is infrequent, as at a certain distance from the monoliths, the environment peters out to the point that the air itself cannot be breathed - necessitating pressurized vehicles akin to spaceships. The second faction, the ""Hazard"", is a secretive revolutionary movement opposed to the Rodoists.
The protagonist (Ran the greener) is a young orphaned boy who seeks to survive, to join the Hazard, and to find and take revenge upon the man with a scar on his chest who killed his mother. He blunders into the middle of a battle between the Hazard and the Rodoists, during which he meets a strange silver-haired girl named Aira. Ran helps some Hazard scouts escape his town and joins them.  Soon, the Rodoist army attacks the Hazard base; Aira is forcibly evacuated against her will by the Hazard. Ran attempts to board the sand ship, but fails, and begins pursuing it across the desert in a stolen pressure suit. He is rescued by traveling water and food merchants just before his air runs out. The merchant leader, a contemplative man named Jeke, offers Ran his assistance in rescuing Aira. The rescue goes awry when the Rodoists attack the Hazard sand ship and recapture Aira as Ran and the merchants attempt to infiltrate the same sand ship.
","Green Legend Ran is an OVA from the early 90s. It was brought to us by AIC, the same studio that was responsible for Battle Athletes, Blue Gender, SoltyRei, Explorer Woman Ray & a variety of others. I don't know anything going into it besides it being science fiction. So, let's take a look and see if this one, unlike the last OVA I dug up, is worth a look.  
 
Story: 
 
In the distant future our planet has been transformed into a world of desserts after giant extra terrestrials dropped onto our planet. There are contained patches of green, but they're few and hidden away. In this world, the ruling class is made up of the Rodoists, people who worship the invading aliens and control the water supply. An opposition faction called Hazzard has also stepped up to fight against the Rodoists while most people are caught in the middle. We follow Ran, a young man who wants to join Hazzard to take revenge for his mother's death. She was killed by a man with a scar on his chest during a confrontation betwixt the Rodoists & Hazzard. He meets up with  Hazzard and befriends a girl his age named Aira. She's immediately abnormal because of her silver hair. Normally that wouldn't be strange in an anime, but in this one it's significant. What does her silver hair mean? Will Ran manage to find his mother's killer? What will happen between the factions? 
 
While there are some interesting ideas on display, the execution leaves much to be desired. The series is pretty passable at building things up but its resolutions tend to last for all of thirty seconds and be unsatisfying. Ran spends most of the OVA repeating himself and contributing very little to the events that are happening. The story arc manages to simultaneously drag and skip over important elements. We'll get long, slow periods that will contribute little or repeat information we already have and then we'll skip ahead in time and be left with the impression that something important happened between the scenes but they aren't sharing what. The environmental message in this is also really unsubtle and in your face. On a scale of Captain Planet bad to a Miyazaki film, it comes considerably closer to Captain Planet.  
 
To the OVA's credit, it does have some pretty strong moments when it manages to keep its focus. I also do kind of like the ending to the series. It does subvert the kind of ending you'd expect.  
 
Characters: 
 
There are some major problems with the characterisation in this OVA. First off, there are the villains. When a villain is supposed to be somewhat sympathetic, the series tries to hammer that in with really stilted dialogue. Which may or may not work. When a villain is just a villain, they're cartoonishly, over the top evil. Then we have Ran himself. He's a really dull character. It doesn't help that he's largely completely inept and just yammers on about the same things constantly. There's also the dynamic betwixt Aira and Ran. It comes across as completely contrived in order to move the plot. They spend maybe a day in one another's company and all of a sudden they're the best of friends and willing to completely rely on one another. I would only buy that if one of them was actually a dog. Not a dog in human form, but a literal dog of some kind.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork and animation vary. On one hand, the OVA is quite good when it comes to strange, surreal imagery. There are quite a few scenes that employ that aesthetic effectively. In contrast, their stuff with ordinary people can be pretty bad. There are a lot of awkward movements that no normal human would do without actively trying to contort themselves, a lot of awkward facial expressions that don't actually match the emotion that the character is supposed to be conveying and a lot of action sequences weakened by a combination thereof. There's also the design of their desert suits to be considered. They look like they're made of heavy material and they have completely unnecessary shoulder pads. Because when you're under a hot sun, you want heavy material with extra features that weigh you down. There's also the question of how they're supposed to function. They look a bit like diving suits. Initially, I thought they might be like proto-stillsuits where they recycle a character's lost moisture but there's never any indication that they can get moisture from them. It's almost like they didn't even consider functionality and just designed something stupid. At least it wasn't a battle bikini.  
 
Sound: 
 
The performances in this aren't bad but they aren't good either. Ultimately what we get from Kikuchi Hidehiro, Yayoi Mitsuki and the others are passable performances. The music from Yoshikawa Youichirou is decent enough. It's not as good as the soundtrack he did for Iria, certainly, but it's all right.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
Don't expect to find any here.  
 
Final Thoughts:  
 
Ultimately, Green Legend Ran is a series with a promising premise, that's held back by poor execution. The story ends up with more weak moments than strong moments. The characters are largely bland, or worse. The artwork is bad when it comes to conveying normalcy and the acting is just mediocre. It's not a bad little OVA, but in the end, my final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's weak. Next week I'll look at another OVA with AD Police. 

          
 
       Helpful Green Legend Ran is an interesting little OVA from the early 90s that's probably too ambitious for its own good. It's got ancient aliens, a post-apocalyptic earth, opposing factions consisting of religious extremists and their corresponding resistance, a revenge plot, a love story, and some kind of environmental message. Taking place in such a detailed setting with such a detailed lore, it doesn't quite know where to start and where to end.  
 
And that's a major problem for Green Legend Ran: It has lots of interesting ideas, but it doesn't spend the appropriate amount of time on each one, and in that way its two hour run time paradoxically feels both too long and too short. The narrative that's woven between all of these concepts can be a little jarring as a result, causing the motivations of some characters to come into question. Some holes are present in the plot, too. While it's not really hard to catch on eventually, it is hard to feel engaged when you're not always invested in what's going on. And, although the concepts can be interesting, they're sometimes relegated to expository dialogue instead of being explored through actions. 
 
The main characters of this OVA are Ran and Aira, and they have some pretty good chemistry together. In fact, the best scene of the series is simply a lighthearted one that features the two of them playfully getting to know each other while on an errand to fetch some resources. The animators portray their body language so fluidly and realistically here that it's just really fun to watch. But, as fun as it is, the scene's simply not long enough to convince the viewer that Ran already feels as strongly as he does for Aira. As soon as she gets snatched up by the bad guys, he's already dead set on risking his life for her, and they've only talked for what was maybe twenty minutes at best. Not only is this abrupt parting unsuccessful in providing a compelling character motivation for Ran, it also robs the rest of the series of further interactions between these two characters, which is especially disappointing. 
 
Ran himself isn't exactly the most likable character, either—at least sometimes. It's an odd situation where the show clearly tries its hardest to make you care for him...and you know, it does work to an extent, but there's just something about it that doesn't feel genuine—like they were going through a checklist of things they could mix together to make a protagonist that would earn your sympathy, when ultimately he just comes across as a nasally-voiced little shit half the time. The emotional climaxes of his arc seem kind of awkward, too, probably due to him hardly getting the chances to interact with those characters who are supposed to be so important to him. However, Ran does have some cute moments with Jeke that do manage to feel genuine despite their predictability. 
 
What probably ends up being the most fascinating aspect of this series is its atypical interpretation of environmentalism. It's almost the antithesis to the idealistic pro-earth beliefs of someone like Hayao Miyazaki; here, rather than being put on a pedestal, the forces of nature are represented by an oppressive alien god who actually feels like an exaggerated mockery of the type of person who would love nothing more than to see the earth purged of us ""rotten humans"" who do nothing but destroy it. This series proposes that wishing for such a thing would probably be going too far and that moderation is important for both sides. To be fair, though, Miyazaki's works never quite go that far either, as they usually end on the hopeful note of giving humans a second chance. However, nature is usually portrayed as the side that's deserving of the most respect in his stories, and it'll certainly never be painted as the villain. (And, if you've read certain quotes from the man, you'll know he's the type who'd probably be more in agreement with the ""screw humanity"" creed of the alien god of this story.) Regardless, it is refreshing to see an anime that tackles this subject matter from an angle that's different from what's seen most of the time. 
 
Now, if there's one thing that's clear about this OVA it's that it looks very good. It's got appealing character designs, the animation is stellar, and there's a lot of momentum that's given to every action; objects and characters have a nice physicality and weight to them. The setting of the series also really comes through in the creative shot compositions that show off the gorgeous landscapes of the desert and the rows of rusty industrial buildings. There's also a great use of lighting here, where vivid, colorful rays and other shapes frequently shine though and pop against the darker backdrops creating an atmosphere with a lot of depth. The only negative when it comes to the look of the show is the occasional use of black gradients that are thrown on top of shots which looks pretty lazy and distracting. But, other than that, the visuals provide nothing but eye candy throughout the entire series. 
 
The more I think about it, the more the story of Green Legend Ran actually feels like something better suited for a long JRPG, where all of its ideas could've had the time to shine. Some scenes even feature segments that could've easily been gameplay instead, particularly one moment where Ran has to follow directions written on notes left by another character in order to make it through a mysterious maze. That being said, the glimpse we do get of this world, however disjointed, is one that's filled with imagination. Its attitude towards the environmentalism debate is intriguing enough on its own. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I first stumbled upon this quaint little OVA at used bookstore, in a similar fashion to how I first discovered Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna… I thought the cover looked interesting and bought the VHS for a $1 on the clearance rack! The $1 was well worth the investment—Green Legend Ran changed my life, in my teens, and I still think about it quite often in my ‘20s! 
 
—Story/Characters 
 
Green Legend Ran takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has become a *barren wasteland after an alien invasion. Six of the “Rodo”—a race of giant monoliths that are revealed to be more than what they seem later in the OVA—crash through the atmosphere and, through emitting a force field of carbon dioxide in the areas where they land, causing all of the planet’s food and water to erode. The massive climate change causes the divide between the wealthy and poor to become more extreme, leading the wealthier class to monopolize the remaining reservoirs. 
*Think Fist of the North Star. 
 
The two factions are: 
a)	The ‘Rodoists’—the wealthy have taken to hoarding the remaining sources of food and water from the poor. They also fanatically worship the Rodo, despite their lack of communication with the monoliths. They refer to the areas around the monoliths as the ‘Holy Green.’ 
b)	The ‘Hazard’—a revolutionary movement that opposes the Rodoists. 
 
Travel between communities is infrequent, at a certain distance away from the monoliths, because of the carbon dioxide, the air between the impoverished and the ‘Holy Green’ can’t be breathed—necessitating *pressurized vehicles and suits. The only people that are legally authorized to use the pressurized vehicles and suits are merchants that bring the small villages food and water from the ‘Holy Green’ but it is barely enough to survive on and many of the villagers die from either starvation or dehydration. 
*The suits and vehicles are very similar to equipment used for space travel. 
 
Ran is a young, orphaned boy who seeks to survive, join the Hazard, and enact revenge on the man who murdered his mother, a muscular man with a scar on his chest. During a failed Hazard attack, he meets *Aira. During their meeting, Aira slaps him for trying to kill a wounded Rodoist and she says that he’s no different from them if he’s a murderer. After spending some time around Aira’s tranquil aura, Ran’s anger begins to wane. 
 
Suddenly, the Rodoist army attacks the Hazard base and Aira is abducted. Ran tries to board the Rodo *sand ship as it is taking off, doubly enraged at the sight of the man who killed his mother, but fails. Ran attempts to traverse the desert in a stolen pressure suit to rescue Aira from the Rodoist’s base and is rescued by traveling merchants, right before the oxygen tank in his suit runs out.  
*Think Frank Herbert’s Dune. 
 
The merchant leader, a contemplative man named Jeke, offers Ran his assistance to rescue Aira. They infiltrate the ‘Holy Green’ disguised as supply shipment, and it is revealed that Aira is not only abducted by the Rodoists to *extract water from her veins but to also as *a source of communication with the Rodo. Meanwhile, Ran catches up with Aira—after the man who killed his mother, Kiba, comes face-to-face with Jeke, who is then revealed to be Ran’s father! 
*Aira is a descendant of Rodo, born from the monolith, so she’s a plant-human hybrid. Rodoists are able to distinguish descendants of Rodo apart from normal humans because of their silver hair. In captivity, she meets Rurui, another descendent of Rodo, who talks to her telepathically before he dies from having all of the water extracted from his body. It’s not explicitly stated but it implies that they keep her alive, as a source of communication, because she’s a sexually attractive female and the previous descendent was male. 
 
Rodo manifests itself into a human form and tells Aira that the Rodo can replenish Earth’s greenery, but are waiting for the remaining humans to kill each other, so all other lifeforms of Earth won’t be destroyed by human greed. Rodo urges Aira to join the past maidens in a collective conscious to let humans be their own undoing. Aira pleads with Rodo to give humanity another chance; Rodo concedes and decides to leave the planet with the other monoliths. 
 
Jeke leaves behind an escape plan for Aira and Ran to be ejected from Rodo’s alien pods that are filled with seeds. Jeke then blows up the Rodoist’s base, killing most of them, himself, and Kiba; and the Rodo lifts up into space and it begins to *heavily rain; and the Earth begins to go back to how it used to be, before the apocalypse. The end. 
*In the first OVA, it only shown to sparsely rain. To the point where the people in the Hazard faction can barely even glean sustenance from how little it does. 
 
Before Green Legend Ran, many of the OVAs I had seen weren’t able to form a cohesive story; that’s why my mind was blown upon my first viewing! The conclusion with hopeful melody of ‘Tears and Rain’ by Ichirō Suzuki playing, while Aira and Ran glance lovingly at each other is one of the greatest endings! 
 
The characters weren’t the strongest but the duality between Ran and Aira’s demeanors, as well as the roles that they played—more than made up for it! I still believe that Green Legend Ran is a criminally underrated gem, and after revisiting it, I still believe that! If only, more people would just sporadically find something at a used bookstore and decide to check it out on a whim. I still am fairly sporadic with streaming, but there was a certain magic to staring at a physical VHS cover and eagerly anticipating whether it would be good or not!

The solid scripting is thanks to the writer, Yū Yamamoto, who also wrote Mobile Suit Gundam. Yoshiyuki Tomino often gets all the credit for creating Gundam, so much that the people under him efforts are depreciated in the process. Despite my nostalgia for Green Legend Ran, one of the reasons that I rate it so highly is because of its tight story telling! 
 
The director of Green Legend Ran, Yoshimitsu Ōhashi, doesn’t have many series that he chiefly directed: Amnesia, Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution, Bakumatsu Kikansetsu Irohanihoheto, Galaxy Angel, and Kokkoku—while many of the series aren’t above aren’t very widely acclaimed, Galaxy Angel and Kokkoku both have their own niche followings! Ōhashi also did key animation for a lot of animations that I am a fan of, like Bakuen Campus Guardress, Darkside Blues, Fushigi no Umi no Nadia, Tokyo Babylon, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust! 
 
Conclusively, Green Legend Ran is story that still tugs at my heartstrings—after more than a decade of initially watching it. My eyes still tear up when I hear the opening verse of ‘Yasashisa wa Furu Ame no Yōni’ or when I think about Aira and Ran’s scene together at the reservoir or when Aira pleads with the Rodo to forgive humanity for its mistakes; Green Legend Ran is a powerful OVA that is still near and dear to my heart! It’s an animation that will always be beautiful to me and stands the test of time! 
NOTE: Gin'iro no Kami no Agito borrowed a lot from Green Legend Ran’s story, but blundered in its execution.

Movie: Take On Me,"Although already a third-year high school student, Rikka Takanashi remains a chuunibyou—a ""disease"" that causes people to fantasize about themselves and their surroundings. Her relationship with Yuuta Togashi has also gone unchanged for the past six months, and with entrance exams right around the corner, both of them strive to enroll at the same college. However, Tooka—Rikka's elder sister—decides to take Rikka to Italy as she has found a stable job there. This unforeseen turn of events causes a commotion between the couple as neither of them want to be separated from each other. Desperate for ideas, they seek assistance from their friends, and after a brief conversation, they come up with a plan—to elope. 
 
 Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me  is a sensational drama featuring the couple—Yuuta and Rikka—as they journey across Japan. The two attempt to prevent Rikka from being taken to Italy, but will they be able to succeed in doing so? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","After the events of the series, Yūta Togashi, Rikka Takanashi and Shinka Nibutani, are about to enter their third year of high school. Their junior, Sanae Dekomori, is now the president of the student council. Rikka's sister, Tōka, tells Yūta on a call from Italy that she wanted to bring Rikka to Italy as her career stabilizes. Yūta and Rikka initially assume that it was meant only to last the whole spring break. However, they soon find out that Tōka intends to permanently bring Rikka to Italy. That night, Shinka and Sanae, along with their friend Satone Shichimiya and senior Kumin Tsuyuri, suggest that the two elope. The two agree, and they board the train the next day.
Tōka soon discovers the plan, and she confronts the remaining members. After revealing that she had secretly recorded their conversation last night, she blackmails the group. Afraid of losing reputation at school, Sanae and Shinka comply. 
Shinka and Sanae eventually find Rikka and Yūta at the Kyoto Tower, but the two manage to board a train to Kobe. Tōka later confronts Yūta at a diner. After asking questions about Rikka's chūnibyō, Tōka lets the two leave, warning that she would detain them if they happen to cross paths again.
Rikka and Yūta arrive at Wakayama, where they attempt to book a room at a love hotel. They eventually fail, and as they leave, they see Sanae and Shinka. Yūta deduces that Tōka is tracking them using Rikka's phone. They take an overnight bus to Tokyo. Unbeknownst to Rikka, Yūta buys a butterfly-shaped ring. Running low on cash, they decide to go to Hokkaido to visit Rikka's mother. However, the two do not know the contact details, so they try to retrieve it at a basement garage and Tōka cannot use Rikka's phone signal to track them. However, the phone manages to transmit a faint signal, enough to reveal their location to Tōka.
The next day, Rikka and Yūta go to Haneda Airport, where they see Shinka and Sanae. After creating a distraction for the two, they successfully board a flight to Hokkaido.
Arriving at Hokkaido, Yūta reveals his intention why he wanted to talk to Rikka's mother about her future. The couple soon found out that Rikka's mother is not home, and is instead at Aomori. Meanwhile, Rikka calls Satone back home about her ""losing powers"". The next day, Yūta discovers that Rikka abandoned him in his sleep. However, he soon learned from Rikka's mother that Rikka had already meet up with her that morning.
Meanwhile, Rikka stands by a seaside cliff, struggling over her conflicting feelings. Satone and Kumin arrive at the scene, convincing Rikka to go back to Yūta. Rikka confesses her thoughts to them, concerned that if she changes, she might lose Yūta. Sanae and Shinka also arrive at the scene, telling the group that they had informed Yūta about Rikka's whereabouts. As a sign of truce, Shinka gives them tickets for a ferry home. The couple reunite with a huge embrace.
On their ferry home, Rikka asks Yūta about her ""abandoning her powers"" and if Yūta still love her even after that. Yūta reaffirms his love for her, leading to their first kiss.
Rikka and Yūta, along with the group, all attend what is revealed to be Tōka's wedding to an Italian man and that the whole pursuit was a ruse to test Yūta's determination.
In the post-credit scene, Rikka's new apartment is now two floors above Yūta's. As Rikka climbs down on a rope to meet him, Yūta realizes that everything about her is the reason why he fell in love with her in the first place.
","Take On Me is a very satisfying conclusion to the story of Chuunibyou. As a die-hard fan of this anime, I felt a little nervous going into this film. I hoped that it wouldn't end up with a disappointing ending like season 2, which seemed to put a lot of people off the show, but I was proven very wrong. It's been 4 years since season 2 came out, and honestly I was hyped out of my mind to see Chuunibyou make a return. Ultimately the movie lived up to its hype, as it was basically everything I hoped for it to be. Though we may not ever see a third season of the show, this movie was more than enough to wrap everything up and give fans a satisfying conclusion. 
 
The story takes place only a few months after the end of season 2, and has Touka forcing Rikka to come with her to Italy. Yuuta and Rikka talk about this to their group of friends (Nibutani, Deko, Sophia, etc) and they tell them that they should try running away together so that Rikka doesn't have to go to Italy. So Rikka and Yuuta recklessly run, and when Touka gets word of this she sends Dekomori and Nibutani after them, blackmailing them to do so. And so begins a wild goose chase through Japan as Yuuta and Rikka travel from place to place, running away. At some point Yuuta decides he wants to speak with Rikka's mother, and so they take a plane to where she lives to go talk to her. Throughout the whole of this story we see Rikka and Yuuta's relationship progress ever so slowly, as it has through most of the series, and we see Nibutani and Dekomori fight and argue like they always do. It's somewhat comforting to see my favorite characters return after many years, and yes, if you are wondering, we do indeed finally get to see Rikka and Yuuta kiss. That's something that us fans have waited so long to see, and we finally get it. It's eventually revealed that all of this was a very elaborate plan by Touka to have Rikka, Yuuta and the rest of the gang come to her wedding in Italy, and to give Rikka keys to her new home, which was a surprise. We get a happy ending with closure. Closure as we see Rikka and Yuuta FINALLY kiss and become more comfortable with eachother, as well as being able to live together in peace, and closure on the rest of the characters.  
 
As for everything else, soundtrack and sound is great, the visuals are more beautiful than the show already was, seeing as it has a bigger budget because it's a movie, and the story is satisfying as we finally see our favorite characters get some closure. If there's any complaints I have, it's simply that the movie isn't long enough. Its pacing might also seem a bit too quick to some, but this is mostly to blame because it's a movie and not a whole season. I'm not sure if you can even say that's a flaw, seeing as it wrapped up everything it wanted to do perfectly in its given time. It's a bittersweet feeling after you finish watching it, you feel really happy that the movie didn't disappoint and you got some closure to the story, but then you feel kind of sad and depressed because you realise Chuunibyou is finally over. Maybe it's not though, we could always see another season, maybe another movie. But not for a long time at least.  
 
Thank you for reading this review. I'm really happy this movie was good and if you're the type of person that felt disappointed by the ending of season 2, then it's absolutely essential that you watch this film. It will make you feel a lot better and put you at ease. I love Chuunibyou, it's an anime that means a lot to me and this movie is the cherry on top of it all. Thank you, KyoAni. Thank you so much.

          
 
       Helpful A lot of good ratings for a decent at best movie. I don't have the pretence to fancy myself putting together a wanna-be deep analysis, so let's keep this short and to the point.  
 
This movie is okay. Unless your standards are pretty high or you've only got so much time to spare, this movie is pretty harmless. It's not offendedly bad, but calling it good would be a stretch. Just be sure to keep your expectations in check.  
 
Chuunibyo was never a stellar show, its second season is allegedly crap. This movie had the foundation story-wise to transcend the overpopulated realm of the barely decent that its franchise has settled in, but unfortunately, it does not deliver. It had me smirking a couple of time, but that's about it. Nothing happens in a good chunk of the movie, but that shouldn't be a problem if you like the characters. Rikka is cute when she's not utterly retarded and the duo Dekomori-Shika is fun to follow. However, the visuals are really sub-bar for Kyoani, really feels like they put minimum effort.  
 
Now if you're familiar with this show, you know how reluctant it is to develop the relationship between MC-kun and Rikka. SPOILER AHEAD. While the movie serves as some kind of conclusion, it feels more like a half-assed attempt to bring closure than a real  study of the themes of the show and the characters. It's a shame really because the movie could have tackled serious questions such as "" Should you/ Can you keep loving someone even when they stop being who they were ?"", "" How do you handle the fear of change in your life ?"", ""Can you really look after someone forever while expecting them to change and get better ?"" ... Instead, the movie has its characters kiss twice before relapsing in their chuuni cringe-fest and calling it quits. The message, if there is such a thing, is confusing. If, by any chance, I got what they were going for right, then I'm afraid it's puerile and completely out of touch with reality.  
 
Tl;dr : It's an okay movie, funny at times, decent at best. Watch it if you like the series, otherwise there's better stuff out there for you. 

          
 
       Helpful We all want to be accepted, we really do. Be it through a need to keep up with the latest trends, solacing in niche hobby communities or incessantly tuning into the various social media updates, we all find a need to connect with other people. Some more strongly than others some more clingy than others, but at the end of the day, we all want to be understood and possibly to understand. That might be perhaps the best way of summarizing the central theme of the grand finale to the anime adaptation of the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! series, which is perhaps fitting considering that the series revolves around the shenanigans of a group of delusional teenagers and in particular the romantic developments between two of them: Togashi Yuuta and Rikka Takanashi, with the former a former Chuunibyou sufferer and the latter an active Chuunibyou. So does the movie finally tie up the loose ends of previous seasons or does it stumble and fall flat on it's face? Allow me to share with you my retake on the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me movie...... 
 
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me takes off 6 months from where it's prequel (Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren) ends. Rikka and Yuuta are about to embark on their their third and final year of high school and are faced with pressures from both their associates and the situation at hand to come to a decision on the direction of their relationship. Rikka in particular is worryingly unconcerned with her future, seemingly content with the status quo and having the aim of ""entering the same university of as Yuuta"", a feat that seemingly insurmountable considering the state of her current grades (having been promoted to third year by the skin of her teeth on the basis on makeup credit) which is particularly concerning to her elder sister Tooka, who also worries about the state of Rikka's Chuunibyou. Yuuta on the other hand is content with waiting out Rikka's chuunibyou, having personally come to terms with her chuunibyou. Though he has plans for their future, he lacks the conviction or assurance to carry it out and is also waiting for Rikka to accept his advances, worried that forced intervention might disrupt Rikka's emotional development. Frustrated at the apparent lack of progress, Tooka decides that rather than simply visit Rikka should instead immigrate along with her to Italy. This triggers Yuuta and Rikka to ""elope"" under the suggestion and initial support of their friends Shichimiya, Nibutani, Kumin and Dekomori, which while temporary, buys them enough time to finally decide upon their future together. This takes the cast as well as a viewers on a journey across Japan as we witness our protagonists discover what it means to love each other as well as finally decide upon the direction of their relationship. 
 
On second viewing, the movie is a mixed bag in the presentation department. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me clings onto the KyoAni's original post K-on! Moe centric art style, which in recent years is being steadily phased out in favor of more faithfully adapting the original source material art styles (see Violet Evergarden, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon & Hibike! Euphonium). Being a huge KyoAni fan and by extension a fan of this art style, I appreciate how clean and expressive this art style allows characters to appear and is testament to how well it holds up even against more modern contemporaries. The animation is suitably fluid but is occasionally out of sync with character dialogue or overly rigid, while this is perfectly acceptable for multi episode TV adaptations it really should've been well ironed out of a 93 minute movie. Though few and far between, theses minor annoyances cumulatively tarnish an otherwise pleasing experience for the attentive eye. It is by no means bad, far from it actually; but this is Kyoto Animation and I personally hold them up to higher standards especially in the animation department. Much plaudits must be given to the remarkably detailed backgrounds, which is something I can personally attest to having recently been to some of the places featured myself. It's a clear love letter to the fans that they chose to hark back to the various local featured in previously adapted series' such as The Melancholy of Haruhi and Tamako market. It's also apparent that they have based the backgrounds on the previous designs of pasts, most notably Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi Station (having previously been there for a Haruhi pilgrimage) which along with the plethora of other backdrops are littered with incredible detail. The Opening & Ending themes ""Journey"" & ""Kokoro no Namae (こころのなまえ)"" as well as the insert ""Take on me"" by ZAQ suit the movies central themes perfectly and are wonderful to listen to outside the confines of the movie, as a mater of fact, I already have ""journey"" downloaded on my phone as of the writing of this phone. The music while pleasantly entertaining, is only functionally effective in enhancing the pivotal scenes they are included in, actually reminding me quite abit of parts of the Hibike Euhponium and Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou Osts (which were actually also done by Matsuda Akito).  
 
The show also acts a love letter to fans of KyoAni's mulitverse and besides reusing previous designs of the various real life locales, also cares to sprinkle hints and little camoes from characters featured in their previous works. Though these inclusions are mainly used as fan service to spice up the more relaxed moments of the show, I enjoyed them immensely as a huge fan of both KyoAni and their works. Perhaps what makes Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me the seemingly perfect conclusion is it's elegant balancing between serious character driven moments and more fun fan service oriented segments to deliver a decisive and emotional end to the unique Rom-com that is the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Series. While the light novels are on going, I highly doubt that the anime will receive further adaptation judging by how it ended; though I will take much delight in being proven wrong. As such, I highly recommend this movie to both fans of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and KyoAni in general as a quintessential part of KyoAni's already impressive catalogue of works, though the same cannot be said for viewers with no prior knowledge of the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! anime series as such is critical to following the plot of the movie.

When Hanabi is chosen to work with Yuuto Takao for an upcoming test, she begins to fall in love with him and they both start dating. Yui also falls in love with Kazuma Hiyama, after he protects her from a classmate who talked about Yui behind her back, and they start dating as well.
","12-Sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki 2nd Season continues off from its prequel. It is about 6th graders growing up and learning 'bout love and are trying to understand what ""adulthood"" is about. Firstly, the plot sucks. The drama has been always shit and the good moments are too short (mine is like last few episodes). 
 
Main plot consists of: 
1. Introduction and pairing partners, 
2. Dates. 
 
That's it. The others are just fillers with side characters, and almost every side-character is annoying. You can just see episodes that pair the students at the start and then skip to the last episode, and you'll see the main plot. The other episodes are a bit useless because they are used to clarify that this anime is about kids growing up and knowing about love, and it doesn't really connect with other episodes. 
 
Animation is fine, it's colorful and looks alright on most cases. Occasionally, animation quality drops and few scenes reused backgrounds from previous ones. 
 
There are also scenes that you'll really be familiar with if you watch all the episodes, and here are some examples: 
1. Running around like idiots 
2. Date in mall 
3. Heroines trying their best 
4. Boys being assholes 
5. Heroines wondering about adulthood 
6. Cringy dramatic moments 
etc. 
 
Opening song and ending song are nice to hear, but nothing stands out or memorable. The voice acting is mediocre, but lines for the side characters made it more displeasing. 
 
My enjoyment is mixed. Few episodes are actually enjoyable, but most of it are pure cringe. 
 
Overall, the cringe makes it meaningful for a bad series like this one. Is it better than the first season? Yes, of course. Do I recommend you to watch it? If you like to cringe and waste time with random animes, I'd do so.

          
 
       Helpful So lets keep in consideration that this anime is 100% for a younger audience (specifically probably 12 yr old females). I feel like a lot of people ignore this aspect when rating: So anyway 
Story 7: There wasn't really much plot development to the second season. There was some drama put in but essentially it was just showing the characters remaining as couples and growing as couples. That was basically the point of the anime so it fulfilled it's duty. 
Art: The art was consistent and fine- my only issues was the wonky eyes. The problem is the eyes are large, wide-set, and basic and the eyebrows are just lines so when the animation on the eyes isn't perfect it is very noticeable. It isn't the worst thing and is common in a lot of anime. 
Sound: Voice acting was great but they re-used the same sound effects over and over and the sound effects were just meh. 
Character: Some new characters were introduced and they added some variety to the story. There was also character growth but nothing too major. 


          
 
       Helpful The second season of 12-sai keeps things the similar to the first season. So if you expect some huge development for the couples or deep relationship drama, you most likely will be disappointed. Although at some points it actually took a more serious approach to their relationships. (fights, thoughts about the future and how long their love will last, approval by family) 
 
Those things are still handled really lightheartedly and resolved in a very short time, so mostly you'll still see the same rosey childish approach. Yes - it's childish, it's cringy, but that's exactly what this show is about. Love from the view of little children. 
 
Quality-wise I didn't notice any change, so art, animation and sound pretty much are the same as in the first season.  
There's also only one single new (relevant) character to it, which basically is the male version of Cocoa (aka makes you wanna punch him in the face), and tries to steal Aoi from Hiyama. 
 
I rated it slightly lower than the first season because I felt that it was kind of a waste to mainly focus on those stupid one-sided love rivals (like Cocoa literally never had the slightest chance) at the cost of less development for the actual couples. 
 
So if you liked the first season, this one will probably be to your liking as well.

Story: 2 
 
Boy meets girl, other boys are asses. Her classmate also likes said boy and is trying to manipulate the two of them apart when they were assigned a lesson together. Cliched as hell. The merit this story had was lost on the fact that these are 12 year olds doing stupid shit in front of their teacher, and the teacher not once intervenes. Even when the whole class is up in the middle of a presentation and blaming each other for messing up on purpose as part of some conspiracy against the boys for being jerks. It literally just portrays her as not even being in the room its ridiculous  and there is nothing here for anyone outside of kids falling in love over something meaningless.

HOLY SHIT WHAT ARE, oh those are your eyes I thought those were some flesh eating parasites clinging to your face, my bad. 
 
Shoujo art at its worst, I mean seriously I understand they are kids, but there is a freaking limit on how big eyes can get before its just stupid.

Enjoyment/Overview: 4/3 
 
This isn't the worst thing I've seen, but it could've been. It was short so sitting through it wasn't so bad, but five minutes in and I felt like it had been a half an hour already. This was a very bad attempt at making something that was short and told a legitimate story. Not much here for anyone and would never recommend unless I hated you, seriously don't waste your time. If it wanted to be good or in the very least mediocre they would have been better of going with 3 min episodes instead and have better fucking animation. THIS WAS 2014 PEOPLE SERIOUSLY. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful My scoring of this show might seem weird at first but you should be able to see why soon. this super short story is adorable in its presentation however it is so very realistic in its storytelling. The story involves a class of 12 year olds and they react and do things you would expect from 12 year olds. the main point i liked about this anime was that the relationship was one of the most realistic i have seen. as they don't understand the real meaning behind a kiss there is no faffing about with the development. as kids normally do they say they love another person quickly and there relationship develops at a quick pace usually ending quickly also. this is presented outstandingly within this show. This really is a quick review for a quick show but i loved it. 

          
 
       Helpful The first few minutes of this short may give the impression that this is another cheesy romance story aimed at the tween-age audience. The main character is excited about being “grown-up”, and yet we adults know those in the tween-age years really aren't as grown-up as they think. Something to keep in mind is that in the mind of many kids in their tween-years they are “grown-up” – meaning they're no longer little kids, but not yet adults either. This time period is a complicated time period of discovery for this age group. 
 
That is one of the charms of this particular short – it manages to capture the complicated feelings of a tween as they start the transition from being a child to being an adult. The work also covers other subjects that result from that including many of the peer issues this age group does in fact have to deal with, and it manages to do so in such a short period of time. I felt more drawn to that, then I did the actual romance aspect. The ending for the piece wrapped everything up nicely as well. 
 
The art work on the other hand isn't much to write home about. I think one of the things that stood out to me was the fact I've seen this style used in so many shows that I didn't feel it stood out. The only time it did was when the artists depicted the characters feeling bummed out, and I personally feel there is a better way to portray that feeling then the way they did. On the flip side it's not ugly art except for that point either. 
 
The sound for the music fit the piece as well and was pleasant to listen to. Again though it didn't stand out. The voice acting though had a nice blend, and worked for the characters. 
 
I felt the characterization was spot on – this is how kids in their tween-years act. In some ways it is sad as some of the behaviors are bothersome, but it also reflects the fact they are growing up. I think that this is a major pointer for the piece.  There is also the fact they don't over exaggerate the stereotypes used. Hamana Kokoa for example could easily have ended up being like Koshiro Miya from the Yumeiro Patissiere series.  
 
Ultimately I enjoyed picking up the piece despite the fact I expected it to be a typical fluff piece. The reason for this is because the characterization was accurate for the age group, nor was I forced to suspend my disbelief for this piece. There is also something heart warming about the piece as well.

Character changes have special powers too, but have more practical uses. Later on, they recruit Amu as the ""Joker"" to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of people's dreams, so the Guardians can purify their dreams. In Japanese, the egg is shortened.
Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs, in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.
Later on in the series, a fourth (yellow) egg named Diamond is born. Unlike Amu's other Guardian Characters, she is only seen a few times in the series. Due to Amu's mixed feelings before Diamond was born, she becomes an X character and is ""stolen"" by idol singer Hoshina Utau, who uses Diamond to character change for her concerts, planned by Easter as part of their plan to get the Embryo. Later on, Diamond is purified and becomes a regular Guardian Character. She would then appear in times of heavy crisis.
","-- some spoilers discussing where the anime and manga diverged -- 
 
No one has written a review after viewing all the episodes yet, so I thought I should. Despite all the fillers in the first half, it was the second quarter that ruined this series for me. They had canon, manga material to work with - and they completely butchered it, rewriting it so that the story made no sense and the characters were out of character. 
 
The story is about Amu and her love life just as much as it is about the Embryo, and it's important to the story and character development that we see that Amu is starting to fall in love with Ikuto, who loves her for who she is. The manga is a lot more obvious about this than the anime. In the manga, Amu is obviously falling further and further in love with Ikuto, and as he leaves to search for his father, she rushes to him at the airport. He kisses her and tells her 'I'll definitely make you fall in love with me - be prepared' before he boards the plane. This was obviously a very important moment, but was cut completely from the anime. 
 
The airport scene was replaced with Amu telling Tadase how much she loves him and not Ikuto, which makes no sense at all. Amu even admits to herself that she's falling in love with Ikuto, and her Shugo Charas realize it as well, so why such a butchered ending? I can't see how the third series is going to fix it, either. 
 
There were also a lot of other 'Amuto' scenes cut from this series and a lot of romance between Tadase and Amu added. From the bedroom scenes between Amu and Ikuto, where they snuggled a lot more than is shown in the anime, to Amu wrapping her arms around Ikuto, and Tadase realizing that she's in love with Ikuto as well. They were replaced with 'shout your love contests' and dates between Amu and Tadase. Amu is meant to be developing from a 'confused and lost' girl who had a crush on the popular 'prince' who only loves one side of her, to a mature character who has fallen in love with somone who really needs and understands her. The anime completely ruined this development, and Amu hasn't matured at all like she has in the manga. 
 
The music and art weren't bad, although I don't think Ikuto's songs were as sad as they were described in the manga, and I preferred the music from season one. 
 
All in all, I was very disappointed, and recommend that Ikuto fans read the manga instead in order to understand the true magnitude of Ikuto's and Amu's relationship.  
 
 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest when i saw tittle for new season Shugo Chara Doki! i was excited to see more going on between characters buuuuuut when you think omg it got exciting it somehow goes back to other minor characters and Amu just forgets about Ikuto.Filers,i don`t mind them really but after a while it gets annoying.Especially when Ikuto gets in trouble,he comes to Amu for help she chase him out because of something stupid and then she just forgots about him and goes saving others and being all lovey dovey with Tadase 0.0  Not to mention he was and always is there when she needs him. 
Overall this anime is funny and cute as much as first season and i love it 

          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara Doki!! is the continuation of the Shugo Chara!, where the main character Amu is still in the same grade as she was at the end of Shugo Chara! The guardians face new enemies, meeting old friends and creating new friends. Their main goal is still to get the embryo, with Easter trying new schemes to get the embryo first.  
 
The story has a nice flow, seeing as i haven't really read much of the manga it seems to be moving towards to current chapters out.  
 
It is a very enjoyable anime to watch overall its, if you love Shugo Chara then you should defiantly watch the sequel.  
 
I personally love Shugo Chara Doki!! and i look forward to watching it every week

","I can't believe people are so glowing in their reflections of this show. I know this is MAL and everyone here gives every show atleast a 7 and then if they enjoyed it they give it a 9, but this show has no redeeming factors.  
 
The show's biggest problem is that the characters have no personality or any likability. The characters have bland interactions that are devoid of anything you can latch on to. Some may say it's a realistic show with realistic interactions but that's not the case at all. A good show with realistic interactions with some realistic flare is Amagami which is related to this show. In that show the characters after initially not knowing each other will begin to flirt and banter and expose more of themselves to each other after some time spent together. Their walls come down and their interactions have that tension building until the eventual release. In this show none of that ever happens. The development of relationships is subpar at best. Some of the relationships just happen just so we have something to occupy us. There's no reason for these characters to like each other and their interactions are so painfully boring and shallow that you want to drop the show. 
 
In this show archetypes and tropes are downplayed which is a good start, but from that point they don't write any character or any scenario well or in an interesting manner which just makes the show bland. I am a big supporter of abolishing archetypes in favor of trying to write original characters with complexities that go beyond what we expect from typical Anime characters, but this show does it in such a forgettable way that I can't say that any character has a personality. Even worse, I can't remember any of the music from this show except the OP which is generic and boring. The character designs are all run of the mill from the medium length haired MC to the high forehead of his best friend. This show has no personality whatsoever. It's a frustrating mess from beginning to end. 

          
 
       Helpful When I first started watching this anime, i didn't know exactly what to expect from it, but as soon as i started i knew exactly what i got myself into. 
 
KimiKiss Pure Rouge was originally a dating simulation game for the PS2. Released by Enterbrain in 2006. It quickly gained popularity and become a media franchise which turned it into a light novel as well as a manga series. Then in 2007-2008 this anime adaptation was relased. 
 
 If your into the stereotypical romance, drama, school life genres, then KimiKiss Pure Rouge is a must watch. Its an anime full of love triangles, a hint of drama, & beautiful girls, all within a school setting. This series was great anime, comparable to the Amagami SS series which was later relased in 2009. 
 
Story: I decided to give the story a 7/10 because of its commonness. Its basically your typical love story, not much true story to it, just mostly romance between many main male characters and female characters. The story generally confuses you and provides a lot of love triangles and confusion. It typically keeps you guessing on who will end up with who. By the end it just kinda get a little repetitive, but overall it was okay. 
 
Art: The art in this anime was fairly well done. Cute characters, a variety of locations to see, nice scenery's, etc. Pretty good overall, nothing else to add i gave the art a 8/10 
 
Sound: Well in this anime the Opening is the same for the whole 24 episodes, it changes a little bit about halfway through i'd say around ep 13, I found it fairly appealing no complaints, it fits the story well. As for the ending themes, they were split into two separate themes which divided the anime in half, 12 eps each theme. The first ending IMO was much better done than the 2nd one and fit the ending scenes much better. The soundtrack was alright. nothing extravagant so i decided to give the soundtrack a 7/10  
 
Character: Well.... most of the characters were very much enjoyable throughout the series, only a few of them really ticked me off by the end.  
Most were very stereotypical however: you got the assertive and playful  older female Childhood friend, the two other average male childhood friends that she hung around with, a rich girl, a shy girl, a quiet guy, the tomboyl female lead, and two really annoying brats. You'll see them if you ever watch this.  
As for the character development, i found it pretty good. One second you'd think that one character had an edge over another for getting with a guy, but another second everything would change, the character pairing always keeps you guessing throughout the show. so i gave characters a 8/10 
 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed the series very much overall, spend most of my free time watching it over the span of 2 weeks and i'd even consider re-watching it, maybe in a few years. A very entertaining series that had the perfect romance story that i was looking for. For Enjoyment i gave it a 9/10 
 
Overall: All and all, I really liked this anime and i'm sure its future viewers would enjoy it as well, If your looking for a romance plot, look no further! just watch KimiKiss Pure Rouge ! :D Overall since i can't give decimal ratings i'll just type it out. I'd give KimiKiss Pure Rouge a 8.5/10  
 
Hope my review was helpful.  
 
 
 
  

          
 
       Helpful Yosha! My newest addiction: Writing reviews! =D Let's start with this one, people! 
 
Story 
Well, the ones with brains already saw that this is a romantic gerne. If you don't like romance at all then I think that this anime is nothing for you. I'm really the romance type so of course I like the story from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. So for the ones that also are into romance, you should really watch this. I give the story a 9! &lt;3 
 
Art 
Mmm.. what can I say about the art. Well, you can see that this anime is kinda new but it isn't the best art that I've seen so far for a 2007 anime. Let's be honest, there are better ones. But the colors and stuff are good and it's about the story, isn't it? Don't get me wrong now, I don't say that the art is bad, I say that it isn't the best that I've seen.  
 
Sound 
With animes from 2006/2007 you mostly just don't have something to complain. I give it a 9 as always. 
 
Character 
Yes, we coming to the good part! I JUST LOVE THE CHARACTERS! My favorite is Mao, but I like everyone from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. We have her (Mao) to start with, she moved to France and suddenly came back. She's like a big sister for the rest who seem to have a crush on Kai. She's telling everyone what to do, lol! Yuumi, the innocent who loves books and has a crush on Kouichi (he also has a crush on her!). Eriko, the genius who does very weird expiriments. Watch it yourself if you wanna find out. Let's see, Asuka the soccer-girl. Nana, the little childish sister from Kazuki and her friend Narumi. And last Kazuki and Kouichi, the male leads. I'm sure you gonna love all of them because they really have their own personality. 
 
Enjoyment 
You could really enjoy this! At least, I do! There are some very very funny moments and it's just the romance where I was looking for. Like I said already, if you don't like romance I won't think that you would really enjoy this so I won't try to watch it in the first place. But romance-lovers you're really gonna enjoy this! 
 
Overall 
Well, I have only one 7 so I'm just gonna give this anime a 9! =D All the romance-lovers, I wish you a great time watching this series!

One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.

God this is a bad OVA. I have not read the original manga, but I watched this out of some twisted sense of curiosity. By the end of the anime I could care less about the cardboard-cutout stereotype waffy-uke and emotionally-stunted seme and just wanted to smack them both.  
 
Here's a general rundown of what happens: they get together, then break up for no reason. Angst ensues. This happens OVER 9000 times in a forty-five minute period, and at some point, Izumi is so angst-ridden he COUGHS UP BLOOD. I think there is some Magical Soul-Healing Buttsecks (R) in there somewhere. 
 
Whatever. 
 
If you are desperate for your yaoi fix, read a naughty bedtime story or a doujin. This sort of anime right here is one of the reasons the genre is so hated even by gay men themselves.

(Source: Global Times)","['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Romance']","The Leader revolves around the life of German philosopher Karl Marx, focusing on his political and economic theories, his romance with Jenny von Westphalen, and his friendship with Friedrich Engels. In a press release, Marx was described as ""a great man standing upright between heaven and earth, whose ideological system established through his entire life awakened all sleeping proletariat across the world and deeply influenced the historical development of the world"". He was also characterized as ""an ordinary man of flesh and blood"", whose love for Jenny and friendship with Engels ""became legendary"".The series depicts Marx's life from his graduation from Trier High School in 1835 to his college years, where his philosophy changes from Kantianism to Hegelianism. His early affiliation with the Young Hegelians and his work on the newspaper Rheinische Zeitung are portrayed. Marx's exiles and ideological feuds with Ludwig Feuerbach, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and others are also shown. The poverty of his family is explored, and Marx's participation in the International Workingmen's Association and conflicts with Mikhail Bakunin are highlighted. The series ends with his death and the worldwide impact of his ideas.
","The Leader is a work with the ability to set any revolutionary's heart alight with pride.  It is not often that these kinds of cartoons carry with them such weight, but this is no ordinary cartoon.  It is a work designed to inspire a new generation of Marxists to carry forth the torch of Communism to a brighter tomorrow.   
 
I was deeply impressed by the characterization of Marx and his comrades.  This show is not just a picture of Marx, it is a mirror in which the audience can see themselves reflected in the actions of Marx and the revolutionaries of the past.  The Leader makes Marx more than just a face in a textbook, it makes him human.   
 
Technically, the show is lacking in many aspects.  The art is sub-par, with the transition between 2d and 3d being quite jarring at times.  The sound design also leaves much to be desired.  However, it would be improper to place as much weight on these aspects as the true meat of the story.  This show needs neither impressive visuals nor immersive sound to draw the viewer in with its powerful message of revolution.   
 
Overall, I was astounded by the degree to which this show moved me.  As a show produced under the direction of the Communist Party of China, I was suspicious that it would dilute Marx's revolutionary character, but it seems even the revisionist CPC recognizes his great contributions to the world.   
 
I understand that to one ideologically opposed to Marx, this show might be rejected on its basic premise.  However, I believe that even a reactionary can be moved by this humanization of Marx.  Too many people understand Marx only by ""Marxism.""  They understand him only by the number of deaths that are falsely attributed to him.  But to truly understand Marx the philosopher, one must understand Marx the revolutionary.

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to Karl Marx the animation: The Daddy of Communism. 
 
As a (fake) Chinese, I can tell you zero things about Karl Marx because the British education system has failed to teach me history of other places other than ‘Great’ Britain. My parents as ex-members of the communist party didn’t educate me on the topic either, if any Chinese is reading this, they are probably calling me out to be a traitor, as they have already, many times. 
 
With that said, I genuinely do not know too much about Karl Marx, nor have I read any of his work, while you might argue that I can’t possibly review this not knowing about the main character, I want to give you my two cents anyway in regard to the purpose of the anime. After all, this is suppose to educate those who do not know about him right?  
 
The premise of the show stated that the anime is made to commemorate Marx 200th anniversary with a serious tone, while most of us (in the west) is taking the piss out of it. I can’t unseen that joke someone made on tumblr calling this as Xi Jinping’s way of making communism appealing to the younger generation, as hilarious and meme like that text post was, some truth lies underneath it. One simple click on Google will tell you that the anime is in fact funded by multiple government authorities, ie. The Government’s Marxism Office. It’s definitely propaganda alright. After more clicks around the internet and watching the anime myself, I don’t really understand who the target audience is. 
 
Responses from the public: 
 
Since I never read any of his work, I can’t confirm how accurate the dialogues are. But I don’t feel like I’ve learnt much from the anime. One of the criticisms I’ve seen Chinese people commenting is that the content doesn’t appeal to a specific audience, it’s too simplistic for those who knows about Marxism, but too complicated for those who know nothing. 
 
There’re not many negative comments of the show under the episodes, the review function for the anime is blocked on the Bilibili platform where the show is streamed (I wonder why). I had to look else where for reviews. On the site Douban, out of the 1527 reviews, 50.3% are 1 star and the anime have a rating of 4/10 (as of today 07/03), if that doesn’t tell you something about how bad the show is, I don’t know what will. People don’t seem to have a problem making sarcastic comments and rating the show 1 star due to the quality of it. What’s bloody hilarious is that people are commenting on how Marx will be disappointed if he knew that Bilibili is charging people to watch the latest episodes, capitalism at its finest, yeah baby. 
 
The ONLY reason I can write this review a week early is because I have a paid membership with Bilibili and I have access to the show. I guess it sucks to be you if you can’t afford one, huh. 
 
The animation, music, writing: 
 
The first thing you will notice is that the animation is damn awful, it’s so inconsistent, it switches from 3d to 2d and back to 3d then 2d and 3d and 2d every 6 frames, it’s really annoying and harsh to the eyes, as soon as you get used to the style it changes. Episode five was just a train wreck, the faces looked funny, there was illustrations inserted that was just in a completely different art style and appeared out of place. 
 
The choice of depicting Marx and Engels as hot bishonens is also a mystery to me, I’m not saying they weren’t hot when they were young, I don’t know I can’t find any photo evidence of it (huh I wonder why), but this is what I mean when I say who is the anime for? It’s supposed to be serious toned propaganda for the communist party, yet they adopted a Japanese bishie otome game style. In episode 3, there’s also a weird ass aura between Marx and Engels, the whole show seems like a doujin to me. The ED is also one hell of a meme, the lyrics is all glory and communism with a comical rap section. 
 
It really feels like it’s very low budgeted, neither the animation or writing is great, disappointing considering the government funded this. The pacing of the story is too fast, many characters are introduced but never gets another mention, the concepts are glanced over and never discussed in depth. In episode five, Marx literally aged 20 years and they skipped over probably the most important parts of his life. Engels on the other hand has about couple minutes of screen time the entire show, considering he is equally as important as Marx, he did co-write the The Communist Manifesto for god sake, oops, sorry my bad, god doesn’t exist in communism. 
 
If the purpose of the anime were to educate, I don’t think they should chicken out on the details. Literally everything that was said in the show have gone over my head. 
 
Would I recommend this? It’s up to you and what you want out of this, watch it for a good laugh but don’t expect anything out of it, if you are even remotely interested in Marx, I presume you are intellectually enough to read some books and journal articles. 
 
Enough shit from me, I will now educate myself by reading a free copy of The Communist Manifesto. Ride on my comrades, peace and out.

This January there was some strange news from China, the airing of a Karl Marx animated series usually called Karl Marx the anime, but actually titled The Leader. There was quite a bit of fuss on news sites and social media, but oddly once episodes started floating around the net it quickly disappeared. It doesn't seem to have gained much traction even in the circles that make image reactions and jokes. 
 
I found a youtube channel that not only uploaded all seven episodes but had also fansubbed the Chinese dialogue into English and Russian. I watched the whole show, and I think I see why it didn't last. Using the channel statistics as a guide, episode one has 100,000+ views, episode 2 though plummeted to 15,000 and the drop continued with the last episode getting around 7,000. There's a lot to untangle so I'm going to break it down a bit. 
 
**Expectations** 
 
I wasn't expecting much going in, its a biopic of Karl Marx that's seven episodes long. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, but at least four of those minutes are dedicated to credit sequences and a preview of the next episode. I was expecting more of a brief timeline and introduction to his ideas and inspirations. This seems to be what they were aiming for and some episodes mostly live up to this but the rest fall quite short. 
The Look 
 
Bluntly the show is very incompetent, both in animation and story structure, it seems to have deliberately gone out of its way to show off how poorly made much of it is. There's no consistency, it switches between 3D and 2D animation styles arbitrarily, the models are extremely janky in movement and stick out from the backgrounds. They often look creepy especially when laughing. 
 
The models are also recycled heavily, Marx doesn't appear to age or change his clothes much from age 17 until the 1850's when he starts to show the beginnings of a beard. His wife Jenny is usually seen wearing her wealthy noblewoman dress and her maid is wearing a sexy formal French maids outfit. The crowds are some of the laziest I've ever seen, a good chunk of multiple episodes are dedicated to Marx giving a speech, and we get reaction shots from the audience, but what's weird is that these audiences usually stay motionless until the speech is finished, and then they applaud robotically. Most do not even emote during, and many not in the front row despite being clearly visible often do not have faces. 
 
 
This is not the worst example of lifeless crowds, this is only the first example. From the first episode, about two minutes in 
 
It looks cheap and it's very jarring. Even the show opener highlights many of the worst features of the animation. But what's really strange is that the first episode is the cheapest looking one, every other episode while not perfect is an improvement. Now animations having spikes and drops in quality is nothing unusual, budgets of both time and money can affect production, but I've never known the opening episode to be the one that's the cheapest looking. I honestly had to pause the episode multiple times to process what I was looking at, it's not just that it looks bad, it often actively confuses. 
 
I think the last episode looks the best, and it's much easier to follow, but that's mainly because aside from an epilogue it focusses mostly on Marx coming to terms with his age and ill health. The section with him and his wife Jenny was surprisingly quite emotional. 
 
 
**The Education**  
 
 
I was expecting this to be a brief introduction friendly to people who knew nothing of Karl Marx, and I think that was the intent, but it often falls short. I personally think it might be better to skip episodes 1 and 2 and start with 3, not only do the production values increase but not much is lost. Though later episodes do still have some pretty serious issues.  
 
It presents the information in small chunks, but sometimes it does so in a way that only makes sense if you were already familiar with the topic at hand. The bits on Hegel and Kant are pretty blatant examples. Episode 2 covers the deep impression Hegel made on Marx, particularly the ""Dialectic"" but it doesn't explain what that is, and both philosophers and many others that pop up in the show are reduced to some very quick summaries that rely on terms that aren't in common usage.  
 
Another time Marx is outlining his ideas on Historical Materialism, and his brief explanation is overlaid random scenes on a street in Brussels, but the connection between what he's saying and the imagery is not made clear. 
 
Episode 5 the highpoint for me, is the best at this, it takes its time explaining some of the passages from Capital, and its framing works in the episode. It also has effective use of colorful imagery, the Vampire like a capitalist relationship. Other than that its main problem is its brief run time, big and important ideas and lessons are briefly mentioned and then everything has moved on. 
 
 
**The Revisionism** 
 
 
This overlaps a lot with both education and looks, but I wanted to make this its own section for clarity sake. While focussed almost exclusively on Marx, -with one exception to be dealt with later- it does reference and introduces, often for less than a minute some of the other political radicals that Marx rubbed shoulders with. Including his criticism of them. with the exception of Ruge whose briefly mentioned before he appears everyone else Marx interacts with just turns up is introduced by a brief nameplate, cross swords with Marx and either immediately leaves to be banished forever, or like Engels sticks around to become his admirer. 
 
Episode 4 takes this to the extreme. Wietling walks into the Marx home, is briefly introduced for his accomplishments, he then talks and moves incredibly smugly, talks about Christian communism for a bit and toasts himself before Marx speaks up. Every part of this scene, the dialogue, the character movements, facial emotions, etc. Is telling the audience to dislike him, but the argument between him and Marx is so quick and surface level its mostly just angry words. The only part of the disagreement that's clear between the two if you don't already know all about their ideas is that Wietling thinks workers allying with the bourgeoisie is a mistake because they are enemies, and Marx disagrees because of his views on history.  
 
Who was right? Well, we're supposed to sympathize with Marx and Wietling literally storms out of his house never to be seen again so I guess that's a win for Marx*. The International Working Men's Association is depicted as being the soul fruit of the labor of Marx, and it largely accords with his views. The reality was that it was a diverse body full of people he couldn't stand and didn't fall under his direct control until 1872 when it promptly hemorrhaged members and collapsed. 
 
In episode 6 there is a Marx/Bakunin standoff at the Hague Congress, Marx ridicules Bakunin as a conspirator, Bakunin has no allies, and he and his group are expelled. In reality Bakunin was never at the Hague Congress, Marx's motion to expel Bakunin failed, he was later expelled for questioning the new General Council, and when he left the majority of the membership also left, either to join him or like the other non-Marx non-Bakunin aligned groups like Blanqui's supporters simply to get away from the direction Marx was driving. The narration and the final episode don't acknowledge this at all, they give the impression that Marx's decision to prevent a split of the international, by well splitting the international was roaring success.  
 
This episode (heh) demonstrates a key failing in The Leader. It's supposed to be biographical, but it won't tolerate even mild and universally accepted criticism of Marx as a political advocate or as a human being. Marx is apparently faultless when I saw they were including Helene Demuth the maid I wondered if they'd dare depict him getting her pregnant. They didn't, it'd probably get in the way of depicting his relationship with Jenny as a fairy tale romance. His well-known binge drinking is also absent, at one point he even criticizes other revolutionaries for drinking too much. His behavior with his enemies real and imagined is always depicted as noble and correct, but it can't go into detail about their opposing views and criticisms even to set up their defeat, so it all comes across as extremely shallow, which also makes Marx the character seem shallow and clueless. Marx never really convinces by the power of his argument, he just registers his dislike and the reactions of the characters do the hard work of presenting this as a victory to the audience. 
 
 
**Self Sabotage** 
 
 
Again this is tied in with all the other examples. A bizarre fault with the show is that it kept undermining what it was trying to achieve. An early scene in episode one that seems based on that famous scene from Good Will Hunting with the Bully is supposed to establish Karl Marx as a genius but it totally undermines itself. Marx does this by reciting a very simplified explanation of Kant's views on dogmatism and skepticism, which shouldn't be a problem, but this is shown to stump all the other students, and more importantly, the scene immediately before that was Karl Marx in a classroom listening to his teacher tell him this. So we're supposed to be impressed by his ability to remember basic information told to him three hours earlier. 
 
Another example in episode 3 and 4 they address the poverty of the Marx family, but each time this done while the maid and his wife are onscreen in there expensive clothing, because they were too cheap to update their models. Shortly after criticizing Wietling, Marx starts ripping into Kriege's ideas on universal love, specifically the absurd notion that capitalists and lenders can be reached by appeals to their better nature. He's saying all of this to his good friend and dependable comrade Friedrich Engels, whom the show has established is a factory manager and was moved to become a Communist because witnessing the plight of the working poor appealed to his better nature. 
 
Lest you feel I'm being a bit hard, I personally agree with the criticism of Kriege, it's just that The Leader is just giving out mixed signals in its incompetence.  
 
Last but not least, there's the case of Pierre Proudhon. Engels gives Marx a copy of his Proudhon's new book Philosophy of Poverty. While Marx is holding the book unopened, two random people start throwing out snippets of Proudhon's beliefs. At which point Marx still holding the unopened book starts ranting about Proudhon's ""Petits-bourgeois"" socialism and declares he will write a criticism called Poverty of Philosophy. It was at this point that I wasn't sure whether some of the instances of self-sabotage were deliberate or not, Marx did write Poverty of Philosophy as an attack on Proudhon, and for many years it was considered a masterpiece in Marxist criticism.  
 
Until people started reading Proudhon's book, where it was discovered that many of Marx's criticisms were incredibly inaccurate if not made up. 
 
 
**Propaganda** 
 
 
AKA, the reason this was really made. The Leader isn't really supposed to be an educational text, its made to capitalize on Karl Marx and use his legacy to legitimize the Chinese Communist Party. The CPC fully supported the creation of The Leader, particularly the Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League and the  Central Office for the Research and Construction of Marxist Theory were involved. 
 
It was made and released just before the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx's death, and the first speech Karl Marx gives on the show “Reflections of a Young Man on the Choice of a Profession” was also chosen as an extract for Xi Jinping's speech commemorating the 200th anniversary.  
 
“If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually be at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.” 
 
 
Even the titles for the episodes sound like they were taken from propaganda posters 
 
1. Different Youth 
2. Defending the Rights of the People 
3. New World View 
4. Scientific Socialism Shines Brightly 
5. Great Work Das Kapital 
6. First International 
7. Marx Forever 
 
The name of the series The Leader isn't exactly subtle. But in case you didn't get it the last part of the final episode really drives it home. The ending credits are a timeline of key events in Marx's life, except for episode seven. In that episode, the timeline is replaced with a history of Marxism-Leninism, through to the present day in the People's Republic. Complete with a narrator praising Mao Zedong, then Deng Xiaoping then the Three Represents and then finally Xi Jinping. 
 
Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese Characteristics together will bring the people forward into a new era for China  
 
 
The intention is, of course, is crystal clear, Karl Marx is the indisputable leader of Communism, and the CPC is the heir to Communism, and so it is the heir to Karl Marx. 
 
There is some attempt to justify this posture though, in an early episode Marx is absolutely indignant at the oppression of peasantry by the landlord class, and the Paris Commune is criticized for not having strong central leadership. Also, Marx did briefly talk about the importance of theory adapting it to historical conditions and reality. Which the narrator echoes at the end by claiming that Maoism through to Xi is just the Sinification of Marxism. 
 
I also think though this is speculation that the propaganda potential of the series is the explanation for its poor production values, especially in earlier episodes. The series premiered on the 28th of January, with an episode a week, meaning it ended roughly around the anniversary date. If the decision to make the series had come late, with the anniversary being the hard deadline it must reach, then that would explain why the earlier episodes are the worst with the most obvious time and cost-cutting. The later episodes which look much better would have had more time available to work on. But even in the last episodes, there are obvious signs of short cuts in some sequences. 
 
**Conclusion** 
 
 
I think The Leader is doomed to be a curiosity unless the CPC believes it was successful at propagandizing to the youth of China I can't see this experiment being repeated. Its a shame but I don't recommend it, it's not without its charms, but the combination of animation issues, shallow information, and propaganda distortions -and there were many more examples I could have listed- leave this as something best avoided.  
 
Which is a shame, as I don't believe the idea of an animated series is without merit, the Manga adaptation of Capital was largely a success, the films Young Karl Marx and the West German film about Rosa Luxemburg were very informative and interesting to watch, and historical drama is becoming increasingly common and more refined. If the CPC didn't cobble this together to meet its targets and it was allowed artistic freedom it could've been something great. For all its faults the final episode was quite good so the people doing the actual work of making the production seem to have been capable of doing good work. 
 
* Incidentally this same episode covers the revolutions of 1848, during which time many of Europe's bourgeoisie eventually allied with their despotic aristocracy to destroy the more radical workers and student revolutionaries. So it seems like Wietling was largely correct on that point but this is never addressed.

4,258,70,7.64759818,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Hitsuji no Uta,"Kazuna's family has a history of suffering from a disease that creates an uncontrollable vampire-like thirst for blood. Knowing none of this, Kazuna was sent to live with the Eda couple as a child. As the sickness begins to show signs of being present within himself, he comes into contact with his older sister, Chizuna, who has been suffering from it since early childhood. Knowing that the sickness incurs a heavy weight upon those that suffer from it, Chizuna tries to ease her brother's burden, to help him learn to control his urges, but...  
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Horror', 'Drama', 'Vampire']","The story centers on Kazuna, an ""average high school student"" who starts to lose control at the sight of blood, or even just a blood red colour (as seen in volume one when Yaegashi shows him a bottle of red paint). This problem is traced down to him being a vampire, like his lost sister, Chizuna, who he now turns to for help.
Kazuna lives with his ""aunt"" and ""uncle"" (both of whom are actually old friends of his father), after his mother died, and his father took Chizuna and left. Kazuna is friends with an aspiring artist named Yaegashi, who later learns about his condition. They both have feelings for each other at the beginning of the story.
Kazuna and Chizuna's father had committed suicide six months before the start of the (manga) story and trying to understand his suicide is one of the central plot points of the story.
","Story: 
In the space of four episodes, this story manages to deliver one major epiphany, but every episode manages to crank the tension up a notch.  The story-telling style relies heavily on flashbacks to memories, slowly mounting tension, and uncomfortable stretches of emotion-laden silence in the middle of conversations.   
 
By the end of the story, I was left wondering whether the creators hoped to do further episodes, because they certainly left a lot of potential story arcs untouched.  The themes of sickness and desire received a very interesting treatment.  But this treatment might fail to satisfy hard-core fiction critics who have a broad basis for comparison. 
 
Art: 
Except for the ever-present tears trembling in eyes, this anime is almost a slideshow.  Very often mouths are not animated when characters speak.  It's impressive that they managed to produce this story in the first place, since apparently they had no animation budget at all. 
 
Sound: 
The voice actors certainly worked hard.  The ending song is moody. 
 
Character: 
The characters were quite well-written.  The introverted, forboding personalities were like something out of Faulkner or Walker Percy.   
 
Enjoyment: 
I was initially intrigued by the first episode, but after I watched the others, I felt that the series opened up too many questions and only answered one of them.  Also, the slow pace was essential for the story -- if one tried to do the same story with normal pacing it wouldn't work -- but I was bored.  This show will appeal to viewers who like slow-paced stories. 
 
Overall: I don't recommend this as a first choice, but if you're a compulsive anime viewer, you should spend the two hours necessary to complete this OVA.  If you hate it, you can skip past the ending song to make it move faster.

          
 
       Helpful Story 
Hitsuji no Uta is an interesting anime, and if it had more time to develop it would have been really good. The anime as it stands at 4 episodes manages to tell a good story, even though it is short. What I found cool about it was that, instead of the low budget taking away from the enjoyment, it actually added to it. The repeated images and switching between black and white and color make the anime a little more stylized, rather than hindering the interest of the story. The way they show Kazuna's attacks also adds quite a bit of tension to the experience. 
 
Art 
The art style looks good most of the time, but sometimes ends up looking a bit off from the way you see it normally. This only happens in a few scenes, and it doesn't really disturb the presence of the theme. And like I said before, the low-budgetness of the anime actually stylizes it and makes it unique. 
 
Sound 
Really, there's not much here. There's about one song plus the ending theme. The one song in the anime actually fits in most of the situations, so even though there's not a large variety, it adds a familiar atmosphere when certain events are happening. 
 
Character 
The characters weren't that developed, mostly because there wasn't enough time to get to know them all. But by the end, you have a feel for the personality and ideals of most of the important characters. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall 
I enjoyed Hitsuji no Uta quite a bit, and because it's so short, the story doesn't get distorted and twisted around until it's unrecognizable. I would recommend it to anyone; I'm sure anyone could find something to like about it. Even if you don't like it a ton, you're only with it for 2 hours of your life, so you can watch it and add it to your repertoire of anime knowledge without too much effort. 

          
 
       Helpful Hitsuji no Uta is the story of two siblings who meet after being separated for a long time. The twist is that they have a genetic disease that gives them cravings for human blood. The story really focuses on Kazuna learning to live with his disease and about his family's past with some help from his sister. The story is pretty interesting and full of suspense, but it does have one major annoyance. There are a lot of Flashbacks, A lot of which show an event that happened in the same episode, less than five minutes ago. What's the point? Did Gisaburo Sugii really think that the audience would have such a terrible attention span that we won't remember the important events that happened three and a half minutes ago? The over-reliance on flashbacks also destroys the pacing pretty thoroughly.  
 
The characters are pretty well developed. There's a lot of subtle torment that motivates both Kazuna and Chizuna. The impact they have on the people who care about them is pretty pronounced as well. The only real problems are that the characterisation borders on overly-melodramatic at times and the relationship between Chizuna and Kazuna seems almost incestuous at moments.  
 
 The art is terrible. This came out in 2003, 2004 and the art is only a little better than the Ninja Gaiden OVA. Maybe they had no budget whatsoever, but when your art is only a little better than an anime with terrible art that came out more than ten years ago there's a problem. 
 
 The voice acting and music are the only truly spectacular elements to this OVA. The music is nice and atmospheric. Although the art destroys any sense of atmosphere that the music might have established. The voice acting is spectacular. It's just what I'd expect from something with such great talents as Hayashibara Megumi and Seki Tomokazu in the main roles.  
 
There is no yuri in this. The female characters hardly even interact. It gets a yuri factor of 1/10. 
 
My final rating is a 6/10. The story and characters have some faults, but it's still pretty interesting and worth watching, if you can excuse the artwork.

4,3613,71,7.628688421,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Toshokan Sensou,"Toshokan Sensou  tells the story of Kasahara Iku, the first woman to join the Library Task Force. In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people. 
 
This anime follows Iku and her fellow soldiers as they protect various special books and artifacts from the oppression of the Media Enhancement Law Commission. A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.","['Action', 'Military', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","The background of the plot is based on the Statement on Intellectual Freedom in Libraries that went into effect in Japan in 1954 (amended in 1979), and the terms are a little different from the Freedom of the Library Law that appears in Toshokan Sensō.
The simplified declaration:

It is the most important responsibility of libraries to offer collected materials and library facilities to the people who have the Right to Know as one of their fundamental human rights. In order to fulfill their mission, libraries shall recognize the following matters as their proper duties, and shall put them into practice.

Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials.
Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials.
Libraries guarantee the privacy of users.
Libraries oppose any type of censorship categorically.When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.

In Library War, the fourth chapter of the Freedom of Library Law states:

 Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials. Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials. Libraries guarantee the privacy of users. Libraries oppose any type of improper censorship categorically. When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.
The details will be amended anytime according to the Media Betterment Act and its enforcement.
The premise of Library War involves the Japanese government passing the Media Betterment Act (MBA) (メディア良化法, Media ryōkahō) as law in 1989 which allows the censorship of any media deemed to be potentially harmful to Japanese society by deploying agents in the Media Betterment Committee (メディア良化委員会, Media ryōka iinkai) (MBC) with the mandate to go after individuals and organizations that are trying to exercise the act of conducting freedom of expression activities in the media.Ep 01 However, local governments opposed to the MBA establishes armed anti-MBA defense force units to protect libraries from being raided by MBC agents under the Freedom of the Libraries Law. The conflict between MBC agents and library soldiers has continued to 2019, when the story begins. In accordance with the Japanese era calendar scheme, 1989 in Library War is rendered the first year of the fictional Seika (正化) era, rendering 2019 as Seika 31.Library War follows the life of Iku Kasahara, a new recruit in the Kantō Library Base who joined in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantō Library Defense Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship.Ep 01 After joining, however, she finds the pace to be very demanding, and that her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo seems to have it in for her and working her harder than the other recruits. On multiple occasions, Kasahara shows herself to be reckless, particularly when she puts Dojo in danger by not securing a criminal in the base's library, and later getting involved with Media Betterment Committee agents despite not being a high enough ranked official; in both instances Dojo has to help her out of trouble. Despite these imperfections, Kasahara is enlisted into the base's Library Task Force, an elite group of soldiers who go through rigorous training in order to respond during difficult operations. This is partially due to Dojo realizing that he did not give Kasahara adequate training, so he gives his recommendation that she join the task force,Ep 02 of which he is a member, in order to correct this mistake on his part. Other recommendations come from the captain of the task force, Ryusuke Genda, and second class task force library officer Mikihisa Komaki who is the same rank as Dojo. Along with Kasahara, another new recruit named Hikaru Tezuka is also enlisted into the task force who is much more capable at the position than Kasahara. Kasahara continues to try her best in the face of difficult challenges while protecting the books she has sworn to protect. As the story progresses, a romance blooms and Iku and Dojo make romantic feelings for each other evident.
","Usually my reviews are a catalog of what I didn’t like in a series but, I don’t think I can love this anime more. First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. I have no complaints to mention here. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is the lack of rewatch factor. It’s short at only 13 episodes, features a strong(?) female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being.

          
 
       Helpful 【 The following is a review of : Toshokan Sensou and Toshokan Sensou: Kakumei no Tsubasa 】 
 
Toshokan Sensou, or Library Wars, it's English name on Crunchyroll, is beautiful monotony. As many of you already know, Production I.G. is known for animating very pretty things.  
	 
	• I.G. collaborated with GAINAX for the End of Evangelion and other very successful projects. You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn't worked on much.  
	 
	• This isn't always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on character building. 
	 
	• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don't get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.  
	 
	• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I'm the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she's a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.  
	 
	• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell's 1989 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults. 
	 
	• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There's no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series. 
	 
	• I mean, c'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn't want genetically enhanced humans.  
	 
	• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don't care about the armed feud between these people and the government? 
	 
	• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I'm okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we're being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL! 
	 
	• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!  
	 
	• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn't help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?  
	 
	• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister. 
	 
	• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it's definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn't know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism. I give Library Wars a 5/10 and hope that Takayuki Hamana does better with the Lyrical Nanoha films.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is quite unique,  but not bad my any stretch.  The storyline is most likely to most unique thing about it, followed by the characters.  The art and sound are pretty typical. 
 
Story:  Something that could definitely happen in America, probably already started happening,  but on a much more technological level.  The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don't know your history,  it's bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop this 
 
Art:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,  not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across. 
 
Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say. 
 
Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn't even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh.. 
 
The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes. 
 
If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book.

I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did. The two flaws in the story line are the fact that it is repetitive and the fact that despite the fact it makes the subject some what interesting I doubt very few people are going to remember that many historical facts from the show. 
 
I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me. 
 
Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time. 
 
I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. 

          
 
       Helpful _Thermae Romae_ is very much a one-note gimmick anime, from its basic plot style to its animation-style and Lucius's hilarious reactions to everything (I'd call the series a bit like _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ or _Yakitate! Japan_), but it suits me at the moment, and the historical accuracy is sufficient to not bother me. Really, where else are you going to get any thing like this sort of historical fantasy but anime? The diversity and weird gems like TR is one of the reasons I love anime.

          
 
       Helpful The ""I-Should-Not-Be-Entertained-This-Much-the-Anime"" XD XD 
 
this is a very very niché anime and to be honest I like to watch random shit especially if it is about something that I have never watched before and short animes because then I can more easily manage to complete them in my busy everyday :) 
 
I went into this series with an ultra lowered bar, expected it to be somewhat like ""inferno cop"" or other very ultra silly animes like this... 
but I became overly pleasantly surprised and I did learn some historical and culturally facts, WHICH I DO NOT MIND :D :D :D :D  
 
so yeah... do not expect it to be a great historical and autentic anime like ""Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin"", Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, ""grave of the fireflies"", etc etc. 
And do not expect it to be great time travel animes like steins gate, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica etc etc 
 
Just learn back and just relax by an silly comedy which Thermae Romae indeed is :3

","~Let's La~ ANIME REVIEW~ 
Story: Honestly,they had a good thing going with the story. I had high hopes. Alas, I was disappointed. At first, I thought it was going to be a lighthearted, fun Precure season, but it soon became clear that it would become more depressing.  
 
Character: It was soon revealed that all the Precure had mental illnesses. It was just depressing. They also made it so that I had no attatchment to the characters whatsoever. They didn't connect with me as much as the other Cures. I really hated Cure Parfait becuase of how they introduced her and how much stronger she was than the cures. 
 
Overall: I am in love with the precure fanchaise, but this truly is disappointing.

          
 
       Helpful ""Kira Kira Pretty Cure Ala Mode"" it's the 14 season of the franchise ""Pretty cure"" also now as ""Glitter Force"" outside of Japan.... 
 
This is called the worst season of the franchise ever made by the fans and... I don't now, i still thinking than ""Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure"" it's worse, but... That means than this is good? 
 
Not really, actually it's pretty bad. 
 
Characters: 
 
They are the same archetypes that the franchise has been reusing for several years ... Now, there would be no problem with the archetypes if they were to use them well, but these characters are painfully one-dimensional. 
 
The protagonist has an excess of time on the screen and never develops a true personality ... they only tell us how it feels more than showing them, simply a generic Precure protagonist. 
 
The other girls are there simply, their only excitement is that they must accompany the protagonist ... And also the fact of some forced drama they have at some point. 
 
Cure macaron and cure chocolate are simple copies of Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus and the villains are quite generic ... in the sense that everything they do, say or plan has already been seen many times in the franchise and anime in general 
 
Story: 
 
Similar to the characters, the plot is the same formula that the franchise has reused for years ... Now, they would not have a problem with it if they executed it correctly. 
 
But the problem is that they have no interest in telling us that formula in a way that could be remotely interesting ... They just want to tell it as quickly as they can, in order to generate toys that they can sell with it. 
 
It is pretty mediocre. 
 
Animation: 
 
 
The animation is normal, the designs are pretty moe, the colors are bright and flashy and the battle scenes are well choreographed. 
 
I also want to highlight the incredible CGI that the series has, La franqucia pretty cure has the best CGI I've seen in anime. 
 
Music: 
 
the music is passable, the songs are catchy and the voice acting very regular. 
 
There is not really a musical soundtrack and the few pieces that were there were quite generic. 
 
nothing special and forgettable 
 
I think if I had been 10 years old I would have enjoyed this show more ... But I'm not a child and it made me painfully bored. 
 
but I think I would see it if I ever have children. 


          
 
       Helpful Kira Kira is one of the many seasons of Precure and I decided to write this review in order to help you decide if you want to dive in or save your time. (This is a spoiler-free review) 
 
Despite their animal appearance, this season’s theme is sweets. If you are unfamiliar with precure, the gist is that the first 10-15 episodes are typically character building and world building. The midway point is a turning point in the plot and the introduction of a new main character. The last 20-25 episodes advance the plot, round out the characters, redeem the villains, and solve the conflict. However this season falls short on many of these aspects. 
 
Characters: 
The good: The main 6 cures are the saving grace of this season. They each receive their own respective character episodes and go through challenges that lead to proper development. Previous seasons have shown favoritism however in Kira Kira they all have multiple chances to shine throughout the season. The character designs are also beautiful and very unique, especially for a precure season. 
The bad: It is extremely common for villains in magical girl anime to be redeemed. However in Kira Kira, after the villains receive their well-deserved redemption, they are cast aside. Their character is barely explored any further and their goals and aspirations are never mentioned again (particularly in reference to Julio, the first villain). Kira Kira dedicates a lot of time getting you to love these characters but instead of being a moving experience, you’re left with a lot of questions, disappointment, and a longing for more. 
 
The Plot: 
Precure starts off slow however Kira Kira feels like a painful waiting game. Episode after episode went by without any clue as to who the main villain was and what his goal was. In fact, it isn’t revealed until episode 46ish that we find out anything about the villain’s past and his goals. The evil just feels like its for the fun of it and the ending battle feels like a breeze. In fact, its so over the top that you might even have a laugh or two. Sweets that someone spends time perfecting and creating for someone they love is full of powerful and wonderful feelings called Kira Kiraru but why are the villains trying to steal this power? What is the enemy’s ultimate goal? You will be asking this for 46 episodes and even then the answer is vague, confusing and lackluster. If you are here for story, you will end episode 48 with a giant question mark. 
 
Combat:  
I really wanted to talk about the combat in this season. Past Precure seasons have shown battles almost as intense as Dragon Ball Z. The girls typically beat the snot out of the enemy after getting thrown around like rag dolls themselves. Now I don’t think violence is necessarily essential but in Kira Kira, the girls simply wave their flashy wands and wrap their enemies up with cream and almost immediately the evil is defeated. There was no growth for their powers. They started off strong, they ended equally as strong. They were perfect super heroes from episode 1 until episode 49. The evil was never even as a real threat and it just felt mediocre. They didn’t experience despair for more than 5 minutes at a time, they never had consequences or loss due to their actions. They never have to do anything other than jump around and wiggle their arm back in forth in order to triumph over the evil. Not only was the entertainment aspect not there but who cares about a hero with plot armor so thick that the victory is basically wrapped up in a bow and hand delivered to them by their enemy? 
 
Sound and Animation: 
This season was aesthetically pleasing. As far as I can recall, there are about 4 off-model episodes out of 49 which is quite good for Toei. The animation is absolutely wonderful, the character’s movements are smooth and suit their personality. Their expressions are cute, comical and emotional when need be. The music in this season is absolutely stunning. The OST (including the vocal album) is enchanting, heart-warming and actually saves some of the more mediocre scenes. When something is supposed to be emotional in the plot but it falls short, the music desperately holds it together. The opening song is catchy, the first end song is meh and the second end song is very very enjoyable. The vocal album this season also felt like a lot more time had been dedicated to it. 
 
 
Overall:  
It wasn’t a terrible experience but it wasn’t the best one. I looked forward to watching the episodes but unfortunately the ending never came to fruition. I desperately try to give Precure the benefit of the doubt since it is a children’s show but that excuse can only go so far (especially since past precure seasons have pulled off amazing plot lines with amazing characters). If you are looking for a Precure season to watch I suggest Go! Princess Precure and Heartcatch to start off. If you are someone who follows Precure, we can only hope next season delivers.

4,1965,74,7.583864363,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Sola,"Yorito Morimiya is obsessed with the sky. He especially loves taking pictures of its array of different faces—sunrises, sunsets, clouds. On one of his early-morning excursions to photograph the sunrise, Yorito meets a strange girl engaged in an argument with a vending machine. By the time that Yorito forces the girl's tomato juice out of the machine, she's vanished without a trace. 
 
 Sola  follows the story of Yorito, his sister Aono, and their childhood friends Mana and Koyori Ishizuki, as well as that of a mysterious girl who appears and disappears, and who seems to harbor a dark secret. In a world where magic and the supernatural are never far below the surface and no one is who they seem to be, love and loneliness vie for supremacy beneath Yorito's sky.  
","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Sola's story revolves around Yorito Morimiya, the main protagonist, who is a young boy attending high school. He loves taking pictures of the sky at any time of day and any time of the year. One day, Yorito decides to take a picture of the sunrise overlooking the bay, but is deterred when he meets a strange girl trying to force a vending machine that stole her money to give her what she tried to buy—a can of tomato juice. Yorito helps her with forcing the machine while attempting to strike up conversation with her, despite it being four in the morning. Yorito tells her why he is here, but by the time he has forced the can out of the machine, the girl has mysteriously vanished.
The next day, Yorito goes to visit his older sister Aono in the hospital with his friend Mana Ishizuki and Mana's little sister Koyori Ishizuki. Despite it being Aono's birthday, Yorito leaves soon after to take a photograph of the setting sun near an old church on the roof of the hospital. That night, Yorito leaves to buy groceries when it begins to rain and stops on the way home to wait for the rain to stop; while waiting, he runs into the strange girl he met from yesterday again. They talk longer this time and Yorito finally learns her name—Matsuri Shihou. A few days later, Yorito goes looking for the girl in the old church and finds a man wielding a sword before Matsuri.
After a display of Matsuri's astounding powers, Yorito discovers that she is in fact a creature known as a ""Calamity of the Night"" (夜の禍, Yoru no Wazawai), who has lived for centuries. She is being chased by Takeshi Tsujidou who intends to kill her, but Yorito tries to protect her by bringing her back to his home which is when Yorito asks her to stay with him for the time being.
A ""Calamity of the Night"", otherwise known as a Yaka (夜禍), is a supernatural being in the Sola universe. Yaka have many supernatural powers, such as: strong physical ability, fast regeneration, and never aging body, among other powers. A Yaka is hurt by direct exposure to sunlight, but the wound can be healed in time if the exposure is not excessive; a Yaka is immortal unless exposed to too much sunlight or has received fatal wounds. Matsuri explains that a Yaka is the embodiment of human agony and pain and that such creatures are meant to always be alone. Despite this, the two fall in love. As their relationship deepens, Matsuri reveals her long tragic past and her knowledge of Yorito's past.
","So I just finished Sola. And I feel that my day is still incomplete. Most awesome possum anime leave you feeling sad, depressed, happy, you know the typical emotions that you feel after watching something that left a huge impact on you. And Sola, failed to leave that impact. What it left for me, was more of a ""WTF? That's it?"" 
 
STORY: 6 
OK I'll be sincere here. It wasn't so much as a boring uninteresting story, it was a story that felt like it left out important details. Like: 
 
How did Matsuri become a Yaka in the first place?  
What are the origins or Yaka?  
What the crap is her power? Rusting objects? Why? 
And if Yaka's cannot go outside in the daytime because they will burn from UV exposure (much like vampires) why not just use Google and buy yourself a UV suit? I just Googled how much they cost and they are like $5 for kid sizes! I'm sure you can find an adult size. There, problem solved. Now you can go outside all you like without the worry of turning into a walking ball of fire. 
 
OK so enough with the obvious solutions to problems the idiots faced. The story had a nice end, but felt incomplete. You know when you have a delicious cake before you, with its beautiful taste of whatever your favorite kind of cake is but it's missing something? Yeah, it is missing those (insert your choice of topping). Or you're eating your favorite type of cookie but without any milk? (Idgaf if you are lactose intolerant. Milk is amazing with cookies) Yeah, that's pretty much what Sola did to me. It gave me an Oreo, but without any damn milk!  
 
ART: 7 
The art was decently and nicely well done. But sometimes, I look at Yorito's chin and I say ""Man what the fuck is wrong with his chin? It looks so pointy. Well at least everyone else seems somewhat nor... HOLY SHIT Matsuri not your chin too! I don't want to feel like I'm watching Cyberchase!  
 
SOUND: 7 
The typical sounds of anime. As in the sounds from the early 2000 anime. I'll reserve this section for the actors/actresses: 
 
Mana Ishizuki - VA - Honda, Youko:  
Besides her name being that of a brand for cars she perfectly fit this character. Not squeaky or annoying, she sounded exactly like a normal high schooler. Just the way it was meant to be. 
 
Yorito Morimiya - VA - Okamoto, Nobuhiko:  
Oh thank you Jesus! He doesn't sound like a faggot! He sounds like any other real good protagonist that has no powers but has the gumption to take in the truth and say ""Fuck it man, I've lived the way I wanted to of my own free will. And when I'm gone, I'll know I didn't regret smoking that weed!"" Because I know I don't. ;)  
 
Aono Morimiya - VA - Nakahara, Mai: 
Oh hey it's Nagisa! Back from the dead I see? Oh wait, you're not Nagisa. You sound nothing like her. You sound like...Kanade? Except a bit more with a chilly feeling rather than a cute huggable, squeezable feeling.    
 
Matsuri Shihou - VA - Noto, Mamiko: 
Yes. Just yes. Hecate all the way! With a little of Tifania sprinkled on top. Maybe some Kotomi in there as well. Then again don't they all sound exactly the same? Anyways if you aren't familiar with this VA you will be now. Famous for her Hecate roll in Shakugan no Shana, Kotomi in Clannad, and Tifania in The Familiar of Zero, she fits so wonderfully with Matsuri and other somewhat soft spoken characters that she practically brings them to life. Although to me she is very infamous at the same time with her roles with vertically challenged little shits. Oh don't remind me of Kouta! Please don't!  
 
CHARACTER: 7 
Damn there was a lot of character development! I jizzed myself when a twist happened with Yorito! The sister's twist was obvious but even then still. WHAT A TWIST! Actually to be honest I'm dating this review as my most apathetic review ever! Every reviewer has to have an apathetic review to be known as a true critic. So this will be my first. Which means I can't be assed to write any further. So... 
 
ENJOYMENT: 7 
I enjoyed it yet wished it was done better. 
 
OVERALL: 7  
Watch it if you are bored and want a neat little anime to watch but get an ending that makes you wish you were watching Clannad instead. Or skip it and watch something funny instead like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? to make you hurt with laughter. That upcoming review will actually be my most put in effort review ever. So it will be like 4-6hours of thought put into it. As for this one this only took me an hour and a half to write so feel free to put it down. 
As for the feedback IDGAF. I'm too lazy to continue on with the review as most people are going to say I didn't even help them anyways. So that discourages me to even make this review any better. Feel free to also leave a comment on my profile insulting me on how I wasted your time also. KTHXBAI!  
 


          
 
       Helpful I was very impressed with this show! I wasn't really into anime when it came out, so i've been catching up on alot of good shows that came out in 2007, and i was very impressed with the animation of this one! The character models are all very attractive with slender bodies/faces. I also think the characters had a lot of life and connections. This stories more or less about tragic relationships, and people that strive too be together but ultimately can't have what they want out of a relationship. My only complaint was that i wish it was longer! I recommend this to anyone this has a little bit of everything in it

          
 
       Helpful Sola is an anime that will have you wondering until the end. 
 
Watching Sola is retty relaxing for the most part but don't get fooled by the first 20 minutes, this is not a slice of life but rather a supernatural with the pacing of a romance. By pacing of a romance I mean it's kinda slow but in the end it all comes together.. or does it? This anime will sometimes tell the plot through flashbacks and have it explained later through dialogue between certain characters. 
 
Sola has some confusing story bits scattered throughout all the episode which I can't mention a single bit of the story without spoilers other than the main character likes to take pictures of the sky and visits his sister in the hospital frequently.  
 
There isn't a whole lot of characters in Sola, but because of this, the characters are easier to remember. The side characters take larger roles than expected. The side characters actually help the story move forward without even knowing what's going on. 
 
There is action in Sola but not enough to fit under the ""action"" genre. 
 
The soundtrack is really relaxing. The art is good and it has an older look but the environment looks really nice. 
 
Sola has 13 episodes and 2 specials. The 2 specials don't really add to the ending but more like extra episodes. The 1st special is somewhere in the middle of the story and the 2nd special is right before the first episode. 
 
I don't have much else to say other than ""I like it.""

Kotarou Izumi is the young heir to the noble Izumi family, so it is frowned upon when he brings an abandoned Hybrid Child he found in the garbage into their household. His family even attempts to throw away Hazuki—Kotarou's name for the Hybrid Child—multiple times when he is not paying attention. But through overcoming these obstacles, their love and the bond connecting them grow stronger. However, ten years pass before a horrifying realization dawns on them: a Hybrid Child might not have an endless life span.

In my opinion it is considered a masterpiece, I could not even wait for sub that I already have finished seeing in raw version. I read the manga in the past, but then upon hearing the news that it would become an anime I immediately had doubts, which instead have turned into satisfaction. It has really exceeded my expectations, despite already the manga was wonderful. 
 
Start by saying that I absolutely prefer it to the other of Shungiku Nakamura (""Junjou Romantica"" and ""Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi""), perhaps because it is presented in a different tone. While the first two are romantic-comedy, Hybrid Child is dramatic themes and gloomy.  
Essentially, it speaks of these dolls that with love and affection (but also negative feelings) grow to physical and mood. 
There are three different stories in this anime which correspond to episodes 1, 2 and 3-4.  
The first story revolves around Kotaro Izumi, a boy from a rich family, who finds a boy-doll (Hazuki) in the trash; despite his parents are against it, he does not give up and continues to care for him.  
The second story talk about Yuzu, another boy-doll, which is adopted by Ichi Seya. This story has an important meaning, especially because it tells us that in life things that happen isn't always happy, but also sad. 
The third story, my favorite and the most dramatic, portraies of friendship between Tsukishima and Kuroda (or maybe love?), they are two sons of chieftains important. Unfortunately the unexpected happen and Tsukishima must take responsibility for everything, but with disapproval of his friend. 
Then we can deduce that the protagonist of Hybrid Child is Kuroda, also because it appears in all three stories. 
 
Take me to the point of being moved is a difficult feat, but ""Hybrid Child"" has done it. 
The designs are very well made and the animations are quite fluid.  
Another thing that surprised me a lot, is the soundtrack: it's beautiful and it's put in the right place.  
Hybrid Child is really amazing although it only has 4 OVA.

       Helpful This anime is a masterpiece. It's original, beautiful, honest, and gut-wrenching. Please watch it. If you're into yaoi, if you're not, it doesn't matter, it deals with love in its purest form and it's wroth watching. 
 
Anime don't usually make me emotional, and I certainly didn't expect this one to. But from the beautiful music to the moving dialogue, the story moves fluidly through the episodes, separate but they all come together in the end. You won't regret watching it, so just do it.

(Source: d-rights)","['Game', 'Adventure', 'Kids']",none,"No review for this anime yet? Of course, since this anime is so old and about unpopular game. Bi-daman is the kind of kiddy game that only played by elementary student, or may be I'm wrong for these days. Putting a marble in a robotic toy and then pushing a button to shoot it out is something fool I think. However, lets tell anything else about the anime instead of the game. 
 
No doubt that some exaggeration need to be added into the anime. So many game animes need it in order to serve better trick, no, story i mean. This anime is also like that. The protagonist named Tamago (I'm sure that means fried egg) is an ordinary kid who really loves marbles. Ancient Japan folks said that a marble contained a soul. So feel the spirit by playing it. A supranatural thing so just deal with that even though i used to play it a lot when child. And thanks to certain another anti-hero named Gunma so that he was acquainted with the game. Gunma was professional bidaman player who could shoot accurately with some awesome trick. Somehow, there was a chance that made Tamago demonstrate his skill in playing bidaman. That was his first time but somewhat he could clamp the toy between his legs and with some pressure he pressed a ring like thing in the bidaman belly and then shot it out. With kamehame-like-shot he launched the marble and hit the target tremendously. Ganwa just dropped his jaw seeing it and then assumed him as rival. Then the hero and anti-hero made a team to join various tournaments. As usual game anime, many enemies with sadistic scene appeared. Even old hag with muscles joined the game, what the heck. Of course a hottie is also needed and she joined their team. 
 
For kids, one thing that can be attractive is the model of bidaman. That mini-gundam-thing has so many various models. It was so sophisticated and fooled no attracted me to keep watching all of the episodes. Many bidaman technologies appeared later and that just made the toys more look like a shooting machine.

4,7785,77,7.530825125,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei,"One autumn evening at a mysterious ramen stand behind the Shimogamo Shrine, a lonely third-year college student bumps into a man with an eggplant-shaped head who calls himself a god of matrimony. Meeting this man causes the student to reflect upon his past two years at college—two years bitterly spent trying to break up couples on campus with his only friend Ozu, a ghoulish-looking man seemingly set on making his life as miserable as possible. Resolving to make the most out of the rest of his college life, the student attempts to ask out the unsociable but kind-hearted underclassman Akashi, yet fails to follow through, prompting him to regret not living out his college life differently. As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he is hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance to live his life. 
 
Surreal, artistic, and mind-bending,  Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei  chronicles the misadventures of a young man on a journey to make friends, find love, and experience the rose-colored campus life he always dreamed of. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Psychological', 'Romance']","The Tatami Galaxy follows an unnamed third-year student at Kyoto University, using parallel universes as a plot device to explore how his life would have differed had he joined a particular student society (called a ""circle"" in Japan). The majority of the series' episodes follow the same basic structure: the protagonist joins a circle as a freshman, but is disillusioned when the activity does not lead to the idealized ""rose-colored campus life"" he dreamed of. He meets Ozu, another student, whose encouragement sets him on a mission of dubious morality. He becomes close to Akashi, a second year engineering student, and makes a promise to her, usually of and within a romantic subtext. He encounters a fortune teller, who cryptically informs him of an opportunity ""dangling"" in front of his eyes; this prompts him to remember a mochiguman keychain lost by Akashi and recovered by the protagonist, which he leaves hanging from a pull switch in his apartment and perpetually forgets to return to her. The dubious mission ends poorly for the protagonist, causing him to bemoan the state of his life and wonder how things would have differed had he joined a different circle. Time rewinds, and the subsequent episode depicts the protagonist once again as a freshman, joining a different circle.
","what a fucking masterpiece.  
 
bolstered by its utterly unique hyperstylized artstyle, tatami galaxy is a visceral and heartwrenching thinkpiece that, despite its zany and whimsical overtones and eye-melting rapidfire technicolor imagery, is GROUNDED in reality.  
 
in fact, all of that boisterous linework, rapid editing that would make anno jealous, a grandiose and whimsical score that harkens back to ghibli and even disney, and art decisions that morph into pure surrealism at points merely EMPHASIZES the heavy and real questions of this series; as someone who is in his third year of college, chasing after my own rosy-colored fantasy that i have simultaneously given up on completely, i felt like this show understood me like no other show ever has.  
 
of course, the perfection of this show goes beyond the flawless stylized art; on top of being a cathartic look into the soul-mucking reality of what it's like to be an aimless, thirsty/girl-hungry college student, the show is a goddamn great time travel story.  
 
the groundhog day premise of looping back into alternate timelines surprisingly never got old, and the writing (infamous for having machine-gun fire dialogue that flashes by with five or so paragraphs a goddamn minute) just keeps everything unexpected and fresh no matter how many days are looped, and how many timelines are explored.  
 
tatami galaxy will reach out and grab you by the neck and hurl you through its 11 episodes faster than its main character can spit out words at you. it's an auteuristic masterwork, a testament to the unique vision of masaaki yuasa, an anime that stands heads and shoulders above the rest when it comes to dealing with real life issues of love, self-doubt, and the search for meaning during the turbelent fickleness of youth.  
 
this is a perfect show, and if you're like me, someone who's drifting through college wondering where the hell it all went wrong, then it will be the perfect show for you. 

          
 
       Helpful J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film ""Submarine"". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug. 
 
The never named main character's story of university level loneliness, as it happens, is told with abnormally badly drawn characters, weird color use and bits of live action. Which might have been interesting under some circumstances, but only comes across as obnoxious combined with the vapid story carrying it all. Already from the first episode it's quite clear how Tatami Galaxy is going to end. The main character yearns for some imagined, idealized version of his university days while ignoring the attractive, very cool girl who is obviously into him, and depreciating the friends he does have. In other words, not something unhappy people can actually relate to, but an excuse for pretty much 10 episodes of the main character trying out different social environments, before he finally realizes his own stupidity. Of course, perhaps I'm wrong in taking it seriously, and all this might instead be an excuse for fun, but the humor is very repetitive. Not only because it's mostly the main character's constant, manic narration which really stops being amusing after an episode, never being particularly funny in the first place, but also because most of the silly situations and their two-dimensional characters are repeated in different ways, often leaving little room in each short episode for new things. Perhaps this is the reason it takes the main character so long to see the truth of his situation. 
 
There is a single word, I believe, which describes this anime perfectly, and sufficiently, though I'm a bit reluctant to use it because a lot of people tend to bring it up whenever something is ambitious at all. This is fairly ungood, because I love animes, or pieces of any kind of media that try to do something out of the ordinary. Tatami Galaxy on the other hand, truly is ""pretentious"". With its fancy animation, aimless literary references, crazy symbolism, purposeful yet irritating repetitions, and what have you, it certainly presumes a lot about itself, wants to be seen as different and smart, only to end the banal way it was obvious it would from the beginning, having done nothing sensible in the meantime. Tatami Galaxy is truly a case of much style and no substance.

          
 
       Helpful I don't think any other anime had the same instantaneous impact on me as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei did upon finishing the final episode. I also can't recall any other anime becoming one of my favourites so quickly.  
 
One of my absolute favourite aspects of the show is how the show is how the plot slowly unravels over the course of the show. One might say that this should be a basic storytelling requirement, but rarely is a piece of art able to accomplish this with the perfect pacing that Tatami Galaxy has. The way in which uses the plot device as a means of world-building is masterful; small, seemingly insignificant details pop-up in multiple timelines, and often transform into much bigger, considerably less insignificant details, which allows the world and the characters within it feel genuinely real. I found myself becoming more attached to these people than in any anime I've ever watched, aside from perhaps Hunter x Hunter, and the experience of realising this during the last episode made me tear up slightly. 
 
However, what's most interesting about this is how the creators were able to meticulously piece together this puzzle before the viewers eyes over the course of 11 episodes, while simultaneously moving the story along at breakneck speed. One possible flaw would be that reading the subtitles while taking in the events on screen is incredibly difficult, although I will say that my speed-reading skills improved significantly by the end. 
But this wasn't done without reason, as it accurately conveys the mentality of the protagonist, who drastically overthinks every decision he has to make; a flaw I assume most people can relate to (as the writers most likely realise).  
 
This anime's greatest achievement, though, would be the insane visuals. Never before have I seen a piece of animation with the level of visual storytelling of Tatami Galaxy. Most of the animation is used to represent the inner workings of the protagonists mind - visual metaphors are in abundance here. I don't think this show would be anywhere near as good without the the level of detail and love put into every second of the animation. I believe that for something to have god-tier animation, I should be able to understand the ideas and concepts without the sound turned on, and the show goes above and beyond this requirement. I'm sure I would be able to understand the ideas, concepts, plot and characters arcs with no sound or subtitles to guide me, simply through the genius-level direction of  Masaaki Yuata.  
 
As you can see, I have refrained from stating any of the aformentioned ideas and concepts, simply because (as someone who myself went in completely blind) I would say that part of my enjoyment of the series was discovering all of it myself as the show went on, and watching the mural unfold before my eyes without any knowledge of where it would go or which direction it would take. Never has a piece of art taught me so much about myself and many of the toxic mentality's that have held me back from enjoying the simpler joys of life, and given me the motivation to go out and do exactly that. Without a doubt, The Tatami Galaxy earns its place as one of the greatest anime of all time, and one of my own personal favourites ever. 
 
10/10.

4,15227,78,7.490733676,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni,"Suzu Urano is a pure and kindhearted girl who loves to draw. She can also be quite the airhead, owing to her ceaseless daydreaming, much to the annoyance but also the joy of those close to her. Growing up in the outskirts of Hiroshima City, Japan, she led an ordinary but happy life with her family.  
 
However, after some time, Suzu has to suddenly leave her beloved home to move into the neighboring town of Kure, due to her marriage to Shuusaku Houjou, a man she barely knows. Put to work in her husband's household, the homesick girl struggles to adjust to the unfamiliar environment, living with a family who treats her coldly. She cannot help but question: can this ever truly become her new home? 
 
 Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni  depicts the years from 1933 to the end of World War II, when peaceful everyday life gradually gives way to harsh and unforgiving conditions, as the war eventually reaches Japan's shores and Suzu's own backyard. She will have to prevail against the inevitable suffering and loss that accompanies war, all the while supporting herself and those she comes to love. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Seinen']","The story follows Suzu, an innocent young Japanese woman who is a talented illustrator who lives in Hiroshima and Kure, Japan during World War II. When Suzu was 18, she worked for a small family business when an unknown young man suddenly proposed to her. The man, Shūsaku, lived in Kure as a navy civilian, remembered seeing Suzu ten years ago, with fantastic experiences. Suzu married him, moved to Kure, and joined Shūsaku's family. However, dark clouds of the war against the US were approaching and threatening the ordinary Japanese people.
Kure, a large port city, is located within one hour by local train from Hiroshima. The port is facing Seto Inland Sea and widely known as the largest military base of Imperial Japanese Navy. As Japan was losing to the U.S., living conditions in Japan were getting worse and U.S. military forces were threatening ordinary Japanese people.
In spite of the food shortage, Suzu made efforts to get over the hard conditions during the wartime and also to prepare to mitigate the bombing damage. In 1945, U.S. air raids started and heavily attacked warships and naval facilities and the city areas in Kure. Suzu was wondering if she will return to the hometown (Eba) in Hiroshima, not yet bombed, from the house of Kure. When Suzu was still in Kure, August 6, 1945, the atomic bombing horribly destroyed countless human beings and everything in Hiroshima.
Like a lot of Japanese, Suzu could not avoid inevitable tragedy, brought by the war, and the war deprived Suzu of the precious persons, and also ""an irreplaceable part of her body"" which is her right hand, for her dominance and reliability towards it. When the war was over nine days after the atomic bombing, the family started the new lives at the time of newborn Japan. Suzu regained the motivation to get through, for her and others, with courage and affection, in one corner of the world.
","Some spoilers below, be you warned. 
 
There are several ways in which one can engage in criticism. 
 
There are objective determinations on which one can base their criticism. There are also criticisms that come from biases and presumptions that one as an individual have and want to see, presumptions and biases which others might not share. To some extent, there's overlap and ambiguity in the delineation between these two styles of criticism. In a trivial way, what is typically seen as objectively bad writing might not bother someone else out of apathy. For instance, a central drama or conflict which becomes resolved without any proper build up towards that resolving (viz., deus ex machina). In less trivial ways, individuals may share different substantive views on the moral responsibility involved with storytelling. 
 
The issues I find most arresting about this film come more from the latter than the former, but I did want to express the idea that this film had some issues on this front: a number of scenes could have been cut without any harm done to the film's narrative integrity (if there ever was any) which served no purpose; a number of scene or shot transitions were noticeably rough (the atomic bombing scene as well as the rapid transitions in the beginning portions of the film come first to mind); there's a lot of thematic inconsistency (note the art direction, the main character's childish naivete and aloofness, in contrast to some of the darker themes later on, which aren't themselves that well developed or strongly held onto); similar to the previous point, but some of the darker themes (Suzu's depression, Suzu's wish for the war to continue) are introduced and dropped real quickly without buildup, and certainly without resolution.  
 
On this last point I can imagine some who would disagree. They might argue that Suzu's wish for the war to continue comes from all that she's sacrificed. What Suzu has ""sacrificed"" for the war however isn't very clear. A lot of the labor she's performed in the film has simply been from her position as a wife in Japan in the early 20th century, much of the seriousness of her labor is further reduced by the naivete of Suzu and the lighthearted approach of the film which seems to take no interest in displaying Suzu's labor here as what would be seen today as a loss of liberty. Without having access to these grounds for Suzu's exhortations, the disagreer is forced to say that Suzu's sacrifice comes from the loss of her hand and Harumi, but Suzu's relationship with Harumi isn't well developed. In any case, the conclusion seems to be that Harumi and Suzu's hand are lost to ground Suzu's wish for continued war, which makes the point seem forced. And for what? A single scene which is completely abandoned once we've transition to the next. 
 
What was most arresting about this film however was its glossed naivete. Our main character, Suzu, is a character without much thought or intelligence behind her. This is not a character well suited for viewing the Second World War and what it meant. As I discussed in other ways before, Suzu's naivete actually collides with the narrative at certain points. For instance, Suzu's wish for the war's continuance when she has never expressed any feeling or thought about the war or what it means. This film could have used such a character's naivete to make a point, but this film didn't seem interested in that. There was no dramatic irony in the early bits of the film when Suzu is married off and is forced to labor for her new family. The film doesn't treat this as if we, the viewer, know better about what's going on than Suzu does. It instead plays it lightheartedly.  
 
The sharpest expression of this naivete, was the contrast between the character designs and the moral context of the film's very setting. It strikes me as not an accident that all the characters in the film are designed with childlike intimations. The film seems to wish for the viewer to view the characters as innocent children. This is a very troubling request given the moral dynamics of the Second World War, and Japan's role therein. 
 
This may or may not have been intentional. I'd actually have a lot more respect for the film had it not only been intentional, but had it been part of a larger message or purpose. I don't view this film harshly because of some perceived immorality to it, I view it harshly because it offers no artistic or narrative contribution to the subject of Japan in the Second World War, has seriously flawed writing, all the while contributing aimlessly to a morally problematic viewpoint with contemporary ramifications.

          
 
       Helpful This review will be bit personal one for me.  
 
There was screening of this movie on April 7th last year. I decided that i would go and see the movie, since anime movies are a expection in my country. When that day finally came i learned about a terrorist attack had occured in my town with people injured and dead. This also meant that public transportation was shutdown for fears of other attacks. After work ended i walked the long way to that little cinema with determination to not bend myself for terrorists that create chaos and live my everyday life as always. I came just in the last minute to find out that the movie would be screened.It showed that people who operated the cinema did not either bend to fear. 
 
With all this that had happened around me i felt more connected how Suzu, a japanese woman living and having hardships during the Second World War. I came to both laugh and cry when things happend for Suzu and her family and friends. The story is a linear tale of she lives her everyday life with the presence of the war coming in closer and closer.  
 
The Art is both simple in character design and beautiful of the world with some scenes really taking the breath away from you with almost living paintings in some scenes.  
 
With Sound it was great with how music was both solemn and happy apprioated for the scenes in the movie. The voice actors had all rather unique way of talking and using local dialects. The theme song made by Aoi Teshima did really stay with me after the movie ended with it´s soothing and sad tunes. 
 
Suzu and other characters felt really lifelike with their how they walked through the everyday troubles and giving humor to smaller things from working and helping around. I came to learn and appreciate how relationships between Chise and others developed, especially between Suzu and Shusaku.  
 
The overall enjoyment of this movie was rather memorable to me with giving a insight how people suffered in such dire times and still somehow continued to  live and work. I will always remember this movie for that event that happened on April 7th. But life itself will always go on as it does for Suzu.

          
 
       Helpful A ""Slice of Life"" in Kure and Hiroshima in 1940s, Involving Love, Laughter, Fantasy, Hope, and Death. 
 
The protagonist is a nonchalant (at least on the surface) and a bit dreamy ordinary girl who loves to draw and paint. She is raised in Hiroshima and marries into a family of a young man employed in the naval town of Kure,  
 
The movies goes into great detail showing the life of an ordinary family of that time. It starts as a great slice of life, of her old-style marriage with a new husband, sharing life with in-laws and communicating with neighbors. There are happy, sweet, and tender moments although the life is set in wartime, and the hardship gradually creeps into life. The relationship with the sister-in-law is a bit fictitious, but the protagonist forms a solid bond with the family and the relationship to her little niece is just beautiful.  
 
And I will stop there, as it would be a great spoiler.  
 
I will only add that air raid scenes were really terrifying, although it was not right in your face bloody. The reason why almost excessive showing of daily life was necessary becomes evident when the war becomes very personal and relate-able to the protagonist, and you are shown what war can do to people leaving emotional and physical scars. The effects of the A Bomb is not directly shown apart from a later brief horrifying scene (as the protagonist was in Kure, 30-40km away from Hiroshima), but depicted as a culmination of personal tragedies in a mass scale (if one could feel the great tormenting pain and sorrow of losing a loved one in Kure which was attacked by conventional incendiary bombings, then imagining the tragedy of hundreds of thousands lives lost in Hiroshima can evoke fear and despair without showing it right in the face). 
 
I groaned in the theater as shedding tears was not enough to control my emotions. After the film finished I was in the streets with Christmas lights and happy faces around among families and friends. The world felt very ordinary yet very fragile. I kept on half-weeping on the train heading home.   
 
This is a very well done film with a distinct art-style (it is realistic but it's a reality only achieved by animation and not a photoshop production using photographs or rotoscope), thorough research in history, and passion. I don't know if this film is the best of all war films, but I think it is one of the best animated films produced dealing with war (I can't say which is better- the Grave of Fireflies, or this). 
 
This should be seen at theaters with a wide screen and good audio.

Sure, the art is quite good, same as the story line, which is as good as it can be in just 1 episode, but seriously, if you can't stand brother-sister relationships with no limit at all, you will find this anime shocking... 
 
Also, it comes quite close to hentai, it is extremely ""detailed"".  
 
Anyway, if you're planning to watch this OVA, prepare!

          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Incest something not really considered a good thing around the entire world yet in Japan it has some kind of concentration in some anime's, but actually seeing the brother and sister fall in love and actually having sex is a little too much for me. 
 
The story is about Aki Aoi and Sora Aoi (hence the name) who are both brother and sister, they have a close relationship and suddenly start developing romantic feelings for each other. 
That is pretty much the gist of the story basically it shows Sora's feelings for Aki increase and even though he tries to hide it and not accept it at first he eventually gives in just like his sister and they have sex which just felt really awkward and uncomfortable to watch, that is literally the story right there nothing more to say really. 
 
Since the show mainly concentrates on Aki and Sora the only development you get out of these people is the slow increase of their romantic feelings for each other although you do kinda see what characters their like. 
Sora despite looking like a woman is in fact a guy and surprisingly is the more mature of the family as he usually does the house chores and cooking, but he can seem like a weak person since he isn't very good at talking to girls other than his sisters. 
Aki on the other hand looks like an angel, but isn't very useful when it comes to housework, she even fails when it comes to cleaning her room yet she is very flirtatious around Sora and pretty much flirts with him to the point where he just gives to her. 
 
The artstyle lets say is very revealing much like your usual Ecchi and there really isn't much to say about it other than that. 
 
Pretty much the fanservice is off the charts and it even seems like a softcore hentai since there is a sex scene just without showing the private parts that would consider it a hentai, but everything else was there nude bodies, breasts and moaning hell there was even sound effects for the orgasms. 
 
Now when it comes to the Romance I'm really full on against Incest as long as the brother and sister are on the same page, but seeing them having sex with each other is just weird, uncomfortable and awkward this was probably one of the cringest things I have seen. 
 
Overall this is just something for people who could have their happy time considering how graphic it is, but honestly I would just stay away from this as much as you can before you scar yourself.

          
 
       Helpful Alright guys so this review will probably be the best and most accurate one! Basically its about a boy and his 2 sisters and one of the sisters love him (Incest). If you dont mind incest and LOVE ecchi as much as I do, then this 1 episode OVA is definitely worth watching! Its basically Hentai but it doesn't show private parts. But the scenes were enjoyable! Like I said, you cant go wrong with one episode lol. THIS IS NOT REALLY A SPOILER JUST FLASH BACK THAT HAPPENS IN THE 1ST MINUTE OF THIS ANIME (AHEAD). When they were kids they use to take showers together. But now its different but she still loves him the same way.

One day he's zapped into the world of Monster Rancher and meets the girl Holly and the monsters Mochi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger and Hare. 
 
Continuing from where the original story left off, Genki and friends journey to conquer the legend cup in hopes of freeing Holly's father from the mystery disc. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","The story follows a boy named Genki Sakura, who is a key player of the Monster Rancher video games. After winning a tournament hosted by the game's creators, Genki wins a special CD that he can use to unlock a special monster in his game at home. However, upon using this disk in his game console, he finds himself transported to a world of monsters that, much like Genki's game, are given life by scanning special stone disks within temples. There, he meets a girl named Holly and her monster friend Suezo, who are seeking a stone disk containing a legendary Phoenix that will save the land from the tyranny of an evil ruler named Moo. Upon attempting to use the disk Genki had won to try and release the monster, they bring forth a different monster, which Genki names Mocchi. Wanting to free the land from Moo's rule, Genki, Holly, Mocchi, and Suezo set off to find the Phoenix, using Holly's Magic Stone to guide them in the direction of the Phoenix. The Magic Stone leads them to Golem, Tiger, and Hare, each of which have their motivations to join the group on their journey to find the Phoenix. 
It is revealed that Moo is actually Holly's missing father, who merged with an evil spirit after being banished from his village. Determined to separate Moo's evil spirit from Holly's father, the group continues their search for the Phoenix, defeating Moo's strongest minions, the Big Bad Four- Pixie, Gali, Grey Wolf, and Naga. In their travels, the gang befriends and aids many monsters as they continue searching, unlocking as many Mystery Disks as possible in the hopes of finding the Phoenix. One of these unlocked monsters, Monol, tells the group of a previous war between Moo and the Phoenix (as part of a larger war between humans and monsters, who exploited monsters as workers and companions in a futuristic society) that destroyed much of the world and weakened the two entities into their dormant states, separating their body and souls.
In the end of the first season, Moo's body is found and merges with Holly's father. Shortly after, the Phoenix's body is found, and it is revealed that the five monsters – Mocchi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger, and Hare – are pieces of the Phoenix's soul. Understanding what must be done, they say goodbye to Genki and merge with the Phoenix's body, and begin to fight Moo. As the two beings fight, Moo realizes that good and evil are inherently inseparable, and that the two are doomed to repeat a perpetually repeating fight as representatives of the two forces. The two monsters seemingly die, and Genki is knocked back into the real world in the resulting explosion, comforted by visions of his friends as he goes home. 
The second season consists of Genki returning to the Monster World to revive and reunite his friends, who were turned into disks and separated after the fight with Moo. The gang must compete in a series of tournaments against General Durahan's army in their pursuit to find Holly's father. The third season ends with Genki and the others battling the soul of Moo that has possessed Durahan; during the credits of the final episode it is revealed in the Japanese version that both Genki and Mocchi are able to travel between both the Monster Rancher world and Earth.
","This is so a rip off of Digimon! I remember when I was younger, I liked it but seriously… now that I have watched so many anime shows and found out just how badly ripped off the other shows are, I feel a little like crying. Now please don’t take this the wrong way, it is a good show to a point but it takes so long to get to where it’s getting good that most people would probably conk out of it. It’s good for what it is, a children’s show, nothing more and nothing less.  
 
We start out with the main character, Genki who is pretty much Ash Ketchum in school. He is overactive, over annoying, and most of all, over stereotypical of these types of shows. He gets sucked into the video game (like Digimon) and has to help collect monster discs (like Pokemon) to unlock the power that is inside (like Yugioh). He fights monsters (like all three) and makes friends with the monsters he meets (like Digimon and Pokemon). They end up getting lost on their travels (Like Pokemon), sometimes wondering aimlessly around the world (like Digimon) and… WHAT THE FUCK? Did the creators have no imagination for this series or is this plot so generic that we can’t make a decent show like this without ripping off another? 
 
The storyline of Alan, in the episode ‘Eternal Worm’ (Ep 4), was actually rather sweet at the end and made me feel something briefly for the show. It was one of the most intense sad scenes in this show. Another character that I actually really like and feel emotion to is the wolf-like tiger called ‘Tiger of the Wind’. I guess I’m just a sucker for anything like a wolf. He seems very spiritual and has wonderful philosophy. His story line is sad and yet seems the most logical of the group. 
 
When Genki does end up making his own character, all he seems to make is something that looks like a pink little thing and actually called itself Mochi when it first appeared, becomes called Sweet Cake by him in the first episode. Then after, they call him Mochi like they should have done in the first place!  
 
So… is the bad guy a cow or something? Because calling the bad guy Moo really doesn’t make him sound any scarier then the little pink squash ball Mochi. Seriously, are we supposed to get milk from this thing? And if so, then I want none of that milk!  
 
So, I’m sort of going to spoil something for you since this is two seasons lumped together (Because Fox kids is a dick like that), Genki does get back home (Shocker… really? *Sarcastic*) and they use the same stupid little storyline as Digimon where only a couple hours passed when he was in the Monster world for months to about years. But it comes at the end of the first season. So my question is, why did they decide to have a second season where he goes back? They could have left it wonderfully when Genki got back and gave us that heart felt ending to the whole series. Something tells me that they just used it to sell more items and that’s exactly what it feels like. And that’s not the only problem because this one ends with a big hole in the plot. It doesn’t let it end like the first season. 
 
The artwork is alright, pretty standard for the time period it came out in. Some of the monsters feel like they were stolen from other anime series. Faces don’t seem to keep their shape, sometimes showing big cheeks once in a while and then no cheeks at all. Bodies don’t stay the same sometimes as all, making it a little mediocre.  
 
The opening English song is really stupid and is like a rap mixed up of Yugioh, Digimon, and Pokemon. They also seem to have something similar to the poke-rap. Then we have the English script… now I have not been able to see the Japanese version but please tell me they do not use this stupid line ‘…then he can turn all the baddies into goodies…’ Please tell me they aren’t so stupid as to do that? Genki is one annoying boy, to the point of me shouting ‘SHUT THE FUCK UP!’ He also calls out ‘IN THE ZONE!’ which feels like they were trying to just make a saying. It sounds as annoying as Naruto’s ‘BELIEVE IT!’ saying. Alan’s voice sounds better then almost all of the characters and that says a hell of a lot. He isn’t the best but he’s the better of them.

Monster Rancher……Yes, I know the Japanese version of that is Monster Farm but today we are doing the English version that aired on the now-defunct (and fortunately) Fox Kids. Now it is based on a series of life simulation RPG videogames created by Tecmo (the company that brought you Ninja Gaiden & Dead or Alive) having over 14 games across different videogame platforms. 
  
  
In the anime adaptation, it revolves around Genki, a 12-year-old middle school boy who really loves to play videogames and one day, he discover the Monster Rancher game and as he plays it, he is zapped into their universe where he meets the rest of the team: Holly, a 14-year-old girl on the quest along with their monster team, Mochi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger and Hare (No, I’m not calling them Tiger and Bunny) to find the ancient Monster Phoenix, and it is the only powerful monster that’s able to stop the dastardly……..MOO! 
  
  
  
Yes, his name is Moo.  What happened to Mistress BAA? Overlord BARK?  Princess SQUEE? Hell, where is Grand Master MEOW? 
  
  
  
 
Now, you’re wondering that this anime reminds you of something. You know, that type of anime that involves battle monsters and traveling in unknown strange lands especially when the travelers are very young and it’s also based on card game/videogame franchise. I know what this anime reminds of……..it’s like…..DEATH NOTE!!! 
  
  
  
OK, I’m just kidding. But the difference between Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Digimon & Death Note is Death Note doesn’t have those noticeable COPYCATS and generic ones at that (unless somebody can correct me)!! WHY anyone would needed another one of this type of anime? I get that it’s something for kids to watch and even though this came out when I was a kid, I never knew about its existence but I guess that were trying to cash in on the Pokémon/Digimon/Yu-Gi-Oh craze and I don’t think it worked that well considering Monster Rancher only lasts about 72 episodes and the other ones just go on forever even if we had enough. 
  
  
  
Well, the story is generic, there’s no doubt about it. Now the characters: Genki is fucking annoying……there, I said it. Basically he is the stereotype of this type of anime where he’s very determined, optimistic, and hopeful and likes to yell something at the top of his lungs. Man, do I want to strangle this kid and tell him to SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU DAMN MORON!! Most of the dialogue is so annoying in this show and for example, the antagonists in the show? They are referred as “baddies”. Yes, They say that on this show and you know what, whether I think of that word, I’m thinking of somebody playing a drinking game to this show and you got to take a shot whenever someone say “baddies”. I guess that no one survived. Most of the monsters with the exception of Tiger are very forgettable, mainly because he bothered me the least and Holly…..yeah, she was important, too…….kinda.  The name MOO as a villain is still stupid and I mean really fucking stupid. 
  
  
  
I’m ashamed to say who did the animation of this, considering they made one of my favorite movies (not just anime movies, but overall movie of all time). The studio is TMS (Tōkyō Movie Shinsha) and what they made before this was Akira of course, Little Nemo (yeah, that movie was animated by a Japanese animation studio. Go figure. I didn’t know that at first.) Anyway, the animation level here is about average for a now-vintage kid show but speed lines do occur sometimes and it makes it seem like they are slipping in that department and character designs are a bit average. 
  
  
  
The music……me screaming at the top of my lungs would sound better than this played-out Wal-Mart style Pokémon rap they played and also that damn side song that goes “Get a disk, take a risk, spin it fast, through the past”. I could’ve ended it with, “I rather get shot in the ass.” 
  
  
  
Now, on to the English dub and surprisingly to me, this wasn’t made by 4Kids. No, really, 4Kids are not responsible for this dub, for once. It was made by a dubbing company in Canada called The Ocean Group and yet the anime & western animation they dub or just voiced before and after this were better made. Here are a few examples: Black Lagoon, The Girl Who Leap through Time, Escaflowne, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, Death Note and Inuyasha….freaking Inuyasha!! Yes, Inyuasha isn’t that great IMO but I rather watch that than this. Most of the voice work in here do sound so very kiddy-like, it hurts and it gets very irritating by the minute hearing those voices, especially since I recognize some voices that came from Ed, Edd, N Eddy. 
  
   
 
FINAL VERDICT:  I could easily say that this show makes me want to curse kid-aimed anime, such as this, Beyblade and Scan 2Go, but even as a kid, I wouldn’t be as interested in shows like that and in the present day, I still won’t have an interest in it.  But as much as I want to trash the show, I can’t but one of the reasons why is that the show can get genuinely decent for most of the time, especially in the emotional moments in the show gives it a plus in my book but still that gets shadowed by the idiocy of the writing, the marketing and the shallowness that basically carried this show. Now even though for you have any kids or younger relatives that might be interested in this and it reminds them of those other shows I mentioned before, just tell them those shows are better than this. 
  
 
As for the second season............I just gonna say what was the point of that? Because there really wasn't unless they wanted more exposure but that failed.

In an attempt to recover from recent events, Hei befriends the inn's other guests. He discovers that one of them is a fellow Contractor tasked with killing him. Their resulting encounter spells disaster for both Hei and Yin, who are forced to fight for their lives and grapple with the emotional wounds sustained in their previous life together. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Ten years ago before the events of the series, a spatial anomaly which became known as ""Heaven's Gate"" appeared in South America. It was followed by the opening of ""Hell's Gate"" in Tokyo, altering the sky and wreaking havoc on the landscape. At that time, ""Contractors"", people with special abilities, capable of supernatural feats, emerged. Kept secret from the public, Contractors murder in cold blood and block their emotions with logic and reason. Their abilities are acquired at the cost of their humanity, and their name derives from the requirement to ""pay the price"" each time their powers are used. Nations and organizations around the world train and use Contractors as spies and assassins, resulting in violent battles for valuable objects and information.
After the 'Heaven's War', the United States loses its position as a superpower to a mysterious organization known as the Syndicate. Darker Than Black follows a Chinese Contractor code-named ""Hei"" as he undertakes espionage and assassination missions in Tokyo directed by the Syndicate. In his false civilian life, where he is known as shy a student under the alias Li Shenshun, Hei is assisted by Yin, an artificial human known as Doll and Mao, a Contractor trapped in a cat's body and overseen by former police officer Huang. The series has a villain-of-the-week format, with a variety of characters such as a Japanese Public Security Bureau who oversee the activities of dangerous people with supernatural powers.Early in the series Hei is revealed as a former fighter in the Heaven's War, searching for his missing sister Bai; he believes that a woman known as Amber is responsible for Bai's disappearance after escaping from the Syndicate. Amber leads Evening Primrose, a group of Contractors targeted by the Syndicate who claim they are terrorists. Pandora, another group, investigates Hell's Gate; the Syndicate is using Pandora and its Saturn Ring weapon to attack Hell's Gate and annihilate the Contractors. This creates mayhem as multiple Syndicate agents target Huang who ultimately commits suicide. Hei and Yin meet Amber while Mao escapes from them. Upon meeting Amber, Hei is revealed to be an ordinary human who became able to use Bai's power after his sister placed his body onto his flesh through her powers. When Saturn Ring is activated, all Contractors except Hei are killed. Hei has a vision where he meets Bai and decides to betray the Syndicate. Amber uses her Contract powers to revert time long enough to enable Hei to destroy Saturn Ring, and Hei and Yin escape from the Syndicate.

(JAP title: Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden) 
 
NOTE 1: This OVA/Gaiden covers the events that occur between season one and season two. However, I recommend you watch this only after watching them first.  
 
NOTE 2: This review is spoiler-free. 
 
This OVA consists of only 4 episodes, so, just like my Kaiba review, this will be a… 
 
[ 3 MINUTE REVIEW ] 
 
Most of us, who watched season two, were really confused. Why had Hei grown out his hair? When did he become a drunkard? Where is Yin? Fortunately, this OVA answers all of those questions. Basically, if you watched the two seasons, then watching the Gaiden is a must. The OVA follows the events that occur immediately after the end of season one. 
 
 The story is one of the best and fits the 4 episodes like a glove. At no point of time do you feel bored. There is action, adventure, romance, drama and mystery. The story revolves around Yin and Hei. Their feelings towards each other are what the four episodes are mostly about. You finally get to see what Yin is thinking. The mood of the anime is very serious and there is no comic relief or lightness whatsoever. 
 
The animation is great and it’s really amazing how Yin’s expressionless face shows emotions so subtly. Hei remains as awesome as ever.  
Voice acting is great. And the soundtrack is excellent. I don’t really have much to say here. 
 
Episodes are intricately designed in such a way that you find yourself canceling other plans to marathon the 4 episodes. However, if you’re a long time anime fan, you might find it a bit predictable, but you’ll still enjoy it.  
 
The Bottom-line: 
Darker than Black OVA is everything is should be – clear, concise and completely enjoyable.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful An entirely unnecessary addition to a fantastic ending of the first season. The story wrapped up nicely, albeit in a rather open-ended manner in the first season. The story is... Lacklustre to say the least. It's something merely pinned on to the end of an already completed story. The only thing that stopped me from rating it lower was improved animation on certain scenes and some stellar fight choreography that outclassed that of the first season. 
 
I've been told this was made after the second season to try to make sense of it and make it less shitty by a number of people, if that's the case... Yikes.

          
 
       Helpful For all of you out there looking to wash away the bitter taste that Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini left in your mouths, this OVA is EXACTLY what you need. 
 
I loved Darker than Black season 1. I thought the characters, atmosphere, and story were all spectacular. Then I watched season 2. And boy, was it different. Virtually every single thing that I loved about season 1 was changed beyond recognition. The ending was so terrible and left me with so many questions that I literally stopped in the middle of my day that and wrote a list of complaints that I had about season 2. I was therefore incredibly happy when I began the first episode of Gaiden and could immediately tell that it was going to be a return to form for the anime. 
 
Right from the beginning, you'll notice that the art style is back to how it was in the original series, just with improved quality. This works wonders in recapturing the nostalgia that many feel for season 1: it just feels right, like the creators are acknowledging that they messed up with season 2 and now they're going to give us what we actually wanted all along. 
 
The music is great, especially the ending, but honestly I would be hard-pressed to recall any moments where I specifically noticed the background music, just because I was always focusing so much on the action onscreen and the dialogue that it never stood out to me. 
 
The story is basically an explanation for a whole bunch of nonsense that was thrown at viewers in season 2, and a well-needed one at that. Season 2 makes absolutely zero sense without this, so it functions exactly as it should. That isn't to say that this is all it does, though, but it's hard to go into detail without spoiling anything. I'll just say that the story is back to being Badass Electric Batman Hei and Yin versus the syndicate, instead of being Magical Girl Suou and Alcoholic Hei versus a bunch of trope characters. 
 
Character development is where this OVA really digs in deep and hits you hard with the feels. Hei and Yin are on the run from the syndicate together, and all they have in the world is each other. It's all of the drama and relationship development that you were itching to see in season 1, and most of the focus is entirely on them. This leads to some very emotional scenes, and I'll admit that I even shed a few tears over this anime. 
 
Overall, I highly recommend Darker than Black: Gaiden to anyone who enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the anime in any capacity. Even if your opinion is the exact opposite of mine and you disliked season 1 and loved Ryuusei no Gemini, you'll likely still appreciate how Gaiden smooths out the story of the second part. I cannot imagine why any fans of season 1 or season 2 would not enjoy this OVA, unless you're only invested in the new characters introduced in season 2 and nothing else.

4,1222,82,7.408106814,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Bokura ga Ita,"Going into her first year of high school, Nanami Takahashi is filled with the hope of making many new friends. After meeting the shy Yuri Yamamoto, she hears about a popular boy in their class: Yano Motoharu. Yuri cares little for Yano because of his past relationship with her older sister Nana, and at first, Nanami doesn't like his attitude either. However, Nanami soon begins to warm up to Yano and takes a liking to him. The two spend more of their time together and eventually decide to start dating. But their love is not without challenges; Yano has trouble opening up to Nanami, since his first girlfriend, Nana, died in a car accident the year before, and she had been with one of her ex-boyfriends at the time. 
 
Finding themselves living in the shadow of Yano's relationship with Nana, Nanami and Yano struggle to keep their relationship afloat amid misunderstandings and heartache with the certainty of their love for each other. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Nanami Takahashi, a teenage girl in her first year of high school, hopes to make new friends quickly. The center of attention at her school is Motoharu Yano, a very popular boy, whom Nanami dislikes at the beginning, due to his apparent superficiality. However, she soon falls in love with him, but Yano is still affected by the loss of his girlfriend, Nana Yamamoto. Nana was killed in a car crash a year before the beginning of the story. Because she was with her ex-boyfriend at the time of her death, Yano suspects she was cheating on him. Due to this, he is unable to trust people or to talk about his relationship with her; instead, he chooses to pretend he does not care very much about the situation.
Nanami confesses her love to Yano but is rejected when he is unable to tell her if he loves her back. Despite that, she is still willing to support him and reassures him she will always be by his side. Soon, Yano realizes he has fallen in love with her as well, so they start going out. However, Yano's secrets (including the fact that he slept with Nana's little sister, Yuri, after the accident and his unwillingness to talk about his feelings for his dead girlfriend) make Nanami unsure to the point that she decides to end the relationship, believing she is unable to make him happy. The story becomes even more complicated when Masafumi Takeuchi, Yano's best friend, also falls in love with Nanami and becomes Yano's rival.
Due to these circumstances, Nanami is confused over whom she should choose, but she soon realizes that Yano is the one she genuinely loves. She agrees to start going out with him again, on the condition that she can find out more about the relationship between Nana and Yano and his true feelings about what had happened. Their romance takes an unexpected turn when Yano finds out that his mother, Yoko, wants to move to Tokyo. Upon hearing this, Nanami tells him to make a decision without taking her into consideration. The anime ends with Yano's departure; however, the two of them decide to continue their relationship.
The manga picks up four years later. It is revealed that Yano and Nanami kept in touch for about six months; then, suddenly, he stopped contacting her and disappeared without a trace. Tired of waiting, hurt and confused, Nanami starts a relationship with Takeuchi. Even so, she is still in love with Yano and unable to forget about their common past. She befriends a co-worker named Akiko Sengenji, who is revealed to be one of Yano's classmates from the Tokyo high school he transferred to. In a series of flashbacks, it is shown that Yano was forced to work part-time when his mother was diagnosed with cancer, but kept everything hidden from Nanami, not wanting to worry her. Following an unexpected visit from Michiko, her former friend and the wife of Yano's father, Yoko became increasingly paranoid, fearing he would leave her. When Yano announced his decision to go and visit Nanami, she accused him of being insensitive. After a short, but violent fight, Yoko hung herself; as in Nana's case, Yano blamed himself for her death and therefore decided to sever all the ties with his past.
Sengenji is also in love with Yano, but, despite this, she sees Nanami as a friend, not as a rival. She is the one who reveals Yano's whereabouts to Nanami (including the fact that he adopted his father's name, Nagakura) and later the fact that he lives with Yuri Yamamoto. As a result, Nanami rejects Takeuchi when he proposes to her, feeling that it wouldn't be fair to marry him. Upon meeting Nanami for the first time in more than five years, Yano claims he is in love with another woman. However, when he and Nanami meet again, she tells him that she knows about the relationship between him and Yuri. He then admits that he only stays with Yuri because her mother is dying and he feels he can't leave her alone. He also tells Nanami about his mother's suicide, and also about his panic attacks. During this meeting, it is hinted that he's still in love with her.
Meanwhile, Takeuchi decides to continue his relationship with Nanami, but only as friends. He tells her that she will eventually reach Yano and asks her to wait for him. He also starts to push Yano to admit his own feelings for Nanami and points out that no matter how strong she seems, she is unable to deal with the situation by herself. Nanami and Yano have an unexpected meeting, during which Yano finally confesses he wanted her to hold him back instead of letting him leave with his mother. Shortly after, Yuri's mother dies, which prompts Yuri to end her relationship with Yano. She reveals to him that her sister Nana never cheated on him and that she only wanted to have a proper break-up with her ex-boyfriend at the time of the accident.
Yano decides to start over with Nanami and tries to contact her on the telephone. He fails several times due to her busy schedule, but eventually reaches her. During their conversation, a severely over-worked and anemic Nanami falls down a flight of stairs and is brought to the hospital injured and unconscious. Terrified by the possibility of losing her as well, Yano rushes to her side; as a result, the two of them are reunited. The finale of the manga shows Yano proposing to Nanami and then visiting Nana Yamamoto's gravesite with her.

Ok, wont say anything about the ending (but long distance relationships dont work! SORRY could not resist) 
 
Characters are petty, lame and poorly detailed. 
 
Nanami) 
Maby shes cute but what a whiny girl. Her voice is so irritating i cant find that attractive. 
Also havent had a moment where she is funny or whatever.  
Can u immagen beeing married to such a girl. that = devorce in less then 2 years! 
And maby it was the art, but i felt that every smile Nanami or Yano made where forced. 
 
Yano)  
What a little mama's boy. He has more emotions that a girl whos pregnant. (and i feel most of them are about sex) Everything he says (besides about the dead girlfriend doesnt make any sence.) 
 
Dead Nana's sister)  
Is the type that eithers gets killed later in live or leaves a suicide note. What a petty character. 
 
Takahasi (or something) likes Nanami but lacks any testosteron or commen sence 
 
And dead Nana could recieve free mental consultation from a doctor in every western country+ pills! And if i where her parents id lock her up untill she was 30! 
 
What a awfull anime. 
I get that it isnt a comedy or something but man dont they have teachers/parents/friends/neibors/familie that teach those students commen sence. 
This sorta anime makes me wonder how the ppl in Japan realy are.  Cuz at least 2 people had to aprove of the script and 1 had to write it. 

          
 
       Helpful This anime namely, Bokura ga ita in english, We were there is all about romance. It has lots of drama and I actually liked it. It seems enjoyable and fun to watch. There were a lot sweet moments and a lot carried away moments. I was captivated by the characters the main character namely, Motoharu Yano is very devoted especially to his ex-girlfriend and his current girlfriend. He had a very tough past and also he wanted to completely forget about it. He is a bit similar to a character in Durarara! which is, Masaomi Kida. He wants to run away from his past but he just can't. In order to forget it they must control their emotions and face their everyday life and if they left something in the past they will surely figure it out and they try to learn from their mistakes. 
              The art is a little similar to an anime called ""Lovely Complex"". So I liked it and it's very cute especially when the characters shows their chibi form. i absolutely adore chibi forms ^^. 
              The sound his nostalgic and dramatic. Kind of reminds me of Fruits Basket. The opening music has a meaningful lyrics and eventually I was very captivated by the song. 
             I enjoyed it a lot but there was something lacking about it. Something very important and that is a GOOD ending. I don't like to be a spoiler but for me the ending needs to be fixed. I wasn't thrilled because it made me realized that watching the whole series was a waste of time but eventually it wasn't because at least i learned a couple of things about life and also it made me realized that life can be harsh. Sometimes there are good and bad endings but to make the best of it we must know that we could still keep up with our future. 
       In short... Bokura ga ita is a good anime. So to those Romantic people out there try to watch this anime it will make you cry,happy,laugh, and learn a piece of life.

          
 
       Helpful Note:  This review contains one spoiler for the manga reader only.  Otherwise, no spoiler.  And if you don't want to read the manga which continues on after the anime ends, then no spoilers, only gems :) 
 
I love love.  And I love drama.  And this anime gave me both.  To be fair, the art annoyed me at first.  Why are there no backgrounds and only one eye?  Probably because the characters are so wrapped up in one another that they can't notice anything else.  And that's also my biggest problem with the show.  There could have been a zombie apocalypse happening and the characters wouldn't have noticed because they are so wrapped up in their own problems.  Which really aren't that big, however, we all remember that such problems seemed huge when we were in high school so it becomes part of the show's charm. 
 
The plot of this show is all about beating a dead horse.  Let me rephrase that.  Beating a dead girlfriend.  The characters cannot let the past go, even if they weren't the ones to live through it.  The main guy is too conflicted to see past himself, the main girl is too naive to know anything, and the best friend who would be the perfect soul mate for anyone is too nice to ever get anywhere.  It is aggravating, it is annoying, it is irritating, it is...this genre.  It is what one expects.  Don't watch high school romance drama without expecting the irritating and expected. 
 
Here's where this show gets good and I'm going to give you a SPOILER, so stop reading here if you don't want to know anything about the story past the anime. 
 
The anime  stops at chapter 31 in the manga but the manga ends at chapter 70, and the manga takes us 5 years into the future and really shows what the characters are thinking and feeling as well as past experiences well beyond the dead girlfriend.  The characters become more dynamic and show more background and their relationships become more real and complex.  The rating I gave this show is based on the manga and not the anime.  
 
So should you watch this? Answer these questions: 
1.  Do you love pointless romance dramas? 
2.  Do you mind teenage problems that are blown out of proportion? 
3.  Would you read the manga past the anime? 
 
If you answered yes, no, yes to the above, watch this show!  It really doesn't take that long and let's face it:  we have all watched much, much worse.  And if you don't love romance, why are you reading this review?

3. Liked season 1, love season 2 even more : The wait is over, you can probably rewatct it till they publish another few volumes and bring about a season 3. 
 
I've met people who liked the good old Oregairu part one and are put off by Zoku since things turned from being light hearted to intense. But then there are people who liked the show even more after Zoku. I obviously fall in the latter category.  
For those of you who liked season one over Zoku, this OVA won't be that memorable since it re-enact the feels from Zoku. Also, if you haven't watched the series and somehow stumbled upon this page and are wondering why everyone's giving it a 10 or so, the answer probably lies in the fact that people either absolutely love this anime or hate it. And since the release happened only yesterday probably the ones who disliked the show didn't bother to check out the OVA. 
Oregairu has always been a special anime for me. Also, since I just finished the OVA chances are that my opinions will be biased. But I don't even care about them being biased anymore since the mighty 8man and gang are back after almost an year.  
The story wasn't any deep, for those of you who aren't aware the 1st part of the OVA is a Canon and the second one isn't. The artwork was awesome as usual. The OVA completely retained the original style of the anime as mentioned by some other reviewers.

          
 
       Helpful 	As the release of Oregairu’s Volume 12 light novel is nowhere in sight, fans of this amazing series by Watari Wataru continue to thirst for any anime adaptation of what source material remains.  Luckily, for us, there’s volume 10.5 and this OVA covers this part of the light novels.  The wait has been gruelling, but as I burned through these 22 minutes, time passed awfully fast.  Does this short piece deliver on the heavy expectations of long-time fans? 
 
	Story (8/10): The events in Oregairu Zoku OVA happen in the midst of the second season.  As a summary, our amazing protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya, goes on a date with his kouhai, Isshiki Iroha, as she has requested weeks before, long forgotten in the main character’s memories.  The entire date is very enjoyable and is well adapted from the source material.  This enigmatic pairing has perhaps the best chemistry between Hachiman and a girl in the series because of the difference in behaviour that Iroha displays to him in contrast to her regular public image.  Their intriguing conversations have so many jabs and so much snarky wit embedded within them.  Hachiman and Iroha’s interactions carry the plotline for this OVA and make time pass incredibly quickly, a sign of an entertaining anime.   
 
         A portion of this episode is also taken by a hangout segment with the other two main girls, Yukino and Yui, and the cynical male.  This part lacks focus, as the evident lack of time can be seen by not adapting a different arc in volume 10.5.  They have replaced that slightly unnecessary section with an albeit filler 6 to 7 minutes, which brings down the story points marginally.  The ending photo is very satisfying however. 
 
	Art (8/10): Studio Feel does an amazing job with the art.  The visual quality in this OVA is comparable with the TV series or even better.  The style is very bright and polished.  Iroha looks amazing in this art style because of how bright her brown hair appears.  The backgrounds mainly comprise of standard urban scenes.  The main standouts are how beautiful the characters look.   
 
	Sound (8/10): The opening of this anime is my favourite of all time.  Yanagi Nagi is an amazing singer and the instrumentals are both uplifting and dramatic.  The chorus is incredibly catchy and the beginning hooks the viewer easily.  The buildup is effective in hyping up the viewer to the main portion with a fun drum roll.  Every part of the song is nearly perfect and even the lyrics relate very well to the anime’s overall message and theme (that of chasing one’s paths and ideals, pursuit of genuine relationships).  The soundtrack is the same as the TV anime, where some tracks may go unnoticed.  It has a few tracks that may stick out like the piano version of the opening, but the soundtrack itself is not spectacular.   
 
	Characters (10/10): The main character is my favourite character of any medium of all time.  Hachiman Hikigaya portrays the loner in such a way that it doesn’t alienate the viewer from his extreme viewpoint, yet easily relates his situations to the viewer.  Through the past two seasons, his deep character development and backstory along with the other main characters, Yui and Yukino, provide profound reasoning for how they act in the OVA.  Each character’s way of living makes sense through context, which makes each of these characters very likeable.  They all have individual, human flaws that make them endearing and a breath of fresh air from the standard anime cast.  
 
       From a superficial view, these characters look like cardboard cut-outs (Hachiman is an edgy self-insert harem lead, Yui is hot airhead, Yukino is generic kuudere jk), but they are given complex personalities that put them above the rest.  Iroha is also very interesting as a character.  She provides an interesting contrast between Komachi and her, where Hachiman’s little sister has a very cute and genuine personality and this other kouhai replicates the same personality type in a fake way.  The characters are all great. 
 
	Enjoyment (9/10): The date is remarkably enjoyable because of the shenanigans provided by it and the exceptional character interactions.  The OVA is mainly comedic or just slice of life because that is mainly the purpose of OVA type anime.  As explained by the story, this OVA episode definitely supplies any Oregairu fan with plenty of entertainment because anything of this amazing series is to be enjoyed.  When is volume 12? 
 
	Overall (8/10):  The Oregairu Zoku OVA is everything that the Oregairu fan wanted and possibly more.  After an unsatisfactory to the second season of the TV anime, anything decent involving more of Hachiman and co. is greatly appreciated.  Having a bit of source material left gives this OVA a good story and backbone for additional content and it delivers.  Although no OVA is spectacular or ground breaking, this one is still very enjoyable. 


          
 
       Helpful Somewhat of a mediocre OVA... which is strange because the first season's OVA was fantastic. 
 
This OVA does not continue the story of the second season but is rather a one-shot side story. It does not really advance the relationship of the characters  and does not reveal any important information, it's a bit more like the first season in that regard , given that it's mostly light hearted and flows pretty smoothly. 
 
However, the big flaw is that almost the entire run-time is dedicated to Hachiman and Iroha rather than Hachiman / Yuigahama / Yukinoshita. This is a massive downside to the OVA since Isshiki Iroha, love her or hate her, is not a main character, she became a strong supporting character in the second season but not strong enough to usurp most of the runtime of an OVA from the main cast. 
 
So I found myself struggling to complete this OVA. Not good, not recommended, can be easily skipped.

4,33095,84,7.336522013,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen,"Even after having risen to the utmost rank of shun'ichi, Yotaro struggles to find his own identity in the world of rakugo. Caught between his master's teachings and the late Sukeroku's unique style, his performance lacks an important ingredient—ego. And while his popularity packs the theaters, he is but one of the few; rakugo is under threat of being eclipsed. 
 
Meanwhile Yakumo, regarded by many as the last bastion of preserving the popularity of rakugo, struggles to cope with his elderly state. Even though his performances are still stellar, he fears that he is nearing his limits. His doubts grow stronger as an old friend creeps ever closer. Konatsu, for her part, attempts to raise her son as a single mother, which Yotaro is heavily opposed to. Instead, he seeks to persuade her to marry him and in turn raise her son as his own. 
 
In  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen , the curtains fall on Yotaro and Yakumo's story, tasked with restoring the near-obsolete art form as well as overcoming their internal conflicts. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Josei']","A man is released from prison and becomes the apprentice of a famous rakugo performer, Yakumo Yurakutei. The story focuses on the backstories of the performers and their struggle to gain popularity, following Yakumo's apprenticeship and rise to fame and his friendship with fellow performer Sukeroku.
","The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was personally my favorite anime of 2016. It was such a breath of fresh air for the slice-of-life genre with its traditional period drama setting that inevitably clashes with the modernization of society. Who would have thought that something like rakugo can hold such power when it comes to crafting mesmerizing narratives? Personally, I would’ve found it boring when I get to see a performance live. However, the show executes this art of storytelling so well that it never fails to catch my attention. The way it shows the perspective of the audience and the storyteller in diverse angles and its sudden frame changes is brilliantly done as it serves as a visual treat with its gestures in which it further enhances the rakugo experience. All of this carries into the second season, though the direction of the story starts to head towards a definitive conclusion. 
 
While the previous season deals with Yakumo’s past and how rakugo forever changed his life, the second season deals with him getting a closure from it. From the first season’s finale, we get a general idea of what to look forward to. Rakugo is in a state of decline just like his health, and he plans to take it along to his death. His haunting past that hinders him from really pushing rakugo to new heights. Unless he has comes to terms with what is troubling him, he can never really move forward and say that he has lived a satisfying life. However, there is an underlying resistance that says rakugo must live on particularly embodied by his apprentice Yotaro. Maybe there is a faint voice within Yakumo that supports this idea that he has grown to love rakugo enough to not let go of it and place his hopes unto the future generations. The second season explores on that, if rakugo will thrive into a new era dominated by technology.  
 
The show attempts to preserve the art as something timeless, yet it also shows how it struggles being squeezed into the mainstream entertainment. Radio and television shows determine its popularity and Yotaro’s quirky and lively performance manages to put it in a state of relevance. But why is this important? Rakugo is often associated with descriptions like old and ancient, it will eventually die if only people stuck in the past are the only ones that care about it. There is a call to innovate the craft, but it cannot happen conveniently and instantaneously. Most stories told through rakugo are centuries old, occasionally altered to fit in within the era but it has been increasingly evident that mere alterations are not enough for it to convey a memorable and impactful story. Some stories can be alienating to a new audience, so there is a need to create new stories for the future. 
 
With regards to a few minor complaints I have with the show, I feel like Yotaro hasn’t been fully fleshed out as a character. The story tries to represent him as the resurrection of Sukeroku and the fire that keeps rakugo alive, but we never really know him outside of rakugo aside from being a former yakuza member that served time in jail. What made him emotionally connect with Yakumo’s prison performance? Does he have any profound past experience that drives him to become a better person through rakugo? We’ve seen Yakumo’s past in the previous season do that, and it’s a shame Yotaro didn’t get the same treatment. Also, the ending is quite rushed. I’m happy that it does get the conclusion it deserves but it felt like it dropped out of nowhere and now everything is going to be fine. The previous episodes have been building up the conflict of the story but it’s kind of disappointing that it gets resolved in one swift move. I would talk more about it but I’ll leave it up to the viewer to have a personal interpretation of the ending. 
 
While I didn’t find myself more emotionally invested in comparison to the previous season, I still think it’s a great sequel. Animation-wise, it’s inferior as really bad animation frames pop up from time to time and the dialogue occasionally goes out of sync during rakugo performances. However the overall feel of the show complements with the previous season, as it tries to convey a message that there is still hope for something that is dying. Just like the current situation of the anime industry, it’s hard for something that has the heart to tell a memorable and refreshing story to survive amidst the oversaturation of mediocre shows. It gets axed if it doesn’t sell well regardless of its potential. Nothing is really certain and permanent. But still, we fans of the medium still cling to hope and get rewarded by gems like this show.  I really wish we get more kinds of stories as well-made as this in the future, but one can only dream.  


          
 
       Helpful The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was the absolute best anime of Winter, 2016, and very possibly the best anime of that entire year. It was certainly the most moving, truly adult, drama I've seen in a long time. Appropriately enough, since rakugo is the art of storytelling, the first season took the form of a story within a story, telling an incredibly moving tale of a complicated friendship, tragic choices, and the repercussions of those actions for people living in the present day. It was haunting, memorable, and it's been a very, very long year waiting for the sequel. 
 
The second season starts with a recap told in the form of a rakugo tale--this was an absolutely perfect, and perfectly logical, choice. You're immediately transported back into the space of the rakugo theater, and anticipating the next chapter of the big story ahead. This time, we're completely in the present day (or at least as much as is possible, as history and memory always informs the present for the characters in this drama), and instead of learning about rakugo's past, we get to see how it's faring in contemporary Japan. We also learn how, or whether, the main characters can move forward with their own lives.  
 
The real joy of this show is to see how Yakumo (the perpetually stubborn, dissatisfied, depressed, and yet extraordinarily charismatic rakugo master), Konatsu (now a mother, and thankfully just as stubborn, prickly, passionate, and intelligent as always), and Yotarou (a newly-minted rakugo star, always playing the fool but clearly much smarter than he likes to appear) interact. There's absolutely no reason in the world for these three to be connected. From decades-long resentments to daily irritations, the only way to explain it is that they're a (very unconventional) family, and sometimes you don't get to choose those deep connections that bind you far more powerfully than you may ever realize.  
 
In a very real way this is a terribly moving romance, one that ties three disparate personalities together in their love of rakugo and their fundamental love for one another. Yotarou’s centrality in this dynamic becomes a major theme over time, but the magic is in observing the intricate dance of recrimination, guilt, and reconciliation that defines Yakumo and Konatsu’s roles in this drama. If you aren’t reduced to tears when watching the final scenes of episode ten, then you’re far stronger than I am. It’s one of the most powerful and genuine moments in any creative form that I have ever experienced.  
 
This show is written and directed exquisitely, giving time for characters to develop slowly, allowing conversations to unfold naturally, and always making room for silent spaces that are more overwhelming than traditional dramatic crescendos in almost all other series. One of the most beautiful and memorable moments is a very small scene in which Konatsu’s infant son interrupts Yakumo while he’s playing the shamisen, and in that encounter we learn much more about who Yakumo really is than most shows convey about a character in an entire episode of “big” revelations. Gestures, glances, and the smallest alteration of an expression are powerful in this drama, and the animation takes full advantage of the ways in which visual elements can encompass nuances that words cannot. As the episodes progress, keep close watch upon how Yakumo is drawn. The level of care given to his face and body is eloquent. The animators tell stories in every line. 
 
The second season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu may just be better than the first. After living with this story and its protagonists for a while, it's easy to appreciate the nuances of personality and dialogue that imbue almost every scene of this show with subtle emotional resonance. After the enormous revelations and emotional impact of season one, even small developments now take on new dimensions. Plus, this season is about the future. It's exciting to see what happens next. After falling in love with this story and its characters, I never wanted it to just remain in the past. I'm glad that we can look forward as well, even with the full awareness that progression through time, while it carries hope, also entails self-doubt, continued pain over past losses, and uncertainty as to whether what’s to come will necessarily result in happiness.  
 
This show is a masterpiece of storytelling, as it should be. It knows that life doesn't often proceed by giant dramas and great occurrences. Life is the incremental accumulation of moments, and these sedimentary layers, overlapping across lived time, comprise each of our pasts. As every new memory, experience, or choice is added to that slowly forming bedrock, the character of the whole is forever changed. While we are a product of our past, the present continually shapes us into something new. It's captivating to see these layers form in Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and it's joyful to see how life is always surprising, intoxicating, and forever a source of beautiful, shimmering stories.

          
 
       Helpful I don’t like Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju. Main reason being is that the main characters’ stupidity is what caused the conflicts within the show. Right off the bat, the main focus of both arcs, Yakumo, is so fickle-minded. Come to think of it, he’s the indirect cause of Miyokichi and Sukeroku death. Now I don’t know if what he and Sukeroku had was just bromance or if he actually had feelings for him. Or if he just wants to focus on doing rakugo. But if he just manned up and dumped Miyokichi, then she could’ve just moved on with her life. But nope, he just had to be wishy-washy about it. 
 
Second is Sukeroku. His laziness in the second arc was annoyingly stupid. I don’t know if it’s just a pride that he didn’t want to take work aside rakugo. But for him to just let his daughter do all the work is nothing I can empathize with. Miyoki, I can somewhat understand considering the culture she was raised in. She was raised in the idea of being a perfect housewife. Honestly she didn’t know better. 
 
Third is Konatsu. I don’t know if she’s just being tsundere, based on how she keeps threatening to kill Yakumo. But she still lives in his house, despite him constantly insulting her parents in front of her. And the ending? It was heavily implied, from her being very secretive about the father of her child, to the way Shinosuke behaves exactly like Yakumo, to Konatsu saying that she and Yakumo were like lovers. Shinosuke was their son. What is this, Usagi Drop 2.0? 
 
On a positive note, I did like some of the rakugo themselves, like Jugemu, Shinigami and Nozarashi. I got to learn the basics of its history and evolution. But that’s really it. Most of the characters in this show are insufferable.

Along with the other Sailor Guardians and her boyfriend Mamoru Chiba, they begin investigating cases of students from Mugen Academy, a school for the most elite students, who are being transformed into monsters. During the investigation, they meet three strange individuals: Haruka Tenou, a handsome racecar driver; Michiru Kaiou, a talented violinist; and Hotaru Tomoe, a mysterious girl with a weak constitution. 
 
As more incidents occur, the Sailor Guardians are met with another surprise—the appearance of two new planetary protectors with motives of their own. Despite the newcomers' questionable allegiance to Usagi and her comrades, they all face a threat from a common enemy: an evil entity who calls himself Pharaoh 90. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Demons', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","One day in Juban, Tokyo, a middle-school student named Usagi Tsukino befriends Luna, a talking black cat who gives her a magical brooch enabling her to transform into Sailor Moon: a soldier destined to save Earth from the forces of evil. Luna and Usagi assemble a team of fellow Sailor Guardians to find their princess and the Silver Crystal. They encounter the studious Ami Mizuno, who awakens as Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local Shinto shrine maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, a tall and strong transfer student who awakens as Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring idol who had awakened as Sailor Venus a few months prior, accompanied by her talking feline companion Artemis. Additionally, they befriend Mamoru Chiba, a high school student who assists them on occasion as Tuxedo Mask.
In the first arc, the group battles the Dark Kingdom, whose members attempt to find the Silver Crystal and free an imprisoned, evil entity called Queen Metaria. Usagi and her team discover that in their previous lives they were members of the ancient Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against them, resulting in the destruction of the Moon Kingdom. Its ruler Queen Serenity sent her daughter Princess Serenity, reincarnated as Usagi, along with her protectors the Sailor Guardians, their feline advisers Luna and Artemis, and the princess's true love Prince Endymion, who in turn was reborn as Mamoru.
At the beginning of the second arc, the Sailor Guardians meet Usagi and Mamoru's future daughter Chibiusa, who arrives from a 30th-century version of Tokyo known as ""Crystal Tokyo"", which is ruled by Neo Queen Serenity, Usagi of the future and has been attacked by the group of villains known as the Black Moon Clan. During their journey, Sailor Moon and her friends meet Sailor Pluto, Guardian of the Time-Space Door. During the climactic battle of the arc, Sailor Pluto dies trying to save the sailor soldiers and Chibiusa was brainwashed by the enemy and turned into the Black Lady, but was eventually reformed and awakens as a Guardian herself—Sailor Chibi Moon.
The third arc introduces car-racer Haruka Tenoh and violinist Michiru Kaioh, who appear as Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, whose duty is to guard the Solar System from external threats. Physics student Setsuna Meioh, Sailor Pluto's reincarnation, joins Uranus and Neptune in their mission to kill a mysterious girl named Hotaru Tomoe, whom they identify as the Guardian of Destruction Sailor Saturn. However, when Saturn awakens she joins the final fight against the main antagonists of the arc, the Death Busters, sacrificing her life in the process. With her newly obtained powers as Super Sailor Moon, Usagi restores the Earth and Hotaru is reincarnated as a baby.
The fourth arc explores the Sailor Guardians' dreams and nightmares when the villainous group Dead Moon Circus exploits the Guardians' deepest fears, invades Elysion (which hosts the Earth's Golden Kingdom), and captures its High Priest Helios, who turned into a Pegasus and tried to ask Guardians for help. This storyline also addresses Mamoru's relevance as protector of the Earth and owner of the Golden Crystal, the sacred stone of the Golden Kingdom. Mamoru and all ten of the reunited Guardians combine their powers, enabling Usagi to transform into Eternal Sailor Moon and defeat Dead Moon's leader, Queen Nehelenia.
In the final arc the Sailor Starlights from the Kinmoku system, their ruler Princess Kakyuu, and the mysterious little girl Chibi-Chibi join Usagi in her fight against Shadow Galactica, a group of both corrupted and false Sailor Guardians and led by Sailor Galaxia, who have been rampaging across the galaxy and killing other Sailor Guardians to steal their Star Seeds, Sailor Crystals—the essence of their lives. After Mamoru and all of the main Solar System Guardians are killed by Shadow Galactica, Usagi travels to the Galaxy Cauldron, the birthplace of all Star Seeds of the Milky Way, in an attempt to revive her loved ones and to confront Chaos, the source of all strife in the galaxy.
","It was a very lucky thing indeed that I stayed in watching Sailor Moon Crystal. The first season was the typical recruitment of the Inner Sailor Senshis and the second season honestly bored me, so I had second guessing whether I continue the series or not. But thankfully, I did. 
 
Because Sailor Moon Crystal S3 was WAY more magical than the first two. 
 
Story: 
 
The story for this season is very simple yet I quite enjoyed it, I don't know why but I just simply enjoyed. Very typical story of an impending doom. It has all been used by other anime after Sailor Moon but the story just gave me some sorta childhood feeling even though I did not watch a single episode of Sailor Moon back then.

Good thing they ditched the CGI transformation and amazingly the transformations scenes became quicker and quicker which I liked because the transformation sequence sometimes drag. The character design was vastly improved that you could almost say that this is a brand new one separate from season 1 and 2. Though sometimes the faces get a bit dopey and somehow makes me laugh at the most tragic moments, haha. 
 
Sound: 
 
The OP fits the story of Sailor Moon, it really gives the magical girl feel to the show, soft and graceful yet strong. The EDs were so beautiful, though sometimes the ED did not fit to the ending scene because of how lively it is. 
 
Character: 
 
They are suprisingly character developments in this show but they few inbetween. They aren't really unforgetful characters and they sometimes smell too ideal so yeah. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I enjoyed it very much, the fights, the sad scenes and the ending! 
 
Overall, I'm surely going to watch the season 4.

       Helpful Sailor Moon is a rare example of a story that benefits greatly from filler and a meandering pace. The original series from the 90s may not have followed the manga as closely as the new hotness, but in a weird twist, that actually greatly improved the quality of the show.  
 
Sailor Moon Crystal season 3 blasts through the manga faithfully, but loses much of the charm in the process. Whereas the original series gave ample time to develop each Sailor Scout's quirks and personality, SMC has only a hint of that charm. Season 3 is an improvement on the first two seasons, thanks in part to the pretty character designs of Akira Takahashi. It also makes token attempts at adding individuality to the characters, but  sets that aside in favor of plot progression. We miss the klutzy Usagi, the bookwormy Michiru, the temperamental Rei, the boisterous Makoto, and the goofy Minako. Instead we are left with stoic fighters in different colored skirts.  
 
While this series does a competent job at hitting plot points, the real magic of the Sailor Moon series comes from its lovable characters. Unfortunately, Crystal did not deliver enough in that area.

","The second season of Nisekoi, although the entire season feels more like a patchwork of OVA episodes with how sheerly sloppy some of this is. And this is coming from someone who thought that the previous OVA for the series was fantastically done and meaningful. 
 
Story 4/10: Although the story continues on the first seasons ""find the childhood promise girl"" that made it actually interesting... it instead focuses on the worst aspects of the first season and the source material. In otherwords, it stagnates for 12 episodes and gets literally nowhere in almost any way. Most of what is accomplished, could have been condensed into a single episode, if not half an episode. 
 
Then it has the audacity to introduce everyone-saw-it-coming plot twists and plot devices that otherwise stop anything from moving the story forward, but instead slow it down further. It even throws in scenes that directly contradict previous scenes or events. 
 
Art 7/10: Roughly the same as the first season, but noticeable improvements, mainly in image quality and consistency. 
 
Sound 7/10: It's a Slice-of-Life Romantic (comedy?) anime. Sound is one of the last things to be concerned about, although it needs to be(and is) passable. 
 
Character 6/10: Although the first season was rather fantastic with its character development, the second season however is not in regards to the MC. And it's not even the story or the characters fault, it's the authors for forcing such awkward, redundant, and contradictory scenes into the anime directly after the MC starts to get some reasonable and well deserved development. 
 
Characters other than the MC seem to get a great amount of development in the sense that you understand the different characters motivations and inner thoughts substantially more. Meanwhile the MC is sitting there brainwashing himself to believe something that, just simply put, isn't true anymore and he is in denial. Throughout the entire second season at that with no progression whatsoever for the MAIN CHARACTER. 
 
By far the best character is ""Shu"", who is working behind the scenes. By subtlety manipulating, giving vague but suggestive hints, and overall interfering with others who wish to interfere with the main plot themselves. Especially in the OVA. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10: Although it did fill the craving of wanting to see more Nisekoi, it ultimately made me somewhat regret watching it. It forced some of the worst aspects of the show to such a sheer extent that it was cringe worthy and I had a hard time NOT skipping these scenes. These scenes of course being those dreaded, incredibly awkward, and utterly ridiculous fawning scenes between Raku and Onodera. Especially when they purposely have the MC Raku monologue insults towards other characters simply for ""suggesting"" the truth to him previously, or insults his own inner thoughts that also suggest the truth. 
 
Overall 7/10: Not fantastic by any means, but it has substantial character development for everyone but the most important character. Which in turn will help understand any future seasons more, should they happen in the first place. There is almost enough source material for roughly 2 more seasons if you go by the seeming formula of skimming over 50ish chapters of the manga and picking pivotal moments to convert. So don't be surprised for another season of this, but at the same time don't expect it.  
 
The series still hasn't gotten much of anywhere until the more recent chapters, and these kinds of character development for the MC should have been taking place substantially earlier. The only other Anime/Media I've seen this in is extremely mainstream anime where they purposely try to distract the viewer with side-stories and forced plot-devices to distract from the fact that they are purposely dragging the series well past when it should have at least concluded the current story arc. 
 
The problem being that if you want to understand events further in the story, see and understand a characters offset behavior, or understand references/flashbacks/etc... You pretty much need to watch these 12 solid episodes of arbitrary filler material, or else suffer further down the line. It's like if an OVA had some of the most important information in the series and took place randomly inbetween episodes. You basically need to watch it, but you may not even know that it exists in the first place. Seeing as OVA's generally aren't bundled together in chronological order to the anime episodes. It would be largely upsetting to finally understand what happens after you see future events, and could very well change your outlook of the events afterwords. 
 
TL;DR - A must watch if you want to understand the story further down the line. You may not enjoy it, but you have to swallow your pride so that you don't regret it later.

          
 
       Helpful This is a complete downgrade from the first Nisekoi, season 2 with only 12 episodes and 90% of the episodes were complete filler with one episode being some magical girl crap that literally had no correlation to the story at all. 
 
I can see why they stopped at season 2 since they would have to do 5 seasons of pure filler if following the manga just to reach the ending... 
 
They should please the fan base, have last 12 episodes that is an alternative ending for Ichijou to end up with the person who truly deserves to be with him.....

          
 
       Helpful I was surprised by how much filler was in this. There was like 4 good episodes maybe? The arc with Chitoge's mom was good. Onodera's and Raku's past with each other is fleshed out in one episode. Everything else felt mediocre (not to mention those magical girl designs were ugly af...) and the thing that bugged me the most was the focus on minor/new characters that I didn't really care about. I'm also pretty tired of Chitoge hitting Raku, and he seems to be getting blander. There was basically no relationship development besides Chitoge's acknowledgment that she likes Raku. Onodera's little sister Haru was okay and got better, but she was stupidly judgemental and quick to conclusions for most of her screen time. Overall I guess I don't regret watching this but I wish shaft had used their time better. I think I would describe this season as cheap.

4,3784,87,7.251401512,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance,"When the threat of the Angel menace escalates, mankind's defense force is pushed to its limits, with Nerv at the forefront of the struggle. Shinji Ikari and his partner Rei Ayanami are assisted by two new pilots: the fiery Asuka Langley Shikinami and the mysterious Mari Illustrious Makinami. 
 
With the aid of their mechanized Evangelion units, equipped with weapons perfect for engaging their monstrous opponents, the four young souls fight desperately to protect their loved ones and prevent an impending apocalypse. But when startling secrets are brought to light, will the heroes' greatest challenge prove to be the monsters...or humanity itself? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mecha']","The Third Angel escapes its confinement and tries to break out of NERV's arctic Bethany Base, but Mari Illustrious Makinami, a new pilot, launches Evangelion Provisional Unit-05 and destroys the Angel by self-destructing the EVA and safely ejecting at the last moment.
Meanwhile, Shinji Ikari and his father Gendo visit mother and wife Yui's grave. Shortly after, the Seventh Angel attacks, but is quickly dispatched by the newly arrived Unit-02 and its headstrong pilot, Asuka Langley Shikinami. Ryoji Kaji delivers to Gendo a suitcase containing the mysterious ""Key of Nebuchadnezzar"" and notes that the destruction of Unit-05 went as planned. Gendo and Kozo Fuyutsuki then visit NERV's lunar compound, Tabgha Base, to view the construction of Evangelion Mark.06, which is noted as being different from the other EVAs. They are denied permission to land, but briefly see Kaworu Nagisa sitting in space without a space suit. During Gendo's absence, the Eighth Angel attacks Tokyo-3. Shinji, Asuka, and Rei kill it in an improvised plan devised by Misato Katsuragi. Both Unit-00 and Unit-01 are damaged. Gendo returns and asks to have them both repaired, but SEELE only allows the repair of Unit-01.
In an attempt to heal the relationship between Gendo and Shinji, Rei prepares a dinner party. At the same time, Mari arrives in Tokyo-3. Later, Unit-04 and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed during an experiment, prompting the U.S. government to send Unit-03 to Tokyo-3. Due to an international agreement that allows no more than three functioning Evangelions per country at a time, NERV seals away Unit-02 and schedules a test of Unit-03 on the same day as Rei's dinner party; Asuka volunteers to take Rei's place as the test pilot, to avoid the party. Once Asuka activates Unit-03, the Ninth Angel possesses the EVA and goes on a rampage. Shinji pilots Unit-01, but refuses to fight the Angel for fear of harming Asuka, who is still trapped inside. Gendo orders the activation of the Dummy System, which makes Unit-01 autonomous, and allows it to savagely destroy Unit-03, crushing the cockpit in its teeth. Emotionally wounded by his father's cold decision, Shinji leaves NERV.
Asuka survives, but is grievously injured and placed in quarantine for fear of mental contamination by the Angel. Shinji heads out of the city, but the Tenth Angel attacks, so he flees to an emergency shelter. Gendo fails to activate Unit-01 without Shinji, so Mari hijacks Unit-02 and heads out to fight the Angel alone. She removes Unit-02's limiters and launches an all-out attack, but the Angel severely damages Unit-02. Rei joins the fight with the damaged Unit-00 and charges at the Angel with a missile. The missile detonates, but fails to destroy the Angel. The Angel consumes Unit-00 and integrates it with its own body, allowing it to bypass NERV's defenses.
Upon seeing Rei consumed along with Unit-00, Shinji rushes to Gendo and asks to pilot Unit-01 again. Shinji fends off the Angel, but before he can defeat it, Unit-01 runs out of power and shuts down. Unit-01 reactivates in berserk mode in response to Shinji's rage at the loss of Rei. It easily takes down the Angel, and Shinji uses the EVA to reach inside the Angel's core to save Rei. Unit-01 then starts transcending its physical boundaries to grant Shinji's wish. At the moment Shinji retrieves Rei, Unit-01 pulls Unit-00's core out of the Angel. As they embrace, Shinji thanks Rei for her attempt to reconcile him with Gendo. She apologizes that it was not realized, but Shinji assures her it was okay. The Angel explodes and its remains, along with Unit-00's core, are absorbed into Unit-01, fusing them all into one being. Unit-01 then sprouts giant wings of light, and Misato, who has been watching the battle, sees that they are identical to the ones she saw during Second Impact. Ritsuko realizes that the EVA has become a divine being, triggering Third Impact and declares this to be the end of the world.
In a post-credits scene, a spear shoots down from the Moon and impales Unit-01 in the middle of its apotheosis, neutralizing it and stopping Third Impact. Kaworu then descends from the Moon in Mark.06, saying that this time, he will show Shinji true happiness.
","What is the worst anime of all times? What is the criteria to even consider, a piece of fiction to such an infamous title? Those are questions I hopefully can end up answering, while giving insight to the colossal mess, that is eva 2.0. Many will take certain approach with some reserves, a worst anime of all times discussion usually is only warranted to a certain type of titles. You probably know them by now, those ultra-trashy, low budget ovas, the likes of mars of destruction, skelter heaven, garzeys wing (at least that is because everybody flipped their shit, whenever I tried to argue shows like charlotte were the worst thing I have seen). And while those unanimous bad shows certainly are awful, I would never call them insulting. No one in the production of those were under the impression of making a great show, neither did anyone put any real effort to make it so, so why would I get mad over how bad the final product ended up being. There is no passion, no ambition on such projects, they are just lazily made projects, made in the hopes of getting a laugh or two, because of how bad they are. And those usually succeed on those low ambitions only.  There is nothing to grab here, nothing to get really angry or mad about. Such forgettable anime, no matter technically bad they can be, or how a lot of their individual’s elements are way worse than anything else, will never stand as a worst anime of all times list for me. 
 
And here I brought the discussion back to evangelion 2.0. I was not laughing, when watching, because of how awful all its aspects were. Like there are lots of things even I can admit where incredibly well made, this is a gorgeously well animated, greatly directed,with cool soundtrack, film. The action set pieces are completely stunning, the shot composition (as with anything hideaki anno makes) is superb.  
 
Neverthless the act of watching this was pure agony, I ended up scratching my face, facepallming and even screaming angrily at everything that was happening on screen. A this is not how this is supposed to be thought, crossing my mind at every moment and scene of the movie. Anyone that is reading this can probably guess by now, I am a diehard fan of the old neon genesis evangelion series, the old series and eoe, being my favorite piece of fiction ever created. It is such a personally important anime, for reasons, I hope I can in write in the future in a pretty fucking long essay. And after finishing those two, the most inspirational and important thing for me, I went and watched all 3 rebuilds that are out. However before anyone gets any funny ideas, no I do not dislike these movies simply for they are different(I am sorry, NGE is just so perfect doing things another way is usually wrong). I do not want these movies to simply be a scene by scene copy of the series, that would be completely pointless, Eva 1.0 was almost a carbon copy of the series original episodes, and that only made it passable at best. So let’s get into some specifics of why I loathe this movie.  
 
For starters, the characters  are not that interesting or fleshed out, especially when compared to its older series counterparts. Sure, in order to streamline this and make the material work as a movie, changes were inevitably going to be made considering, how unlike 1.0, this one actually, complicates the plot (a lot) and brings a lot new aspects that were absent in the original (surprise, none of that shit actually worked to its advantage). But really sacrificing a lot of the character depth in eva, in order to make room for more mecha action and plot oriented series? That is a low blown. Remember when we had this superbly made episode 4 of nge, that great such great insight to shinji’s character, and weight to his relation with Misato? FORGET ABOUT SUCH SHIT, because let me tell you, not only the characters on screen are not that interesting, their interactions are also shafted, there is not enough time dispensed to properly stablishes how every character reacts and affects each other, no relation feels organical or well developed. It all fells so artificial, like these are the works of a checklist, of the minimal things to do, in order to make the audience remotely care and understand the characters. For example, Asuka is on screen for a total of 8 minutes before falling in love with shinji, talk about contrived character writing. Again a lot of people will not agree on how serious of an issue this ends up being, having a more action heavy, almost blockbuster like formula of this movies is bound to appeal to a lot of people.  
 
But no, for me most of the appeal of eva was not in the mecha battle, even if those were undoubtedly entertaining to watch, nor in its cheese save the world plot. But in its flawed characters, that had to face not only a lot of pressure from the duty as pilots, but a lot of more universal and relatable personal issues. Like the pains and joys of human interactions, how said interactions may come to define us, our world views, how we see ourselves, how important it is to come on our own as an individual, make your own decisions and take responsibility for their consequences. And to be fair it is not like those ideas are absent in the movie, there is definitely an effort to allude and portray a lot of the same ideas. Though this ends up being mostly wasted effort, the protagonist we see on screen right now, is no longer that complex individual desperately struggling with his fear of rejection, and the fact he never acted upon any of his desires. Now all we end up having is a generic harem lead, that has chicks literally fighting to be his girlfriend. Asuka also really changed, long are gone the days where she was that self-centered bitch, that really needed confirmation from others, while at the same time isolating herself, a person that only defined her value in life for how good she was as a pilot. Currentely she is a generic tsundere, that only cares about the great Shinji Ikari. Anno even had the audacity of changing the iconic evangelion elevator scene, and change the dialogue, from rei’s view of herself, asuka's trauma with her mother and need of confirmation, to a literal fight about who should be shinji’s number 1 girl. Why would I care, or how could I relate to the themes in display , no matter how personally important they may be? How the fuck I am supposed to really relate to these characters? To make matters simpler, I did not like what they did to my Shinji, my misato, hated what they did to my gendo, and my god, Asuka, what did they do to you? 
 
Wish fulfillment and escapism are not terms of criticism I really like using against fiction. Those are so overused, because of the way how everything is labelled as such, the terms have lost a lot of their meaning over time. I will have to use those here, because very rarely I have seen something that was so transparent, about its intent of being a wish fulfillment fantasy. If you have any better way, to describe a show where our protagonist literally says, I do not care about the world, I just want to save this cute idealized version of human being, a perfect waifu, please let me know. The tone in here reminded me more of a school comedy if anything, with lots of its aspects, like the constant ecchi fanservice moment being awfully self-indulgent. Eva always had some of that shit, but 2.0 capitalizes on that by tenfold. And like I get it, presenting this perfect fantasy, of the average male being called out to save the world, and having lots of chick fall in love with him has a lot of thematic purpose in this story. It is that escapism tale, that eva questioned and ""deconstructed"", in its later half, by applying psychology and real world logic to a lot of its clichés. To what degree that is so innovative in mecha (if at all) is very debatable. It turns on its head such fantasy, and in turn brings back important questions of how the audience deals with reality (Are we running away from our problems?) and what purpose fiction has in your lives. So yeah I get what Anno was attempting, it is very deliberate how pandering this ends up feeling, maybe the escalation of those aspects serve to show how bolder, escapism has become in the decades after NGE's release. But it does not change how not worth, the final product ends up becoming, especially for someone that already got a lot of the same ideas, in a way more potent way before. I might end up giving it a pass for the whole rebuild saga, if the meta, franchise angle was well done in 3.0, but that sadly was not the case. 
 
The worst past of all of that is not even present in the movie. The fan reaction to it manages to even more annoying than the movie itself. Like whenever I see someone saying that they like this, because shinji finally acts like a man, I just want to lower my score for it even more. But that, and facts like how this lost that darker and depressive edge of the older series, how more prevalent the action scenes are, all seem to be hailed as great positives.  Many even start to argue to just skip the older series, which is pretty ironical, since there are lots of aspects specially in the next movie that will not make much sense if you skip the older series (you will still not get it even, with the context of both).  
 
Those opinions, I simply cannot stand that, like I know evangelion is a highly divisive series, but having this being put as a definitive version, something that makes NGE obsolete, is just so unacceptable  Really, I get why people like this, but every minute watching is nothing but a slog of seemling endless torture. Something feels very wrong in every scene, and by that fact alone I can easily say I find the so hated eva 3.0 to be a superior work. Sure 3.0 is in a lot of ways a clusterfuck, with a fairly incomprehensible plot, however I never got the same feeling. It feels like eva, it had concepts like Shinji facing alone the consequences of his actions, having to face the weight of killing the person he cared the most, that I could easily get behind, unlike anything in 2.0 or 1.0. So well done 3.0, for being the first competent imitation of the original's ideias and mindfucks, that actually had enough bold choices to add anything to EVA as a whole. 
I could keep complaining about every change this movie makes in the original plotline, But for someone who does not want a comparisson series, I sure talk a lot about those. Instead I want to argue, what is the point of this story. While 1.0 is somewhat understandable, as a new introduction for newer audiences that did not grow up with eva, and 3.0 brings up an entire new direction for the franchise, 2.0 is sadly lacking. Sure you could say the purpose was simply to make easily digestible self-indulgent nonsense, that bridges the gap between those two, but outside of that I got nothing. This is such pointless and mostly derivative nonsense. 
 
In the middle of all of this, a silver line of hope exists. I am talking about the sequel theory of course, the controversial fan theory, that the rebuilds are actually sequels to the original. It may give an entirely new way to approach these characters, and story. Like the more extreme ways the character’s act in 2.0 could be seen as a natural development of their personalities, it may also give an in series importance to how pedantic a lot of it feels, representing Shinji falling even further into escapism after failing to accept reality after EOE. It retroactively may give some value to some of the things I am complaining about. As for me I would be really surprised if that was not the case, there are way too many fucking hints at the rebuilds actually being a sequel, to the point it will be kind of a surprising twist for me, if that ends up not being the case. Regardless I will wait for 4.0 to make any form of final judgement on that. And of course this will never redeem 2.0 in my eyes, but hey, It will become better than what we have right now. 
 
So those are the reasons for me thinking of this as my worst anime of all times. I am of strong belief, that the individual aspects of a series have no value in, and of themselves. It is how they add up to create the enjoyment, the experience is how I rate and judge fiction, so no, I do not believe this should be rated at least a 5 for its fantastic technical aspects, or soundtrack. Animation is completely worthless without a great story, a vision, passion and a desire to express ideas. Maybe even all of that alone may not add up to a good show, since with some ideas I have this inherit prejudice with. And maybe that is all there is towards my hate of 2.0, but hopefully, I could be more insightful than that. Lastly I would like to add that yes I do recommend 2.0. Despite my eternal grievances with it, if you did not like, or just did not care much about NGE, definitely give this is a watch. I hope you end up having a better time.

       Helpful I just finished watching the original TV series for the first time two days ago and I can safely say that You Can (Not) Advance far surpasses the equivalent episodes, which were by far my least favorite of the series (we wont count 25 and 26). Amazingly, the improved animation, the new characters, and the changes to the story (big and small) all combine to focus the viewer's attention on positive relationships that bring the characters together and ultimately lie at the heart of Evangelion. The original series completely failed to draw the viewers attention to these relationships because it spent so much screen time focused on self hatred and self loathing. In Eva 2.0 ever change, the cuts and the additions, serves to push the negativity to the background. It keeps the pain real without alienating the viewer like the original. I'm almost inclined to say that the improvements make 1.0 look a poorly edited and rushed (of course they've had a decade to get it right).  You absolutely do not need to have seen any of the old versions to enjoy You Can (Not) Advance.  Whether the viewer has seen the original or not, Eva 2.0 will have a bigger emotional impact on them precisely because it focuses on being together and fighting together as a team. The painful moments are there, but they are no longer the focus. You actually feel good when you finish You Can Advance. 
 
Animation:  Even on a cam rip, the quality of the animation excellent.  When 3d rendering is used it integrates well with the normal animation.  The animation does its job and makes sure you don't notice it unless you're supposed to. 
 
Sound: It is hard to give sound a fair review when listening to a recording of the actual sound, that said there was nothing wrong with the sound, oh except for that sounds in space thing (nerd). 
 
Music:  The music takes what would otherwise be a good film and raises it to the next level, strengthening the emotion the director wants you to feel. 
 
Characters:  Without a doubt the subtle changes to the characters actions from the original make all the characters more real and whole.  I had trouble finding anything likable about many of them in the original, but in this rendition  one can actually have sympathy for them.  Also Mari, but I don't think I need to say much beyond that she will hit you like a rocket powered freight train. 
 
Story: Major departures from the original here, but they all work beautifully to develop the characters where the original completely failed.  I am interested to see where Anno decides to take us next.  Some new viewers may dislike how certain plot points blaze by without much explanation, but it prevents the film from getting bogged down in back story. 
 
Editing: Personally I think this is where most of the magic happens in Eva 2.0.  The timing of all the scenes is just long enough (no more eternal elevator scene for example) to get the point across without frustrating the viewer.  The film flows very smoothly with only one or two brief points of agitation.

       Helpful I'll just start by saying this anime really isn't worth your time. It's only 3 episodes though, so you might sit through it just for the sake of seeing what a truly mediocre anime looks like. Or maybe just to add another number to your list. 
 
The plot was pretty weak. Actually, I don't even know what the plot was. This was basically just a short scenario with the typical boy meets girl setup, boy and girl have feelings for each other, followed by boy remembering that he promised to marry girl when they were 5 (or thereabout. and for some reason it's always the guy that forgets, whereas the girl always remembers). I understand that promises are important and all in Japanese culture (actually, where aren't they? ), but there are some promises you just don't bother keeping because they're so frivolous (and we all know that children aren't half as psychologically developed as many anime make them out to be). And at that, such minor things that happened at that young of an age would probably be soon forgotten anyways, rather than used years later to try and get a girl who is out of your league (in this case, the characters were all average enough that it doesn't actually apply here, where it often does in typical harems with better visuals. +1 point for being somewhat realistic by using some of the most average characters I've ever seen). 
 
I used to think of Happiness! as a stereotypical generic anime, but I enjoyed it a little. This, however, is much more generic. Nothing about this anime was really done right, or particularly wrong for that matter, it just didn't do much of anything. There wasn't really a point. It's a love story that's not really heartwarming or dramatic. It's boring. 
 
Visually, it's also generic. At first I attributed this to age, since I assumed it was pretty old (like early 90s or before). You know what they say about assumptions though. But anyways, I was wrong. There's no excuse for the bland visuals, given that this was actually produced in 2003. You're sure to find countless others produced around that time that actually have respectable visuals and animation. Which brings me to the next point: this anime had mediocre animation too. Generally, it wasn't really an issue (it's not like there was much animation going on anyways), but there were parts where the animators were just plain lazy. From the looks of this anime, the production budget was probably so low that they weren't getting paid enough to motivate them to work in the first place. So I'll excuse the bad animation out of pity for the overworked and underpaid animators that had to waste their time on this one. 
 
Now for the characters, the part I pay the most attention to by far in an anime. Short story shorter: they were flat. In fact, I've probably drawn on paper with more dimension. The emotions were also poorly done and didn't feel natural. This was probably mostly due to the voice acting, which wasn't particularly bad, but wasn't particularly good either. Just bland. There was the girl from the library though. She was hitting on him like it was nobody's business (I don't even know why she was there. It was totally random). Who does that? But that automatically made her the most dynamic character (not that that's saying much. it's pretty sad when a random insert character has more personality than the important ones).  
 
Because of my previously mentioned assumption that the show was kind of old (I don't generally bother to look at the date before watching something), I had given the sound some undeserved leeway. It's poor. None of the music was even slightly memorable. Have you ever watched an old VHS and noticed the sound is a little distorted? That's exactly what this sounds like. 
 
Enjoyment wasn't present. They could have at least attempted some cheap humor (there were a couple chances where it could have been easily done. This anime still wouldn't have earned more than a 5 from me that way, but it still would have been an improvement). Needless to say, I'm glad it was only 3 episodes. 
 
I don't think I used the word generic enough times in this review to qualify my opinion of this anime.

","“Forbidden Love” 
 
It’s all about forbidden love…  A high-school student living together and already married with his physics teacher will keep their secret from everyone until the right time comes. 
 
Story:  
 
The introduction in every episode is somewhat irritating. In every episode they encounter difficulties on how they will hide their relationship to others, as the story goes on it’s becoming repetitive and boring, and at the end they live quietly and happily ever after, and then poof ‘fin’…  It’s a kind of simple family composed with somewhat simple characters to begin with, nothing very exciting happens rather it’s very quite simple.  
 
The other view in this anime is that Asami Onohara (the student) always trying to seduce Kyosuke Ichimaru (the teacher) that leads to failure each time so I’m tired on watching and waiting for it. It lacks on story development, a slow and somewhat boring story to watch on although this series tries to gather some viewers from its ecchi scenes, but I think it’s a failure. 
 
Characters: 
 
The main characters are daring and timid that doesn’t develop and doesn’t make any sense at all. Still, the other supporting characters somewhat add some twist to the story though it’s not enough to excite me, to sum them up it lacks on character development. 
 
Animation: 
 
The animation is quite simple and nothing to impress on just like its art. 
 
Sound:  
 
The OP is like a children song so I skipped it always while the ED is quite normal and simple, nothing to excite.  
 
Enjoyment:  
 
If you're seeking for some great enjoyment don’t watch this because it awfully lacks on everything, but there are few scenes that I somewhat like. 
 
Overall: 
 
It’s a great mess, such disappointment and a sadly attempt as an anime. There’s nothing special on it, it bores me sometimes though it’s quite interesting in the beginning but at the end, it’s a failure. Many unanswered questions that was left behind at the end. 
 
It’s a kind of anime that may people watch when they’re not feeling well.

          
 
       Helpful Look I'll be upfront about it. It's dross. Not even the kind of turn your brain off and take a vacation dross that I call ""mental junk food"" like say Infinite Stratos, but like Infinite Stratos I was surprisingly enthused with this, not quite to IS levels, but impressive for it's genre. The title had me expecting a sub par anime based on an ero-manga I hadn't read. Instead I got an average to above average for genre anime based on an ero-manga I hadn't read. 
 
Story: 
An interesting concept at least, and handled at least semi-seriously in a rare turn of events. Sure Asami's focused on getting some nookie out of her hubby when all the universe and the gods of luck are actively preventing them, but really the focus in the anime is kept tight on our forbidden young married couple and how they react and respond. There's some middlin drama, and some cringe worthy moments that will have the relationship experienced amongst you yelling at the screen like an old lady watching her soaps. (Or maybe that's just me). I came to actually enjoy our lead's relationship, and it could be quite sweet at moments. If anything the things that bothered me were things not covered. 
 
Art: 
It's standard issue, but not bad per say. Just common. Run of the mill. 
 
Sound: 
Same. Some music was really well used here and there, voice acting's crisp and clean with reasonable performances for the material. 
 
Character: 
As with the art and music, boilerplate with some stand out moments. Asami can be surprisingly sweet, and the character comes off as being earnest, as does the husband, which is nice for an anime couple. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Like I said at the start, I rather liked it. It's not a bad little time sink and bridges the gap between ecchi and a romcom in a more positive manner then I've seen before.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Futari Ecchi meets (a reverse) Onegai Teacher in a different twist of the genre. The series finished up, but still left some unanswered questions laying around.  The series live up to the potential that it had and even though it does have a lot of fan service, it&rsquo;s of a tolerable nature. I am glad to see that they are staying somewhat close to the manga, but it did not (so far) follow the manga exactly. The manga has some rather sexually explicit chapters in its later volumes (especially volume 5). In that way it is similar to Futari Ecchi's manga (another personal favorite). For once, I am rather satisfied with an Avex Mode produced show, which is hard to believe after the mess of the Ichigo 100%'s anime.

Thinking it would look cute on a bracelet, she goes to pick up the rock and discovers a creature named Kappy. Kappy happens to be the three-year-old prince of Kapimeshia. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']",none,"The anime is about the everyday lives of this little girl named Suguri Kinoshita. Her life is not so normal though because she lives with a magical pet named Kappy that has magical powers. The anime mostly revolve around normal everyday stuff like baking, cleaning or playing in the park and it has normal everyday problems like a balloon stuck in a tree, doing your chores or having fights with your friends. These problems are resolved though by having Kappy use his magic powers. The anime usually ends with a happy note after Kappi saves the day but other times, some trouble brews because of his interference. There is nothing groundbreaking in the anime though. The story is simple, there is no strong conflict and the flow of the events is predictable. It’s just a very bright colored five minute anime about fluff episodes. 
 
As the anime progresses, it introduces new characters with magical powers. The episodes usually involve the new characters, magical as well and related to Kappi, stirring up trouble and having Kappi use his powers to save the day. Once again, there is nothing really huge. It’s light hearted and cute. I can’t really expect much from a kiddie show that runs for five minutes. 
 
The characters in the anime are all fluff as well. They’re friendly and nice and caring like what you’d expect from a kiddie anime. Some characters are a bit unruly but the cuteness still dominates. The two main characters are pretty bland. Suguri is the typical girl that happens to have a magical pet. There is just enough of her personality to fill in the gaps of the five minutes. The same goes for Kappy. He’s laidback, cute, funny, and loves to eat donuts. That’s basically it and they remain the same from start to finish. 
 
I do admire how much the anime has achieved in the span of five minutes. Including the OP and ED, there is actually a decent amount of story in the episodes. There’s a conflict and a decent resolution to them. Don’t expect much though because the anime caters for kids. Everyone in the anime is friendly and the anime is predominantly made of cakes and butterflies.

A lone mysterious female warrior, known to others as Emeraldas sails the endless planets of the universe- in her Seas of Star ship- fighting the tyranny of that merciless race. She is tormented by the memory of her lost love. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","The storyline follows a young boy named Hiroshi Umino (海野広) who sneaks aboard a freighter in order to leave Earth. As the freighter is flying through space they are attacked by an Afressian ship bearing the Skull and Crossbones insignia. However, the train is saved by a mysterious and incredibly powerful spaceship (which also bears the insignia) and is able to make it to their destination, a desert planet with a Western atmosphere, complete with saloons and bar fights. The boy meets up with another stowaway, an old man, and becomes friends with him. He tells the old man that he came to the planet in order to become a stronger individual. He gets himself a job in a bar with the roughest reputation on the planet to prove himself.
When the attacking ship, led by Captain Eldomain (エルドメイン大佐), lands on the planet to search for whoever attacked him, Emeraldas appears to confront him, demanding that he remove the insignia from his ship; ""Only two ships have the right to bear it!""  In the second episode, after a final confrontation with Eldomain and later with Queen Baraluda (女王バラルーダ), of Arfess (アルフレス), Emeraldas presents Hiroshi with the Cosmo Dragoon once owned by Tochiro.
Another divergence from the manga takes place here when Emeraldas states that there are five Cosmo Dragoons in existence (hers and the ones owned by Tochiro, Captain Harlock, Tetsuro and Maetel), whereas in the manga there are only four. Later, Hiroshi Umino and his elderly friend visit a planet whose inhabitants have been forced out by a murderous cyborg. This cyborg killed one of the planet's inhabitants and drove his son mad. Umino meets the son and his sister and with their help and Emeraldas', he kills the oppressive cyborg.
While the story can stand on its own, independent of Matsumoto's other works, it mostly assumes that the viewer has seen the other Harlock titles, especially Galaxy Express 999 (the TV series and the movies), which featured Maetel, Emeraldas' sister, but had the occasional appearance of Emeraldas (Note: Maetel, for some reason in the English dub is referred to as Mataire). The story of Queen Emeraldas is set five years after the events of the final Galaxy Express 999 movie and was designed to give Matsumoto's fans a further glimpse into what became of Emeraldas. However, of the other characters, most are only mentioned in passing, except for Captain Harlock who has a brief cameo appearance.
Queen Emeraldas first two episodes were produced by OLM, Inc. and licensed for American distribution by ADV Films, being one of their earlier releases on the DVD format.  Those two episodes also have regular runs on the Action Channel. In Japan, the remaining two episodes were produced by MAC (Multi Access Company) and were released the following year after the initial two, indicating that a separate contract (that is not yet forthcoming) would be required for anyone to license the concluding episodes of the story outside Japan.
","As one of the more mysterious and sufficiently badass women residing in the vast Leijiverse, her boundaries as a side-character rarely failed to aggravate me in her various cameos as the sincere fanboy I identify myself as. I'm talking about the space pirate Emeraldas who had to wait for 1998 to come before she finally got an OVA of her own. I just finished watching it and hopefully this review will provide a considerably more objective assessment than my rampaging fanboyism logically would allow.  
 
Story: 5/10 
 
The Leiji Matsumoto pattern has made it clear that a young and ambitious male protagonist is likely to emerge whenever a story needs to be told and Queen Emeraldas proves to be no exception. This time, the tale concerns Hiroshi Umino who ironically gets more screen-time than the titular character herself. Basically, the story is comprised of a series of coincidental encounters these two characters have with each other and the opponents they more or less face co-operatively as Umino aspires to grow stronger and explore the universe in the liberal spirit he shares with Galaxy Express 999's Tetsuro.  
 
I'd like to make it clear that this OVA seems to exist in order to provide some background information on a popular heroine and as such does not bother too much on developing its narrative. There is a troublesome lack of continuity present and it seems like Umino's repeated meetings with Emeraldas are just random plot devices created to establish a friendly relationship based on coincidence. All in all the story is not particularly strong but comes off as decent. 
 
Animation: 6/10 
 
For the first time I got to witness a Leijiverse title with detailed scenery, fluid movement and wonderful character designs. A most welcome delight! Queen Emeraldas applies a few instances of horrible CGI but generally maintains a great and stylistic approach that qualifies to the contemporary standards. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
Emeraldas was apparently deemed awesome enough to get her own theme song and, musical appeal aside, it does match her personality and epic characteristics quite a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is decent but seems to be a lot more timid. 
 
As far as voice acting goes, the two protagonists are portrayed in praise-worthy manners and Emeraldas in particular has the virtue of being voiced by the same woman who starred as Oscar from Rose of Versailles.  
 
Characters: 7/10 
 
Sigh. Assigning a 7 to the ""character section"" of an anime in which one of my favourite characters of fiction resides doesn't quite seem right. However, as much as I'd like to call Queen Emeraldas character-driven, even that term feels strangely out of place. There's nothing particularly wrong with the characterization, it's just that there isn't any in abundance. We get to witness Emeraldas's inner feelings; her motives and a past that has shaped her as the cynical heroine she has become. But those who watched Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express already knew those things about her and little of the material is actually new. Then there's the modernized Tetsuro and a few diabolic villains that create a diversity that's not as amazing as expected. 
 
All in all, the characters in this OVA aren't bad at all (look at the 7 damnit!) but given that most titles in the Leijiverse seem to be character driven, it certainly doesn't reach the standard. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Despite my harshness I'd like to emphasize that I greatly enjoyed this title as an opportunity to watch one of my favorite heroines show off in a story that seems to be designed in favor of her awesomeness. It quite accurately falls into the ""Guilty pleasure"" category with a heavy focus on space battles and fencing but still reaches at least mediocre heights of story-telling and disappointing yet sufficient character portraits. Recommended to somewhat initiated Matsumoto fans but might not work quite as well as a gateway drug.

          
 
       Helpful It's hard to really write a review, the last 2 OVA ep3-4. Are hard to find items.. in any form. For what was seen ep1-2.  This is worth the ownership, Great if a fan of any of the Harlock-Galaxy 999 Fans.  Again i feel i can not write a true review untill i see ep3-4

          
 
       Helpful I’m going to start off this review with a disclaimer: If you’re thinking about using this OVA as a starting point for getting into Captain Harlock, turn away right now. With that said, for anyone who’s already a fan you’ll probably enjoy this OVA just because it’s loosely Harlock related and that you’ve probably come to expect very little from anything beyond the original series anyway. 
 
First off, the few good things the series has: 
 
1. The story. Despite the shortcomings of basically everything else, the story itself is actually quite good. The series has great pacing, fun characters, and an interesting overarching plot.  
 
2. The action sequences. Although a little uninspired the fighting throughout is some of the best in Harlock. There are cosmo guns, gravity sabres, cloaking fields, energy shields, lasers, missiles, space battles, and a giant robot horse. 
 
Now, onto the bad: 
 
1. It’s not actually about Emeraldas. Despite what the title may have lead you to believe the series is actually about a young boy named Hiroshi who dreams of building his own spaceship. Emeraldas acts as his watchful guardian and that’s about it. If you were thinking you’d get to finally see a series with some focus on Harlock’s most alluring and mysterious ally you were wrong. 
 
2. Being an OVA you might assume its self-contained, well it’s not. The series doesn’t end on a cliff hanger or anything but it’s pretty obvious the plot was intended to continue on. 
 
3. The animation sucks (kind of). The first two episodes are pretty solid but the studio was switched halfway through and the latter 2 episodes are visibly worse. Especially the characteristic Leiji Matsumoto eyes which the second studio never seemed to get right. The series also has a penchant for 90’s 3D animation which I assume was all the rage at the time but now looks hilariously bad. 
 
4. The dialogue is terrible. By the end of this 4 episode OVA I estimate you will have heard Emeraldas say “I am Emeraldas” about 14 times. I don’t know what happened but the show really fell flat in this regard. 
 
Ultimately this is a series that you should only watch when you’ve exhausted all other Harlock options. In that regard it’s enjoyable enough, I certainly didn’t hate it but it leaves a lot to be desired. The real tragedy however is simply pondering what could have been. Emeraldas was a fairly underdeveloped character before this OVA and she continues to be afterward but it’s obvious they were setting up for something big. I’ll let you see how it plays out but there’s a lot of foreshadowing and then it seems to end before it even really gets started.

       Helpful This is my first review, so I hope it's good enough. 
 
Before you watch this series, I suggest to watch Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded, the remake of the original series' 27th episode. You can also watch Inazuma Eleven: Outer Code before or along with this series to learn the perspective of other teams in the series. With that said, I'll start my review. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The plot is set on a parallel timeline one year after the altered 27th episode. The story is somewhat boring, as there is basically no emphasis on the actual title, ""Ares no Tenbin"". 
Simply put, this series just introduced a set of new characters and remake of some the original characters, to play in Football Frontier. This could be good but the execution is quite bland. 
However, the series tried to make three perspectives along the Football Frontier, through the main characters Asuto, Haizaki, and Nosaka. I believe Haizaki and Nosaka were developed nicely, but Asuto was very underdeveloped. Unlike the original series' core main Endou Mamoru, this series' core main Inamori Asuto is not attachable. I decide to give the story 7/10. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art of the series is different from the original series and the GO series, but still quite nice. I enjoyed the original art the best. I decide to give the art 8/10. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The sound effects were nice and the both opening and the ending songs wasn't bad. The animation of the songs follow the usual stream of openings and endings of Inazuma Eleven series. I decide to give the sound 8/10. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The characters... is what I want to discuss most. The Inakuni Raimon team character development is horrible. You don't feel attached like the original series to just Asuto, but the entire team. Everyone in the main team was underdeveloped until later episodes. The captain never stood out until later in the series, ironically being the captain. Very few characters has slight development and the rest have almost none. The only character in Inakuni Raimon that was good was their coach, that isn't even in the team. 
However, most of teams outside Inakuni Raimon were wonderfully developed despite their brief appearances. I decide to give the character 7/10. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
With all the above said, I enjoyed the matches almost as much as the original series. Even though this series involved quite a lot of normal shots which is a new thing in the line of the entire series, it is very enjoyable. I decide to give the enjoyment 9/10. 
 
Overall: 8/10

Oh no, no more football. Oh no, my mother died. Guess I have to play football because she's dead. 
Let's also add a chinese man with slanted eyes and he also does kungfu. A guy that says gosu in every sentence because, uh, unique speech pattern. The dude also scrubs a good wall. Oh and that chinese looking fella boyo, key man, I guess?

The reason why the 3rd one is my favorite is for the simple fact that we get to enjoy 3 lovely boys instead of 1 showing us various ways of enjoying themselves and new ways of exploring their summer and enjoying their youth at it's fullest. 
This series of 3 OVA's show's how friendship is one of the most important things in life, having someone to support you in your ''hardest'' times is what all young boys nowadays need. 
I plan on watching this with my significant other one day.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, if you don't have a thing for Shota and Bl, then you really should NOT be here. The Pico series is full to the brim with it, and if you haven't figured that out by now, you should start paying attention. 
 
Now personally, I'm a big fan of shota, so it was a fine surprise to see the character design for this production was very nice. Someone did their homework on the anatomy of little boys~ 
You can bet there's a type for every Shota fan out there too, 
 
The sweet quiet one with a hidden agenda, 
The tough, scrapped up, angry boy, 
and the charming and gorgeous little boy who looks like a little girl. 
 
The voices were also cute, and matched every boy very well. The story was unique and original for a 'Yaoi' so you don't have to sit through another boring repeat of something you've already experienced. And if you've watched the other stories in the Pico series, you must know that the intercourse involved is quite intricate and graphic, be well aware of that and be sure to keep the volume down, or have earphones in if you want to be confidential. However there is no uncensored version of any episode in the series, and try as you might but finding it uncensored even in Raw will prove to be quite difficult, so try to grin and bare it until one is released. 
 
All in all this is a very enjoyable OVA for all of you Shota and maybe even Loli fans out there, if you take the time to watch it, you will be pleased. 
This is also the last episode in the series, if you've watched the others, it would be uncouth if you just skipped over this one.

Overall: 
Pico x CoCo x Chico is an excellent anime, that will provide you as much entertainment as your sexual appetite for little boys allows. God has left us, there is nothing left but demons, crawling through Hell waiting for their chance to rise up to Earth. 
 
Story: 
It doesn't need one, therefore it doesn't have one. The very definition of utilitarianism. 
 
Art: 
Watching kids touching each others genitals has never been this beautiful. 
 
Sound: 
Better than Pupa. 
 
Character: 
Pico is as good as always, and even though Chico drags things down, Coco is a welcome addition to the team. The producers acknowledge that in the title, by putting Chicos name last. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Am I legally allowed to say that this aroused me? 
In the first one, there were ice cubes being shoved into Picos asshole. In the second, Chicos sister masturbates with a banana and Chico uses a dog paw vibrator on Pico. I'm saddened to say that in this one, they have toned it down. The really weird shit was kept to a minimum, instead they focus more on the boys just plain fucking.

4,28297,94,7.111350992,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Ore Monogatari!!,"With his muscular build and tall stature, Takeo Gouda is not exactly your average high school freshman. However, behind his intimidating appearance hides a heart of gold, and he is considered a hero by the boys for his courage and chivalry. Unfortunately, these traits do not help much with his love life. As if his looks are not enough to scare the opposite sex away, Takeo's cool and handsome best friend and constant companion Makoto Sunakawa easily steals the hearts of the female students—including every girl Takeo has ever liked. 
 
When Takeo gallantly saves cute and angelic Rinko Yamato from being molested, he falls in love with her instantly, but suspects that she might be interested in Sunakawa. With his own love for Yamato continuing to bloom, Takeo unselfishly decides to act as her cupid, even as he yearns for his own love story. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","The story follows Takeo Gōda, a tall and muscular high school student who does not have much luck with women, as every girl he likes ends up falling for his best friend, Makoto Sunakawa, who is charming and good-looking. This all changes when he saves Rinko Yamato, a petite shy girl who, above all other expectations, falls in love with Takeo, beginning a unique love story.
","Ore Monogatari!! is a series that looks unconventional at first glance but a second look reveals that it adheres to every trope of romance animes. 
 
Plot arcs with misunderstanding as the foundation? Check. 
Third parties? Check. 
Impossibly optimistic leads? Check. 
Unsubstantial episodic fluff? Check. 
 
The characters are also not Ore Monogatari!!'s strengths. Takeo's unconventional looks for a male shoujo lead feels gimmicky. While it's true that he was ridiculed by the girls he liked back then, it was glossed over and the series portrayed him as a someone who is much loved by everyone. Swap him to a bland looking guy  but retain his behavior and we will still get the same results. Suna is the most interesting character in the series for being observant while emotionally distant but was not given proper development. Yamato was not given much task aside from being cute and a doting girlfriend. 
 
You cannot also rely on the show's humor as it borders too much on slapstick or events which require the audience's suspension of disbelief (Takeo's blissful ignorance of a 'university exclusively for females' and the restaurant incident.) There are also some episodes that are reminiscent of countless romantic anime before and bore the heck out of the viewers. 
 
No major conflict occurred in this series which might shake Yamato and Takeo's relationship. What we received is their daily fluff that while admittedly sweet, is never substantial. Yet to dismiss Ore Monogatari!! as bland is also not warranted as it shows occasional moments of excellence. 
 
The musical score of Ore Monogatari!! was one of the year's most moving and was used in perfect timing with emotional scenes. The voice actors also did their best (although Takeo sounds grating at times) to bring these characters to life. Ore Monogatari!! is also a rare case where the ED is much better than the OP. 
 
When it gets its groove, it really stands out. In Ore Monogatari!!'s defense, it only took three episodes before Takeo and Yamato became a couple in the most awkward yet endearing way possible. The poignant scenes in this series are really moving and hit the right spot for shoujo junkies. The couple's technically second kiss counts as one of the finest moment of 2015. However, episodes revolving the side characters (Suna's sister, Shijou and Yamato's friend) and Suna are the better representatives of this genre for being believable and well-developed characters.  
 
These flashes of brilliance do not absolve this series for playing too safe and for following religiously to the tropes which made the shoujo genre dull.  So probably, maybe, it will be a long time before a series can dethrone Kimi Ni Todoke as my most favorite conventional shoujo series.

Story: 2 
The first few episodes were really good because it was something different (from what I've seen). An unpopular guy amongst girls, who's not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl's feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins... 
Or so I had hoped. 
 
I should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both like each other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on. So the focus then shifts to other people and their relationships but it's executed quite boringly. When the focus is back onto their relationship you can always expect Takeo to misunderstand, overreact or ""SUKI DA"". 
 
 
 
Art: 7 
It felt a bit like it was a children's anime in that the backgrounds were just very bright, watercoloured and simple. The girls were drawn quite oddly and I wasn't fond of that. 
 
 
 
Sound: 7 
Didn't like the OP, didn't like the ED, voice acting was standard. 
 
 
 
Character: 2 
Well what can I say, they so simple that I only need 1 line for each character. 
 
Takeo - Misunderstands, always resolves issues, ""SUKI DA~~~~"".  
 
Suna - Single, good looking guy that gets all the girls attention and needs to instruct Takeo on how to do anything related to relationships. 
 
Yamato - Likes baking, get flustered when she's thinking of Takeo, always nice towards other people. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment: 3 
After the first few eps, it becomes tedious to even watch it while eating. If you want to watch it, watch it for the first few eps then don't bother because they will basically be the same. 
 
 
 
Overall: 4 
Most overrated anime this season. Starts of great then becomes 'mystery meat' stew where you basically know you're getting one of few choices and where each choice is bad in itself.

          
 
       Helpful I was reluctant at first to watch this thinking it was just a dumb anime to waste your time for, but I never been so wrong. I tried it and it was one of the best anime I've seen so far. It actually has a similar theme with beauty and the beast .  The bromance between Gouda and Suna has real feels on it and the relationship between Yamato and Gouda is just pure and absolutely sweet. I highly recommend this anime if you want to have an ear to ear smile and feels after watching it. I really enjoyed this series and would not even bother to rewatch it again someday.

For Mashiro, however, serialization is just the first step. Having promised to marry his childhood sweetheart and aspiring voice actress, Azuki Miho, once his manga gets an anime adaptation, Mashiro must continue his to popularize Ashirogi's work. A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka—including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda—both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit.

Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga.

LA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and ""near masterpiece"" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry. 
 
LA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacency and honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all. 
 
 Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it. 
 
Bakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!. 
 
Bakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way. 
 
In terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman. 
 
The animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great ""in-universe manga details"" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected. 
 
Without a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a ""near masterpiece"" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these ""characters"" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime? 
 
LA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!

          
 
       Helpful I have just dropped after completing episode 6. I enjoyed season 1, although not spectacular, it was a story with meaning. it was about two friends with a shared goal struggling for their dreams. The downside was the love interest, lets get together after we succeed. In my mind a relationship is tested with the lows more then the highs, struggle together surely. But i believed this was more to do with culture, my own being wildly different to the protagonists. 
 
Season 2 started up OK, i didn't understand why they would change the editor. The new assistants while not good were not bad either, flavorless is what comes to mind. Where i object is the hospitalization and this absolute obsession with work and the handling of it. Hes collapsed while in hospital, clearly in pain and his love interest objects to a nurse being called and hands him his markers. His uncle died of overwork, surely he should know better then anyone that health matters. Maybe if i were 10 years younger i could overlook this, but as an adult it doesn't sit right with me.

          
 
       Helpful Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second. 
 
The first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story. 
The second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12 episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside. 
 
Art I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end. 
 
Sound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about. 
 
Character, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = = 
 
Enjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again. 
 
Overall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is. 
 
Those who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too. 
 
Those who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed. 
 
Those who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.

Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it has been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (スカブ・コーラル, Sukabu Kōraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (コーラリアン, Kōrarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are:
Command Cluster Coralian
The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its ""body"". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state.
Kute-class Coralian
A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels.
Antibody Coralians
Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z.
Human-form Coralians
Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them.
Trapar waves and lifting
In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (トランサパランス・ライト・パーティクル, Toransaparansu Raito Pātikuru), dubbed Trapar (トラパー, Torapā) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for ""lifting"" (リフティング, Rifutingu, or ""reffing"", according to some fan translations, as well as official translations in some countries) is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called ""reflection boards"" (""ref boards"" (リフボード, Rifubōdo) for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar—massive humanoid fightercraft—are a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral.
The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. 
An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the ""Amita Drive"", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the ""Seven Swell Phenomenon"". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.
","My biggest worry going into this was about the rumor that they were going to add original footage about Adroc Thurston and the Summer of Love. One of the key thematic arcs of the show was Renton's feelings of resentment for his father's reputation as a hero, having to live in the shadow of someone who lived this exciting life and became a hero to the entire world. We never got to see the Summer of Love in the show, so the gravity of what Adroc did got to be filled in by our imagination. How could they actually depict Adroc's sacrifice and make it stand up next to our imagination? 
 
By showing us just the last hours of his life and filling them with a million explosions as the world goes to fucking shit all around the main characters. 
 
The strategy of not explaining the complete nature of the Summer of Love or Adroc's part in the creation of the Silver Box that caused the Seventh Swell we see didn't just preserve the mystery of Adroc that is so core to the show: it accentuated them. Now we get to have our cake, this action-packed climax to the man's life, and eat it to by knowing just the right amount more about what occurred, such that the original show isn't tarnished. Not only is this a 10/10 masterpiece, it makes the original 10/10 masterpiece even better by proxy. 
 
But that's just the first 20-30 minutes or so. What the movie is actually about is Renton's relationship with Charles and Ray. I can't properly describe you the emotional swell I felt as the realization dawned on me that this wasn't going to be a straight rehashing of the show. The first part of this trilogy is a stylish re-edit of my favorite arc from one of my favorite shows of all time. I could cry. It was so beautiful to see, even if the 4:3 aspect ratio is outdated next to the widescreen of the opening and the remastered animation is still quite obviously TV-quality, not modern film quality. But what should we have expected? Bones to animate the sides of the frames so that all the scenes could be in widescreen while all the action was in 4:3? Nah. The Charles and Ray arc from the show can stand on its own very easily, so save that money for higher concentrations of original footage in 2 and 3, please. 
 
Charles and Ray is a microcosm of everything Eureka Seven was about. Renton meets them as the spoiled child who has rejected Eureka because of she wasn't the dream girl he idolized and expected her to be. He leaves them as someone who has a better grasp of the need to listen to other people and understand their differences so that he can respect them and go through the world more confidently. Making a movie about his relationship with them as a separate thing from his relationship with Eureka makes sense to me because it can be a standalone about growth in the aftermath of an undescribed massive disaster like Acperience was for Renton and Eureka. This very closely parallels how the show as a whole is about growth in the aftermath of the Summer of Love. More than that, the arc's presentation is edited and intercut such that the emotional gut punches of the arc just keep coming and coming and coming in an extremely methodical way. 
 
Using the lens we were given in Hi-Evolution 1 (and assuming for the sake of useful argument that 2 and 3 are strictly content from the show), I would totally expect someone only interested in watching the movies to get a good understanding of what Eureka Seven is about. They get a thematic summary with 1, then they'll see Renton grow up from nothing to a hero alongside Eureka while she does the same over the course of two more films. I'm extremely looking forward to that and whatever the hell they have planned for those soccer KLFs and idol singing in the next episode preview. 
 
Even if you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen the series, this is an unforgettable way to experience an excellent arc of it (again, my favorite) in a new way. See this. It's not a replacement for Eureka Seven; it's a peerless companion to it. SEE THIS.

Well, Studio Bones is at it again! Out of all the original series they make (and they’ve made plenty) Eureka Seven seems to be a favorite to many. But to be fair, why wouldn’t it be? The original 2005 series is a stone cold classic, with its arresting visuals, compelling lead romance, and just a grand adventurous tone through and through. I’ll make it no secret that I love it dearly, and its been my favorite anime for nearly 6 years now. It just does so much wonderful that I can’t help but wear a smile anytime I rewatch it. 
 
Unfortunately, with that much praise comes bank to be made on it. And with that bank comes Bones trying to make the magic strike once again. Their first attempt, Pocketful of Rainbows, was an alternate take on the series featuring some reused footage and had some interesting ideas going for it. It was never going to live up to the original, but for what it was it was harmless. The same cannot be said for their next attempt: the infamous Eureka Seven AO. Truth be told, I haven’t seen it myself. But everything I’ve heard makes it seem like seeing it would be the last thing any fan of the original would want. AO was pretty much the lowest point in the series, and many just thought it was done after such a botched follow up. 
 
Perhaps trying to wash away AO’s taint, Bones is taking the old horse out for another try. The Hi Evolution trilogy was announced last year, with the original staff and cast from both languages returning. With the first installment releasing last year in Japan, nerves have never been more on edge. Fans waiting with baited breath to see if they shit the bed once again. And from the first screening at Otakon last summer, reception was...mixed at best. Much of anitwitter was ablaze, claiming that the bed was indeed shat in; some going so far as to say that it was just as bad, if not worse than AO. But with its American release finally here, it must be asked: do those claims ring true? Is Hi Evolution 1 just another blemish on the original? Is it truly worse than AO? To answer this, I must put aside my biased love towards the original series. And now I can say with confidence that this new film is, surprisingly, really damn great. Though truthfully not for everyone. 
 
The overall plot of the film can be broken down into two parts: the first is the story of the Summer of Love. That often talked about but never shown event is finally shown in full glory, as is the story of the man who saved the world, Adroc Thurston. The second part shifts the focus onto the familiar face of Renton Thurston, as he reflects on his past experiences with both Eureka and his adoptive parents, Charles and Ray. For in this continuity, Renton was adopted by the Beams right after his father vanished, and so it’s from them he runs away from to follow Eureka. 
 
Let’s get the obvious praise out of the way: The Summer of Love section is amazing. The first 20-25 minutes is basically one big action scene, and it is jam packed with awesomeness. We’ve got Scub antibodies blasting away at KLF units. We’ve go lasers and missiles flying sky high and exploding into big beautiful bursts of color. We’ve even got a giant missile that transforms into the equivalent of a rave party; god almighty, it is amazing. But it doesn’t stop there, we’ve got plenty of great character moments to boot. It’s great to see Charles and Ray again, and they get a bulk of the early action in the scene. Holland and Dewey actually looking out for and calling each other “brother” is something i never knew I wanted, and it's amazing. It’s impossible to watch it without feeling pumped up. 
 
What’s more, they actually manage to one-up the original series by actually giving Adroc some character. In the series, he was dead by then, and more acted as a symbol for many of the characters. Here, he’s given some depth and it’s quite well done. The film portrays Adroc as a man who genuinely wants to help the world. Someone who is desperate to stop a doomsday plan he created, and laments all the pain caused by his actions. It really succeeds at humanizing him, making him more than just the legendary figure of the original show. All those elements makes his sacrifice all the more powerful in a truly beautiful sequence. The entire Summer of Love was just one big lump of fanservice to the original show, meant to please the fans in every possible way, and it unquestionably succeeded. And then the rest of the film happened and things got more complicated. 
 
See, the controversial reception this film has doesn’t come from the story being told. No, it comes from the way that it was told. Hi Evolution 1 takes a decidedly non linear approach to telling Renton’s tale. Signaled by the words “Play Back” and “Play Forward”, the film leaps throughout parts of Renton leaving the Gekko and his reunion with his adoptive parents. Fans of the original series will recognize these events, in particular Renton’s encounter with the Vodarac girl and his specific reason from running away in the first place. Many have complained that this style of storytelling was too confusing and hard to follow, but for me it wasn’t so. Everything followed a thematic throughline about Renton’s maturation, and it didn’t hop along too large of time gaps. Plus, if you’ve seen the original show, you should know where these events line up time wise. The criticism perhaps comes from how unexpected it was, which while certainly true proved to shake up the original version of these stories. 
 
To be frank, the film basically requires you to be familiar with the original series. It doesn’t really touch on Renton’s life aboard the Gekko, nor his relationship with Eureka; instead assuming you already know about everything Renton went through and giving the new information needed for this trilogy. Some may be aghast at those changes, and while I sympathize, I must also disagree. Had the film gone over that material it would’ve basically been the same as in the original series. Then you would’ve had people complaining about how the film retreaded too much of the same stuff. Some may certainly argue that reusing moments from the series in the first place was a mistake, and while that may have merit, the way they went about telling it was the most interesting approach. 
 
Some will also be disappointed to know that the focus is kept primarily on Renton. In fact, the film kind of turns into a character study of him, squaring in on his reasons for running away and his own problems with relating to Eureka. The elements explored are similar to the ones from the TV series, but they are different. Most notably, it is much harsher on Renton. This section of the original show was a dark time for him, and this film carries that over very well, and then some. It explores how, while he genuinely wants to be a good person, it’s difficult for him to understand what people really want. This was lightly touched on in the series, but here it’s put more front and center as the big character hurdle Renton has to overcome. It’s no coincidence also that the scenes taken are the ones that most strongly reflect that theme. 
 
His encounter with the Vodarac girl proved to be the key example of that hurdle in the original series, and it’s just as much here, but different in a subtle way. In the original, after Renton is brought back to the Swan, Charles comforts him by saying that he doesn’t begrudge his actions; that what he did was “the right thing to do as a human”, but that they didn’t know if the girl really wanted what Renton thought she did. In Hi-Evolution, while Charles still sympathises with Renton, he’s fairly more harsher on him: saying instead that Renton did what he truly thought was right, but that there was no way he could have known if it was for the best. It’s a subtle change, but Hi-Evolution’s version call Renton’s actions into question more and is shown to have a bigger impact on him. And while we don’t see much of her interactions with Renton here, Eureka is shown to be different as well. She’s a lot colder emotionally than she was initially at this point, and her conversation with Renton before he runs away shows that as well. She, too, was more willing to draw attention to Renton’s actions, and the repercussions they had. As such, in the same way that Adroc’s sacrifice is strengthened by his characterization, so too is Renton’s when he once more leaves Charles and Ray. The production name of this film was “Renton Seven”, and that is undoubtedly what this feels like; a story about Renton, his maturation, and where he will go from here. 
 
If I had to point to the films largest shortcomings, it would be its attempt at trying to appeal to newcomers. Text appears often that is meant to explain certain elements that may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Some are actually quite helpful and interesting, such as one explaining the Trapar Waves and the military connections of the characters. Often, however, it’s just running down information that is somewhat unnecessary, and often actually spoil some parts of the series. If they wanted to get newcomers in, they shouldn’t have revealed Eureka’s identity as a human form Corallian, for instance. In fact, I get the feeling that even the writers were aware of the issues with the constant text, and actually played them for laughs in some cases. There’s a text line about helmet wearing rules in Bellforest, and even one explaining what tacos are. Still, the text is somewhat easy to phase out of your mind. But it was a mistake to try to appeal to newcomers in a film like this. This is a film for fans, first and foremost, and we already know most of this stuff.  
 
In terms of visuals, the film devilers in a way you may not expect. Obviously, the Summer of Love is the high point: it’s a delectable smorgasbord of mecha action, gorgeous shot composition, and is a true sight to behold. It’s probably some of the best giant robot footage put to the big screen, and among the best Bones has produced. But after that, the film heavily uses footage from the original series during Renton’s portion of the film. Many have criticized this as a lazy move, and while new footage would’ve been amazing, its use is actually kind of smart. Using it during the primarily flashback-centered part of the movie is thematically appropriate; just as Renton remembers what’s happened to him, we too remember seeing these events from the original. But they didn’t just slap the old animation on and call it a day; they’ve actually cleaned it up quite a bit. Subtle changes to the line work, new background elements, even redrawing some scenes for a greater effect. What was once the Ray=Out magazine is now a governmental propaganda magazine, Hardfloor album covers are seen on Charles’ wall. My favorite would be a certain character appearing to have a vastly different role here, even if she doesn’t appear physically. It succeeds in giving off a surreal vibe; a feeling that what your watching is Eureka Seven, but is still different from the original. Admittedly, the aspect ratio change during this part is annoying, but it’s a minor detail for me at least. 
 
Naoki Sato returns to the score, and it’s as great as ever. The film doesn’t rely too heavily on his original pieces from the TV series (I think they use one song from it and that’s it). Highlights include pretty much the entire Summer of Love sequence; that booming orchestral score is just eargasmic (is that a word? I hope so). In a surprising move, german trance musicians Hardfloor composed a song for this: Acperience 7. Playing during the Summer of Love, it’s a techno feast for the ears, and a straight up banging tune to boot. Considering that Hardfloor’s “Acperience” song was used as the title for a number of the TV shows episodes, it’s very fitting. Additionally, the ending song, Hiroya Ozaki’s “Glory Days”, is a phenomenal piece that really captures the feeling of the series. 
 
As for the VA work, I watched the english dub. Somehow, Funimation managed to pull off the impossible and got the entire original cast back. Equally amazing is that they slip back into their roles without much of a hitch. It’s great to here all these voices again, especially Patrick Seitz and Melissa Fahn as Charles and Ray. Hell, they even got Dewey’s VA back, and he does great too. The big new addition is Fred Tatasciore as Adroc, and while I was surprised when they first announced him, within the first few lines he sold me completely. He captures all the pain and anguish Adroc goes through while also never seeming too overdramatic. In short, he’s exactly how you imagined the character sounding, and is probably the best performance in the whole film. If I had to critique the acting, it would mostly revolve around Renton. Not that it’s a bad performance; it’s quite a solid one on the whole. It’s just that Renton sounds...different. Johnny Yong Bosch still voices him, but either he can’t pull off the same voice as the original or the dub decided to tone down the pitch he originally used. Regardless, it’s still the same Renton voice underneath, and you get used to it quickly. Either way, it’s a stellar dub all around. 
 
Of course, this is only part 1. The film ended with a preview for Hi-Evolution 2 which looked so insane and crazy that it made me even more hyped for it. It would seem that this series is going to be one giant, big tribute to everything Eureka Seven. If so, than this film can only be truly judged as part of one whole entity that is the Hi Evolution trilogy. Even those who disliked this film, from what I’ve seen, expressed interest in the sequel, curious as to where this is all heading. And that’s really what this film was: a giant piece of set up for the sequels. But rather than have it just be that, the crew at Bones decided to make it something truly memorable and different, yet still feel like Eureka Seven.  
 
I can, of course, see why many would dislike this film. But the claim that this is worse than AO is just nonsense; at least this is set in an alternate universe and doesn’t screw up the original shows plot. Hi-Evolution 1 ended up being an interesting and very well done jumping off point for things yet to come. It succeeds in reminding you of what the feeling of Eureka Seven is, while also providing enough changes to keep you interested. At the very least, the Summer of Love part is worth seeing, but I enjoyed the rest of the film just as much. I know I’ll be there for everything to happen in part 2, but until then, all we can do is wait for that day, that most glorious of days, to arrive. 
 
To be Continued...

          
 
       Helpful Reuse a whole lot of old animation that's lying around And make Johnny Yong Bosch come back to reprise the role, force him to do a different, shittier voice for some reason. Fuck it, who gives a shit. Who cares like, just animate a bunch of title screens and jerk off onto it before passing it along to the editor who's sleeping on the job or getting blown by a stinky smelly dirty TRANNY. Seriously just pad out the movie with a big obnoxious ""PLAY BACK!!!"" title screen that's probably taking up 10 minutes of the runtime. Oh yeah just cut out key plot elements. Like almost all of them. Nobody cares right? fuck it. Also cut back and forth through different parts of the story. That might make it seem deep as FUCK. Like what's the difference between being artificially confused and confused with intricacies?! Could have been a cool prequel but this is just like, a weird fuckin mess just like when I shit after Taco Bell. Oh am I rambling? kinda like this movie I paid 20 bucks for and I want a godamn refund. This movie has made me want to stop being a fucking weaboo and go to business school or some shit. Go bang a bunch of hot BABES. Become a fucking ALPHA MALE FUCK YEAHHHH! FUCK THIS ANIME SHIT! I'm going to shit this back out onto Funimation's chest or whoever is responsible. I don't give a fuck just give me a chest to shit on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the vicinity of the old school, several mysterious murders take place, the one common element being a female apparition reported. The police bring in their psychic division, including Kurumi Imari, to investigate. One of the deceased is rumored to hold a piece of the Lance of Longinus (For this that don't know, little history lesson here.

This sequel was slightly a disappointment for me to the strong original series. The quality of the animations is the same like before but the characters were much more uninteresting and kind of unlikeable for me. This series takes place a few years after the first series, so like the schoolgirls are done with school and already have a job. I didn't like Imari at all now, not concerning the later episodes and what she is then, no already from beginning, she was really different than she was a girl and her speech is different as well. 
 
I would like to have seen just all the old characters and how they interact with eachother. the story itself wasn't anything special, it didn't have those interesting aims like in the old series. I must admit that i kind of liked the cold imari later and also some more characters. Some sex scenes were interesting, others just so common. 
 
In this series you will see alot of futanari action, besides that a few male on girls scenes. Besides that there are alot of other fetish you can expect like bondage. For me an OK Hentai itself.

I must say, I find myself surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this. I find that I enjoy objectively watching yaoi in attempts to find stories of romance that I enjoy. This one actually caught my attention.  
 
Although I am strongly against what i call the 30 minute I love you, I did very much like the idea. A man forced to marry someone he doesn't love, only to find the one hes been waiting for right under his nose. The bit about the human trafficking wasn't entirely necessary...but eh, I can live with it. My only other issue is that Al was a bit too perverted for my taste... 
 
The Seiyuu's and the art were as good as I could have asked for, and I love the serious tone! I'm a business kind of person. 
 
All and all, well done for a two episode yaoi!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so the anime itself was short, it was slightly rushed and stacked. The plot was faint, but as a yaoi it was good. 
Story was good, because it was obviously a love story. The idea of it being held on a cruise ship and outside of Japan was good. The story takes place in an equally romantic place, Italy. And while the whole idea of an affair happening among the main characters has been done, this one didn't over exaggerate on that factor too much. In fact- the wife seemed mellow about it. The molestation is another element in the story that just presents another evil to the story I suppose, and I think gives another reason for the mains to fall even more in love. 
The artwork was,,,,,well personally to me amazing! The way both main men were drawn just brought out the sexiness and the beauty. Especially Al- his blond hair, so shiny- and Ranmaru's whole body, and his kimono- very nice. The backgrounds and scenery were nice too, and detailed. 
Both sound and character were 8. The majority of the sounds were either fighting or sex- oh and the woman's rage. It was decent and just made certain scenes stand out. Characters didn't have too much background, enough for the story and to the characters themselves. and how what was there was explained eventually and made sense.  
Enjoyment over all- it's yaoi...gonna love it. I appreciated the artwork and the awesome characters. I would recommend if you're into romance and something different from the usual one-shots. ^^

          
 
       Helpful As anime's go this one is never going to go down in history as the greatest love story ever told.  Nor is it going to be notorious for breaking tabboo's or showing some shockingly graphic scenes.   
 
That doesn't mean to say though that you won't enjoy watching it anyway.  If you're into yaoi, Ikoku Irokoi Romantan is a nice, short OVA that can provide you with a little boy love fix.   
 
The story isn't groundbreaking but it's enjoyable to watch, the characters are a little bit predictable but I couldn't help but like them anyway.  There are some quite unrealistic scenes in it which might leave you thinking; Oh that would never happen!    
 
But the point of this anime isn't to bring shocking realism to a gay love story.  The point is that it's a fantasy.  There are a couple of hot scenes if you're into your boy smut &amp; there are some quite funny moments as well as a little action thrown in for good measure.   
 
I don't think non-yaoi fans would like it all that much but for anyone who wants to watch themselves a non-heavy and fun boy-love anime, then give Ikoku Irokoi Romantan a go.

This heartwarming story of love, desire and... bloodshed continues as Sakura's normal everyday life slowly crumbles into a bloody mess. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Magic', 'Ecchi', 'Comedy']","Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan tells the story of 13-year-old junior high schooler Sakura Kusakabe, who twenty years in the future develops a technology that causes all women to stop physically aging after they reach twelve years old in an attempt to create a ""Lolicon's World"". However, this act accidentally creates immortality amongst humans, thus offending God. Dokuro Mitsukai, a member of an order of assassin angels that are called Lulutie, has been sent from the future to kill him. Believing that Sakura can be redeemed, Dokuro decides instead to keep Sakura so occupied and distracted that he can never develop the immortality technology. In response to her reluctance to complete the assassination mission, Sabato, another assassin of the Lulutie order, is dispatched to ensure the mandate of God is carried out. Using her feminine wiles along with her electric baton as her weapons of choice, Sabato seeks to kill Sakura herself and Dokuro is forced to oppose her. In so doing, Dokuro pits herself against the will of Heaven itself in order to protect him.
Ironically, she herself quite possibly poses a greater threat to his well-being as a result of her capricious and highly volatile personality. Due to her impulsive nature and super-human strength, she often carelessly or unthinkingly kills him with her massive spiked kanabō (club), Excalibolg, only to regret it moments later and return him to life with angelic power accompanied by her whimsical personal chant of ""Pipiru-piru-piru-pipiru-pii"". This repeated trauma, along with myriad other problems she causes for him, prompts Sakura to ultimately question whether her ""protection"" is worth it and ponder that it might be ultimately preferable to simply allow Sabato to kill him permanently and put an end to his perpetual misery.
","Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Going into the second season I was really expecting it to be just as bad as the first season yet there were actually a few elements that made the second season a bit more tolerable to watch. 
 
Story (3/10) 
 
The story continues with Sakura and Dokuro doing random stuff however the second season only has 2 episodes whereas the first had 4 which to me was an improvement since it meant not having to watch it as long and another slight improvement was the antics that the duo got up to which actually didn't involve much of the school or their schoolmates instead it focused on a more select group of characters which felt a bit more decent to watch. 
Once again though the story goes nowhere yet even more this time since there wasn't really a story to begin with in the first place although I did like the moment where the characters got trapped in a prison made to contain angels which did add a bit of suspense because we didn't know how they were going to get out of there. 
 
Characters (3/10) 
 
Now the characters are a little better not because of Sakura or Dokuro because they are still the same, but because of some characters in season 1 getting some more screentime like Zakuro and Zansu who felt like the only decent characters of the show and I really liked how they used these characters more especially Zakuro who seemed like a waste of a good character in season 1, luckily they decided to make her a main character this season which made the show a little more tolerable to watch. 
 
Art (8/10) 
 
Once again the art is pretty much the only good thing about the show and the show does improve the character design's this season although I don't know why they turned Dokuro's hair from a light purple and into a turquoise blue which didn't make any sense however I did like some of the locations especially the angel prison which may have looked bland it actually held it's fair share of traps which was pretty interesting. 
 
Sound (2/10) 
 
The op this time isn't as bad as season 1's op, but that isn't really saying much to be honest it's still ear bleedingly hurtful to listen to. 
 
Extras: 
 
The comedy was a little better since it didn't fully focus on Sakura getting smashed into bits so many times by Dokuro instead it puts the characters into bad situations and tries to make their actions funny which was an improvement. 
The Ecchi side was a little heavier too even having a bath scene with Sakura, Dokuro and Zakuro which was a little steamy, but nothing I haven't seen before. 
 
Enjoyment (3/10) 
 
Overall this was a small improvement over the first season and it sucks you'd have to watch the first season to get here then again it's not really worth you're time as the improvements this season still weren't enough for me to give it a much higher score. 

          
 
       Helpful Overall, this has been a positive year so far. Lots of really strong series, nothing too bad. Obviously, that had to change at some point. Which is why we find ourselves looking at the follow up to Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan, a terrible anime from Hal film maker about an angel who beats her love interest to death, brings him back to life and that's basically the big joke that we kept getting. I'm not looking forward to this one, but let's move in and see how many more gruesome domestic abuse scenes they can cram in and treat as humorous.  
 
Story: 
 
We pick up where the last series left off. Sakura is living with the angel sisters, Dokuro and Zakuro.  He's trying to live a normal life and get the attention of the girl he likes at his school but that's consistently ruined by Dokuro torturing and murdering him, but it's okay because she brings him back to life afterwards and that makes it funny because... people dying horribly and gruesomely is hilarious according to this series.  
 
The humour is much the same kind of thing that the first series offered. We have gross out humour with the over the top gore effects and perverted humour that's really used more as an excuse to show Dokuro and Zakuro in skimpy outfits than it is for actual comedic attempts. This is one of those series that seems to be based firmly on the idea that sex and violence sell and you don't need any charm or clever witticisms. After all, even semi-clever jokes would have interfered with this OVA's mission to route your blood flow away from the brain. The humour is also quite repetitive with Dokuro getting angry and mutilating or murdering Sakura with little or no provocation. It really shouldn't be possible for a joke to get stale with less than an hour of content, but they manage. So, does this one have any legitimately funny moments at all? Personally, I thought that Corpse Party did the over the top violent humour much better and it wasn't trying to be funny.  
 
Characters: 
 
This cast of characters is pretty horrendous. I'll give comedic series some leeway when it comes to character complexity since they really only need to play off of each other well for comedic purposes, but this cast doesn't even have that much going for them. We get the same few unfunny pay-off reactions repeated.   
 
Art: 
 
The artwork is pretty lazy with fountains of blood gore effects, really basic character designs and minimal backgrounds. The most effort they put in is for the tacky fan-service scenes. Which shouldn't be surprising after the first series.  
 
Sound: 
 
Like the first series, the theme tune is easily the best aspect of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2. However, it is weakened a bit by being a pretty lazy remix of the first series' theme tune. Rather like Toei did with Futari Wa Precure: Max Heart. The acting is either obnoxiously exaggerated or emotionless and dull, depending on which character is speaking. Which is a pity since there are some really good actresses here. Chiba Saeko, to give an example, voiced Nina in Code Geass, Azmaria in Chrno Ctrusade & Natsuki in Mai-Hime/Otome. She can give such strong performances. It just doesn't happen here because there's nothing to work with.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There are some “jokes” that imply that Zansu is romantically interested in Sakura. Aside from that, there's really not any.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
This series is not good, at all. It's crude, tacky and generally tasteless with the same basic jokes the first OVA had. So, if you're a fan of the gross out/ fan-servicey humour, you might get a kick out of it otherwise, I would stay far away. For myself, I was not amused. I was quickly annoyed by the series and tired of its nonsense. I give Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 a 2/10.  Next week we'll move away from sequels and talk about Charlotte. 

          
 
       Helpful Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 can basically be described as this: Over the top comedy and violence, complimented with pointless story and echhi-ness on the side.  
It picks up where the first season left off, (well with the cast appearance anyway) and gives you even more of what the first had to offer. 
 
Story: 4/10 
Honestly if this anime series could talk, it would say: &quot;Story? What is this story of which you speak of?&quot; Because quite frankly there is none whatsoever, if you have ever seen season one then you may be surprised that everything the actual storyline (if you can even call it that) had built up to that point, seems to have gone right out the window. In fact it kind of confused me when I started this second season. The way the first half ended left many things up in the air, and instead of continuing it from where it left off, it simply just decided to put all characters together as one big happy family, whether or not they actually were so in the first half. Anyway, there is no plot at all to speak of, basically we see Sakura (main male lead) get into all sorts of over the top situations with Dokuro-chan and her friends. Whether it be simply taking a bath together, (in their swimsuits no less) or getting trapped inside some magical box. It does differ from one another so you don't feel you are re-watching recycled content scenes from the first part. They also boosted the over all &quot;echhi-ness&quot; factor and over the top &quot;violence.&quot; So whether you either loved or hated Dokuro-chan's content before, it will mostly increase two full this time around! So if you are new to the series, just be aware that it contains more extreme themes regarding these. Oh and they also added about two new characters, nice for its 2 episode length. Though I personally would have liked for it to continue further than that. There is no character development whatsoever.......nor an actual ending to this either, as you could basically switch the first and last episodes with each other and it wouldn't make much difference. And the way they threw the story out, this series could honestly keep going on for an eternity, all the while making you laugh the entire way. Honestly I just found this title drop dead hilarious at times, as many on the comedy scenes are pretty darn clever......dirty and bloody as they may be. 
 
Artwork: 8/10 
Bright colorful, sharp and lovable, and definitely on par from what you would expect of the series. (though they seem to have given the overall characters a bit more of a mature-er look to them) The character design is not fully different from what you may be accustomed to wanting, but the design and artwork truly have a distinctiveness to them. I especially like how they cut and copy actual animal faces, (or even real life historical characters on occasion) and stuck them on selected characters; Whom of which have been cursed by Dokuro-chan herself! So yeah it varies on the artwork, most of the time you'll see the standard colorful fair, and others you'll see real life western style paintings and character art playing a role in the wackiness. Backgrounds were good and detailed for the most part, but never really come off as anything great or unique, and look pretty standard overall. 
  
Soundtrack: 6/10 
They actually re-made the opening theme from the first part, its okay and all but just isn't quite as carefree and happy as the first. The ending song was pretty beat-ish, basically it has all the characters in yukata's (summer kimonos) dancing to this happy kind of drum beat, all the while singing along, which may tempt you to sway along with it. The background music is pretty forgettable though, nothing really stands out as most are just generic sounding pop beats. I honestly didn't even notice the BG most of the time. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
Great as usual, all the characters retain their varied personalities from the first half. From Dokuro-chans innocent yet murderous intent, to Shizuki's (supporting role) tender caring attitude. Which is quite nice considering nothing in this title is taken seriously, and I am glad that the company went out and actually gave each character a good variety of persona's! Though I think most viewers out there will either love or hate a guy named Zansu, as he can be an extreme in the personality department. Not the most memorable cast out there, but great for this style of anime. Though I feel I should stress it once again, zero character development. 
 
Bottom Line: 8/10 
&quot;Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2&quot; ups everything in content from the first season, chances are you will either love it or hate it more depending on your taste. It remains a solid watch for what it brings to the table. If you like echhi-ness complimented with over the top comical violence, then you will absolutely love this series, if not then you will loath it all the more and find it overall pointless. Good solid watch for fans and viewers who can appreciate its approach in comedy content.

Socially inept and awkward, he immerses himself in video games and anime, only to be relentlessly ridiculed and ostracized by his classmates. Sharing his misery is Yuuto Itou, his only friend, who wears cat ears and is equally obsessed with the world of games.

Brazenly blunt, loathed by female classmates, and infamous for messing around with boys, Tsutsui believes that getting involved with her would cause nothing but problems.  
 
 3D Kanojo: Real Girl  is a story revolving around these two outcasts—a boy full of emotions he has never experienced before, struggling to lay them bare, and a girl who strives to break him out of his shell.

","There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring 18 season. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both 3D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring 18 season was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over 3D Kanojo Real Girl is that one the characters were likable, two that show was well paced and three the romance was actually great and believable. As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than 3D Girl Kanojo stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this 3D Girl Kanojo which speaking of 3D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of 2018 bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period. 
 
So what went wrong with this show? 
Your soon gonna find out. 
Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of 3D Kanojo Real Girl and with that said let’s begin 
 
Story. 
The story follows a generic okatu high school student named Hikaru Tsutsui who is shunned by his classmates for his otaku behavior. One day he gets set to do pool cleaning duty for being late along with a beautiful but reputed troublemaker Iroha Higurashi who is also considered an outsider by other students. At first reluctant to even talk to Iroha, Hikari is able to overcome his insecurity and defend her from bullies. In yet another pool-cleaning task, they decide to start a relationship. The catch? Iroha is due to change schools at the end of the year. 
 
The story is awful. 
Am not kidding this is one of the worst romance stories I have ever seen period. 
For starters this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favor being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well branding Hikaru as a lolicon for days. Okay I understand if you don’t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn’t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be a easy target for the police. 
People don’t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now. 
 
Episode 1 alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowed a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters.  
To add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is. 
 
The single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portyal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potenal romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships. 
 
Overall the story in 3D Kanojo Real Girl is awful. 
 
1/10 
 
Characters. 
If you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse. 
Tsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions. 
Iroha is just your typical easy going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best. 
 
The rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative. 
Overall the characters were just plan terrible. 
 
3/10 
 
Visuals. 
Like with the story and characters the visuals are shit. 
The character designs for 3D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in 1 hour without a second thought. 
The animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation. 
 
4/10 
 
Sound. 
3D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent. 
The voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role. 
Overall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best. 
 
5/10 
 
Final Thoughts. 
 
This show is a dumpster of a romcom anime that deserves to be burned and forgotten. The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck. 
 
Final Score 2/10

          
 
       Helpful Typically, a show scored under 7 is garbage. Therefore, it is surprising that this is getting such a poor score. 
 
Don't get me wrong, it's not groundbreaking anime but I saw many shows over 7.5 that are definitely worse than this one. I feel like the MAL score is slowly becoming irrelevant. 
 
I typically can't handle shoujo anime (the pace is so slow, I feel like dying) but there's just enough mystery in the story to keep you interested. The character interactions are indeed awkward and cringey but considering the setting it makes perfect sense. 
 
From the setup, it looks like it's supposed to be a drama more than a rom-com but it has comedic elements. It's a little bit odd that it portrays any other male character (other than the mc and his friend) as being complete assholes, but it doesn't affect your enjoyment. 
 
It's worth giving a try.

          
 
       Helpful It is often said by many that anime is gradually getting worse. As much as I want to deny this, I can't help but reluctantly agree. Over the past few seasons, there had been such a lack of originality and overuse of cliches that besides the occasional 'a place farther than the universe', I'm wondering if anime is even trying anymore. Lets take a look at '3D girlfriend', which, as much as I wanted to like it, I can't help but getting annoyed by how cliche it is. 
 
Plot (4/10): The story to this show is extremely mediocre and predictable. A boy who is an otaku and often bullied meets a girl, the girl changed his initial opinion of 3d girlfriends (whatever that means), falls in love, starts dating, bla bla bla. Basically its 'the world god only knows' except its a whole less original and consists of a single relationship. This may not have been a bad thing except the execution is laughably poor. None of the otaku subplot is explored in a meaningful 
way at all, which makes me wonder why the show even made the mc an otaku in the first place. The romance is very bad, with poor chemistry between the characters and is badly paced. I mean, come on! They meet and even started dating on the same day? How does that work? 
 
Character (3/10): Besides the plot, the characters in this show are very unoriginal as well. The main character, tsutsui, I feel is probably one of the blandest shojo leads I've seen. Not only does he lack any personality whatsoever, but he is also horribly inconsistent. He 
gets angry for no particular reason and is then showed to be placid in the next scene. I suppose this show wants to characterize him as a socially awkward type of guy, but if it is, it does a very terrible job at it. Next up, we have the female protagonist, Igarashi, who, while still being better than Tsutsui, is still very boring. The third character, Itou Yuuto, is hardly worth mentioning since the only bit of development he got is as a plot device for being the mc's best friend. 
 
Animation and Sound (5/10): While not being bad, the technical aspects of this show aren't very good either. The character designs are mediocre, with Tsutsui being the typical high school boy with glasses, which was copied from at least 50 other anime with basically the same design and Igarashi looks like the typical shojo lead with wavy hair. The music in the opening is pretty bad in my opinion although for voice acting, I do like Igarashi's voice a lot so I'll keep this category above a 4. 
 
Overall (4/10): Overall, this show so far is pretty bad. I might watch a few more episodes to see if it gets better but I'll put it on-hold for now.

","Critic's Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2012. Review #20: Kimba, The White Lion 
 
Back when I was about 5 or 6 years old, there was a Disney movie that I watched all the time. That Disney movie was The Lion King. I loved the animation in the movie and I never got tired after repeated viewing. Today, I haven't watched it as much because there are other movies I like and I have shows that I want to watch. I decided to do a little research on the movie and I found that it bears a striking resemblance to Kimba from the anime Jungle Emperor (Kimba, The White Lion in The U.S.) There was a controversy over The Lion King because of its similarity to Kimba, The White Lion. It's been 18 years since The Lion King was released so I have no comment about the whole comparison of both things. My theory is that Kimba, The White Lion was the primary influence for The Lion King. It didn't completely plagarized Kimba, The White Lion. I also want to mention that I am treating this review as a retrospective. With that said, here's Kimba, The White Lion! 
 
 
 
The basic premise of this anime is that Leo (Kimba in the American release), a young lion cub who becomes king of the jungle when his father was killed by a human hunter. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Mushi Pro production and this is an anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga of the same name. Don't know who Tezuka-san is? I'll tell you. Tezuka-san is a cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer, activist, and was best known for series such as Astro Boy (which was the first anime to come to the U.S.), Black Jack, and Kimba, The White Lion. Tezuka-san was often nicknamed ""The Godfather of Anime"" and often considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney, which made total sense. Tezuka-san was influenced by some of Walt Disney's work. Tezuka-san has a prolific output, and had pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres that earned him nicknames such as ""The Father of Manga"" or ""The God of Manga"". 
 
 
 
Before I go any further, I want to apologize beforehand that I dropped this series and I don't plan on finishing it. I will simply give out my retrospective of Kimba, The White Lion to the best of my abilities. 
 
First of all, I am going to excuse the quality of animation on this anime for a couple of reasons. First off, this is the first anime in color. Secondly, this was a 60's anime. The animation has definitely aged as time went by. 
 
 
 
 
The music by Isao Tomita may not be recognizable today but he often composes soundtracks of the anime adaptations of Osamu Tezuka's series. 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as voices go. This is going to be a bit difficult to talk about. I am assuming the Japanese cast is good on this show. The Dub is from way before 90's dub quality and the dub is corny but actually watchable and that's saying a lot. Too bad the American release never included the subtitled version. it's a Dub-only affair in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
The characters are simply introduced well but it was hard for me to latch on to the characters in this show. I don't have much to say on this matter 
 
 
 
 
 
Then there's the story, It is kid-friendly but it does challenge the audience with some mature themes. It has a simple premise that expands as the show progresses I should also point out that Rintaro (who went by the name Shigeyuki Hayashi during the making of Kimba) was the chief director. You might want to do a little research on this guy because there might be a few animes that he was involved in that you probably didn't know that he was part of. Also, Eiichi Yamamoto was also the director of this anime and he also did the series composition for Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US). 
 
 
 
After sharing those little tidbits, allow me to mention The Lion King once more. About the whole controversy about whether The Lion King homaged this anime or plagarized it. There seems to be some comparisons between the two and I can see some similarities.  
 
 
 
This anime was influential in Japan and might as well be a major influence to The Lion King. The Lion King might as well be an American tribute to Kimba, The White Lion. 
 
Kimba, The White Lion is available from Right Stuf. 
 
 
 
With that said... Kimba, The White Lion is an anime worth checking out if you are looking for an anime that is definitely worth seeing if you want to go as far as the 60's. This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However in order to fully appreciate this anime, you will have to overlook the flaws and technicalities that this show had to offer. This was a 60's anime, this anime was completely hand-drawn and not many sound effects were possible at the time. What you see is what you get when it comes to this anime. Many children in Japan grew up watching this anime and now are the key players in the anime industry today. I may not have a big interest in this anime, but at least I was able to give out my first-impression retrospective into the series. 
 
 
 
I give Kimba, The White Lion a 5 out of 10, it is SO-SO! 
 
 
 
feel free to comment, and give out a might roar!

4,9000,102,6.912272122,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Toaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku,"The war between the Levamme Empire and the Amatsukami Imperium has been raging for years. In the midst of this struggle, the prince of the Levamme Empire declares his love for Juana del Moral and vows to end the war in one year, as part of his marriage proposal. When the Amatsukami catch wind of this, they assault the del Moral residence, targeting Juana's life. As a last ditch effort to bring the prince his bride, the San Maltilia Airforce hires a mercenary of mixed blood—a bestado—to fly Juana to the Levamme capital in secret. The pilot, Charles, accepts the mission...but traversing an ocean alone, into enemy territory, proves a much more dangerous ordeal than anyone could have anticipated. 
 
(Source: NIS America)","['Adventure', 'Military', 'Romance']","Koroku Inumura's original war romance light novel revolves around Charles Karino, a Levamme Kingdom mercenary aerial pilot and Juana del Moral, a princess of del Moral family. Charles, who's the best fighter pilot in the entire Kingdom, lives with the mercenaries and is looked down upon by the regular soldiers of the Kingdom, but one day gets to man the twin-seater reconnaissance seaplane Santa Cruz after receiving a surprise assignment: to fly over 12,000 kilometers of enemy waters to protect aforementioned princess after her mansion gets bombed by the Amatsuvian Empire's fighter pilots and her father, Diego del Moral, dies. This mission would be a covert operation requiring the other mercenaries and forces to play the part of the decoy.
But after having suspicions from the start of the mission, Charles eventually discovers that both the original operation and the covert operation have been figured out by the enemy decoding the military telegraphs sent by the crown prince Carlo to Juana. Although this outrages Charles very much, he agrees to proceed with the mission. Throughout the whole mission, they become known about each other's character and history, thus becoming emotionally attached to each other, while hiding, surviving and defeating the worst attacks from the enemy, enduring hardships. At the end of the mission, even though Charles receives a hefty sum of pay disrespectedly, he throws it all away and goes away with his plane. It doesn't become clear what happened to him afterwards or whether those two met each other again or not.
Eventually, the princess after becoming Queen of Lavamme, goes on to create lasting peace between the two warring sides.
","I haven't really watched many anime movies, since I'm more into series anime. (FYI: There is an anime based in the same universe but in a different time period, named Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta). 
   Romantic films like these are very enjoyable in my opinion, and those that are based on certain themes like forbidden love make it all the more. I definitely enjoyed having something as simple as flying across a large expanse of water develop and blossom into the beautiful film that is Toaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku. 
   Charles Karino, a ""lowlife bestado"" (someone born of mixed blood) is tasked with an important mission; a treacherous flight across enemy territory, harboring a future princess; Juana del Moral, who is to be married off to a Levamme prince. 
   The story, while not being something overly dramatic or over-the-top, is something I think lovers of romance anime would definitely enjoy. Just listening to the short synopsis of the story, you would imagine that they would run into several challenges along the way; and they do. 
   Having several obstacles along the way, varying from enemy planes to maintenance, I would easily see how the frequent interruptions in the trip would lead from one thing to another, primarily the development of the relationship between Juana and Charles. 
        The music and art were to my liking; no complaints in that department. The dogfights were very excellently portrayed, except for the mundane lack of realism should it be compared to real life (I honestly don't care though, those dogfights were pretty thicc). 
        Looking at the general rating of this movie, the one thing I would say that probably made the rating lower than it could have been would've been the somewhat realistic ending. Time and time again, you see love blossom and grow, usually with a happily ending after as it does in most romance anime. In this movie, the two main protagonists were able to strengthen their bond and relations as a team, but never got any closer than that. In my opinion, I didn't really like how it turned out, and sort of ruined it for me in fact; but I'd like you all to see it for yourself before judging. 
   Compared to several other anime movies I've watched, this one is fairly high up on my list. If you are tired of seeing the same themes in anime and anime movies in general, I would definitely recommend this. If you are an aviation junkie however, I'd recommend you restrain yourself from critiquing and nitpicking the several instances of the blatant defiance of aerodynamics. This is a romance anime, not a full-blown war movie. 
   I'd definitely give this one a second watch if I had the time; if you are interested in something that sort of strays from the romance genre norm, give it a go and see how you like it.  
     
    
     

          
 
       Helpful I haven't written a review before since there was no reason to because of the abundance of them already but this show just takes the cake for me so I decided to write one. As you can see by the rating I have given this show, I find myself extremely disappointed. I was honestly disappointed with the character development that seemed to be going somewhere only for it to just disappear as if it never happened. The first thing I want to warn is that it is no traditional romance so if that is what you like, don't watch the Movie. The name and the 'romance' tag are clickbait but may be subjective to some so read it as you please.  
 
Story-wise, it has a clear and straight-forward plot that is very well explained in the synopsis. The reason I gave the story a 6/10 was because of the abundance of plot armor in the story that somewhat ticked me off but I gave it the benefit of the doubt just because I am interested in what is going to happen next. Secondly was because of the ending. Although this may differ depending on preference, the ending left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. The amount of times I ranted in my mind regarding the ending is innumerable. But I could only blame myself because of that stupid romance tag.  
 
The art for the movie is one I find extremely beautiful and breath-taking. For a movie that came out in 2011 and watching in 2019, I find the art much more developed for its time (Or maybe that is just me). Hence, it is a no brainer I gave it a 9. Regarding the music and sound in the show, I found it extremely well done and fits really well with the movie. 
 
And now for the 5/10. My enjoyment and the character development. My enjoyment is pretty self explanatory for what I have written so far. I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed the movie even by little bit since I didn't. I am literally fuming right now so if there are any grammatical mistakes I apologize. Truthfully, I would have given this a much lower rating instead of a 5/10 if it weren't for the fact that my mental resilience to these kinds of unsatisfied situations that I have built from reading such terrible or bittersweet endings, It would have been 1. But since the art and sound was so good, I gave it a +4.  
 
Now for the character development. All I can say is what the hell. I really wanted the replace the word 'hell' there but i am not sure if it is against the community guidelines to do so because that is just what I thought of the character development by the end of the story. Unfortunately, since I couldn't write about any spoilers, I can't really back my reasoning for the character section because if I can, that is where the rant is going to start and oh boy will it be an additional 1000 words. But all I can say is for a movie with the tag of romance in it, I can't seem to find it. Not even my pet rat can seem to find it. Maybe in the middle of the movie but god damn where is it. Don't get me started with the prince and the other soldiers, but god damn are there a lot of plot armor on them. With the amount of plot armor that the soldiers are carrying, world domination is childs play. Heck, how are their backs not hurting yet from all that carrying.  
 
Thus a 5 is a natural result overall. The writer should thank and gift the sound and art department because they really outperformed themselves. If it weren't for their hard work, I would be using the pages from his light novel as tissue paper. If it weren't for a short clip of this movie that I found on youtube with the romance in it then I would have never even known about this crappy movie. But seriously though, the ending is extremely subjective and it seems in a good way hence the 7.72 rating. But ratings isn't what defines a movie, preference does. Sadly, I am not in the upper 99.9% so I don't see the movie that way. All I can say is if you're in it for the romance and the romance you are probably thinking about, exit the page. If you want it for the story then go ahead. This is merely a one in a million other review anyways but I merely just wanted to say my piece. Also, damn if you read every single word of this I applaud. Most people only look at numbers and choose whether to watch it or not. 
 

          
 
       Helpful The title of the movie kind of gives away what this movie is about, there's a princess and an air force pilot that fall in love, this is a classic archetype that it is at the core of any great love story. However, this movie really demonstrates the best way to tell a love story. What can make emotional movies like this difficult to make is that because they're only 90 minutes long the writers have less time to create a connection with the characters and the viewer, but this movie I believe really does a fantastic job of showing how the love between the two main characters was born. The main characters in this movie aren't ""star crossed lovers"", they each bring out the better qualities of the other which is really the corner stone of love and strengthens the connection that the characters have for each other and the connection the viewer has with them.  
 
One thing I love about this movie is the ending. I thought for sure this movie would just end with ""..and they all lived happily ever after"", but it actually has a very realistic and believable ending that is more similar to real life then some fairy tale ending where the viewer is just waiting for the guy to kiss the girl.  
 
Another thing I love about this movie is how the princess's personality change feels so natural. In some live-action American movies I see I feel like the characters evolution is so forced, but in this movie I really got to see how the princess struggled through her and the pilots journey and I understood why her personality had such a sharp change. Also, because I got to see  the princess's struggle  and character evolution so much better, the love between the princess and the pilot on which the movie was built on was much more believable.  
 
Plus, there was this really great ""dog fight"" scene that I found to be very exciting! 
 
Overall, I'd say this was one of the best romantic movies I've seen! The plot was kind of predictable, but the kind of emotion and personality the characters in this movie had is what helped it stand out from other movies. Also, this movie succeeded in one of the most important areas of making a good love story by convincing me, the viewer, that the main characters were truly in love. Neither of the characters in this movie just looked at each other and said ""I love that person""; at the beginning of the movie the princess and the pilot were just in the same boat, or plane in this case, together and didn't have any emotional investment in each other, but as the movie continues there bond grows stronger and stronger until their love for each other is born. Also, just because the movie doesn't end with ""..and they all lived happily ever after"" doesn't mean the love the princess and the pilot had for each other dies at the end.

","This is just a very short romantic anime which is so cute in its own way.  
 
Anyway, the plot is all over about a girl who got saved by a guy so she ended up developed feelings for him but he dumped her because her feelings were too much for him to take or so. The boy actually played on the basketball team which she did not know but throughout the anime, she had to take over her girl friend’s job, which was to be the manager of the basketball team. Therefore, she starts to see him all over again since she does not have a choice avoiding it and neither him. She ends up stalking him to find out what there is between him and her since she finds out that there is a lot more to them than she thought.  
 
Plot 8  
The plot in the anime is very easy to understand and it goes right into the subject. 
 
Art 8 
The art is not that bad but it could have definitely been better even though the characters are pretty well good painted but whatsoever. 
 
Soundtrack 7 
Sorry, no really focus was on the soundtracks.

That all the characters have their own unique personality makes the anime much better. 
 
Enjoyment 6 
It is wat too short to really enjoy the anime but if it was a series then it could not have been anything else than perfect.

I really recommend this anime for people that are lost at the moment and have nothing to watch.

On his 14th birthday, he finally decides to confess his love to his longtime crush Risa Harada, but is rejected.  
 
In an unexpected turn of events, however, Daisuke finds himself transforming into Dark Mousy, the infamous phantom thief, whenever his mind is set on Risa. Though Daisuke is unaware of this strange heritage, his mother is certainly not: since before the boy was born, his mother had been planning for him to steal valuable works of art and let the name of the elusive art thief be known. 
 
With doubt and confusion constantly clouding his mind, Daisuke finds himself struggling in his relationships with classmates and family. And it is not long before Daisuke realizes that he is not the only one with a fated family legacy—his greatest adversary could be the one classmate he is most unwilling to fight.

At the story's opening, Daisuke declares love for his crush, a girl named Risa Harada, on his fourteenth birthday. She rejects him, and later that day, the heart-broken Daisuke undergoes a strange mutation that changes him into another person. He is told calmly by his mother Emiko that, because of a strange genetic condition, all the males in Daisuke's family gain the countenance of Dark Mousy, a famous phantom thief. The transformation occurs every time Daisuke has romantic feelings for his crush or whenever he thinks too long about her. Dark changes back into Daisuke the same way. Daisuke is forced to keep his family's secret and control his alter ego, Dark (whom Risa, Daisuke's crush, has fallen for), while dashing his way out of being caught by the commander of the police. Daisuke learns that in order to return to normality, he must have his unrequited love returned.
The aforementioned commander of the police is a classmate of Daisuke's named Satoshi Hiwatari. Hiwatari suffers from his own version of the phantom-thief curse, and a bond forms between Hiwatari and Daisuke because of their similar afflictions. Hiwatari carries the alter-ego named Krad. However, though Dark and Krad hate one another, Hiwatari and Daisuke maintain a strained but genuine friendship, despite Dark's constant moaning. Dark steals certain artistic objects of value, works made by Satoshi's ancestors, because they contain dangerous magical properties. Some of them, such as ""The Second Hand of Time"" and ""Argentine"" also have personalities of their own. Some of the objects that he steals are quite dangerous. Dark's method of stealing is based on garnering attention; before stealing, Emiko will send out a warning of what will be stolen.

Great opening song and i love dark hes great. But after about 5 episodes although i stuck with it by the end i really didnt care what happened as the story seemed to come out of nowhere as though half way through the idea sparked up to have artwork contain power. I really feel more can be done for this anime as its a great concept.

          
 
       Helpful This review was originally posted in November 2011, during a month long special honoring Voice Actor Vic Mignogna. 
 
Alright, everybody, time for the first review of Vic Mignogna Month! And, according to Wikipedia, this is one of his most well known roles in anime. Apparently, it’s up there with Full Metal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club. Well, we’ll just have to see about that. 
 
D.N.Angel is a Fantasy/Romance anime based on the manga by Yukiru Sugisaki and published by Kadokawa Shoten. Tokyopop did holds the rights, but since they closed their doors the series has not been relicensed. The 26 episode anime comes from Dentsu/Xebec, originally running in 2003. ADV Films used to holds licensing rights, but current rights belong to Discotek. 
 
Daisuke Niwa is your average teenager, until his fourteenth birthday. He tries to declare his love to the girl of his dreams, but fails. Suddenly, whenever he thinks about this girl he turns into the legendary phantom thief known as Dark Mousy. Daisuke's mother, very much aware of this, makes him turn into Dark and steal valuable works of art for a purpose unknown to Daisuke. As the story unfolds, he learns why, and about his classmate who seems to have the same ability. (Anime News Network) 
 
The art style and animation is well done for an anime of the early 2000’s.... If only it didn’t repeat scenes. Yeah... I’m guessing the budget went down the tubes real quick so they had to reuse some of their scenes. And this happens a lot, so, unfortunately, it does take away from the series as a whole. Hell, you can actually tell where the budget went: the end of the series. The last few episodes are better, visually, then the rest of the series. Makes me wonder, when will an anime actually be consistent in animation? Oh wait, it has.... It’s called Soul Eater, Eden of the East, Baccano!, Umineko no Naku Koro ni...... 
 
D.N.Angel’s plot is a little hard to follow, because for most of the series you’re following Daisuke and Dark stealing art works plus some comedic filler episodes involving the Harada twins or Wiz (he’s called With in the dub, but I don’t care. He’s Wiz to me). Each episode has it’s own story to tell, and you don’t really see a set plot until later on in the series. This isn’t a bad thing, because it does help establish the characters more before the big climax of the series. However, it leaves the viewer wondering when the ACTUAL plot is going to happen. Then something DOES happen and you feel like this would be a good end to the series. Even credits role with more of the characters at the end.... However, D.N.Angel decides to pull a ‘psych’ moment and show you “nope not done yet”. And, also, there is suddenly foul language (small amount, but compared to having none so far, it stands out). So.... The two problems I have with this series is lack of strict plot, and that it doesn’t know when to stop. 
 
The characters aren’t really full of depth or development in the series at all. Whatever development the characters have, it all gets thrown in during the last episodes. The one thing that really seems to grow throughout the series is Daisuke and Riku’s relationship. Makes sense..... But what about Dark’s past? Or Satoshi’s growing friendship with Daisuke? Hell, when did Risa and Satoshi suddenly have a thing for each other? Sorry, none of that is explained much. Even the relationship of Daisuke and Riku doesn’t start happening till later in the series. It seems like a lot of the characters just seem to get the short end of the stick. 
 
Alright, pertaining to the English Dub, all I’m going to say is this....... My ears are bleeding now...... Seriously, I have never heard so much pitchy voice acting in any anime; not to mention a few bad dubbing matches. A lot of the choices for major characters had a very hard time playing young teens, when you really hope for a little maturity in their voices. Prime examples, Kevin Corn (Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu) as Daisuke and Luci Christian (Princess Tutu) as Risa. Then there’s the “I’m the most mature and serious character, but my voice doesn’t make you take me seriously”; such as the case of Greg Ayres’s (Nabari no Ou) Satoshi, who does make it work for him later on. Here’s the thing in all of this, D.N.Angel is more along the lines of after-school-special, so, in some circles, this kind of acting can be explained. And, eventually, the actors make due and it turns into a decent performance on all parts. Still doesn’t give it the best excuse in the world, but that’s all I got (so the dub was bad but that’s…. okay?). Some other known voice actors for D.N.Angel include: Illich Guardiola (Le Chevalier D’eon) as Krad (if I hear him yell “Dark” one more time, I am going to destroy the TV), Hilary Haag (Chrono Crusade) as Riku Harada, John Swasey (Soul Eater) as Daiki Niwa (and the only character I really enjoyed), Monica Rial (Gunslinger Girl) as Towa, and Jessica Boone (Azumanga Daioh) as Mio Hio. 
 
Now, since this month is all about good old Vic, it’s time to see where his performance stands in the anime. According to sources, his role as Dark Mousy is among one of his most well know voice acting roles (Along side Ed Elric and Tamaki), however, it’s not quite one of his best. He’s certainly is the best voice actor in the series and fits the role really well from start to finish. It’s just one of those things, like with Johnny Young Bosch with Ichigo from Bleach, I just hear Ed Elric in my ear the entire time. Don’t get me wrong, he’s not terrible, he could probably have done better though. If I have to grade his performance, I would give it a solid B because of the confidence and guile that was put into this role. In some circles, I believe D.N.Angel was just a prequel into what would soon become Vic’s real breakout role from Full Metal Alchemist. 
 
At the end of it all, D.N.Angel isn’t exactly the most well planned anime. From the animation to the voice acting, a lot of better choices could have been made to make the series even better! But it did give viewers the chance to look at the soon-to-be highly demanded voice actor, Vic Mignogna; and the budding romance between Daisuke and Riku was a fun one to watch. But, other than that, it’s an after-school-special and not very much of a stand out anime and can be completely forgettable. If you’re into cute romances and handsome thieves, then check it out. Be warned though, constant bleeding of the ears may occur.

          
 
       Helpful one of the best animes ever. lots of romance, and the music was awesome. it starts out a bit slow, in the first episode, i almost felt like i didnt want to continue. i continued anyways because i was bored. then i started to watch a bit more episodes and they got better and better. i dont understand why this anime got a 7 score. it deserves to get a better rank

First of all, The first season, The first season wasn't really that great It was Average/Mediocre for me. 
Mostly because at that time there were other school Idols anime which dominated the genre of School idol. But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point. 
 
It's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the μ's and want to perform at Love live, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it. 
 
The first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way. 
Sunrise has made a big chance in every part. 
 
This season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode. 
 
The story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal. 
Now that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and μ's story 
 
Like any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED. 
The music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with ""Snow Halation"" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment. 
 
The visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??). 
The CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched. 
 
Love live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks. 
Like i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season. 
 
Like any other anime It has come to it's end, the μ's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the μ's!

In life, people encounter different forms of happiness. Some people find it in the places they visit. Others discover it in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. And yet others still find it in the bonds of everlasting friendship. It's with this last part in mind that Love Live! School Idol Project 2 ""sets the stage."" When it comes to a feeling of togetherness, no other show comes close. 
 
STORY 
 
Love Live! 2 begins where the first left off. That is to say, the girls of Muse discover that a second Love Live is being hosted, and it is their goal to achieve their dream of conquering the ultimate School Idol prize. 
 
LL2's main focus is in its idols, singing, and dancing. And for the majority of the show, this focus is executed very well. The show's highlights are definitely the compositions that the girls sing and dance to. Many of the songs deal with the problems and feelings they are experiencing at that time. Whether it is about a sense of love or feeling the need to be the group they've always been, the songs do a wonderful job of capitalizing on the shows overall themes. 
 
With that said, what LL2 does better than LL1 is that it forgoes the misplaced melodrama. Instead, LL2 captures these beautiful emotional moments that leave the viewer both incredibly happy and extremely sad. I found myself getting towards the tears and burning throat when watching particular scenes, because after viewing the girls for so many episodes, their plight and their overwhelming love for one another really started to get to me. It's not something on the level of Clannad: After Story, but it is definitely hard not to get somewhat emotional over what is occurring. 
 
When the show isn't making you feel so down, it sticks to its method of comedy quite nicely. The show does a nice balance of character gags, jokes, and reactions that show-off the cute girls being cute. With the comedy, the show also delves more into its characters. It forms characterization for those that needed it and expanded upon those that already had it. I enjoyed this approach more, since it allowed me to see different sides to the girls than them just being cute. 
 
My teeny-tiny gripe with the story is in the ending. Not being shown anything afterwards, but if they somehow retcon what they did, it kind of defeats the purpose of the scenarios and events prior to it. I hope this isn't the case, but the way things are left off, I am led to believe that this is so. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Once again, LL2 does a fine job in the animation department. One of their best talents is in their facial expressions. They usually use more frames than needed (this is a good thing!), making their face movements more detailed than in other shows. The same can also be said for their general body movements as well. The show is not afraid to go all out in terms of animation. 
 
The same quality is again found in the dancing portions as well. I was a fan of the mix of CG and 2D from LL1, and I was a fan of the technique here as well. 
 
The art style itself is again rather plain, and the character designs are not terribly unique, but it's not something that should turn anyone off. One thing I found to have increased was the use of lighting. It seemed to have more of a presence this time around, such as with sunsets, night-time locations, and general sunny daytime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
LL2 features the same nine characters that it did in LL1, and the whole cast is quite likable. As with LL1, I'll focus on three (different) girls to talk about. 
 
Eli started off being the student council president and was rather stalwart in her ways in dealing with keeping the school open. But after joining Muse, she learns to not only integrate herself with others but also on how to have fun. She used to be rather strict and unforgiving, but the girls have her learn that sometimes just being with others can make your day that much brighter. She is one of the eldest in the group, and therefore one of the more mature and beautiful, so her character was always nice to see. 
 
""Nico-Nico-Ni!"" When you probably read this phrase, I hope you re-read it and performed its accompanying hand gestures! Nico is the girl who is both quite prideful but at the same time very sensitive to the things around her. She wasn't quick to accept that there were others just like her, but she realizes this season that the girls are not only their to further their own dreams but to further Nico's as well. Nico, over the course of the series, grows up from being a rather difficult to approach character to an understanding and caring one. It just took a few ""Nico-Nico-Ni's!"" to get there. 
 
Finally, one of my favorite characters from the show is Umi. Umi is serious, determined, and yet shy in certain situations. She looks out for everyone too, especially Honoka. While watching the show, she had some of the best reactions alongside Honoka. Plus, she's able to switch from being quite angry to severely cute in the blink of an eye. Muse literally couldn't have started without her and I'm glad that her character was as good as it is. 
 
Once again, LL2 does a nice job of displacing the screen-time among the entire cast. Nobody ever feels left out, and those that actually seemed to get less screen-time than usual actually got quite a bit more. None of the characters are to die for, but I still like them all the same. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP and the ED for LL2 follow the same pattern as the first season. That is, the OP is a School Idol song that is there to get you ""in the mood"" for the show while the ED is there to demonstrate the skills of the singers. I didn't enjoy these songs as much as LL1, but can still appreciate the work put into them. 
 
The soundtrack's most important elements are once again the rest of the School Idol tracks. My favorite is probably ""Snow Halation,"" but all of them were performed quite nicely and were amazing to listen to. I also thought the inclusion of the first OP was rather clever and a joy to hear once more. 
 
As a little aside, I feel like it is best to listen to all of the School Idol songs with the appropriate dance animations. Otherwise, I don't think you would get the full experience out of it. This is more of a personal feeling than a fact, so take it with a grain of salt. 
 
The voice acting is also wonderfully done by the whole cast once again. Each of the girls sings and acts their heart out, and I really couldn't ask for more than what we got. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
To be honest, I've never seen another idol show before this one. Going into this season, I knew what to expect: lots of laughs, great singing, and pretty darn good animation. What I didn't expect was the previously mentioned emotions that the show was able to elicit from me. I really like it when a show is able to make me feel enough to care about what is happening on-screen, and the show was able to accomplish this. 
 
I'm one of those dudes who likes to watch the cute girls do cute things. Honoka's infectious smile, Rin's cat-like way of talking, and Hanayo's pleas for help constantly put a smile on my face. One of my favorite moments from the show was their reenactment of each other's personalities. It was always funny to see them joke around with each other in these ways because the show does it so well. 
 
Most importantly, Love Live! School Idol Project Season Two does more than just making you feel happy, watching cute girls, or containing lots of singing and dancing. It leaves you with a sense of wanting more, and I truly hope to see the girls of Muse make their much needed return. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Good, both funny and emotional but with an unclear ending 
 
Animation: Good, art style is plain with nice dancing/non-dancing animation 
 
Characters: Good, more of the girls of Muse 
 
Sound: Great, OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs all performed exceptionally 
 
Enjoyment: Great, cute girls, dancing, and singing, who would have thought 
 
Final Score: 8/10

The second season of Love Live is... kinda meh, at least, compared to the first one. 
 
It started out with the same story quality as the first one. It has moments of interesting character development, while also having moments where the plot feels slightly contrived. A few times, characters seem to speak up to give them screen time or to steer the story in the 'right' direction, even if it's somewhat out of character. This particular point seems very prominent, either because I expected more or that's the way it really is. Anyway, no real disappointments here except in episode 9. 
 
Even though things seemed to be going fine, disaster befell the protagonists. Faced with overwhelming adversity, they still chose to press on helplessly. There was no hope. 
 
Suddenly, everything was okay. People had helped them even when, logically, their efforts would have been fruitless. Seriously, they could could surely try but it should not have been possible. 
 
It felt to me that they, the writers, wanted to up the stakes exceeding the previous season then realised they couldn't solve it realistically. 
It was still enjoyable though, plus, the last few episodes was what sold me on the previous season so I figured there was still hope. Episode 11 was headed in a hopeful direction with heartfelt moments. 
 
Episode 12 was okay up until the rather contrived ending with the overt intention to make people tear. Felt forced and didn't work. After what seemed to be a finale, episode 13 seemed to be to tie up all loose ends on a positive, if somewhat sad, note. Unfortunately, it was dragged out with several scenes and character actions meant to evoke sadness, but felt too forced to do so. 
 
Overall, it started okay and sometimes good at first, but the ending, among other things, was a letdown. 
7/10

Takayuki accepts Haruka's confession and the two become a couple, supported by their mutual friends Mitsuki Hayase and Shinji Taira. All is well for these friends—until tragedy strikes.  
 
One of them is sent to an unenviable fate, lying dormant in a coma. Three years later, they awaken, but their sudden reappearance in everyone's lives threatens to test the limits of these friends' bonds. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Kimi ga Nozomu Eien's story revolves around the main protagonist Takayuki Narumi, a male high school student. The first chapter, which takes place between July 6 and August 20, 1998, serves as a prologue to the second chapter. Takayuki is set up with Haruka Suzumiya by their friends Mitsuki Hayase and Shinji Taira. Takayuki ends up in bed with a nude sprawled out Haruka, but their relationship is not consummated due to performance anxiety. Mitsuki stops Takayuki on her birthday and has him buy her a ring, which results in him being late for his date with Haruka. At the end of the chapter, caused by Takayuki not being able to arrive in time, Haruka ends up in a coma because of an accident. In chapter two, during the three years since the accident, Mitsuki has been taking care of Takayuki and they have formed a relationship. Takayuki has also taken a part-time job at the Daikuuji (Sky Temple) family restaurant. Haruka's sister contacts Takayuki to tell him that Haruka has come out of her coma and is asking to see him.
","If you want a real tear jerker than this anime is for you!  Takayuki is in high school and is in love with a girl named Mitsuki only to have her friend Haruka fall in love with him.  So a love triangle starts.  The issue with this love triangle is that tragedy happens which will change the path of all their lives.  This anime is incredibly sad.  There are moments when it is almost awkward and you feel the tension between the characters.   
 
The reasons I liked this anime is because of the drama.  The very nature of the story has some level of reality to it. I could truly see it happening to typical high schoolers, or even the events that fall after highschool.  It isn't your typical anime and has a level of creativity that other anime have yet to touch on as well as being unique.  

          
 
       Helpful This is one of those animes that was absolutely flawless in its execution... but doesn't let the story or characters be what we want. This is a drama + romance + school anime that isn't a fairy tail love story. Without spoiling in the end, all I can say is that no matter who you like in this anime, you will be broken hearted by the end.No spoilers so everyone can enjoy this review. :) 
 
Story: 10/10 
It was FULL of drama and romance at every turn, the epitome of what a drama romance anime should be. It doesnt have dull moments or pointless filler. However, just because I rate the story highly... its an awful story. I hate what happens. Not that the story is written poorly, its just that I can not stand what is happening. Similar to an anime like School Days or Clannad... where you dislike what is happening or what is happening to the characters but it is INTERESTING and you cant put it down. So I just want to get that straight... the story is 10/10 but what goes on inside the story is SO crappy, and I hated it.  
 
Art: 7/10 
It's fairy cute with a strong 2000s vibe - as it should as a 2003 anime. It's not awful and I enjoyed it (I love that 2000s art after all) but its nothing to hype over.  
 
Sound: 6/10 
Soundtrack is pretty much just background noise. It's alright, and pretty expected of the 2003 anime, but nothing special. I wouldnt mind listening to the soundtrack over again though. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Theres three main characters. I wont say who is who... but... One I LOVE. This character is perfect all around and enjoyable and likeable. The other two are disgusting and I hate for different reasons. HOWEVER, just because they are bad people doesnt mean they didn't play their role perfectly in this romantic drama, which they did. The reason horrible things happened in this anime was because of these two... no they didn't kill anyone lol. The characters are well developed and are solid characters... I just don't like them because of what they do. You'll know who is who after a while. XD 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I know I keep saying I hated this anime, well I do... but you cant always like what goes down in a drama anime. Especially when its paired with romance. The ending was completely painful and emotional... but it was the only ending that really made sense.  
 
Overall: 
This anime was enjoyed NO DOUBT... but I still can't believe all the things that happened... this anime is a must watch for hopeless romantics who want a deep PAMDS and to be emotionally scarred forever. Maybe not forever, but at least for a while. If you love drama and romance, this is a perfect anime. It is a 10/10 anime... and like I said absolutely amazing... but you'll hate what is happening and wish you could change it! But thats romance for you!  
It's too incredibly emotional for words and will make your heart go </3

       Helpful rumbling hearts. just watched it a little while ago and this really made me fucking sad and depressed as hell in a good way, this is pretty refreshing to me haven't watch an anime that is pretty moving and at the same time a story close to real life.  
 
rumbling hearts is an anime that  reminds me of how being an adult really fucks you up so bad and events in your life that you think is irrelevant at first could drastically change your life and shape you to a whole new person. plus it reminds me that the past will bite you in the ass. 
 
[spoiler=review and reactions]  
 
synopsis: 
rumbling hearts revolves around 4 ordinary students.  
 
Narumi - really nice guy. kind but too kind. guy that i'm sympathetic with. you won't get a hint of douchebaggery on him. his put with so much shit that he completely becomes insane in some point 
 
Mitsuki - athletic beautiful long haired girl. many guys courts her but he all refused them. Haruka's best friend. swimming prodigy champion been on news papers and expected to be on the Olympics when she graduates  
 
Haruka - fragile high-school girl who loves to read books. secretly in love with Narumi.  
 
Shinji - Narumi's bestfriend very supportive with Narumi. This guy is a bro. (BRO'S FO LYF MOTHAFOCKAZZZZZZ!!!!)  
 
they are all experiencing the so called rosy high school life, but it seems that having a rosy high school life sometimes is a pain in the ass when friends hides somethings from you, as they say too much kindness is cruel.  
 
story: 
it's starts with Mitsuki befriending narumi and shinji to let Haruka become closer to Narumi, in the end Mitsuki succeeds after 5 freakin years and the 4 of them becomes inseparable. 1 day Mitsuki called out Narumi and said that she needs to say something important. narumi waited on his favorite spot, a tree in the back of his school with a really good shade and view, while waiting for Mitsuki.  
 
Narumi is thinking that Mitsuki might be confessing to him but rather than Mitsuki appearing, instead haruka appeared, narumi thought it will be a meeting of the 4 of them but instead haruka confessed to him narumi didn't answer. haruka started crying, then narumi remembered mitsuki's face as we now know that narumi really likes mitsuki but still said yes to haruka's proposal seeing Haruka cry, Mitsuki being the one who planned this for them, the poor bastard narumi can't really refused now since in narumi's head that's a sign that mitsuki has zero feelings for him and just sees him as a friend as kind as a person narumi is he accepts haruka feelings and moves on.  
 
but what narumi doesn't know is that mitsuki has feelings for him secretly. everything is fine and dandy and everyone is ready to move on but a certain tragedy occurred and that's where the shitstorm starts. 
 
while dating, narumi and haruka was supposed to meet in a certain place. accidentally, narumi bump into mitsuki and they had a little chit chat. like friends narumi teased mitsuki how is she with his boyfriend, mistuki answered that she has none and got no time for that, but she likes a boy who said that her hair should look good if it's shorter (which is not . F-U! narumi!!) then narumi said that he and haruka is on a date and haruka is waiting and natsuki told narumi that it's her birthday today they chat and chat and narumi said she'll just apologized to haruka and explained that it's natsuki's b-day today after all haruka had the same experience before about narumi being late because of natsuki asking for narumi's help and of course haruka will understand since natsuki and haruka has been bestfriend longer than narumi and shinji.  
 
narumi and Mitsuki kinda stroll a little bit and Mitsuki saw a ring being sold in the streets and joke around if narumi could buy that for her since it her b-day. narumi refused sarcastically but in the end he bought the ring for Mitsuki and they laugh and parted ways. while in the train-station narumi hurriedly  go to the meeting place where he and haruka is supposed to meet.  
 
Narumi was looking for Haruka he saw some people pilling up in a certain area, he saw an ambulance and kinda wants to see what happening there, worried, Narumi try to force himself inside the crowed while searching for Haruka, he shouted for Haruka's name but no reply then he saw the scene. he saw a phone-booth nearly crushed with blood all over the place and he saw a familiar thing a ribbon that looks like from Haruka then a paramedic confirms who was the victim and Narumi in his head prays that it isn't Haruka but when the paramedic read the school I.D it confirms that it was really Haruka.  
 
the 3 of them rushed in the hospital including Shinji. while waiting for any news Narumi blames himself for being late(that's why Japanese people are always in time) if he came in time or earlier Haruka wouldn't be in this situation. while Narumi is thinking like that, Mitsuki is blaming herself because if she hadn't delayed Narumi's date with Haruka this wouldn't happened.  
 
3 years has passed. the 3 of them has moved on. but unlike before there is something that change the relationship of the 3 of them. while Haruka is on a coma Shinji is kinda much more distanced with Narumi and Mitsuki. of course this will happened because Shinji is 1 of the guys that confessed to Mitsuki in her high-school days and got turned down. (to be clear Shinji confessed to Mitsuki when he heard that Haruka and Narumi is dating. BRO'S FO LYF MOTHAFOCKAZZZZZZ!!!!!!) and to give Shinji a reason to go far away as much as he can it's because that Narumi and Mitsuki has become lovers that it's so close that they are like wife and a husband. there relationship is so serious as fuck that it reeks with maturity and when I mean mature they work, they talk, they have sex,they support each other in a very mature way, YOU WON'T SEE ANY ECHHI HENTAI CLICHE SHIT ON THIS ONE. no daame!  Iyaaa!  Narumi-kun ecchi tehee! shit like that in this one. they ARE REALLY FUCKIN SERIOUS WITH THERE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
now for the reason why Mitsuki and Narumi got together, blame the parents of Haruka.  
 
Mitsuki is so broken that I wanna give her a hug shiiiiiittttt. she lost everything and the most broken character in the series. T.T 
 
now that's just a summarizes pretty much the story of rumbling hearts. 
 
rumbling isn't for everyone. i believe rumbling hearts is much enjoyable to watch if your age is on the verge of transitioning to adulthood or higher it will really make you connect with them but if you are old and jaded It can't do shit for you man. you watched to much real drama in real lyf. lol 
 
reaction and negative criticism: 
 
 rumbling hearts can be a masterpiece if they kinda make the scenes much more dramatic and other scenes should be more explained. like for example. the coma of haruka- they should have made a scene that haruka known the truth that it already passed 3 years now but she becomes unstable and her memory resets when someone tells her the truth. and that where narumi enters and haruka gets better and remembers more better when narumi visits and lies to haruka that it's only a few months since the accident. 
 
for an anime like this. it's pretty old like old as hell they use betamax tapes for this one and some viewers may not like it because of that. 
 
if rumbling hearts had a scene that kinda like in clannad that everyone turns back in time but not literally but just thinking of what if. what if Mitsuki was honest in her feelings in the first place. what if narumi confessed to Mitsuki. what if Mitsuki didn't bothered narumi on his date going to haruka. what if they are all in the same university. what if they are all the same like before scenario. 
 
not sure if the Bluray and the normal episodes are different but i suggest you watch the blueray one since it has the sex scene of haruka and narumi before the accident and that's pretty crucial. and some other sex scene on why akane hates Mitsuki.  
 
about Narumi visiting Haruka in the hospital. remember that he is doing this for months or even more. just think about that. that's why Narumi and Mitsuki is beyond their wits that they feel like going insane, scared ,pressured, responsible sometimes doubt i wasn't surprised when the two of them breakdown to the pressure. 
 
if rumbling hearts have a little bit of emotion squeeze on it and a scene like that just like Mitsuki is always saying this anime will surely be a masterpiece for me. 
 
special mention for Daikuuji YEAHHH Daikuuji for the win!!![/spoiler]

It does deal with a lot of heavy perversions ranging from S&M, male rape (by a bunch of females, that is), bondage, torture, yuri (lesbian love) and incest. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Parody', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Hentai', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Yuri']","Cream Lemon is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including fantasy, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, mecha, magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the Cream Lemon series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.
Cream Lemon often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.

First of all I'd like to get this out of the way; THIS IS PORN. The characters and plot are all there as a set up to sex. This being said, if I only watched it for porn why would I choose to watch Cream Lemon as opposed to millions of videos on numerous websites of an unsavory nature? The reason is that this is much more than porn. With unique and strangely appealing storylines, fantastic visuals, and good audio, Cream Lemon has become a classic of all anime, not just of the hentai genre. 
 
That being said, during the sexually explicit scenes, some of the fetishes (especially the bondage in the Escalation series), can be a bit overwhelming and detract severely from anything that makes this show anything but pornography. 
 
I have only seen the first 16 episodes however, because these are the only ones available (that I could find) with English subtitles. Also this series may prove difficult to obtain and I was only able to find it through torrents. 
 
Cream Lemon is an episodic show with new characters and different settings in each episode with the exception of a few multi-episode series. The stories surrounding each episode are extremely varied ranging from science fiction (Star Trap and Pop Chaser) to World War II era Japan (Black Cat Mansion) to pure fantasy (the Rall series) although most if not all of the other episodes feature some aspects of school in them. 
 
The animation in Cream Lemon is superbly done and even looks good today despite being created in the 80's. The motion of characters is generally fluid although there are many sex scenes which do not always hold up to this standard. I would like to draw specific attention to the animation in ""Black Cat Mansion"" (episode 11) which was simply spectacular and brought out the story in very vivid detail. The only episode which was particularly unappealing in terms of design was the first episode of the two-part Mako series in which faces were just plain ugly or expressions were animated rather lazily. 
 
In general the music was enjoyable and featured many piano pieces (especially in the escalation series) but also had some guitar stuff and, of course, had porno music going on during sex scenes. 
 
I can't really say much about the characters being exciting or anything for the most part as their primary function was to lead to the sexual encounters between themselves and others. Almost all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. Some characters are enjoyable due to their personalities or due to the inherent humor of the episodes. 
 
What I enjoyed most about Cream Lemon and watching it episodically were the differences between episodes. Some could be very funny and a few made me LOL a few times (Pop Chaser, Star Trap and Narisu Scramble). In some of the episodes the plots were so surreal in fact that you could even laugh at the premises of them even if the episodes themselves were not explicitly humorous. 
 
Others had decidedly good plots despite being only to facilitate sex. An example of this is the Ami series which, if there were no sexually explicit scenes, easily comes off as simply a drama, albeit possessing a plot which involves an incestuous relationship. Another is the Rall series which focuses more on action scenes (scenes which did NOT involve sex) and in my opinion had less focus on explicit sex even though there were several scenes in which it did surface. This is about a village being attacked by a great evil (who wants to violate the women obviously) and a mythic heroine who must save them.  
 
Overall this series is worth watching once and I feel that at least one or two episodes would be appealing to the average male (I doubt females would have any interest whatsoever). Thank you for reading :)

          
 
       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in  
the 80s and though most of it's stories are absolutely abhorrent, it is indeed, interesting to see how a multitude of genres are coming together and being integrated here while the scenes act as side stories that the characters develop from. It seems that what ""Cream Lemon"" wants to accomplish is anything from what people usually expect out of your prototypical hentai series, by trying to incorporate a tons of characters and signifiers that would give more meaning to the sexual content or sort of avoid having the sexual content become too much of a repetitive arena and distraction for the narrative. Instead of throwing in a sex scene in just because, 'Lemon' wants it's viewers to think and analyze about the content, enjoying it for non-perverted reasons too. That being said, I don't recommend watching the entire series but, I do recommend giving at least, a few episodes a try just to see what the craziness is really like.

       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in  
the 80s and though most of it's stories are absolutely abhorrent, it is indeed, interesting to see how a multitude of genres are coming together and being integrated here while the scenes act as side stories that the characters develop from. It seems that what ""Cream Lemon"" wants to accomplish is anything from what people usually expect out of your prototypical hentai series, by trying to incorporate a tons of characters and signifiers that would give more meaning to the sexual content or sort of avoid having the sexual content become too much of a repetitive arena and distraction for the narrative. Instead of throwing in a sex scene in just because, 'Lemon' wants it's viewers to think and analyze about the content, enjoying it for non-perverted reasons too. That being said, I don't recommend watching the entire series but, I do recommend giving at least, a few episodes a try just to see what the craziness is really like.

4,2042,108,6.868925385,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Five Star Stories,"Amaterasu is the god of light, the future emperor of the Joker Star System. Under the guise of young mecha conceptor Ladios Sopp, he is compelled by an old friend, Dr Ballanche, to save his two latest Fatimas Lachesis and Clotho. And so began the stories of the Joker System, as well as Amaterasu's love for Lachesis.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","The Five Star Stories takes its name from the Joker Star Cluster where the stories take place. The star cluster is made up of four stars: Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern. The ""fifth star"" is a large comet named Stant that passes through that sector of space every 1,500 years pulling with it its own collection of orbiting planets.
In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the ""Super Empire"", controlled all 4 solar systems of the Joker Cluster. They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Cluster. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for ""Joker Calendar"" and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized.
The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered ""fatimas"" are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar heads that dominate the battlefields. Warfare between nations is commonplace and few still hope for peace.
Mortar heads are the combat mainstays of the Joker Universe. They are mecha which require superhuman reflexes and skill to control, and are therefore only utilized by headliners with Fatima copilots. Fatimas are humanoid creatures genetically engineered for a life of service on the battlefield. Fatimas are necessary copilots for mortar heads and mentally merge with the computer systems of these devastating machines to control weapons, communications and other vital processes. As such, Fatimas are designed to have computational skills rivaling any computer.
As of the 2013 May issue of Newtype, the setting of FSS has changed to fit the lore of Mamoru Nagano's 2012 film Gothicmade. MH (Mortar Headd) has been renamed GTM (GothicMade), while Fatimas have been renamed AF (Automatic Flowers).
","It's a beautiful show, with distinctive character designs and richly drawn backgrounds.  And the prettiest of pretty-boy main characters to boot.  And yet...  
   
The thing is, Five Star Stories is a very long-running and popular manga series.  In fact, so long running is that it started in 1986, and is still coming out three decades later.  It's a massive exercise in world building (or, rather in this case, multi-solar-system building), with a back-story that stretches past a thousand years, far too many characters to count, and intertwining machinations that would take hours to explain.  Think Dune.  Think Legend of Galactic Heroes.  It's a massive amount of material.   
   
And here, you have a single, one-hour OVA, to cover it all.  Or, to be more succinct, to introduce it all.     
   
An almost impossible task, and unfortunately it shows.  There's a ton of exposition that has to take place, all sorts of explaining of concepts and people, and it's a whole lot to take in at once.  You spend half the time just trying to suss out who is doing what and why, and it never really sinks in.     
   
I guess if this whets your appetite, this is to entice you to check out the manga.  Which, was probably half the intention of this one-shot OVA in the first place.

          
 
       Helpful The Five Star Stories is a notoriously complex and detailed manga by Nagano Mamoru, who also worked on L-Gaim, a mecha show that Yoshiyuki Tomino fans should be familiar with.  
 
 
The movie, however, had minimal involvement from Nagano, and only tells the story of the first 3 or so volumes of the manga or the first ""book"" released here in the U.S. and so by the end it feels like it has just set the stage for an epic, interstellar adventure filled with androids, robots, and androgynous gods. And that's it. That's where it stops. This could be seen as a major flaw, and it is, for those who don't ever plan on reading the manga. For those who have had the pleasure to experience the story on paper though, this movie is a great visual treat. The story we get to see is nothing but an introduction, so it does feel a bit weak, even if there is an action packed climax at the end. 
 
 
The art style gives away the era it is from quite easily, and will invoke nostalgia in many veteran anime viewers, and possibly repulsion by those newer and more spoiled. The mech design, though barely seen here is fantastic. I can't stress enough how amazing Nagano's mechanical designs are. If you can get this movie in 1080p, DO IT! 
 
 
The music from what I remember was great, the notes that bombard your ears as soon as the title screen shows up is very fitting for the type of story this is. The theme played in the credits is catchy and again, very nostalgic for its era. 
 
The characters are all great, and I love them. But this is from the perspective of one who has read the manga. You don't get to really see their full potential here, but there are some glimpses of what they may become.  
 
 
This movie is just fun to watch, I wouldn't say it's the pinnacle of cel animation, I'd shift more towards ""Do You Remember Love?"" for that, but this is definitely up there. For those interested in this series, I recommend this movie as an introduction, then the manga as a followup. Grab yourself every artbook you can find, I know there's gigabytes of material out there, they're all worth it, Nagano is fantastic. 
 
 
Any fan of mecha, especially of the fantastic variety (Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Dunbine) should look into this series. You won't regret it. 


          
 
       Helpful If you're into sci-fi/mecha-related anime from the 80s chances are you are aware of the existence of Five Star Stories and you're probably wondering whether to watch it or not.  
 
This will be a fairly short review wherewith I will try to answer this question. For those of you who don't have time nor patience to read the full review, here's a short answer: no, just don't. For the rest of you, here's why you should avoid this anime and save 1 hour of your life that can be spent in so many better ways. 
 
There isn't much to say, actually. The story is a complete mess: a weak and rushed plot that explains almost nothing (and the few things that are explained are confused and not well developed) is a bad thing on its own, but if you add no character development at all... well, you have a bad anime. And that's what it is: not horrible, not trash, it's just a bad anime that isn't worh to be watched. 
 
Interesting mecha and ship design and decent animation aren't enough to save it from a 4 out of 10, and the character design is weird. This anime offers no enjoyment so don't even bother and just ignore it.

Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don't believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new ""Disco Queen"" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she's too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho's dreams just might come true!",['Shoujo'],none,"I would like to write to you about how Harbor Light is a touching Cinderella-like story where a young girls dreams come true due to her determination and hard work.  I would like to say that Harbor Light is a nostalgic piece that will remind you of the glorious decade of the 80s, where leotards, legwarmers, disco, and the moonwalk reigned supreme.  I can’t say any of those things because this anime sucks. 
 
Whatever you read on MAL regarding this anime plot summery is not accurate.  Yes it’s about a young girl named Miho, you won’t ever forget her name because it’s written on her shirt.  Miho dreams of being a fashion designer but doesn’t get along with her designer Aunt or cousins, well because they are bitches.  Apparently they are resentful because her father left her in their care while he was deployed in the Navy.  I thought it was a great reason too.  The big event in town is a disco dance in which all the lovely ladies will dance the night away in fabulous dresses.  Miho has one cousin who isn’t a complete scumbag and wants her to design a dress for her.  Sounds like a mildly interesting starting point for a story right?  Nope because this is where the story takes a turn for the nonsensical.  The town mayor’s son has returned to town.. from prison I suppose we are lead to believe.  Apparently everything his father does pisses him off but not more than the Disco Queen competition.  He gathers his gang and proceeds to terrorize the town.  Never are we ever given any real explanation for his actions or any resolution to that part of the storyline. 
 
To say that Harbor Lights characters are dull and lethargic would be an understatement.  Miho is boring and uninteresting as a character.  In a lot of ways the way she lives and is treated reminded me of the movie ""The Little Princess"".   She lives in a drab room and his constantly talked down to by her aunt and cousins and forced to do menial tasks and chores.  Her family does some very cruel things to her that seemingly is completely forgotten by the time the anime ends.  She even finds herself treated nicely and living in a beautiful room just in time for her father to return.  It just made me disgusted but seems to be a theme in some anime from this era.  A character will be treated horribly but another and end up being friends with them.  Now while this isn’t a terrible thing, often the things done to them were so horrible that no one with any self respect or esteem would forgive it. The rest of the cast is what truly earns this show the pathetic rating I gave it.  They are all so unlikeable and dull as a group.  None of them stand out at all besides the fact that I hated them. 
 
About the only thing you can say remotely positive (I guess) is if you really want to feel some old nostalgia from the 80s.  I cringed when I looked at the fashions and heard the music.  It brought back memories and stirred old feelings, mostly.. what the hell were we thinking?  If you’re a child of the 80s too and remember any of it then you will probably get some laughs out of it as well.  The art style is as one would expect from this era.  I don’t care for it but this is how anime was drawn so I can’t say it’s really bad. 
 
If you’re thinking about seeing this... don’t.  There is nothing to recommend at all.  I warned you. 


          
 
       Helpful Harbor Light Monogatari - Fashion Lala Yori is a slap in the face to pretty much all common sense in story telling.  From the opening you can tell this anime is having a serious identity crises.  The opening consists of assorted jumble of scenes from 1980’s jazzercise to some really fairly odd science fiction space shots.  This mishmash pretty much sums up a lot of this anime as it tries to mesh together a whole lot of things that just don’t work.  It also features more conflicting moods then a temperamental two year old. 
 
On one hand you have a pseudo Cinderella story about the main character Miho who is living with her ill-tempered Aunt and her three snide cousins while her father is away.  This part of the story seems the most fairly tale like, and with Miho wondering around a seaside town with her dog delivering packages for her Aunt’s business and hoping to make a dress for her one cousin to wear in the upcoming Disco Queen contest.  This part of the anime has an almost dreamy like quality to it and has the most potential to be something cute to bad it's all lost in a giant flushing toilet of bewilderment. 
 
Then there is other plot of the town Mayor’s son coming back into town.  At first he seems the typical bad boy who is just a little rough around the edges and with a soft spot in his heart but then he transforms in to heartless terrorist.  Seriously, I am not kidding!  They bring him in to a place in the story where you think it a might creepy but not insanely out of place (for an anime) love interest for our little Miho, but it just turns out he is a cold hearted bastard and gang leader.  Who was so scared by his father and sister, he now must blow up the town’s Disco Queen Contest.  Really, still not kidding!  His character is never really fleshed out more then that, and what starts out fitting in the dream like quality of the anime ends up being so over the top and out of place it’s just amusing. 
 
There are several other mash ups fitted into this short OVA that never seem to get there fill of screen time.  Several places early on in the story seem like it’s going to take it some where else then it ends up going to, they would have been far nicer places really.  It almost seems like the creators wanted to do a longer story but got stuck with forty-five minutes and decided to fit all the bits and pieces they liked best into it. 
 
The art used in this story is also a jumble of 1980's anime style.  Most of the characters are pretty normal looking with natural hair colors except for Miho's which is purple, uh ok, sure she has the rare purple hair gene.  Style wise though up to a point everyone looks like a normal person from a small town, from the 80's, but still they still conform.  It isn't until the mayor's son picks up his fellow town misfits/terrorists who look like bad rejects from a discarded Streets of Rage game.  Sure they still look 80's but they look more like Fist of the North Star or Mad Max then fitting in a cute story about a young girl who wants to do fashion.  I also have to mention something I really did like was the background art, it was very charming and pleasant feel to it, with lots of nice detail showing the town off.  Sadly it wasn't used in a better anime.  
 
All that being said, I still really enjoyed this anime.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s terrible, it really is, but I couldn’t look away and while I was watching it. It starts out with a kind of cute 1980’s charm but then turns into a insane schizophrenic mess at the end it’s hard to look away.  I can’t recommend this for everyone, but for anyone who likes something that is so bad it’s good, I think they will get great enjoyment out of this.

          
 
       Helpful And thus, a new magical girl was born!    
   
Except, well, no, not really.  Knowing very little about this OVA from 1988, I suppose it was to kick-start a new 'magical girl' franchise.  But if that was the case, it really didn't take off -- at least not for a FULL decade later, when a short-lived not-really-the-same anime series and manga series came and went without much of a splash in 1998.   
   
Maybe it was because this OVA was pretty bad.  A mayor and his rebellious son clash over a fashion show.  Young little Cinderella...er, I mean Miho...gets caught up in the middle.  Scorned by her older sisters and dreaming of being a fashion designer and model, can this clumsy but strong-headed nine year old suddenly transform into a magical girl, win over the town and save the fashion idol contest?  I think we all know the answer.   
   
Formulaic plot, but the actual story that fills out that plot is nothing to write home about.  The artwork is kinda meh, the dancing scenes are laughably poorly done, the music I don't even remember.  This is a totally forgettable, throwaway OVA.  I mean, if you want magical girls, there's plenty of other better shows to choose from.

4,1116,110,6.810054008,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Junkers Come Here,"This heartwarming and unexpectedly mature story concerns a young girl named Hiromi Nozawa and her dog, Junkers (pronounced Yoon-kers). Hiromi walks us through her childhood troubles of love, schooling, and family bonds. Her companion Junkers accompanies her on this adventure; however, Junkers is no ordinary dog—he can talk and grant 3 wishes. ","['Slice of Life', 'Drama']",none,"Junkers, Come Here encompasses everything that is great about animation. 
 
The movie sticks close to the reality we know and avoids topical and epochal content while still using animation effectively to depict scenes that would otherwise be difficult, expensive, or uncanny in other media. While the story it tells is typical, the writing, soundwork, and pacing of the scenes demonstrate mastery of craft. While neither being a dramatic film nor a comedy, Junkers manages to constantly deliver scenes which are wholeheartedly funny, moving, and entertaining. The characters and story deliberately avoid feeling artificial, and even with the inclusion of a talking dog, the movie's universe feels completely like our own. 
 
Movie gems like this are the reason I keep watching anime. Rare is it to find a movie which can sincerely entertain me for every second of its runtime and leave me feeling good after reflecting on the experience.

          
 
       Helpful This heartwarming family film focuses on a young girl named Hiromi dealing with the complications within her family alongside her pet talking dog, Junkers. The film believably deals with the issues of divorce and parental absence that effect Hiromi in this film, issues that you wouldn't find touched upon in many family or children's films. Both of Hiromi's parents have areas of work that require them to have days to weeks at a time away from home and Hiromi is normally cared for by her tutor and family maid. While the young girl puts on the facade of not minding the work of her family, her dog and tutor can tell that the distance with her parents hurts her emotionally and the movie creates a coming-of-age theme out of Hiromi's situation with her parents. Hiromi behaves believably for a girl of her age and gets enough fleshing-out where one can connect with the problems she faces throughout the movie. 
 
At the same time though, the anime deals with the issues in enough of a light-hearted and mature way where the content won't alienate or insult the intelligence of its wide audience. The anime mixes in its fun moments and jokes involving Hiromi and Junkers' interactions with one another to lighten the mood at points and has some magical elements thanks to Junkers that contribute to the anime's heartwarming moments. The combination of fun and serious elements give Junkers Come Here its strong charm and excellent quality for a family anime film that some could mistaken for a Studio Ghibli film with the similar themes and animation style from the studio's films used for this movie. 
 
Speaking of animation, the backgrounds to Junkers Come Here used a soft pastel-like drawing style that are beautiful to look at, are well detailed and add to the film's gentle mood. Character designs are a bit on the simple side, but are drawn to make the characters look lifelike and not feature the big-eye or ridiculous hair styles and colors found within many popular and well-known anime titles. The soundtrack mostly consists of light and whimsical music pieces that do their part in enhancing both the fun and serious moments found throughout the film. 
 
Overall, Junkers Come Here made for quite the engaging and touching anime family film offering a nice balance of fun and serious moments in the exploration of Hiromi's family issues and the girl learning to be honest with her family in expressing her feelings on the dilemma. It is definitely worth adding to your collection and even a film worth showing to your children if you have any. 

          
 
       Helpful This is an anime for all the latchkey kids out there. This is an anime for everyone that has sat alone at an empty table eating microwaved dinners night after lonesome night.  This is an anime for all the people that grew up in broken families, where stony silences and frigid stares were the main means of communicating. And this, sadly, is an anime for me, someone who spent the majority of his childhood, desperately trying to reconcile two hostile parents that couldn't stand to be in the same room as one another. I too spent many late nights waiting to hear that car pull into the driveway or that key rattle in the lock. It's the reason I was drawn to reviewing this anime, because the anime resonated with me on a personal level. I'm also reviewing this anime with the hope that my words will influence a few readers to give this film a chance. It's closing in on its 20th anniversary, it's won awards for best animated film, and yet still fewer than 1000 people have completed it on MAL. 
	 
 
Story: (8/10) Now I hope I didn't discourage anyone with my introduction. Even those that can't relate to the opening will still be touched by this remarkably poignant and moving film. Both slice of life and drama, this story tells the tale of a young girl named Hiromi and her pet dog, Junkers. With her grandmother recently deceased, her mother working deep into the night, her father constantly away on business, and a lack of friends at school, Hiromi finds herself struggling with loneliness and a feeling of abandonment.  Junkers is her only constant companion, and we quickly learn that Junkers is no ordinary dog... Junkers can talk! When people hear talking dog, instantly they pigeon hole the film as a kiddy movie, but this film tackles serious and difficult issues. Divorce, abandonment, sacrifice, and being true to oneself are each explored in this surprisingly emotional story. Importantly though, the film manages to avoid falling into the trap of being melodramatic. The drama is never overblown to the point where it becomes unrealistic.  
	 
 
Characters: (9/10) Hiromi takes up the lion's-share of the screen time, and her character is more than up for the task. Her character is beautifully developed through out the film, and its very easy to empathize with her pain. Outwardly Hiromi struggles to convince the world that she's perfectly fine. She portrays a happy, confident, precocious girl to all who meet her. The truth behind the mask is that she's really breaking down inside, and the weight of wearing it day in and day out only makes her misery worse. Junkers is an interesting character as well. He plays the naive, well-meaning friend, but perhaps he's more than he seems... The parents aren't given enough screen time to really develop much, which is unfortunate, but fits into the theme of the absentee parents. I haven't mentioned the boarder that's living with them yet. His relationship with Hiromi becomes quite interesting, and he may be the second best character in the film. And last but not least is the housekeeper, who provides wonderful comic relief. 
 
Animation: (6/10) Even if we give the film some leeway due to its age, the animation can only be described as average. The frames per second seem to be slightly on the low side, and some of the movements lack smoothness. The character models are simple, yet effective. The facial expressions work well to aid the story. The backgrounds and sets are very plain, but this isn't the type of film that requires beautiful and detailed artwork to carry it. The simple artwork lets the story and the characters become the stars of the film.  
 
Sound: (8/10) The soundtrack for the film is decent, but not remarkable. I thought the voice acting was superb though. Hiromi's voice actor did a fabulous job, and was always able to convey her characters emotions to the viewer. I also really liked the maid's voice actor as well. 
 
Overall: (8/10) Again, I couldn't recommend this film enough to anyone that enjoys a good drama or coming of age movie. After I watched this movie, I was really shocked it was as unpopular as it was. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I promise you won't be disappointed!

","Hulaing Babies is a new short anime with a really simple not particularly compelling narrative about a hula club. What this show does have that makes it worth watching for me is a cool aesthetic I've never seen anywhere else some nice visual flow, creative animation and something pretty dang important for anything I'm watching on the basis of visuals, it has more than enough new visuals each ep to make it worth it. Whether it's some art style changes to something really cool looking for a scene, new characters with cool designs, creative animation, or something else, there is for me at least, always enough new things each episode visually to definitely justify the 5min watch time. And to round this out I'm going to mention the charming ED were this guy floats in the air spins and tells a kinda funny story while playing the ukulele. So in conclusion I would recommend checking this out to anyone who wants something visually fresh and cool.

       Helpful Hulaing Babies is fun and nothing else. 
 
It's a psychedelic trip, crazy, wacky and ultimately meaningless.  
Narratively there isn't much going on than what's said in the synopsis, but that's hardly why it's enjoyable. 
 
Hyper condensed fun and aesthetically dreamlike. 
There isn't much animation in terms of frames, but the colour palette and editing make up for this. Its high energy editing keeps things moving and entertaining. The characters have personalities that bounce off each other - sometimes literally thanks to the editing. Everything looks fantastic. Character designs work in perfect synergy with one another whilst complementing the dreamy background art. 
 
The comedy is character-driven and visually spastic.  
There are mostly multiple things happening at a given time. 2 characters having a conversation about something random and in the background, other characters will be doing their own thing. Either playing cat and mouse or bouncing off the walls. At least 1 thing is funny. 
 
The ED is banter. 
Just some dad playing a ukulele sharing some humorously dark stories about his failed marriage and daughter issues, maintaining a light-hearted tone while laughing about it, that feels totally out of place and it's fucking hilarious. Simultaneously acts as a break to calm you down and prepare you for the next episode, do not skip it.  
 
Watch it, you'll like it.

","Initially I was reluctant to watch this series because I thought it'd be depressing, but glad I didn't linger on that assumption.  
 
They did a very nice job balancing Benio's fresh personality from the first movie imo, while occasionally revealing her struggles and gradual changes in adapting to a new reality. It's done in a non-depressing manner and fits Benio's character really well; another thing I'm glad about, how they didn't just hop on the typical shoujo depression trend. There's some tropes that would've been annoying, but it's directed very straightforwardly so to speak so it's not dwelled on to the point that brings frustration.  
 
Just a heads up because I've been fooled way too many times by shows not having tragedy tags when it really should've been-- this isn't a tragedy.  
 
I wish they adapted more from the manga on Benio's interactions with other characters (minor or not) so we see a more wholesome image of her as an individual, but it's understandable they couldn't from the limitations of movies. Overall, it's very relaxing to watch, puts one in a good mood too (at least for me).

","I watched this movie at the Akibapass Festival in Frankfurt, Germany. First of all, I have to say that I'm not familiar with the original source (published from 1975 to 1979) or the older anime series, which aired from 1978 to 1979. As it is I cannot compare it to these works and watched it completely unaffected and without any previous knowledge, besides the information which has been included in the trailer. Though as it is written on the manga source page, Haikara-san ga Tooru won the first Kodansha Manga Award for shoujo in 1977, so likely it has been very good as well.  
 
The story is put-together enjoyable and the art of storytelling has been made in a very lovely way. The transition between different scenes was often in such a smooth way that you just had to smile at how it was done. As the genre allocation of this anime says Comedy, Historical, Romance, and Shoujo, you get exactly that. I laughed or smiled a lot, while I was watching this movie and as I experienced it at the cinema I was surely not the only one with this expression aka impression of this movie. The historical aspects are also depicted quite well and one or the other scene reminded me of pictures I've seen before (in preparation for a presentation I made) about this era. Also, I haven't seen such a pure romance shoujo for a while, which means some scenes have been worked out almost unrealistically perfect or smooth. But still very enjoyable and sweet. For sure something recommendable for romanticists. 
 
The art was clean, consistent and very lovely. I wouldn't describe it as the most artistic outstanding work ever, but it really was enjoyable. As I've seen this movie only once yet, I cannot further go into detail with this point.  
 
The creators have taken great care of this production. The character design and composition also make it very enjoyable.  
 
As it is Part 1 out of two movies, the story is not yet concluded but the first movie is in its own a great work and is not only the introduction to a bigger following story. 
 (Like some other multi-part movies have been created.) 

          
 
       Helpful Let me ask you: Have you ever heard of an old manga called Haikara-san ga Tooru? Yeah, me either. Not until this, at least. Anyway, the original manga by Waki Yamato, which ran from 1975 to 1977, actually had a bit of a rough history with animation. It was adapted into a TV series from 1978 to 1979 and received 42 episodes. It was apparently supposed to be longer, but from what I've heard, it got cancelled due to low ratings, and as a result, the anime had to end in a different way than the manga. Ever since then, it just sort of faded into obscurity, as nobody ever really talked about it. The manga and the anime series were never licensed in the US, likely due to their old age and old school artstyle. Considering all of these things going against it, it seemed that Haikara-san ga Tooru would be left into the darkness forever, never to be seen again. 
 
OR WAS IT?! 
 
Apparently, someone decided this story deserved a second chance, rightfully so, and decided to make a bold move: Revive the series! But instead of making it into another TV series, they decided to adapt it into two movies. Not only that, they completely changed the art style to make it appeal to modern anime audiences, with a new look and coat of paint. Having seen the first movie myself now that I have the first Blu-Ray, I can wholeheartedly say that whoever decided this anime deserved a second chance did an awesome job of bringing it back to life, even with its flaws. Because this movie is awesome and I absolutely can't wait for the second movie to come out! 
 
The story takes place in the 1910s-1920s, during the Taisho era, focusing on Benio Hanamura, a happy-go-lucky, ambitious young woman and the daughter of a high ranking military officer in the Japanese Army. She lost her mother when she was young, and as a result, has become quite the stubborn, individualistic tomboy, in stark contrast to the strict idea of the ""good wife, wise mother"" ideal of womanhood. She studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in Western clothes, and ardently believes that a woman should be free to choose who they themselves want to marry instead of being forced to accept arranged marriages. When she finds she's been betrothed to a man she knows nothing about, a handsome, sweet natured man named Shinobu Ijuuin, Benio tries everything she can to get out of it, from deliberately messing up her chores and housework (Which isn't hard, since she sucks at housework anyway) to trying to set him up with her best friend, who actually likes him. But things don't always go the way she wants them to, and circumstances might just make her realize that things might be better than she thinks. 
 
Now, the original manga is eight volumes long, so it can be hard to try and cram so much material into two movies, much less one. Many movies have tried this and failed miserably. As of this writing, I haven't seen the second movie yet (Though I do want to, and I'm definitely getting the Blu-Ray once it comes out!), so the review will focus solely on the first one for now. But even with the movie's overly condensed, compressed nature, there's a lot of things that it manages to do really well. One of those things is the animation and the character designs. As you can see, both the original manga and the anime from the 70s have VERY dated designs, with washed out colors, exaggerated sparkly eyes, huge lips, and some weird-looking, gonky faces sometimes. The producers for the new movies radically updated the character designs, making them sharper, cleaner, and more modern but still keeping it true to the shoujo aesthestic, with huge doe eyes, large eyelashes, and the men having some feminized features. The animation is beautiful, with smooth movement, lovely backgrounds and backdrops that really enhance the mood of various scenes, and it even has the characters make comedic, goofy faces like in the original Sailor Moon anime, and it works really well here. 
 
I'm kind of biased when it comes to the soundtrack, as it's done by one of my favorite anime composers, Michiru Oshima, who's worked on a lot of my favorite anime such as Nabari no Ou, My Sister Momoko, Fancy Lala, Snow White with the Red Hair, the live-action Sailor Moon series, and many others. But you probably know her for her work on the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia, Tatami Galaxy, and more recently, Bloom Into You. Yet again, she hits a home run with the soundtrack here, with oboes and violins that perfectly fit the quaint, romantic feel of the movie, but never to the point of getting obnoxious or overbearing, something that few soundtracks can boast. 
 
I do have some mixed feelings about the characters, which is inevitable considering this manga tries to cram several volumes of manga into one/two movies. I will say that Benio is a relatively good lead character: She has a lot of character flaws, such as being a little too stubborn and argumentative, which can make her come across as bratty at first, but the movie never takes these traits too far to the point of making her come off as obnoxious or a bitch. Plus, while she does eventually fall in love with Shinobu, she still keeps her self-sufficient, independent personality, taking charge of her own fate. She's an intriguing, three-dimensional character with plenty of strengths, weaknesses, and perfectly carries the movie, something which is sorely needed in the anime industry as of right now. The other characters, on the other hand, aren't as lucky in this department. They're all decent enough, and I love the whole ensemble, but because the movie rushes through everything, they don't get fleshed out like Benio does, so every scene they're in lacks emotional impact. Shinobu in particular comes off as way too perfect. His patience for Benio is saintly, he's always nice and kind, never pressures Benio into doing anything she doesn't want to, supports her in everything, and there isn't a bad bone in his body. Now, don't get me wrong, normally I love these kinds of characters, and considering that most shoujo manga/anime tend to give those kinds of characters the shaft in favor of portraying people who IRL would be considered domestic abusers in a romantic, sympathetic light, we need more characters like Shinobu. But the problem with him here is that he doesn't have any flaws. You can't make a character that audiences will like if you don't give him any flaws or traits that he needs to deal with or overcome, and the only time we see him have to deal with a character flaw is at the very end, so it winds up coming way too late. Eh, maybe the next movie will rectify this. I hope it does, because as much as I like Shinobu, you can't deny that he's rather vanilla and too perfect for his own good. 
 
But none of these things detract from my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. Many scenes had me on the floor laughing a lot of the time, and in a really good way. The animation is luscious, the music is great, I love all the characters despite the movie being unable to develop them and flesh them out, and I'm really excited to see the next movie. I guess all of the movie's problems can be attributed to its format: Movies are typically better suited for standalone stories, and trying to cram 10 volumes of manga into two movies won't yield very good results if you want to tell a whole story. Scenes have to be cut out and you have to compress other parts in order to tell the story you want to tell. As far as Haikara-san is concerned, despite its initial missteps, I think the producers did extremely well with what they had and did the best they could to do what they needed to do here. It's a sweet, heartwarming romantic comedy that's sure to get a laugh out of you and take you to a time long past. 
 
All in all, while made missteps in its presentation, Haikara-san part one is definitely one of the better romances I've seen this year, and I normally tend to dislike romance. Now to (impatiently)eagerly wait for the next movie to come out on Blu-Ray!

","Story (7/10) - These OVAs are like others, funny little shorts meant for fans of the series. They delivered, and answered a question many people have probably been wondering. 
 
Art (8/10) - The art was great just like in To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd.

Overall (7.4/10) - It is sad to see the anime series of To LOVE-Ru end, but it just makes me more excited to read the Manga and find out how it ends! 

          
 
       Helpful OK, first of all this is my 1st review and is only because i felt like is unfair that it only contain 1 review and that leave Darkness 2nd as a fail when to me was the opposite. 
I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1). 
 
 
Happy Holidays

It is the Bakumatsu and early Meiji Period. Akizuki Keiichirou and Kusaka Touma stand of opposite sides of the political scale of the time but still, something as fragile as the shell of a cicada binds these two men together in a tragic and cruel fate. A story of friendship, love and seperation as well as reunion and sacrifice. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Samurai', 'Yaoi']","This three part yaoi story spans the war torn Meiji era when the Japanese turned from a Shogunate to Imperial rule and entered trade with the rest of the world (1862–1869).  While the story unfolds historical dates and important figures are given while the characters give even more bits and pieces of this period during dialog.
Episode One: ""Edo Love Song"" starts in 1862, second year of the Bunkyuu Era, in Shinagawa Gotenyama during the Expulsion of Foreigners movement started by the Chōshū (Choushuu) clan of which Touma Kusaka is a member.  Kusaka differs from his clan believing in peace and opening Japan up to foreigners where it can do trade and stand with equal footing on the world stage, the Open the Country movement.  While trying to stop other Chōshū clan members from setting fire to the British Embassy, Kusaka is confronted by a Bakufu (Shogunate) samurai who helps him and a comrade, Aizawa, escape from the authorities.
Years later, while trying to find a school that will teach him English despite his clan's political stance, Kusaka once again meets the samurai who had saved his life.  No longer in the employ of his Town Magistrate father, Keiichirou Akizuki goes to English school at the Nakahama Private School. Recognizing each other, Akizuki eventually offers to teach Kusaka English.  Having been raised in an upper-class home, Akizuki takes pleasure in learning more about the common class lifestyle that Kusaka has always led while they learn English in secret as their clans cannot see them together without creating conflict.  Despite their precautions, one of the Chōshū sees them and Kusaka has to stop meeting with Akizuki.
Episode Two: ""Record of Ezo War"" starts with Kusaka thinking about cutting ties with his clan when the Head Administrator, Sufu Masanosuke, offers to send him to London to learn about the West.  Before leaving, Kusaka meets with Akizuki one last time during a sunset and they declare their love for each other by kissing and having passionate sweaty sex in a meadow near a riverbank. They consummate their relationship. While Kusaka is in England, Akizuki gains the leadership of his clan and its immediate association with the Shogun.  After four years, Kusaka returns to Japan and receives a high ranking post in the Imperial army.  It is during this time that Japan is in the midst of the greatest civil war Japan has known, the Boshin War, with Kusaka on the Satsuma-Chōshū (Imperial) side and Akizuki on the Bakufu (Shogunate) side.  During one of the last battles, Kusaka finds Akizuki about to commit seppuku after having lost a leg to cannon fire.  Upon being seen by one of his comrades aiding Akizuki, Kusaka kills the man, leaving his lover in shock.
Episode Three: ""Tokyo Tragedy"" starts four years later, with Kusaka working for the new government, wearing Western-style clothes and living in a Western-style home.  In a private Japanese cottage behind the house, he keeps Akizuki in secret.  Relations between the two lovers have broken down as Akizuki cannot stand being kept in hiding in comfort while his fellow Bakufu comrades suffer in prison, and he wants to commit suicide.
Eventually Aizawa, now an officer of the new law, discovers their relationship.  He confronts Akizuki, leaving him with a tantō (short sword).  A while later, it seems things between Kusaka and Akizuki are being patched up; yet a small group of police going through Kusaka's home, led by Aizawa, interrupts one of their moments.  Kusaka runs back to the house, engages in a brief argument with his former comrade, and returns to the cottage only to find Akizuki missing and a suicide note on the futon pillow.
Akizuki pulls himself along the snow-covered ground, Aizawa's tantō in hand, stopping in front of a tree split into four trunks.  After a brief reminiscing, he kills himself; Kusaka finds him a short while later.  Opening the pouch around Akizuki's neck, he realizes that Akizuki was carrying around the shell of the cicada they had seen about eight years earlier.  Kusaka takes the tantō from Akizuki's hand and commits suicide as well.
","Fuyu no Semi is a wonderful love story.It is definetly a yaoi anime, and very touching one. After searching for good yaoi and shounen-ai animes, I finally end up in appreciating Fuyu no Semi, besides gakuen heaven.   
 
STORY: 
What is good about this anime is that it can be placed into various categories such as drama, action, historical, romance etc. 
Its story plot is dammed good for 3 OVA containing all these categories. The story is a very touching one. The emotional aspects both the main characters, Akizuki and Kusaka, can really be felt through out the anime, (The emotions experienced by both Akizuki and Kusaka especially regarding separation caused due to different clans.) This anime really shows various aspects of life, be it emotionally or practically. 
What is the most interesting part of Fuyu no Semi is the love and appreciation that is present between the main pairing, especially the last part of the anime (very touching moment). 
 
ART: 
The art is very good... except that these types of art styles goes well with male characters only. I believe that the female characters should have drawn in other style. So, this aspect did not cause any effect to the anime because the main leads were male only. 
 
SOUND: 
For a hystorical anime, with lots of saddeness, separation and war, the sound well suited to the plot. 
 
CHARACTER: 
The characters were marvellous, especially the main pairing. Both leads were great. The appreciation and love between the main characters were great...No bad comments from my part for the main characters. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
Well I end up enjoying the anime throughout... except for the ending which left me speechless. But the ending did left an impact on me, in terms that, love is extremely beautiful though it can bring trajedy, sadness, loneliness and... sacrifice. 
 
OVERALL: 
This anime is definetly a great experience. I, personally, was not a fan of shounen-ai in the past but after watching anime like gakuen heaven (for example) I realised that there is really something special with that kind of gay or lesbien love that many societies, in various parts of world still rejects. Yaoi and shounen-ai animes really makes one realised that love is beyong physical...

Fuyu no Semi is somehow like Romeo and Juliet in Japan, just before and at the beginning of Meiji period. It is a love story that succeeded to make me cry, no matter the time, no matter the people, no matter the sex. 
 
Forget yaoi. Fuyu no Semi talks about male feelings, honor, convictions, modernity... and love. 
 
Moreover, Fuyu no Semi is very interesting for his historical aspects. But history courses never succeeded in making me cry...

An absurdly comedic take on the idol genre,  Zombieland Saga  tells the story of Franchouchou’s heartwarming struggle to save Saga Prefecture while hiding their zombie identities and rediscovering their past lives. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural']","In the year 2008, high school student Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed by a truck on the morning she plans to submit an idol application. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six ""legendary"" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to revitalize Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group that would become known as Franchouchou.
","Out of all of the shows I’m watching this season plus shows that I’ve heard about, none are as insane as Zombieland Saga. Like almost everyone else, I was in the dark about this show. I thought it was gonna be something completely different but it turned out to be a fun idol show with a twist. Spoiler alert: All the main characters are zombies! With a bunch of other zombie girls, The manager, Kotaro, wants to save the saga prefecture by making them all idols for no particular reason other than to save saga.  This sounded like one of those shows that was gonna be so bad but I watched all of it and was pleasantly surprised. It’s really funny, The manager, played by Mamoru Miyano, is as insane as his portrayal of Okabe, The zombie girls have great chemistry, they are all pretty interesting, and the songs sung are great. Like I said before, the comedy is great. The timing of the jokes are really funny and the situations they get themselves in because they’re zombies kills me. This show doesn’t have a dull moment for me either. Every episode was entertaining and even got into character development towards the second half of the show. The opening is also a huge banger. Supposedly, it’s supposed to take inspiration from old anime from the 70’s from the sound to the visuals. It also takes inspiration from super sentai or power rangers here in the states.  
 
There are a few things that bothered me though. Some of the dance sequences are in CG. I don’t have a huge problem with CG but this show’s CG didn’t look that great. It’s trying to take inspiration from other idol animes like Love Live that do the same, which is great, but it just looks worse. Another problem I had was it didn’t seem like the show knew where it was going the beginning. It started out with the girls thrown into gigs that are super entertaining and got me to watch the show, especially the rap scene, but didn’t really show what the purpose was. It started out with just gigs then into the character development with a dance at the end. I feel if it started with the character development in the beginning then moved forward with the random gigs, it could be a little better. I also want to see more of the progression of the girls and the struggle to become better idols. If we could see that, we could care more. I also don’t like that they barely touched on the saga thing. I feel like they had one episode with real Saga things but I don’t know if the auditorium that they performed in is a real place. If the whole goal is to save saga, there should have been more of a saga focus. The last thing that gave me an issue were the character designs. This was made by MAPPA and they make some pretty nice stuff but Zombieland Saga looks pretty rough with the character designs. Honestly, they just kind look weird or more unique I guess. I think it’s just the faces. They look kinda jagged but they serve well for funny facial expressions which there are plenty of. There were also little things like shots in the training room with the mirror. People would move but not in the mirror but those are just minor.   
 
Now, I’ve never seen an idol show but if this is what all idol shows are like, I’ll definitely give them a shot. Extremely entertaining! If you haven’t watched this yet, you might like it or not but it's definitely worth a shot. At the end of the last episode, they said franchouchou isn’t done so I hope that means a second season because I’ll definitely be there to watch it.     


          
 
       Helpful FIRST REVIEW, don't judge... plz 
 
Zombieland Saga was a pleasant surprise this season, I went completely blind into it with just a title as reference so I wasn't really expecting for a comedy/idol (first one I've seen) anime but more for an action/horror kind of anime, then when I started watching the first episode my first reaction was ""WTF??"" and at the same time I was enjoying it. My shock wasn't because of the weirdness of the show, I like weirdness I embrace it, it was more because I wasn't really expecting this at all but I'm glad I stuck around till the end. 
 
This show has some of the best characters this season starting with the manager Koutaro Tatsumi his voice actor (Mamoru Miyano) is excellent and every time he talked he made me laugh,*spoiler ahead* btw many people theorized that he was the one that ran over Sakura I actually always thought that he used to know her or had a crush on her when she was alive the way they show it in the show I could have been right *spoiler end* 
 
As for the girls we have everyone with their special little quirk Sakura being main girl as main as can be, Saki a badass, Lily with her heart poking out and being cute af, Junko being the quiet, gentle soul, Ai being litteraly an idol, Yuugiri slapping people left and right, and Tae doing Tae things, overall it is a group that I would like to see a lot more from them. 
 
My main issue with this show is the cg used on the performances, I know that it is kinda of a parody of idol shows and I know that animating a whole performance with dance moves costs a lot of paper, but i thought that at least for the final performance wouldn't be in cg, but nonetheless it wasn't really too bad. 
 
The end left room for a second season and for what i've been seeing apparently this is big in Japan so I'm 90% sure that there will be a second season and I'm hoping for it.

       Helpful Zombieland Saga had the chance to become one of he best, if not THE BEST idol show out there. The start of the show was shocking, but hilarious. The zombie concept left a lot of room for unique comedy, and the cast of odball characters from different eras (most of whom didn't even want to become idols) really set the show apart! Deathmetal and rap battles, weird promotions and oddjobs to get the group's name out there, it was all very promising in it's creativity and stark difference from other idol shows. 
Unfortunately, the show started to get into formulaic and predictable stuff mid-season. The episodes regarding the character's backgounds, the horrendous 3D concerts, it was all pretty bland. Even the later episodes about the group dynamic and the main character were less and less unique. Even if we take all the objectively bad things out, it's still just wishy-washy idol stuff you can watch anywhere else, probably better. Where are the different music genres from the earlier episodes? Where is that crazy energy that carried the show? 
Unfortunately, Zombieland Saga ended up as another trend-follower instead of the trend-setter I wanted it to be. It's still a quirky show about zombie idols, and I think it's still worth watching, but the show didn't deliver on the promise of it's great early episodes.

","Anime was pretty good at the start, it had a dark feel and there was a fair bit of action. After that it wasn't as good, the dark feel at the start of the series wasn't there anymore and there was less action as well.  Honestly, the action isn't too important to me, but it was pretty good at the start. Although the fact that there was less of a dark atmosphere later on in the series kinda made it less enjoyable, as that was what I came for. 
 
Anyway, the best part of the series was at the start. It goes a bit downhill later. The later parts of the anime felt a bit rushed as well, which may have been why it not seem as good...

          
 
       Helpful CUBED X CURSED X CURIOUS REVIEW: 
 
MINDSET: 
You should already know what's coming Your way once You see, “Light Novel Adaptation” popping up the back of Your hand, its either from the Cows Buttocks, or average stones. 
 
SYNOPSIS: 
C3 starts out in regular modern day Japan with our generic protagonist Haruaki, at one day he soon finds a  mythically giant black cube posted by Your local mail man, soon he notices that the giant cube can transform into female loli known as “Fear”. It was then found out that her cube can not only resize into the palm of her hand for plot convenience, but it can also be used as a tool of 100 torture devices. (BDSM style! Yay, kids!) 
 
 
REVIEW: 
We all know that light novel adaptations are always aiming for “Mass Appeal” since that is the one thing that always tend to sell! (AKA: The casual audience) Consequently, C3   slightly “Differs” from this case as it is surprisingly good on paper. However, for me to summarise such issues, the show is also trying to also be ecchi, which has the tendency to break a show if it has a more mature, interesting and serious nature. This is no exception. 
 
Don't expect deep and complex villains. They are all completely lacking in depth, and are often just one liner character. Like is it ever in any way, shape or form that the first villain is just this random axe wielding  psychopath who keeps crying out “Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” Every 5 seconds when she's fighting a woman will equal character depth and complexity? No! 
 
Tropes are a thousand times more overused, and replicated. So (obvious fact) the light novel adaptation tends to carry: One dimensional villains? Check! Character Archetypes? Check! Tsunderes? Check! Fan Service? Check! Endings that leave one or more plot holes? Damn hell & Check! And  this is the biggest issue to be summarised with this show here, it feels far too much like a light novel adaptation, yet it has an interesting premise and a fairly good amount of potential to be a “Good Light Novel, with the Adaptation” Buuuut Your run of the mil light novel is bound to fail. 
 
Speaking of fanservice, there is a bit too much fanservice to take this show onto more serious and mature levels. The fact that Kirka wears permanent bondage under her clothes will not mean as a symbolic reference of her sexual suffering and how she is trapped in pain unless if the show shuts up the fanservice, takes a serious look on the audience, and respects it like an actual man! 
 
These kinds of concepts may look very nice on both paper, and in action if done in properly mature manner. However, its is simply lazy to take the risk, and create a potentially good and interesting show! For goodness sakes! The show is not even trying to make these concepts as interesting and thought provoking as it is meant to be, leaving it into Ecchi abyss... 
 
Silver Link doesn’t have many renowned or popular works, but its safe to say that the budget will remain very consistent for these 12 episode series, and C3 tends to have pretty above average Animation, the action scenes and cool powers they use create some pretty energetic looking battles. The colours they use all have a nice shiny finish to them so everything is all nice and colourful. The character designs aren’t anything to be especially proud of, since there quite generic and only the female designs only stand out. 
 
Though I think Silver Link is trying to copy SHAFT STYLE at certain points, but I don't really think its ever overused as much as Shafts own work. Though I don't think it really ever gives out extra points for that since those moments are kind of sparse, but not elusive.  
 
OST is again is just as above average as the Animation, with only one note worthy song that seems to stick around Your mind, and the rest fitting in with the mood, with Your usual pianos, trumpets, drums etc. Though it seems to be quite a large OST for 12 good songs that seem fairly on par with the Animation. OP is above average and fairly catchy, while its rather advisable to skip the ED. 
 
LEGACY: 
Such an Underrated show that never really managed to be seen upon masses. Season two is bound to never be released because Silver Link can't profit enough milk from it, but I suppose I'll remember this Light Novel Adaptation though failing and hitting its face on a wall, for having a bit more ambition than something like Mahouka which aims too much for MASS APPEAL. 
 
SCORES: 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL CHARACTERS SUCK. (cool ideas though) 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL PLOTS SUCK. (though some decent foreshadowing at times BTW) 
6.5/10- Well made and brightly coloured pieces of imagery but note bing too Shafty, but good Animation is good Animation. 
7/10- Mainly for 12 good songs on par with the Animation. 
3/10- Lacking enjoyability because it does'nt take good advantage of its potential, and fanservice. 
 
FINALE: 4.5/10 it has cool ideas and the budget to go with it, but fails in the long run. Because of fan service and the attempt of MASS APPEAL.

          
 
       Helpful I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character's hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. ** 
 
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the 'cube'. Kubrick being 'Cube' and 'Brick'.. get it? Get it?! :D 
 
'Yachi Haruaki', the main male protagonist in the story. ""Yachi"" in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I'd have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever. 
 
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing 'torture' machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical 'Swordfight' anime or 'Trigger-happy' anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations. 
 
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, 'Muramasa' until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) 'big-breasted' friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from 'Shakugan no Shana', and Siesta from 'Zero no Tsukaima'). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is 'Muramasa'. 
 
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear's dance really cute and charming. 
 
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10 
 
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear's hair shines rainbow. It's very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion. 
 
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier. 
 
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

","Shortly:  
 
If you like episodic anime with kind of strange, black and pervert humour, don`t be mistaken with other reviews: Ixion Saga DT does not fit you. 
 
 
And some more letters: 
 
Ok,  it has some balls and sudden jokes, but no more than 20% of screen time, so the rest of time you will enjoy standard  noisy hero, not-cute loli (she is quite interesting character, but annoying at the same time), trap with boobs (middle-century fantasy knows plastic operation or it is a fat in push-up?) and a big guy with big sword (I wonder why my lovely Nakai Kazuya acts so bad as him :( ). It may sounds interesting, but it`s not. 
 
I will not complain about incongruities, cause it`s just a comedy in fantasy world, but still they don`t use that opportunity as that did creators of One Peace or Gintama. I mean, in these series illogical stuff is really illogical and makes bad feeling. 
 
Why you can enjoy it: because of seyus. On the other hand a lot of great VA don`t sound great here, so if you watch this very average anime just for hearing favorite voices, you will get nothing but voice. Maybe after third ep they will act better... Anyway there is nothing outstanding in Ixion Saga.

       Helpful Just finished watching Ixion Saga .Mixed Feelings about that one : 
 
Ixion Saga can me summarized as an attempt to replicate the relaxed/wtf/lol?/laid-back style Gintama made popular in Anime . 
In this style a lack of a greater overarching plot , comedy and dirty jokes , excellent sound-soundtrack choices and strange character are the standard .The style is great , Gintama that introduced it in the Anime industry a masterpiece .Let's see how Ixion Saga DT fared though : 
 
Story-3 
As i said before the specific sub-genre/style Ixion belongs to lacks plot lines as it's main points .Even though i take that as a given , still Ixion Saga could have fared much better: it tries to use the story both as a background and as a hook/point of interest , with the result being a failure in both attempts .The story is not absent - it is there , but it is ignored , resulting in some disbelief and boredom that could have been (easily ?Dont know .) avoided .The lack of progress endangers the whole series as the viewer can become tired of what seems as meaningless events , spawning at each episode like NPCs in a RPG game that is just too full of grind .And i know that the fans might defend the series reminding me that Ixion , like Gintama dont require a master story - yet still having seen and loved Gintama and even Sket , i have to commend that Ixion Saga's story can be compared with boring Pokemon episodes but not with the tense and emotional charged story arcs the two aforementioned shows field . 
(Let it be known that the last episode has a much better written story than the rest of the show- a wonderful surprise rewarding us for making it to the end !) 
 
Art-6 
Nothing great , nothing good , nothing bad . 
Lately Art seems to have been standardized .I kind of miss the variety the 90s and the 2000s had : each show had it's own style for good or for bad .And there were always glitches to be found .The much cheaper/improved technology of today has eliminated visual errors and unusual/unique art styles from most series today. 
 
Sound-8 
Ixion Saga has great sounds and soundtracks :the level was on par with Gintama ! 
Different music genres , familiar chords and styles , variation - the soundtracks were great and played a nice part in drawing you into the series . There was Rhythm and good taste in orchestration and song choices .And the most surprising fact is that i am not talking about the OP/ED - no , i actually didnt liked those two - i am talking about background themes .Very good on sound . 
 
Characters-6 
Ixion Saga's Chars are interesting and funny : each has his own fetish plus some perks - and each gets a decent amount of attention in the show .And here is where trouble ensues : 
the characters while are interesting seem to have been made with some kind of character generator you can find for RPGs .They are too much replicas from the Gintama series- something that becomes even more obvious when you actually hear half the cast of Gintama playing as the main chars in Ixion Saga .There was a lack of originality - i find myself imagining the people that designed the character watching Gintama and saying to each other ""Ok that was good , what can we use instead of that ?"" .In short if you ve seen Gintama you ll see no new character concepts in Ixion Saga .They have somewhat recycled the chars from it . 
 
Enjoyment 6 - Overall 5 
Ixion Saga is a fun Anime and it sure is enjoying watching one .With all the the lack of originality it still has some entertaining value .However -and with that i sum it up - this show has copied Gintama at so many major points , so obviously that one can clearly feel the lack of dedication and investment from the creators  .And since those two things are what make an Anime interesting and enjoying to watch i can say that this show is worth watching without lying . 
 
Ixion Saga is for Gintama what the many industrial Harem anime are for their originals .

          
 
       Helpful If you come into this hoping for the standard sword & sorcery, historical/fantasy shounen adventure fare, you're probably going to be disappointed. 
 
I rather despise that genre, because they're all the same. Once you've seen one, you might as well have seen them all. They re-use the same tropes and devices, and don't much original fare to offer. 
 
This series takes those tropes, and irreverently plays with them, providing parody and lots of unexpected content.  And trolling.  So bad it hurts.  I haven't had so many laughs over an anime since ""Daily Lives of High School Boys"" (which, incidentally, has the same director; who's also the guy who did Gintama). 
 
The princess isn't a sexy teen girl (she's not even cute enough to be a loli) and the sexy teen girl isn't actually even…. 
The cute animal mascot (which EVERY hero group must have), is at war with the hero. 
And, erm, ""crotch problems"" take center stage.  It's all about balls here, folks. 
 
Basically, you can watch it without knowing quite knowing what's going to happen next. Except that it's not going to quite turn out the way it's ""supposed to"", or at least, not the way we've been conditioned to expect. 
 
This is a comedy that's given me lots of healthy laughs so far; I've watched through half the episodes, and look forward to seeing what curve'balls' are thrown at me next.

Clara is excited about her friend Fritz coming to visit the next day and refuses to go to sleep. Her Aunt Gerda  tries to frighten her with stories about the Ragman, but Clara says she's too grown up to believe in him. Uncle Drosselmeyer startles them with his arrival. He gives Clara a nutcracker doll, which she adores. She promises to go to bed immediately if she can keep it.
Clara awakens in the middle of the night to find her nutcracker gone. She sees a group of mice carrying it down the stairs and follows them into the living room. As she takes back the doll, she's confronted by the leader of the mice, a two-headed rat queen. The queen orders Clara to hand over the nutcracker, but she refuses. Clara is knocked out just as the nutcracker springs to life to defend her against the mice.
The next morning, Clara finds herself back in her bedroom. She tells her aunt about the mice and her doll being missing, but Gerda insists that she is talking nonsense and is ill with a fever. In her delirious state, Clara goes down to the living room and stares at the grandfather clock. Thinking she sees Uncle Drosselmeyer inside, she climbs in, only to be scared by the Ragman.
She wanders, looking for Drosselmeyer, until she finds herself in a palace. There she sees a portrait of a girl identical to her and a glass coffin containing a sleeping mouse person. A king and a group of mourners appear, believing Clara to be their Princess Mary returned. After Clara corrects their mistake, King Goodwin explains that she's in the Doll Kingdom. They were at war with the mice, led by the two-headed queen Morphia. When defeat seemed inevitable, the dolls surrendered. However, the King refused to agree to Morphia's final term: Princess Mary must marry her son, Gaar. As punishment for refusing, Morphia cursed the princess to look like a hideous mouse and lie in sleep until King Goodwin agrees to the marriage.
King Goodwin gathers all the world's wise men in hopes they can find a way to break the curse, but all their ideas are far fetched and illogical, and an argument quickly breaks out between them. Despairing that no one knows how to help, Clara leaves the castle and wanders the streets. A street singer points her in the direction of The Queen of Time, who is known for having the answer to everything. Clara goes to her and asks if she knows how to save the princess and defeat Morphia. The Queen of Time uses her magical crystal ball to spy on Morphia, revealing the only way to save the princess is to destroy the queen's source of power, the Nut of Darkness. This can only be done if the magical Sword of Pearl is wielded by someone with a pure heart. The Queen of Time provides the sword, but it's up to Clara to find someone to carry it into battle.
Clara returns to the castle, believing Franz, the captain of the guard, has a pure enough heart. She tells him what he must do in order to save the princess. King Goodwin promises Franz his daughter's hand in marriage if he's successful, and Franz leads the doll army off to battle. They arrive as the mice are celebrating Gaar's eminent marriage to the princess. Just as it seems the toy soldiers are losing, Franz destroys The Nut of Darkness and kills Morphia - but not before she places a curse on him, turning him into a nutcracker doll.
Clara carries the Nutcracker back to the palace, where she finds the court and King Goodwin are celebrating Princess Mary's awakening. Seeing Franz's new state, the princess abandons the marriage promise and calls the Nutcracker ugly. Clara leaves the kingdom to wander in search of anyone who knows how to return Franz to human, unaware that Gaar survived the attack and is following her. She eventually comes across the Watchmaker, who tells her the only way to save Franz is through an act of true, unselfish love. Clara declares  she loves Franz, but the Watchmaker says that isn't enough.
Exhausted from travelling, Clara falls asleep. She dreams that Franz is human again and they enter a magical kingdom made of candy. As they're about to ascend the stairs to live happily ever after in their castle, Clara's foot becomes stuck. Franz continues without her, leading Clara to grab his foot and beg him not to go. She wakes up to realize she's clutching the Nutcracker as Gaar tries to pull him away. She begs Gaar to spare Franz and kill her instead, but Gaar insists Franz must die for killing his mother. As he's about to stab the Nutcracker, Clara uses her own body as a shield. This frees Franz from the spell and destroys Gaar.
Clara wakes up in bed, with Uncle Drosselmeyer beside her. As Clara is recounting what happened and trying to ask Drosselmeyer what he was doing in the clock, Aunt Gerda comes in to say Fritz has arrived. He comes in, identical to Franz.

Story 
A bit confusing to understand certain connections. Such as the first villain's connection to the the other main villain. While i don't think it was made clear one was sent out to build a force for the other to conquer with. Aside from that the story was a delightful romantic tale with some tossed in drama. As for the ending a true fairy tale ending. 
 
Art 
This movie has come a long way. It used to be painted in such a dark fashion. Like a dream which makes sense given plot. But more of a dream where one would recall bits and peaces. For depending what version you had that is all you saw. Luckily there is a brighter more refined detailed version(which is what i saw). However, there were some dark areas but a real remarkable difference compared to the vch version. 
 
Although one element that was somewhat featured in the show was the portrayal of a real life ballerina. Not quite sure aside from innocence that had with the story. 
 
Overall: If you are a parent and wish to present a young girl a memorable tale to ponder as she drifts off to sleep i would suggest this. While sure it does have a certain England feel to it but the happy message comes out clear.Love conquers all. With the added bonus of possibly encouraging a proper follow through with bedtime hours.

4,432,120,6.476981125,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Iria: Zeiram The Animation,"Iria is the story of a girl and the Alien being she loves to hate. The series begins with her brother, Gren, taking a job. He is a bounty hunter, and one well known for his incredible skill. Iria, being a skilled apprentice bounty hunter herself, tags along. What is the job, one might ask. It is to find out what has happened to the crew and cargo of a Space Station. Needless to say, nothing is as it seems, and the war between Iria and Zeiram begins in earnest.  
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"" is a pretty good action oriented OVA spanning across 6 half hour episodes. It tells the story of a young bounty hunter Iria's hunting of Zeiram, the most dangerous life form in the galaxy. 
 
The weird opening theme, which sounds like some Sharon Apple song from ""Macross Plus"", feels out of place and put me off the anime initially. And not being the fastest anime off the block despite its short length, it took ""Iria"" a couple of episodes to catch my interest, but to its credit it gains more and more momentum as it goes on. 
 
The action, though slightly sluggish at times, is overall solid enough to provide a good foundation for the enjoyment of ""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"", with the appropriately climatic climax being especially good. It's backed up by a pretty good story (albeit one that doesn't explain everything) and some really likeable characters. The roles of the mischievous kids are played out perfectly, as is that rogue Fujikuro, providing comedy entertainment that often had me grinning widely. The animation may not look that great by today's standards, but there are some fantastic character designs. The heroine Iria herself has quite a unique look, while Zeiram reminds me of Yoshimitsu from the Tekken video games. 
 
On the downside, I think the anime suffers from small inconsistencies in its characterisation and plot. To name a couple of examples, part of the personality of Iria is hard to pin down since she seem to be inconsistently portrayed from one episode to the next, and I could have sworn the Zeiram's weak point that is revealed towards the end had already been peppered with bullets with little or not no effect in an earlier episode. 
 
Even though this OVA does look and sound a bit old, it's still succeeds in providing an entertaining 3 hours. Worth checking out if you come across it. 


          
 
       Helpful Iria: Zeiram the Animation is an OVA prequel to the Zeiram movie series. Between the movies and the animation, the animation is the clear better of the bunch. 
 
Starting with the good, the world in this is certainly very unique. It has its own world, with everything similar to ours, yet different. From the buildings, to the vehicles, to the weapons, it really gives an excellent sense of a planet similar enough to feel welcoming, yet different enough to feel alien and foreign. The plot is good, too. Nothing too new, but it's set up well. (Because of how much I liked these, I added an extra point to the overall score, hah.) 
 
Unfortunately, the main draws to this are also a problem. At only six episodes, it's very short. The world and premise might be top tier, but we don't see enough of it. It goes with the plot, too. It doesn't have enough time to properly develop, so each episode seems more like an individual story that shares a general idea. It's probably more of a budget problem than anything else. It had excellent ideas, but they didn't have the funds to properly realize them. Even just one 13 episode season and a minor plot arrangement could've benefited this series immensely. 
 
It's an enjoyable few episodes, I liked it, and I'd definitely recommend it. It's just a shame it's so unlikely we'll see any new Zeiram material.

          
 
       Helpful Coming from a somewhat unknown studio, Ashi Productions, and an unknown director, Tetsuro Amino, there was much to speculate how decent this could be. An action story about a rookie bounty hunter named Iria, comes into a battle conflict against an unstoppable killing lifeform called a Zeiram. 
 
With a plot straight to the point, live and get rid of the Zeiram, this anime knows what it is. Spanning as a 6 episode OVA series, each episode is different, yet a continuation on each other. Time continues between each episode until Iria must have another life and death battle between her and the Zeiram. 
 
Even though the anime is on the short side, luckily, all the characters involved are fairly interesting and the viewer slowly sees Iria become more mature with each episode. There is plenty of action ranging from the transportation machines to the numerous gadgets used to fight. Needless to say, the action is the strong point, and while not being smooth all of the time, the fighting sequences and explosions are done well enough. 
 
However, the anime does have its flaws. The ending, for example, is pretty controversial, and why some weapons work in places while others do not are just a couple to pay attention to. Although, if given more time (episodes), maybe things could have been explained better. Instead most is left up to the viewer’s imagination. 
 
As Iria Zeiram the Animation could come off as a bit old and average, the action is worth the ride. Iria is lovable and so is the supporting cast around her.

In the coming third season, they enjoy hiking beautiful mountains with colored leaves and the story gets even more colorful when they become friends with local school girls!! 
 
(Source: Yomiuri TV Enterprise)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Slice of Life']","Aoi Yukimura is a quiet girl who prefers staying indoors and is afraid of heights. When she reunites with her childhood friend Hinata Kuraue, who is outgoing and loves mountaineering. They decide to climb a mountain together, in order to see sunrise, they saw together when they were younger. Along the way, they meet several other girls who are also interested in the outdoors, and begin a series of adventures on various mountains across Japan.
","We had to wait 4 years for a third season of Yama no Susume and the big question is of course if the series is still as good as the previous seasons and if it still has the same charm?  
 
Story 
The story in the third season focuses mostly on the relationship between Hinata and Aoi which was already the case in the previous seasons too and one of my favorite aspects of the anime. Something that has less presence in this season is actual mountain climbing because they focus more on the slice of life elements and they even dedicate whole episodes to it which isn't directly bad because we get nice character developments through it in this season especially between Aoi and Hinata. 
 
Art 
One of the things I always liked in Yama no Susume were the background arts and I have to say that the third season sadly doesn't look as good as the previous seasons and especially the characters look in some episodes really minimalistic drawn and even kinda low quality at some points. 
The Art in S3 is the weakest part of the anime, but even if I say that the anime still looks better than most other Anime this season so it's not such a big thing it's just sad that it isn't as good as in the other seasons. 
 
Sound 
There are some openings that always give me a smile and which I just don't want to skip and the opening of Yama no Susume S3 is one of them it's a perfect way to get into the episode. The episode themselves have the same OST as we already got in previous season and it's of course still fitting. The ending is pretty nice, but I like the opening more. 
 
Character 
Like I already mentioned earlier this season focuses mostly on Aoi and Hinata and gives them trough multiple episodes really good character development, but what about the other characters? We get to see the other characters and they all get their moments to shine which I really liked because one thing I was scared of at the start of the season was that they won't give the other characters their moments because it first seemed like they will only give Aoi and Hinata moments and forget about the others. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall 
I really enjoyed this season of Yama no Susume and even though the anime has a loss in quality compared with the previous seasons it gives me still the same feeling I got from the previous seasons and it's a comfortable watch, but one can clearly tell that this season is mostly fanservice for people that wanted to see the characters one more time animated. 
Overall the Anime is a 9/10 for me and I can recommend it to everyone who likes the previous seasons. 


          
 
       Helpful Yama no Susume's 3rd Season is here and LA can't be any more satisfied with this series getting another season. 
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season picks off right where the 2nd Season left off, with it being Winter for Aoi and the gang, any chance for them to try and climb becomes out of the question, thus Aoi and the gang continues to climb by climbing other mountains with their friends with some growing conflict between Aoi and Hinata along the way. 
 
See in this season, Aoi and Hinata are separated the most, be it through schedule conflicts, misunderstandings as well as Aoi opening up and gaining new friends while Hinata gets more isolated due to her conflicting schedules with Aoi, now this is something of a focal point that comes into play but it gets dealt with and resolved rather well and both Aoi and Hinata reconcile, but the entire drama between Aoi and Hinata isn't spiteful in anyways more like misunderstandings and assumptions that lead to what it became, as both Aoi and Hinata are developing their relationship but apart and this tribulation grows their relationship even more. 
 
Nevertheless, Yama no Susume's 3rd Season still looks at mountaineering in the typical Yama no Susume flavours of giving us tidbits about mountaineering and the such from equipment to finding new Japanese mountains to climb but really the ""drama"" concerning Aoi and Hinata helped with this season as both first and second season was essentially a slice of life comedy with mountain climbing, the 3rd Season brought something new to the table and dealt with it rather well. 
 
Now since Aoi and Hinata are the focal point of this season, what about the rest of the cast?, well Kokona tags along with Aoi as she's probably the most freely open character this season and she probably has the most screentime outside of Aoi and Hinata. Honoka Kurosaki voiced by Nao Touyama also gets this, at first being a character introduced in the second season and befriends Aoi, she goes along with Aoi in several trips to mountains in the process. The only character within the main cast who got shafted in this season was Kaede Saitou voiced by Yoko Hikasa as Kaede has exams thus is trapped in an endless cycle of studying and little mountain climbing thus her lessen screentime though she appears with Hinata more often than not, which is shame as LA wanted to see more of Kaede. With this you can kinda see the entire ""Aoi and Hinata separation"" through the rest of the cast and the major conflict of the entire third season's buildup. 
 
8Bit, once again helms the animation and really it's what you expect from them with gorgeous backgrounding with moe character designs, really LA doesn't need to go too deep into animation, if you've seen the past 2 seasons then this is a given. Praise easily going to the beautiful backgrounding... 
 
Voice work, well the entire cast is back and with Honoka getting more screentime, means Nao Touyama gets more too, BUT LA won't get LA's bias come into play...MVP's goes to Yuka Iguchi as Aoi and Kana Asumi as Hinata, it's a no brainer here. 
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season gives us something new in terms of character development from Aoi and HInata, Aoi as she becomes much more open through mountain climbing, Hinata as becomes more isolated and away from Aoi giving Hinata internal problems concerning their relationship and by all means, as a result they grows their relaitonship even more oddly enough.  
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season is about mountain climbing, but this season shows that it's much more than that and as cheesy as LA will say it but this fits into Aoi and Hinata's relationship this season and Yama no Susume as a whole and that is of the tried and true ""the power of friendship"" and Yama no Susume's 3rd Season encapsulates it in variety of spectrum all under the hobby of mountain climbing. 
 
This was the little anime short that could and it STILL good even after 3 seasons...

          
 
       Helpful The claim that sequels are always better than prequels is true, because YNS S3 is better than S2. It's more relatable for me as each and every episode reminds me of the friendship I have with my best friend, the fun we have together, the jealousy and frustration that we have sometimes when we can't seem to find time to hang out with each other, and the problems we face which we share to each other. And YNS S3, it's just that. Less hiking on Yamas and more emphasis on personal relationships. Between Aoi and Hinata(of course cos they're the MCs) and between their friends. So w/o further ado, leggo start the ofc review!  
 
P.S. This is gonna be quite a personal review so yea. 
 
Story: Well I already gave a short summary of what YNS S3 is about. Sure there's episodes where they go hiking together, but 80% of the anime focuses on the deep friendship which Aoi and Hinata have with each other. What really attached me to this season of YNS is what I said earlier, the fun times and problems which Aoi and Hinata faced. It was extremely relatable towards the ending when both Aoi and Hinata seemed to just missed each other every time they wanna hang out with each other. Quite a mirror to my real life right now, with my friends in NS or are too busy, especially my best friend. Now that I look back at time, I do miss the times when me and my best friend could hang out with each other everyday after school, 4 years ago. So I can totally understand Hinata's feelings. That feeling of not being able to hang out with your best friend. I also like the fact that the anime tries to involve Honoka more in this season. And we could definitively see Honoka hanging out with ze gang(Aoi, Hinata, Kokona and Kaede) more this season. Granted, this season may not have been the most relaxing one due to the fact that it focuses on relationships more, but it was a very relatable season, at least for me. 
Rating: 9.5/10 
 
Animation: Kindof a hit and miss for this category. I like the fact that the producers try to make the scenery as realistic as possible, but when it comes to the faces, wow, I didn't like the way the animated some of the scenes. Felt cheap. At the same time of course the facial expressions were priceless most of the time.  
Rating: 7.8/10 
 
Music/Sound: As usual using the VAs to sing both the opening and endings song, me like. The soundtrack just makes me relax whenever it plays(and makes me think of going to Japan :v). 
Rating: 8.3/10 
 
Characters: For this review I don't have much to say about the characters, because we already know their personalities and character from past season. So for this section I just want to focus on Aoi and mostly Hinata. So as we know in past seasons, Aoi is kind and friendly, but she's also.... kinda.... idk she worries too much. During the last episode when she wanted to get a present for Hinata she just overthought what she was gonna get. Oh and add to that her constant thoughts of Hinata making fun of her..., yes that's very funny xD.  
As for Hinata, this is the first time we see her being a little bit insecure about her friendship with Aoi which i can't blame her for that since she and Aoi seemed to be always missing out on each other for a few episodes. Ah yes her stubbornness is also a trait of her that is funny but also can be rather annoying. So.... I guess that's it for characters?  
Rating: 8.7/10 
 
Overall, this has gotta be my most relatable anime this season, because it reminds me so much of the relationship I have with my best friend and it is these kindof animes which I really love. I really do hope that they'll make an S4 because we havent seen Aoi conquer Mount Fuji yet.  
 
Overall rating: 8.8/10

The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators.

Great characters too, and the voices from the Detective and Nine, pf... fantastic 
I really wanted to see more of this anime, now im in love with him and im so satisfied with the end 
Very recommendable guys, trust me, you will not regret 
 


          
 
       Helpful Story: This show's greatest strength is how it unravels the truth behind Nine and Twelve's intentions. We begin with a setting in modern day Tokyo where 2 boys make off with what we know to be a heavily guarded and secured object. You can tell that moments up until revealing the protagonists' mission were paced very well up until the very end. The story writers did a damn good job of setting up each of the events, and making sure that we as the audience knew enough to know what was going on, but not give us the entire explanation just yet. 9/10 
 
Art: It seems that ZnT was going for a more realistic approach to its animation, which I found to add more to the story. The colors used and the graphic style paired well with the kind of mood that (I believe) the anime is going for, which is on more of a serious and darker tone. I understand that a psychological thriller probably wouldn't focus a lot on aesthetically pleasing aspects such as the hair color or backgrounds like most animations do. What I enjoyed was their use of feathers to off balance a lot of the psychological aspects of the anime. 8/10 
 
Sound: I really like the opening theme and found that it greatly captures the feel of the animation. The lyrics of the song also sets up the mood of the anime quite well. I also really enjoyed the voice acting in the main characters and felt like they were chosen very appropriately. I also look forward to more of Saito Soma's work in a future  with him voicing Twelve and Tatsumi from AgK, who have very different personalities and characteristics, very we'll. I retract a point due to the ""Engrish"" that was spoken throughout the show. I thought that the sloppiness of it took away from the sense of hostility and excitement that the producers want us to feel during intense scenes. 8/10 
 
Character: I consider the unveiling of Nine and Twelve's past to part of their character development because it allows us to understand why they have done the things they've done and chose the choices they've made. I also enjoy that Nine and Twelve have made an enemy of themselves in order to unveil who the true enemies are. Talk about a double negative creating a positive. The inclusion of Risa in their affairs didn't particularly draw out to her development, but more so to our protagonists instead. I would have liked to see her character play a stronger role, where she was not in need to always being saved or taken rare of by Twelve. 8/10 
 
Enjoyment: I very much enjoyed it. The beginning, where clues and riddles were being laid out was a great way to entice the us viewers to keep watching and anticipating for me. The tragic moments highlight how well thought out the plot was, and the final scenes made me feel sad, but at peace at the same time. 8/10 
 
Overall: Great psychological thriller! I enjoyed how much research and realism that was put into this anime. I think it's pretty daring to put out an anime about terrorism considering all the current events happening lately, damn, Zankyou no Terror carried the task very well. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something interesting to watch that shoujo and slice of life can't give to their viewers. 8/10

          
 
       Helpful Having watched this based solely on a recommendation I didn't hold high hopes and thought I would give 1 episode a try. I now sit here 6 hours later having finished the anime trying to find words that do it justice. 
 
We all have that one day in our lives that we lived, that felt real and will be remembered, it may not have been a big day such as a wedding but could have been as simple as a day off work or the perfect date. This is exactly what Zankyou no Terror feels like. It doesn't rely on one big shock factor to seal the deal it paces everything perfectly, leaving you satisfied, not wanting more or less. every element did their part to bring this masterpiece together. While it may not contain a big twist or shock factor it feels like a show that has been shown love and affection by the animators. 
 
Each and every character feels like they are reaching out to the audience, the story feels real and the soundtrack reaches right into your heart. The message is constant throughout and changes as the narrative progresses, leaving you asking ""if you had the chance, could you do it?"". 
 
I was on the edge of my seat the whole time with this anime, it was as though I was a part of it and for once I'm not upset that a journey has come to an end. Rather I feel better having seen it and knowing I can do it justice through recommending it to others.  
 
I don't think there will be an anime that will immerse me as much as this one did.

It was an amazing experience might I add even though it was the second screening and there were no posters...

The story was good don't get me wrong but overall I really enjoy the music even though I can't understand what they are saying. The songs have a catchy beat to them that just get's stuck in your head. It's been over 12 hours since I watched it and I still have Sunny Day Song stuck in my head and have already listened to it over 15 times! 
 
The story this time was a little different in the sense that it's the buildup to the end of Muse. They plan to break up after a concert to show the appeal of school idols to the world. Before this happens though they end up going to America to meet up and do an interview about School Idols and also play a Live. They sing the song Angelic Angel which let me say I have played a bunch on the game.

After running away from their fans the problem arises *HAHA The puns* where they must decide... will Muse break up or will they continue to sing as Idols! If you didn't figure it out yet they broke up there band and finished off the movie with Sunny Day Song! 
 
The movie overall was abesolutely amazing and brings back the feels of the anime when you watched it for the first time.

       Helpful A Review on Love Live: The Movie 
Story –  
The story at best is simply: “Ok”. There isn’t anything exciting or interesting about it. It’s just mediocre. This was already an apparent trend in the actual series, but having it condensed in a 1 hour 39 minute movie, really makes it obvious how bad it is. The pacing is god-awful and it just throws you from scene to scene will barely any suitable transition. At one moment, it’s like: “HAH, HAPPY FUN TIME WITH MY FRIENDS” then it’s a supposedly seriously moment with a (kinda) heavy atmosphere. Then it swaps right back to the “happy, energetic moments” with again, little to no transition. It makes you question, “what was the point of that whole scene?” It feels like a waste of time and adds nothing to the overall story. It was there for simply the moe appeal. That brings up another issue I found while watching this. Because of this over usage of dramatic moments with no substance, it made me care less and less about those moments. Why is this bad? Because when there are scenes with actual substance, such as the whole tension about continuing the Muse after the third-years graduate, I couldn’t care less about it because the viewers have already been diluted to the point where their perception is just “another pointless dramatic scene.” If I were to give this Movie anything, it creates a decent conflict for once. A battle against “ the audience they  wish to continuing performing for and their relationship as a group” vs. the “philosophy of what school idol means to them”. It’s a shame the execution was just terrible, it had no proper built up, and once we got to the climax, it felt underwhelming. I also need to point out the transition to the music videos, or song section if you will. Based off what I’ve seen, it feels as if they made those segments first, and were like: 
A:“Hey, check out this cool music video we made!”  
B:“Great! Where is that going in the movie?” 
A:“Oh” 
 
 Out of the six song segments, I’ve seen, four of them were just awkwardly placed there for the sake of “We need to put this somewhere”. What annoys me about this is that seeing how they could fit in two other songs in the movie well, they failed to do it with the other four songs. It was lazily incorporated into the movie, and honestly felt like I was watching a kids show where they suddenly break out into song just out of nowhere. My best example of this is the first song segment. Where it’s just “suddenly, it’s raining... ooooh that’s bad… we can’t have fun… (or something). Then BAM, SONG. Like what? It goes from one side of the spectrum to the other within a split second, and the initiation to that segment was just, Rin jumping…. It’s a mess. 
Art –  
The animation has been half-and-half for me. Overall the drawn animation looks pretty good, especially during the dance segments. There are parts where it looks a bit stiff, but otherwise it was well made. My only complaint would be the CGI. It just awkward to look at and contrasts heavily with the background. You may argue that “dancing is hard to animate”, which it is, so using CGI is justified. But they keep on switching from CGI to Drawn, and sometimes the dancing is done in 2D animation, AND IT LOOKS BETTER. And sometimes they have CGI AND Drawn in the SAME SHOT. IT’S LIKE THEY COULDN’T DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY, otherwise, its awkward and a pain to look at.  
Sound –  
The music is good, this is the only good part of the movie. They’re idols after all, this is probably the reason why you’d watch this in the first place. If the music was bad, I don’t know why this movie would exist then, let alone the series. 
Characters –  
My main issue with Love Live would be its overall premise. They tried to make an anime based solely on an Idol group. That’s it. In an Idol group, you only need a few things to be successful. Good songs, Moe Characters, and quirky and cute personalities. In an anime, you can’t do that, you can try, but the quality will surely drop. The Love Live gang is just generic. They’re not interesting, they don’t have any character development, they’re just one-tricks. Quirky and baseless. It works for the first ten minutes at most, but in a movie? It gets fucking annoying. Allow me to run down the list: 
Honoka – Clutsy leader 
Rin – Makes meow noises at the end of her sentences, this isn’t cute. It’s annoying. 
Hanayo – WHITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Other than that, nothing is memorable. 
Umi – Overreacts to literally everything 
Maki – Generic Tsundere attitude 
Niko – NICO NICO NIIII. That’s her contribution to the story 
Kotori -  Her contribution in this movie specifically was minimal, mainly just restates the lines. 
Nozumi – Has tarot cards and just is there.  
Eri – Serious, and gets the plot rolling.  
Of course this a general description of the characters, but it's to get my point across.  
The issue here is that you can’t make a show just on very shallow personalities. From start to finish, they’re the same. Boring.  
 
Enjoyment –  
Can’t say I enjoyed it. I had literal headaches watching this. It was a waste of my time, and I’d rather would just want to see the music videos.  
 
Overall –  
The Love Live Movie is bad…. Not terrible to the point where it’s unwatchable, nor a “masterpiece” as some may describe it. It suffers from being just extremely bland, average, and mediocre. Despite the movie having great music/dance segments, that only constitutes maybe 10% of the movie. Making the other 90% of the movie just unbearably annoying.  
 
To clarify, I don't think Love Live as an Idol group is bad, I just think that the transition from an idol group to an anime and full-on movie was very very poor and deserves another look at the drawing board for we cannot continue with the perception that this series is ""well-made"" when it clearly lacks in the most important areas in what makes a good anime.  
 
Final Rating: 
5/10 
Story – 3

       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, albeit minor ones 
The Love Live movie was kinda good 
 
It had a lot fan service but not in the definition that most people would use. Quite a number of scenes, jokes, lines and details are throwbacks to the previous two seasons, meant to give fans enjoyment when they recognise them. Also, that one snippet very near the beginning with Maki, wow. 
The plot was... ...it didn't give a clear direction in where it was going until past the halfway mark. They were working hard but I was wondering why. Actually, we weren't even shown their hard work and jump into the group song when they say so. I think that might have contributed to my inability to root for them in the movie. 
 
Most of the songs were seemingly randomly inserted with dances that make no sense in the moment. I even started thinking, after the second random insert, that the creators put those songs in to match the number of songs that there would be in a full season. 
 
Admittedly, the throwbacks were really enjoyable, among other things. 
 
The mysterious person was quite an interesting addition too. 
 
The art was also a great improvement. 
 
Overall, it's good for fans and a pretty bad place to start for the uninitiated. 
...I'm kind of torn between rating it 6/10, 7/10. 6/10 for the reasons above, 7/10 because it was enjoyable nonetheless. 
 
I guess I'll settle for 7/10

4,9712,124,6.439017294,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Maria†Holic Alive,"When Kanako Miyamae transferred to a new all-girls school, she hoped to find true love. What she found instead was the beautiful Mariya Shidou, a charming classmate Kanako met on her first day. But Mariya has one flaw: she is actually a cross-dressing boy! After discovering Mariya's secret and becoming stuck with him as her roommate, Kanako's life has become a series of misfortunes. All she wants is to find the girl of her dreams, which is hard to do with the meddling of the sadistic Mariya and his sharp-tongued maid Matsurika Shinouji. 
  
 Maria†Holic Alive  continues the story of Kanako as she deals with being Mariya's roommate and aims to find true love, while enduring high school itself. 
  
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shoujo Ai']","Maria†Holic revolves around a high school girl named Kanako Miyamae, who due to a childhood incident is scared of boys and breaks out in hives if a boy touches her. During her second year of high school, she enrolls in an all-girls school hoping to find a female romantic partner. However, her ideal candidate, Mariya Shidō, turns out to be a sadistic cross-dressing boy.
","I had a love-hate relationship with the first season of Maria Holic. It was like a train wreck - I knew how awful it was going to be, but I couldn't look away. At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.  
 
Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But, it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.  
 
I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me.

          
 
       Helpful Maria Holic Alive is the sequel to the above-average anime, Maria Holic. To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided. 
 
Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako's transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako's crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there's still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it's nothing too serious. 
 
The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting. 
 
The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing. 
 
Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.  
 
Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic. If you're looking for comedy anime, go watch something else instead. 

          
 
       Helpful The story for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1, in other words the only unique thing about it was the fact that it had a perverted teenage girl instead of a perverted teenage boy. That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10. 
The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10. 
The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10. 
The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10. 
The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10. 
The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

After a series of embarrassing accidents, both she and the mysterious boy she had a crush on, Akira Sudo, were elected as members of the student council. Being the first student council of this newly established high school, they are about to create ""new traditions"" for their school and a bittersweet love story for themselves...

","I remember loving the manga, which, as everything written by Ai Yazawa, shows lively characters with real, deep emotions and issues. 
The problem with this OVA is obvious even before watching it: it's a 30-minute video out of an 8-volume series. It doesn't expect to represent the entire plot, but even the slice taken in consideration by the OVA is really shrunk, and everything happens so fast that there's no time for the characters to develop their feelings or to show their complex personalities, which is a big part of what makes Yazawa's stories wonderful, nor it's possible for the viewer to really get attached to the characters, especially without having the manga in mind. The plot of the OVA is a bit meaningless, by itself, it feels like some things are happening, without real reason or a final resolution. 
 
That said, it's a surprisingly good effort, considering all the issues I've mentioned. The art and animation is as good as one can expect from such an old anime, but not really worth watching, especially if you haven't read the manga. 
If you're a die-hard fan with 30 minutes of spare time, and have nothing better to do, watch this, but don't expect too much.

","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The film is based on the tradition of ""four basic necessities of life"", like each other and is divided into three storylines: 

The Rice Noodles (Japanese: 陽だまりの朝食, romanized: hidamari no chōshoku, simplified Chinese: 一碗乡愁; traditional Chinese: 一碗鄉愁; pinyin: yì wǎn xiāng chóu), focusing on food

","I watched the netflix version of this, which just sort of mushes the three stories together to make a feature length film. The story is as the MAL description says. It has three parts that do not really have much to do with each other. Each story is sweet and features about 80% voice over to tell it. Your enjoyment of the three may vary. I personally feel that the middle story is the weakest and kind of played out. However, the characters are solid. The first is my favorite for the visuals and the voice acting (which we'll get into later) but lacks any kind of story. The third is the only one with a real story line. However, the characters are bland and the voice acting is terrible. No one part has everything.  
 
The art is absolutely spectacular. While the character design is lacking, the background and and settings are very deep and dazzling. There was a shot of a puddle in the opening minutes that made me mark out hard. The art is pretty consistent throughout the three stories, but the first is where the most animation time went into.  
 
The sound and music are not very noticeable. Aside from a few good tape recording and cooking effects there is not much to talk about. The dubbing is a bit rough. It is a little noticeable in the second story with not awkwardly read, but awkwardly translated lines. Then, in the third story we get to listen to captain no charisma do the main character.  
 
The characters are where this movie takes a hit. Outside of the second story there are not any noteworthy characters. Some kids, some grandparents etc.  
 
Overall, it is a very easy and fast watch. The movie likes to try to trigger nostalgia and in some cases may do so effectively. I would recommend watching it with the dub if only to be able to focus on the beautiful artwork as it is one of the few saving graces of the work.

          
 
       Helpful • SLIGHT SPOILER REVIEW • 
 
Shikioriori, English name: Flavors of Youth, is divided into 3 Chapters: First (Sunny Breakfast), Second (Small Fashion Show), Third (Shanghai Love). Similar on what Shinkai did on 5 Centimeters per Second. The movie is placed in China and even the main character’s name is all in Chinese. But the studio and voice actors are Japanese. Here’s my quick review of the film: 
 
Story: 
As the film begins, you're greeted with an aesthetically beautiful art and animation followed by a few words and the first chapter’s title. The MC of the first chapter then is introduced. As the first chapter ends, the second chapter begins. The transition is the same as the first one. As the story flows, the movie gives a very heartwarming slice of life, with a slight touch of love, heartbreak, and a mediocre drama. The story travels from the perspective of a young man experiencing youth, first love, and being unknowledgeable about adults. Being able to wonder why do people leave? The story then jumps from a young man to a 20-ish women. The movie shows how life has plenty of trials to overcome, and how people be able to overcome those difficult trials. In this chapter, the movie also questions you, ”The job you choose, are you really enjoying it?” ”Have you really live life to the fullest?”. Then from 20-ish women to a young boy, in this chapter, you are able to realize how communication is really important at any times. This chapter is so far the best among them. A really strong friendship of a group of best friends followed by a trial they should, with the emotion of love, anxiety, and fear at their backs. This chapter shows how this group of friends reacts to their current situation and how time could never be rewind even you wish to. Overall, the plot is filled with tons of great slice of life, paced on a slow start and an explosive ending. There are no big expectations, to begin with. The story might be boring to some non slice of anime fans. 7/10 
 
Art: As the Studio who created Your Name, 5 Centimeter Per Seconds and Garden of Words, it was amazing. Tho there are times where you can able to see some lousy animation, but overall its good. The budget might not be too big as compared to Shinkai’s work, but CoMix Wave really give a shot especially to those beautiful backgrounds! The CGI of the cars are actually good too. Nevertheless, the animation is amazing, tho they have flaws, but the positives overpowered all the negatives. 8/10 
 
Sound: Sound effects are great. The food preparation during the first few minutes of the film is amazing. The chopping of ingredients, up to the sound of rain. It's actually pretty decent. The credits song is actually good too. 8/10 
 
Character: The character designs are mediocre for me. I mean, CoMix Wave actually has pretty decent animation and art skills. But their character design is just .... meh. Its nothing to be amazing and shock about. VAs are good. They did choose a very warm tone for the VAs of the MCs. There is really no character development that can be seen in the movie. But on how the MCs end their chapter is really a big thumbs up for me. It also relays a message to the viewers and few life lessons. Overall, 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: I’m a fan of slice of life anime, so I’m pretty used to a slow-paced plot. A slow pace movie also gives the audience time to enjoy the great art drawn by the studio. Afterall, it is a great animation that leads the viewers to finish the movie at the end. I somewhat enjoy the movie. There are no explosives and huge plot twist like Your Name, nor a heavy drama and heart pounding ending like 5 centimeters. Just pure slice of life with a glimpse of love and a tiny drama. Overall, 8/10 
 
Conclusion: As I said a moment ago, this movie is pace differently to other famous one. So you should not compare it to them as they are way different from each other. I would definitely recommend this anime to SOME, as non slice of life and drama fan might get really bored to this film. Overall, a great film if you are looking for something to cry one. Overall, films score is 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful This film comprises three shorter, independent stories, with the common premise of the inevitable loss of the things, people and places that used to make us happy. I think it is targeted at a certain demographic starting at late 20s to early 30s, when one begins to realize the extent of this loss. It is an emotional experience for those of us who can relate to it, but to those who not it may be boring, since all three stories are built on a feeling more than a plot: In that aspect, it reminds me of Jiro Taniguchi's works. Let's say as well that I don't agree with other reviewers in the point that it is a product for an Asian audience specifically: I am Spanish and I can fully relate to the themes presented. 
 
When giving a score to it, the problem is that I'd give a different score to the three shorts: 7 to the first one, 6 to the second and 8 to the third; therefore, by average I give it a 7 (plus an extra point because overall I enjoyed it quite a lot and felt touched). I feel though that the themes could have been better executed, specially in the first and second stories. 
 
Keep in mind that this is not something you watch for the story, but for the shared feeling of nostalgia between the film and your own experience. If you haven't felt that experience of seeing the things that mean your younger days disappear, you'll probably find this boring.

","Even though I barely played any of the persona games, I really adore the series. I got interested by Persona Q, decided to check out P3 and P4. One of the better decisions I've made in my life. 
 
After watching the first movie, I was hooked to the story of P3. As a newcomer, I could follow the story, get into the style, get to know the characters etc. The second movie got me even more hyped for the series. Once I realised the movie was released with the English Dub, I had to see it ASAP. 
 
Well honestly, it wasn't bad. But I wouldn't call it great either. 
 
Story: 5 
 
With the story telling being the worst offender here. For the first time in three movies, I had troubles following everything. From the start, it felt like I was missing so much information. Not because it started in the middle of an action packed scene, but because after it was done, I was left with many questions. How did they end up in that situation? Honestly, that seemed like it would make a great scene. 
 
And as the movie progressed, it didn't get any better. Sometimes the pacing is rather slow, filled with fillerish moments etc. And other times, it's way too fast. So fast that it has to include important information in the form of a flashback. 
 
There also seems to be a really big hole between the beginning and the midsection of the movie. While it's nice and fitting for the series to have your slice of life moments, it just felt like all the slice of life scenes were crammed in those moments. 
 
And have I mentioned there is a severe lack of information going on? Even after watching the movie, I had to explore the wiki to understand more(about Strega for example(At some point I thought Strega was a complete race, different from humans). 
 
Character: 5 
 
The character development is also sub par. I really like the characters from Persona 3, especially after playing countless hours of Persona Q, I really got to know them better. But I just can't associate with them in this movie. While I love how dark some of them are at the beginning of the movie, the switch seemed unnatural. It wasn't instant, they took the time for it. It was just poorly written. 
 
Besides that, the feelings of other characters seemed to be completely forgotten(Honestly, Ken should have gotten way more attention in this movie), or are written off with just one short scene. 
 
Similar to the couple formed in this movie. I just don't buy it. There is no buildup, it's just suddenly there. And you have one flashback to justify it. And I really think they are cute and everything, but as the ending neared, I just couldn't care what happened to them, or what could have happened. 
 
Art/Sound: 8 
 
What I said above are mainly the biggest things I disliked about the movie. The art and sound though, just like the previous movies, great. The CGI blends in really well, the music is topnotch(although, I hoped for more Persona songs), the animation is well done, the style is great. Sometimes, the difference between the dark hour and night is a bit iffy, but it's nothing big really. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
And after all, it's still enjoyable. Maybe I'm saying this as a Persona fan, but even though I was annoyed at many things, I didn't felt the need to turn it off. There are plenty of moments that make the movie worthwhile. 
 
Overall: 6 
 
So a 6. It's not good, but not bad either. If you have played Persona 3 before, I think it appeals to you. If you've just seen the first two movies, and aren't really into the series or characters, you probably won't enjoy this movie as much.

          
 
       Helpful Fall means the preservation of life and boy does Falling Down both play this up and looks deep into this when talking about the SEES. 
 
So Persona 3 the Movie 3: Falling Down quite early on time skips a bit where SEES are facing off against Strega and having defeated the last of the Shadows, but comes an early plot twist that just changes so much of what SEES were initially doing that it changes the course of many of the core cast. 
 
Makoto's beliefs is struck once again but this time not wanting to keep the Dark Hour and playing hero but having to protect those close to him and not for him to get hurt if they were to ""vanish"" thus keeping his distance towards SEES, a new character arrives in the form of Ryoji Mochizuki voiced by Akira Ishida (Hmmm..same voice actor as Makoto) and quickly becomes buddies with Makoto and the rest of the SEES and being quite the womanizer as well, anyways he helps Makoto get him out of this funk of keeping his distance from people and even getting Makoto to join the ""Helper's Club"" to earn a few bucks. The second core plotline comes in Junpei and one of Strega's, Chidori Yoshino voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro as Junpei starts to care for her even though she's an enemy and they actually get in a relationship together while Chidori is recovering in the hospital. The last core plotline is in the form of the aftermath of the early plot twist LA mentioned that actually gives Mitsuru development and world building, not only about the Dark Hour and Tartarus but  at the same time is linked somewhat thematically to Yukari as well.  These three core plotlines deals with separation through death one way or another, Makoto's fear of losing any of his friends, Junpei and Chidori's relationship near the climax and Yukari and Mitsuru dealing with death in their own way and thematically Persona 3 the Movie 3: Falling Down does a good job executing it. 
 
There are some some smaller plotlines that gets resolved in which they were kinda brought up in the previous movies, such as giving finality towards Fuuka and Natsuki, Akihiko's resolves on why he still fights and some more detail into Aegis as both a character and her obsession with protecting Makoto gives some clarity. 
 
Once again, like Midsummer Knight's Dream, Persona 3 the Movie 3: Falling Down gives some cameos to social links, this time towards the student council concerning Chihiro Fushimi and LA brings up the social links again as Falling Down seems much more focused on it's social link aspect than the dungeon aspect from previous movies, kinda makes sense due to the formulaic Shadow hunting is done and gone so what else can they do?, so LA sees the focus to social links to be an obvious direction this movie would go to, especially concerning the core SEES members and their interactions with one another and they do the social links events as well, the biggest example being the Kyoto field trip and the *ahem* Onsen operation. 
 
LA won't say much again about the production value as it's the same as Midsummer Knight's Dream, with it done by A1-Pictures and the voice cast is pretty much the same just with Akira Ishida and Miyuki Sawashiro pulling double and even triple duty with some of the newer characters. But with the animation department, LA will say it is the same as Midsummer Knight's Dream, the animation is consistent and the character designs are the same silky designs with the action packed battles the same as well. Consistency was what LA wanted and it easily passed. 
 
So Persona 3 the Movie 3: Falling Down did ALOT, mainly due to the change of pace and how grim dark it took thematically, developing the majority of the cast along with it and executed rather well, it helps that the core cast almost all have the same themes of losing people and death being prevalent to them happen to them, nonetheless if Midsummer Knight's Dream was the build up to it's themes and it's characters then Falling Down is the climax of it all. Sure this movie rushed it rather early but LA can give Falling Down some grace for at least trying give characters much needed screentime, character development and tying itself nicely and thematically linking itself to it's themes of death and separation was dealt with extremely well. 
 
And now we see the ""final boss"" as it were... 
 
Fall lies in wake of the Winter of Rebirth...

          
 
       Helpful Persona 3 the Movie 3: Falling Down is based on the Atlus game Persona 3, more specifically it is focused on November and December. The story of Persona 3 revolves around an young man who returns to his hometown after several years, discovers that there are unusual events and through a series of events gains access to people's power. 
 
I played the game and i liked the movie but not as much as i like the game, i i'll try to give the good features in the movie, here the game was better and why. 
 
Story: 5 out of 10 
 
On this movie there is many thing wrong, the dates are wrong, some events are wrong and they miss some important events. If i remember well in the game Chidori kidnaped Jumpei in September and after they retrieve him they kept her on the hospital. Spoiler alert, What happened to Jumpei's persona before it happened to other characters and that didn't happen in the movie. 
 
Art: 10 out of 10 
 
The art is the same as in the game, it is a beautiful kind of art that fits the game very well. 
 
Sound: 10 out of 10 
 
It is so good they i have nothing to say about it, the bgm fits every scene, the voices and the other sounds are also very well done. 
 
Characters: 5 out of 10 
 
They developed some characters in the movie, but they left out many important events that as someone o played the game, i can just say that they did the right choice. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 out of 10 
 
I enjoy looking for the differences between the game and the movie, but in this movie there were many to many big differences.  
 
Overall: 7 out of 10 
 
If you're thinking about watching the movie to know if you should play the game, DON'T DO IT! First play the game than watch the movie.

4,240,128,6.290162379,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Genshiken,"Kanji Sasahara is an introverted college freshman just looking for a place to fit in. One day, he happens to stumble upon the club known as the Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture—otherwise known as Genshiken—that serves to bring the full spectrum of otaku culture together. His first visit to the club, however, does not end well as Sasahara's pride is crushed by his senior, Harunobu Madarame, and he leaves the meeting in full denial of his otaku nature. However, after befriending club member Makoto Kousaka, who turns out to be a hardcore otaku despite his looks, Sasahara becomes more involved with club activities which include obsessing over their favorite anime, reading doujinshi, and attending conventions. There, he meets other interesting people like Kousaka's vehemently non-otaku girlfriend Saki Kasukabe, who strives to turn her boyfriend into a ""normal guy."" 
 
While Saki struggles to understand otaku culture and her boyfriend's love for it, Sasahara finds himself enjoying his time at Genshiken, gradually shedding any denial he once had about being an otaku and immersing himself in an otaku lifestyle.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","BANG POW CRASH SMUSH , Genshiken avoids the cliches and focuses instead on the reality, this isn't a series about spectacular super human ninjas that were injected with magical fox semen,  it's about the otaku subculture in Japan, it's about the people that are the otaku's and the choices they make , there goals ambitions lifestyles failures and successes. Watching this series, which is hard to get into unless you've read the manga ( Doujin Work ) you really start rooting for the characters, when things happen you hold your mouth in shock, you feel the jealousy and taste the dislike in the back of your throat it's really an anime that pulls you in and keeps you there with humor , intelligence , games , hatred and love.

       Helpful College slices of life are rare in a medium prolific with high school romances, 15-year-old pilots in mecha, gargantuan harems, and everything inbetween. In comes Genshiken, one of the most laidback and down to earth shows I've ever seen. The heavy amount of realism is almost shocking, and the college club slice of life elements are fantastic. Picturing a life in an otaku club can't get anymore immersible than this, with a solid lead character that's relatable (much like Yuuta from Honey & Clover), and an all-around fantastic ensemble. You know you're in for a ride when your appreciation for Genshiken's comedy is directly proportional to how awkward your social skills are. 
 
Perhaps what's most striking about Genshiken is its crassness with the ins and outs of otaku culture. The show manages to hit the main crevices on otakudom—whether it be compulsively watching midnight screenings, purchasing doujinshi, cosplaying, or even building models. Genshiken intends neither to glorify nor criticize the underlying culture; what merely exists is prevalent, and Genshiken deftly and unbiasedly documents it. 
 
What's also admirable is how forward Genshiken is in its storytelling, particularly with not dodging borderline controversial material. Saki, for instance, constantly berates others with her sexually frustrated problems, and admits that one of the main reasons she dates Kohsaka is because of his looks. Frankness with sexual content is to be expected of in western shows, but is fairly commendable for one within an otaku-glorified medium. Even holding hands may take an anime multiple seasons! (Yes, Japan may not be so forward as in western cultures, but ""purity"" is nowhere even close to what's perceived in pandering anime versus real-life Japan.) 
 
Genshiken's unparalleled persistence to realism almost becomes one of its few flaws, as the show is practically uneventful—even for slice of life standards. This is where you have to wonder when the mundane is pulled too far. One episode could be so briefly summarized as, ""Saki reads manga in the clubroom while Madarame tries to strike up a conversation."" The work is almost Hyouka-esque in its banality, but fortunately, Genshiken is told in such a charming way that you often forget that nothing even happened in the episodes (and it's also not spoiled by silly ""mystery"" antics like Hyouka's first half). 
 
The ""new guy in the group"" manages to be an archetype served well here, as it grants viewers the insight into what would otherwise be a closeted (and hence alienable) culture. To divy the variety, the role is often placed among different members of the group (particularly with Sasahara and Saki) depending on the situation. However, Genshiken's cast performance is not all as great as the concept bears to mind. Certain characters are unfortunately pivoted towards the sidelines while the few with inherently more interesting premises take up the primary spotlight. Saki becomes the de facto main lead (while already the poster girl), and Sasahara is more or less forgettable during most of his screentime. He spends his idle time blending in and never doing anything that stands out, offering comedic reactions in uniform with the rest of the group. What makes this truly unfortunate is that given the ensemble's individual premises, each character offers a certain flavor of comedy to enhance every scene. Instead, we're served the same glops of behaviors and comedic variety each episode, which quickly diminishes one's entertainment via pure redundancy. Sure, the topics change and the group slowly mingles more and more, but the character dynamics and per-character screentimes remain relatively the same. 
 
The animation and artwork is dated and quickly shows its age from a cursory glance. A most noticeable resemblance would be to the often compared work, Welcome to the NHK!. In both, the visuals are frankly quite terrible, but this is mostly forgivable due to their comedy subgenre anyways. Works like Genshiken don't necessarily rely on compelling production values to ample its enjoyment, and there are never situations where you feel more detailed visuals would have benefited a particular scene. On the audio side, the soundtrack is practically nonexistent, which complements the laidback, relatable atmosphere of the show (especially with all the awkward scenes). Production-wise as a whole, things here are cheap as Mexican candy, but so what? It works. 
 
Genshiken is a fantastic, homey slice of life that places itself in a genre difficult to come across these days. The ensemble has its flaws, but overall the casual storytelling really takes center stage and makes up for this. The cast slowly yet noticeably grows with each other, and the uneventfulness of Genshiken really grows on you. This is certainly not a show to miss, and I look forward to its newest season. Hopefully it'll retain the same charm that makes the show so endearing.

       Helpful If you are an Otaku, then you should probably watch this series. You'll definitely find yourself identifying with one of the characters, if not most of them. And wish that you had such an inclusive club to develop your inner otaku. Its a wonderful study of Japanese culture featuring anime, plamos, games, cosplay, manga, and dōjinshi. I recommend watching a good fansub that includes definitions of various otaku slang, if you aren't familiar with them. As a fairly new otaku, I found myself learning alot of new things about the culture. So yeah this anime doesn't have magical girls, aliens, or giant robots, it does have various otakus willing to debate those subjects and brave an army of other crazy otakus, just to get the latest dōjinshi. If you have a favorite Gundam series and are willing to fight for it you may even find yourself siding with characters. Not to mention the various name drops and cameos of anime, and games. So take a chance and watch this ""realistic"" anime, you'll be surprised how much you have in common.

Their split personalities, Yoru and Ran, are deeply in love. Even though it creeps Fujimori and Hashiba out what their other selves do with each other at night, they also start to fall for each other. Because of their relationship, Hashiba Sora finds out a lot of shocking facts about their youth.","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Shounen Ai', 'Slice of Life']","High-school student Sora Hashiba was hospitalized after falling from the fourth floor of his school building. On his first night back in the dormitory, he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name of ""Yoru"". The stranger identifies himself as ""Ran"" and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or ""Nao-kun"", is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.
Sora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as ""Ran"" that first night: he and Sora have alternate personalities. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.
Other comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group ""The School Do-It-Alls"" and from such minor characters as a bishōnen ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin'ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans. Both have some connection with Sora and Sunao's dark past, which also involves one of the older students at the school, Kai Nagase, and a mysterious doctor named Aizawa.
","Entirely too cutesy wutesy woo. Entirely too predictable. Entirely too annoying. Just what age-group had that been directed to?  
 
When I started watching, I immediately thought that the overly cute and constant chibi-scenes were more awkward than funny. It was like the story was grabbing me from the neck and yelling ""it's chibis and they are being cute and funny. NOW LAUGH!"". Honestly,  
 
In 12 episodes, there were entirely too many characters and trying to deal with them all just made the anime confusing. Specially when the story-telling jumped back and forth from cutesy wutesy woo chibis to seriousness like... every few minutes. Like the review I read about the series before watching it ""once you think the chibis are just a bit too much, it changes into more serious story-telling, and when the angst is starting to become overwhelming, it goes back into the humour-mode"" ( or so ). That is really hard to pull off without being annoying. Fruits Basket managed this marvelously, Sukisyo didn't. It was just restless and hard to follow. Not to mention that more than once I was stunned by the sheer stupidity of the characters ( someone might call them plotholes... ). In the end, I felt like whole of that second personality stuff was pretty pointless, among many other things. They hardly supported or had anything to with the main plot.  
 
It did jerk some laughter out of me ( but sometimes it wasn't because of the humor ) but most of the time I felt like banging my head to desk. 
 
The style of the animation... ugh... not only was it overly cute, it was pretty generic, anime gone overly-cute. Almost all the most important characters had weird colored hair and eyes while the background characters were almost always that basic brown-haired and brown-eyed types. I really hate it when for no apparent reason characters have cute blue or pink or what not eyes or hair, specially if they totally stand out from the rest of the group yet no one minds.  
Animation itself was basic good. Nothing too incredible but not bad either. At least all the eps looked pretty much the same ( at least I didn't notice any big difference anywhere ). 
 
Sora was fun, but his constant chibi-transformations made him a bit annoying. Also, his stupidity from time to time was nothing out of annoying, rather than cute ( and make no mistake, I often like dumb characters ). His alter-ego Yoru, seemed much more interesting. 
 
Sunao was cute. If you like that kind of cute. I don't. His light-red hair accompanied with such basic ""difficult uke"" behavior was irritating, and his reasons of angsting and eventually putting up most of the story was ridiculous. I can't find such childishness believable, let alone likable. 
 
I was mostly interested in Nanami's and Shinichirou's relationship in the end. Mostly because I like their voice actors alot, which is probaply pretty shallow but that's really all there was to it. 
 
I liked Matsuri a lot, because... can anyone say Ayame ( Fruits Basket )? Sure you can. He was totally, absolutely like Ayame. Then again, that's also why I didn't like him as much as I could have - originality is nice. 
 
While I'm a complete shounen-ai/yaoi fan, I did find the lack of girls a bit silly. I don't think in whole 12 eps there was a single female character around, not even in the background. It was a total Homotopia and while I sometimes amuse myself with such thoughts, it's really kinda unrealistic. That Valentine's Day ep was a sad... sad thing to see. 
 
Anyway, this was definitely a very disappointing anime and I really can't recommend it for anyone.

          
 
       Helpful I've noticed, that as I read the reviews, that a lot of people seemed to dis and look for the faults in this anime. I am still new to the yaoi anime department, but seeing that I am, I thought I should at least give my opinion on this. 
 
As I said, I'm new to Yaoi, and this was a great way to ease me into the themes. It's not overly detailed and somewhat cute in a way. Though, this may not be a good anime for hard-core and people who like yaoi to a major, this is great for those who have just been introduced to the anime. 
 
Though, I did question why there were only GUYS in this anime. I never saw one girl and obviously, in this an all boy school, everyone has strange interests (though that doesn't bug me entirely). But I did think, since it is an all boy school, strange interests are bound to happen. 
 
The humor in the anime always had me laughing and I chuckled through-out the anime (I owuld have just laughed...but my parents would have then looked at me funny). When I first started watching, I was a tad confused in the beginning but then everyone became Chibis...I have a sorta weakness to chibis so I kinda just squealed upon seeing them. 
 
Again, I state that to yaoi otakus, I agree that this anime may be bad to all of you, but to those girls (or boys) who are just introduced to yaoi and are just easing into likin it, it's a great anime to start.

          
 
       Helpful Sukisho, where to start... This would have to be my all time favourite anime. The story is fairly original I felt, with a good dose of humour that sort of masks the dark undertones so it's not a depressing anime. It's a story of friendship and love, but also cruelty and revenge. I recommend this to everyone, even if boy x boy isn't your thing, it's only light shounen ai and is still a great watch.

","(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!) 
 
My wonderful sister got married near the end of last year. 
 
Her husband (now my brother-in-law) are perfect for one another. They have each other’s backs, putting up with the other’s “baggage” despite their differences. And with him being one of the nicest guys that I know, and her being overly supportive, they are as compatible as can be. 
 
I know they’ll have a successful, happy marriage moving forward. At the minimum, they’ll be a lot better off than whatever Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! presented. 
 
STORY 
 
As expected, Okusama contains similar content to that of the first season. Izumi and Ui are shacked up, leading to the pair’s multitude of sexual romps. Unfortunately, Okusama also includes a ton of unnecessary elements that ultimately ruin the entire experience. 
 
Chief among its problems is a refusal to let any of its sexual content play out. Not only in first-second-third base terms but also in emotional terms too. Izumi and Ui are about to passionately kiss? In barges Rin to stop it before it even happens. They’re about to get frisky in bed? Sorry, Izumi, but premature ejaculation would like a word. A Rin-and-Ui double feature ready and waiting? Whoops, Rin’s sister conveniently shows up to say a few words and derail the fornication. 
 
Even when the anime finally has the guts to show off its sexual content, much of it simply lacks spice or at least variety. One too many almost-touched-lips kisses with Izumi and groping without any flair lead from one boring sexual encounter to another. Izumi helping Ui take a suppository is as adventurous as the anime gets. 
 
These events and the ones outside the realm of debauchery also go against Okusama’s previous season’s theme on marriage even more so than ever before. The anime constantly places Izumi in situations that don’t involve Ui whatsoever or simply don’t mesh with the marriage aspect of their relationship. 
 
For instance, they raid the photography club’s clubroom, but it’s an event that has little (if anything) to do with how Ui and Izumi get along. What occurs, then, is a slew of scenes that should have never been allowed to happen in the first place since they continue to reinforce why the anime does not deserve to be titled My Wife Is the Student Council President. 
 
The anime does keep its motif in mind on occasion, like when Ui complains about Izumi not giving her enough attention (and touching) or when Izumi eats the food Ui concocted despite its nefarious aura (because that’s what a man should do). Sadly, Okusama would much rather give Rin yet another unnecessary shot with the male lead, bringing the anime back towards polygamy. 
 
Okusama does have its small moments. The condom that Rin’s older sister gave to Izumi returns as a joke later in the season when Rin discovers it in his desk drawer, and the final episode proves that the anime didn’t forget about Ui’s parents from last season, giving them a miniscule cameo to cap off this this season. Plus, it does have the usual cute pouts and comedic jokes to fill the gaps between the promiscuous asides. 
 
Unfortunately, so much of the content is boring, aggravating, or otherwise lacking that whatever else Okusama attempts to do cannot heal its self-inflicted wounds. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
In this second season of Okusama, the amount of actual animation seems to have decreased. Characters will sometimes shift forward without moving their limbs, and the events themselves usually end up as just the characters speaking to one another while standing. Rin’s breasts do jiggle at every opportunity, but that’s not enough to justify how static a lot of the scenes feel. Especially when the sexual content refuses to give much more than Ui sucking Izumi’s finger or showcasing yet another still-framed picture of the girls as naked as possible. 
 
Speaking of the sexual content, the anime at least (and once again) provides a censored and uncensored version. 
 
Naturally (and once again once again), the uncensored material is the biggest draw of the show and wins out over the censored material. Granted, all that’s really shown are nipples, and the explicit material that’s too tough to cover up with baby chicks is replaced with theatrics that aim for cute, comedic relief. But the crotch shots, despite their perversion, are why the audience are there in the first place, so uncensored is really the only way to go. 
 
The artistry in general still doesn’t impress, but it gets the job done. While the fast-moving backgrounds and the talking-head bubbles are relied on more than usual, Rin and Ui still have their attractive designs, and the silly reactions with the squatter, comedic depictions of the characters invites the cuteness and the funniness with ease. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
As an ecchi, comedic short, Okusama doesn’t have the character depth that regular dramas tend to include. However, that doesn’t excuse the anime from a lot of choices it makes regarding its cast. 
 
For example, Rin receives a lot more attention this season. Said attention is mostly going towards her chest, but Okusama also highlights her naivety when it comes to love and the difficulty she has in accepting Ui’s working theories on letting lust live. Thus, Rin starts to take part in the lasciviousness, letting Izumi release his pent-up hormones with her breasts or thinking about buying a black bra to satiate Izumi’s own desires. 
 
Yet, during most of Rin’s sexual interactions with Izumi, the outcome is the same: punching him in the face. Despite initiating the situation herself, she’s the one who ends it (often in a violent manner). 
 
To be fair, her even putting herself in those situations is arguably a big step forward for her, considering her role as the head of the disciplinary committee and her previously discussed naivety. But she never truly leaves this quasi state of liking-Izumi-but-not-really. Plus, it gets quite old quite fast to see her stop her progression for the umpteenth time when she was the one to start it in the first place. 
 
Ui and Izumi are no better. Arguably, they are worse. 
 
As a (supposed) couple, they don’t have very many scenes together. With Rin refusing to go away, the introduction of Honoka, and the comedy involving the side characters, Ui and Izumi rarely have any alone time. When they finally are alone, they almost never exchange words of love or commitment, and the relationship they do share does not rise above friends with benefits. 
 
It gets worse. Looking at Ui and Izumi individually, they don’t help themselves or each other. 
 
Ui constantly lets Izumi take part in situations with the other characters that will inevitably become sexually charged. She either has no idea, is oblivious, or, worst of all, simply doesn’t care. 
 
Izumi is similar. His instincts will eventually control him if pushed to his absolute limit, but these moments are rather uncommon. Sometimes, he himself won’t let their relationship move forward, like when he “has to go to the bathroom” when Ui says right to his face how she won’t run away from him, readying herself to kiss him outright. 
 
As for everyone else, Okusama should get some credit for providing its side characters with a moment or two to shine. Ayane gets to see what it is like to have a boyfriend, Karen learns to not hate Izumi’s guts as much, and Honoka creates some scenarios for Izumi, Ui, and Rin to comingle within. 
 
But even this credit is difficult to see as a positive when one realizes that they are also getting in the way of what is supposed to be a “marriage” between Ui and Izumi. Ayane gets somewhat tacked on as last-ditch option for Izumi, Karen’s episode doesn’t incorporate Ui to any large extent, and Honoka comes off as an unnecessary addition to the cast when she barely contributes to the plot besides snapping a few phots here and there. 
 
Again, Okusama isn’t a “deep” anime, and the sole reason for watching it is to see some occasional boobies, so a lot of these gripes are “pointless.” Still, when the anime is arguably an anime about Ui and Izumi, and what’s presented is anything but, the show does not do itself any favors. 
 
SOUND 
 
The opening track and the ending track are (understandably) small pieces that help to set the tone for Okusama. 
 
The OP uses piano and drums to create a fast beat with a sense of nostalgia, but the grating instrumental in the background is way too distracting no matter how many bells go off. The ED is even shorter than the OP (twenty seconds versus thirty seconds), but it stands as the better of the two thanks to its happier feeling through blaring trumpets. Also, letting the voice actresses for Ui, Rin, and Honoka sing their own versions of the ED gives it more variety than its OP counterpart. 
 
These voice actresses are Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Sora Tokui (respectively). While Ms. Tokui does not have any notable scenes, Ms. Taketatsu knows how to pout, Ms. Tsuda has the authoritative drive, and the two can moan when needed. 
 
(And a small shout-out to the talking hormones, condoms, and erections that supported the show in comedic fashion.) 
 
The rest of the original soundtrack remains the same as the first season. A light piano backs the romantic scenes and steps along for the sillier ones. And a nice acoustic guitar accompanies the quieter, simpler times. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Once again, I find myself conflicted over an anime. 
 
On the one hand, it’s frustrating to watch many of the scenes play out when they almost always conclude with some interruption or unnatural shove in the opposite direction. A lot of this interrupting and shoving derives from Rin, but Ui is no better when she fails to make any significant strides due to her odd choices. To be fair, Izumi is just as much at fault with everything as these two, but he at least has the excuse that he’s at their mercy most of the time. 
 
On the other hand, I like both girls. Ui has the caring personality that I find very attractive, and Rin has the bombshell looks that get my head turning. Ui made me laugh with her huge pouts, Rin had me smiling at her blushes, and the two together were no doubt arousing when it came to their ecchi escapades (even if they weren’t exactly novel). 
 
I want to like this one more than I do, but the anime makes it hard to do so. The show should just go all the way in one direction with either Rin or Ui. Enough of the back-and-forth, maybe-maybe-not wishy-washiness. Because the anime is cute and funny and arousing – but it just doesn’t know what it ultimately wants to be. 
 
Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! ends up worse off than its previous season. Further deviation from its marriage motif, less animation, and not enough focus on Ui and Izumi are its biggest mistakes. Its art and music remain consistent, but it’s a show that one will part with long before death. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, constant refusal to let events play out and even more unnecessary “polygamy” entirely defeat the purpose of the narrative 
 
Animation: Fine, while less movement occurs, the uncensored material and the comedic portrayals keep the visuals both alluring and fun 
 
Characters: Terrible, Ui and Izumi’s relationship goes nowhere as they and those around them impede their progress without fail 
 
Sound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Fine, Rin and Ui are likable, but having both together only makes things unlikable 
 
Final Score: 3/10

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to tits the anime! Are you a filthy cave dwelling otaku who wants to watch a bunch of high school girls with large breasts swarm over one guy like moths to a flame without having any personality while at the same time remaining stagnant throughout the show? Then this is the anime for you! 
 
To be perfectly honest this show lacks substance of any kind. It's a very basic ecchi show about a couple of high school students who are 'married' and live under the same roof together and hang out with their friends. Scenarios ensue in which the girls are either forced to remove as much clothing as possible or they find themselves in a situation in which they're groped by our main protagonist. That's it! It feels like a heavily condensed To-Love Ru. The characters don't really go through any development arcs and the story remains incredibly linear and dull. None of the characters feel as if they've grown all too much throughout the series either and it remains a very forgettable throughout. 
 
""But LIQ, you cynical ass-hole, you hate everything anyway. Besides the seven minute length time doesn't allow for character development!!!1"" 
To that, I say you're half right (the ass-hole part anyway). However in regards to the second half, Space Patrol Luluco was also a seven minute anime but that show managed to do a whole of a lot more than this one while having fun and interesting characters with an actual over-arching story line so there is no excuse. This anime has no development of characters or narrative and is instead just a show in which borders on hentai without having any hentai at all. It's just an excuse to showcase a bunch of tits with nothing else and if that's the shows main purpose than I guess it achieved. The characters themselves could invoke a laugh or a smile out of me and I acknowledge that but you have to bust out the scale of justice to determine the shows worth and I can't help but rate this any higher since there are other shows of the same nature doing it much better. This show is vapid and has no substance nor did I have any fun while watching it. I found many of the characters to be either beyond annoying and every single one of these characters are the exact same in other shows done to a better effect. 
 
To be fair they do attempt some character growth and development but it's not really much and is not given nearly enough time to develop or to flesh out characters since the show seems to need to fill a quota of stuffing about three hundred shots of tits and asses in our faces in the span of seven minutes. 
 
The animation was pretty consistent and the character designs themselves were pretty good too so I can at least recommend this to people on a superficial level if they want to waste a little bit of time watching some guy grope some tits and the such but, to me, this always came across as a cock tease. If you really like ecchi shows then I'd say give it a shot but for everyone else I wouldn't waste your time on it. If you really want some tits go watch Kill la Kill or even better, a hentai!

       Helpful This is the BEST ecchi anime I have ever seen, and trust me I have seen many. Good opening, wide variety of characters and superb ecchi scenes make it a must watch. The main advantage of this anime is that each episode is only 8 minutes long.  
 
One of the rare anime which delivers what it promises. 
ALL types of girls including tsundere , deredere , loli etc are included! 
 
It also has a decent story and some scenes will make you unable to contain your laughter. 
 
The ending episode is extremely good and will leave a warm feeling in your heart. 
 
I recommend you to not think much and just ignore the rating and watch it, cause such anime are very hard to find!

4,27833,131,6.270086035,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Durarara!!x2 Ketsu,"As Mikado Ryuugamine continues to purge the Dollars from within in accordance with his warped sense of justice, Masaomi Kida hopes to bring his friend back to his senses by bringing the Yellow Scarves together once more. Little do they know that a far more dominant force is about to enter their struggle for power, one that their friend Anri Sonohara is all too familiar with. 
 
Meanwhile, the group that has gathered at Shinra Kishitani's apartment realizes that they are on the brink of something life-changing, an event that will throw Ikebukuro into a spiral of confusion. Their anxiety is realized when reports of Celty's head being found in public start to appear all over the news as Kasane Kujiragi begins to make her move. 
 
Gone are the brief periods of tranquility as the current turmoil sets the stage for one final performance in this thrilling conclusion to the story of Ikebukuro's finest. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","Mikado Ryūgamine, a young boy who longs for the exciting life of the big city, moves to Ikebukuro to attend Raira Academy with his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, whom he has not seen since he was young. After the two meet at the train station, they set out to explore the streets of Ikebukuro. Masaomi warns Mikado about people he does not want to cross in the city such as the violent and superhumanly strong man Shizuo Heiwajima, the information broker Izaya Orihara, and the mysterious gang known as ""The Dollars."" After running into some of the side characters, Mikado sees a local legend called the ""Black Rider"" who rides around Ikebukuro on a black motorcycle that occasionally neighs like a horse and who is rumored to have no head under her helmet. The ""Black Rider's"" real name is Celty Sturluson; she is an Irish dullahan who is in Ikebukuro looking for her stolen head while working as an underworld courier. The narrative follows all of the characters equally, showing how their lives intersect and create a greater plot line from each character's knowledge about a common incident.
The story is told from the perspective of approximately eleven of the main characters and changes every episode in the anime, sometimes even more often. One of the few constants given in every episode is that the narrator gives his own opinion on the current situation that he is in as well as what things that make him tick and keep him going in Ikebukuro: a city with a large underbelly that is the medium for the majority of both the plot's development and random violence throughout the series.
","Durarara is a unique anime that comes everyday and confusion in the city of Ikebukuro. In this city gangs fight each other. There are many characters and the story is dense in order to develop the cast. 
   
Regarding durarara direction is good, to focus on struggles and actions. However, a lot of patience is required. There are slow and no action episodes, but they serve to develop the character and make it reflect the circumstances of that time. If we make a comparison, durarara x 2 ketsu is faster than the ten durararax2 which found only average. The script can be simple or complicated depending on who is watching, because we see the daily life of many people in the city and are often complex. One action leads to another action which in the end will generate a consequence. 
 
The art I found more or less. The animation had some variations, but nothing that generates absurd. The movement of the characters were not so perfect to be in fights. Durarara (2010) had a better animation, but still possessed errors. Furthermore, the anime changed studio (Brain's Base for Shuka) and this influenced. 
 
The OST is very good. That brings jazz climate in an urban world. Not only that: both the opening as the ending were good. Some piano touches moments of drama were good. 
 
Durarara has many characters: Shizuo, Anri Sonohara, Celty, Mikado, Masaomi, Shinra and Izaya hated among many others. Mikado occasionally made me angry. He was very indecisive and cowardly and it influenced the slowness of the anime. In the end, I even found satisfactory, but not as good. Sonohara had a good development and in the end she knew live together well with saika. The Celty finally found her head and formed a romantic couple with Shinra. The problem is that it would be better to head to join her, because during all this time the anime focused on that. The Masaomi had a worthy final and was the character with stronger personality. The Izaya .... the hated Izaya deserved catch. Shizuo did well to discount the anger in Izaya. Izaya was the articulator of all the intrigues that happened in Ikebukuro. So overall despite criticism, durarara has great characters. 
 
As entertainment, Drrr is good. There are confusing parts, but the story is interesting and innovative as Baccano! I really would like a continuation, because clung to the characters (especially Celty and Shizuo)

       Helpful DRRR!! was such a journey and this review will take into consideration all the seasons since they are strongly connected. I started this anime with no expectations, I saw it had a pretty decent rating and I thought I should give it a go even though the genres didn't appeal to me so much. The first season was ok, I liked the first half, but the second one just seemed a bit boring since at that time I didn't really understand where they were trying to go with this. So after I finished the first season I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch the other ones, since I was afraid the story would continue to leave me bored and unsatisfied. However I still had this curiosity about how the story will conclude for some characters ( as in will Celty get her head back, what's gonna happen with Izaya and Shizuo, what will Mikado do with the Dollars). So yeah, with those questions in mind I started the second part of the story, again with not too many expectations. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised to see that this second arc really kept me hooked. I usually don't watch more than 3-4 episodes of the same anime per day since I get bored easily. However, I finished Ten in only one day and this doesn't happen too often when I watch anime. I started to empathise with the characters more and I found myself identifying a lot with Anri (she was so shy, insecure and didn't know what love is) and a little bit with Mikado. I started to like Shizuo more and more, at heart he was a good guy and I liked his relationship with Varona. I kind of wanted to see more of them, but in the last episodes we can pretty much tell that they really cared about each other. I really liked the new characters, I didn't actually think that it was possible to bring so many new faces and still keep the story interesting, but DRRR!! managed to do this wonderfully. My favourite new guys were definitely Rocchi and Akabayashi-san. 
 
After I watched the last episode I was overwhelmed with a feeling of satisfaction, but also a bit of sadness that it was over.I don't know how to put it into words, everything was just so wonderful and it's been such a long time an anime has made me feel like this. I really really appreciated this 2 weeks journey that I spent watching DRRR!!. 
 
Needless to say, the music was perfect. The only songs in my playlist these past few theys were all DRRR!! openings.

He enters ""The Alternative Trivia Research Club"" where the first of his many sexual encounters takes place. Despite that, he finds out that both of his foster sisters are in love with him, and he has to make a choice—who does he really love. Nikita Shindou loves the world of animation more than anything; he puts his life into it. He has never fallen for a real, living girl, until the day he meets Ren Aoi. 
We're introduced to young man Nikita Shindou as he's making his way through Akihabara, which is his main haunt and the place where he gets all his bishōjo games, which he plays in his room all alone in the dark. Keeping them a secret from his sister who just moved in a few months ago after their parents had died, Nikita loves playing up the characters having sex with each other and manipulating them as he can. To his surprise on his way home though, he comes across a park he hadn't remembered before and sees a beautiful woman there, one that reminds him strikingly of an older Sheeta from Laputa: Castle in the Sky! Even more amazing is that she comes into his room in some sort of dream sequence not too much later and keeps calling him Pazu and the two fool around quite a bit only for it to end up as a dream.
","This is nothing more than average hentai. The plot makes no sense, at least for what little plot there is. So it's really like watching random hentai clips, but with the same guy. That's fine, I guess, but that's why it's just average. 
 
The sex scenes are good, though all the girls have a similar look and body type (check out the cover photo to see examples), and their personalities seem nearly identical as well. They are all horny, not really shy, not really kinky, and right to the point. All of it is very tame, meaning no rape, no blood/virgins, not even any anal. Though there is incest with his sister, but the only thing different with her from the other characters is that she calls him brother. 
 
Mostly how it goes is that the guy basically comes in contact with different women, has a short conversation that attempts to give explanation about who the woman is and why she is there, and then the woman seems to realize she's horny and quickly seduces him in about 3 sentences. 
 
The way they try to loosely connect the characters (rather than letting it just be random, stand-alone strangers) makes it seem like you're missing something, like there's some back-story they forgot to let you in on. It's like I missed an episode, but I didn't. 
 
If you like the look of the girls, then you'll probably be satisfied with this as a mindless hentai, unless you were looking for some plot and personality to go with it.

          
 
       Helpful Seems I'm new to reviewing Hentai Titles, I'm just going to quickly tell you how I do things before I get started with the reviews. Now with me, hentai I find pointless trying to review each category of how the story was (if there is even one), then art and so on. Its pointless, hentai doesn't really go all into that, its about the experience as a whole so with Hentai reviews I'm just going to rate the overall Experience. Now onto the review: 
 
Akiba Girls could have been a quirky, tongue-in-cheek look at the hentai industry. After all, one female character leads into a sex scene with the actual premise that she needs practice for her next job as, yes, a hentai voice actress. If that isn't self-referential, I don't know what is. 
 
Sadly, apart from that particular set of lines, Akiba Girls is otherwise a dull, unoriginal show with mediocre sex scenes that often highlight just what I find to be wrong about hentai anime in general. 
 
For starters, most of the girls are saddled with breasts that do not match their body types. This is one of the things that annoys me the most in American pornography, and the transition to Japanese cartoons has not changed this for me. Maybe it's because I'm just a guy who really likes boobs. Either way, fake boobs irk me, and the boobs on the Akiba Girls are as fake as they get. 
 
The same could be said for the plot. We are expected to believe that Nikita (who's pretty good-looking for an utter geek) is supposed to go from unpopular to sex machine overnight. Uh huh, sure. It's pretty silly to begin with, but when his adopted sisters start professing their undying love lust for him, that's when things get utterly ridiculous. 
 
Since I already commented on the fake-looking breasts, I should be fair and criticize the rest of the animation, which is really rather lousy and doesn't work well with the standard hentai-game art style being used here. We also have another hentai cliche I really don't understand -- the fire-hose penis. Now, it is scientifically proven that the average ejaculation only measures about two or so tablespoons -- not much on the grand scheme of things, but certainly more than enough to do what is intended. In hentai anime, this figure magically rises to gallons, and Nikita apparently can get spray on a girl's face during an internal release. This guy is a one-man bukkake team, and it isn't arousing so much as headshakingly stupid. 
 
I never liked bukkake anyway, but that's another peeve for another time. 
 
Plus there's the whole ""adopted sister"" angle, which is just a goofy, poorly executed, and overdone ripoff of the whole Marmalade Boy idea. 
 
While the sex is consensual and there aren't any naughty tentacles or magic rope tricks, Akiba Girls is kinda like combining the tired cliches of mainstream Japanese porn with the fake boobs of mainstream American porn. 
 
I guess if you're desperate for animated sex and don't like the darker stuff, this might work for you, but there is a plethora of better titles out there. 
 
It's not quite the bottom of the barrel, but finding better hentai than this isn't hard.

          
 
       Helpful Akiba Girls 
 
Well it’s a story of a guy who joins a club composed of only girls, more like composed of only sluts. It’s ridiculous, he meets the girls and they instantly have sex with him, there is no development. 
About the guy, his parents died in a car crash when he was a kid. So he lives with his sister who has a crush on him. Not a crush, she’s in love with him, and not the brotherly sisterly kind of love, she wants him inside her. 
So this guy watches a lot of hentai and he falls in love with a hentai star, who appears to be in love with him too. So we have a love triangle. 
So after he has a lot of sex with the different girls, with his sister and with the hentai star, it’s time for the big reveal at the end. Now this ending is what killed it for me.  
The hentai star is his guardian angel who’s been looking over him ever since his parents died. And now that he has his sister to take care of him it’s time for her to leave. 
I hate the way this hentai just went off track at the end, kind of ridiculous.   
First of all the story is ridiculous, the women are ridiculous although I will admit they were hot especially the sister. 
 
Rate Mediocre 
Story sucks. 
Art is good. 
Characters: the women are way too easy. But I did like the sister. The angel made no sense.

","I'm going to start this off by saying this: I am not one to heavily criticize anime, in  fact, there have been very few that I would speak  only negatively about.  
HOWEVER, Loveless is one of those anime that is just a time waster, and does not have any benefits of actually watching the series. So I guess lets just get into this... *sigh* 
 
Story (1/10) 
I swear I wanted to give this a 0 so badly, but I assumed it to be unfair. The whole premise of the anime has no center story and repeats the same thing EVERY EPISODE. We get it, Ritsuka is traumatized by his past, but even so... it doesn't give you right to bring it up in every scene in every episode. There were even sometimes that they would insinuate his Mother was abusing him, but never go into detail about why or what exactly happened, because apparently the anime didn't need it? YES IT DID. By the end of the anime I was left sitting there empty wondering what I had spent countless hours leading up to. Absolutely nothing!! No backstory is explained, no explanations are given for anything in the anime and it leaves viewers quite empty and without context. So basically you're sitting there watching a 12 year old boy be pressured into love, yell constantly, and cry about his brother, all while trying to avoid being kidnapped (which was never attempted well at all). In general, if you're looking for a good storyline/plot DO NOT WATCH THIS. 
 
Art (4/10) 
 
Ok, given its time, the animation is not bad, in fact at some points I enjoyed it. I thought some characters were extremely aesthetically pleasing. Even still, the art was still mediocre at best and was not able to raise the score for this anime higher because of it. 
 
Sound (4/10) 
 
Honestly, I can't quite remember much of the sounds. All I really remember were some odd sounding background music that didn't fit the scenes at all. Still, I gave it a 2 because even though it didn't fit, its not like it was the worst music ever. It just wasn't memorable at all. The english dub is also done mediocre, some of the characters had voices that made me want to throw a chair at them (Yuiko). 
 
Character (1/10) 
 
Again, I wish I could give this a zero but that would be so cruel. The characters of this anime lack so much depth or any character trait that they didn't display within their first episode. Each one knows about two lines and says them often. and i mean OFTEN. At some point I was waiting for a groundbreaking change to happen in the MC, but alas, loveless has let me down yet again. Their inability to communicate well with each other is beyond hopeless as they never seem to learn from their lessons or pay attention to any consequences at all. At one point I literally shut my laptop in such rage of how annoying and downright idiots each of them were. aka, mute button was used alot. 
 
Enjoyment (0/10) 
 
nope, i refuse to give it any points for enjoyment and I do apologize friends. but this anime just really killed my vibe, honestly. Points in the series where I questioned the making of the manga itself and then its ability to carry into an anime? There was even a part where Ritsuka's THERAPIST started crushing on him and becoming jealous. At that moment, is when I truly realized that the cringeiness of the show just had me flabbergasted and scared to continue. Still, my otaku self was just waiting for something exciting to happen to the MC, the build up was so (not) promising, BUT I STILL BELIEVED. Though once I reached the end of episode 12, I was crying from the hours that I lost my sanity to. When i could have watched something with actual substance. My mistake. (don't make it yours). 
 
Overall (2/10) 
 
I gave Loveless a 2 because if anything, the art and sound did not have me losing massive amounts of brain cells like the characters and story did. Seriously, those who give loveless a 9 or anything remotely high, are lying to themselves and only enjoy the yaoi aspect. Save yourselves a couple hours and don't watch this anime. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING DONT WATCH THIS ANIME.

          
 
       Helpful I personally loved Loveless loved the story but there's a reason why I gave the story a 6... I was personally disappointed with the ending, and thought this anime could have used more episodes. The ending was not what I wanted, and I feel like they kinda rushed it. With this being said, the last episode is sort of a cliff hanger for me and left me with lots of questions as did Gravitation, and I HATE leaving an anime with many questions unanswered. To me, if I leave an anime with questions that doesn't make a good story. The story overall was really good,  I loved the action, but I can't give it a higher grade since the story in my opinion is not completed. I would go into details of what questions I have but that would be giving away spoilers! Haha! Overall though, I recommend this anime! Loved the artwork! Sound was good and I was always excited to come home and watch it!

          
 
       Helpful OK so here goes my first review, wish I could say I'm writing this cause I loved the anime so much, but I really can't. I actually wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. 
First off I have to give the story a 3 and here's why: 
When I rate a story I take into account the ending too, if your like me this read this. The ending isn't really one, to me it felt like a longer series that just got cut off. They don't explain the big secret mystery of the whole series, and the last episode actually left me with more questions than i had before, like they were trying to hook you for a season 2 that never came. I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules. 
Now Art, that i give a 7:  
Yeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people. 
6 for the sound: 
The sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either.  
Characters 4: 
Now this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd. 
Enjoyment 3:  
I say this because of the ending mostly. I mean the whole series they keep building you up with this whole mystery thing that keeps you watching, hoping for a reveal, only to go, WTH at the end. They explain nothing really and actually leave you with even more questions at the end, which I find Very Annoying! 
So Overall 4: 
Interesting at first, makes you want to know all the secrets, makes you want to understand the characters and see where they will end up. In the end leaves you wholly disappointed. Only thing I can say is it probably came from a manga and if so maybe that is better or if you know the manga you might get and like this. Otherwise, if your like me and just wanted to enjoy an interesting story and romance, DON'T BOTHER! 
 
P.S. sorry if this offends anyone who actually liked the show, but this irritated me so much I had to write this.

4,39569,134,6.22362414,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Sora no Aosa wo Shiru Hito yo,"Set in the same Chichibu city as  Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.  its story follows two Aioi sisters, Akane and Aoi, who have lived together since their parents' passing 13 years ago. One day, older sister Akane's ex-boyfriend Shinnosuke Kanemuro, who is 31 now, visits the city to perform at a festival. At the same time, 18-year-old Shinnosuke, called Shinno, also time-travels from 13 years ago. While Aoi starts falling love with the 18-year-old Shinno, Akane and the 31-year-old Shinnosuke finally reunite... 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)",['Drama'],"In Chichibu, third-year high school student Akane Aioi is dating Shinnosuke Kanamuro (nicknamed Shinno), an aspiring guitarist. Shinno is also friendly with Akane's preschooler sister Aoi, and in turn the sisters support Shinno's band. Akane and Shinno plan to move to Tokyo after graduation, where Shinno will pursue a career in music. However, the girls' parents are killed in a car accident and Akane changes her plans, choosing to stay in Chichibu to raise Aoi.
Thirteen years later, Aoi is an aspiring bassist who plans to move to Tokyo after high school, while Akane works for the city hall. Masamichi Nakamura (nicknamed Michinko), the drummer of Shinno's former band, also works for the city hall. Michinko is planning to hold a music festival to boost the city's tourism, and the main performer is the famous enka singer Dankichi Nitobe. 
One afternoon, while practicing bass alone in the hall, Aoi encounters Shinno from thirteen years ago. Frightened, she runs home to Akane and awkwardly asks her about Shinno. Akane admits that she hasn't heard from Shinno since he left, and is not even sure if he is still alive. This leads Aoi to believe she had seen Shinno's ghost. Later, the sisters reluctantly help Michinko in welcoming Dankichi Nitobe, and they are surprised to see a grown Shinnosuke as the guitarist of Nitobe's backup band. Aoi then returns to the hall with her friend Tsugu (Michinko's son), where they confirm that the young Shinno has a physical body but is unable to leave the hall. Tsugu hypothesizes that Shinno is an ikiryō (living ghost) born from Shinnosuke's strong unresolved feelings. Shinno then asks Aoi to help bring Akane and Shinnosuke together, believing that doing so will return him to Shinnosuke's body. However, this proves to be difficult as Shinnosuke is rude, arrogant, and does not get along with the Aioi sisters—a different person from the Shinno that they once knew.
","A tale of experiencing first love for the second time, and that of losing sight of what you once dreamt of. 
 
Firstly, the synopsis is not that accurate. This is not a story of time travel, nor did Aoi only start to fall in love upon meeting the Shinno from 13 years ago.  
 
The movie starts with Aoi plugging in her earphones to practice her bass, drowning out all sounds. I feel that that is a nice touch. We are then gradually introduced to the other characters and how Aoi feels about them. There was also a flashback of her past which explains why the two sisters are living together, when Shinno suddenly appears.  
 
Story: 10/10 
There were some twists that I've never expected. At first, I thought only Aoi could see Shinno, but it turned out that everyone could see him too. They called him an Ikiryou (a spirit that is left behind when the living passes on) at the start, and I thought that that was the case too, when Aoi ran home to Akane and asked her for more details about Shinno - to which her reply was ""I don't know whether he is even living or dead"", which cemented my belief until minutes later when Shinnosuke appeared on the Enka stage as a guitarist.  
 
What happens when you meet face-to-face with your past self? That was the other big twist that I did not expect. Watch it to find out!  
 
The story built up emotions leading to that scene from the ominous cave to the landslide to the sealed guitar and to the meeting, and the tension - emotions at an all-time high was kept at that plateau for the rest of the movie. It was truly a work of art. 
 
Art: 9/10 
My first thought was that the older Nakamura looked like Poppo from AnoHana, but it turned out that they were different persons. Each scene, though ordinary somehow managed to look special while being not overtly imposing. I liked how the director transitioned from showing a dull welcoming scene to the appearance of a very flashy Nitobe, and how the camera slowly pans to the right to reveal the older Shinnosuke. That said though, while the art was great, it was not particularly outstanding hence the score. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
As I have mentioned in the introduction, the touch when earphones are plugged in and when Aoi tries to convey her feelings for the older Shinnosuke was absolutely stunning. Aoi fondly reminds me of K-On! when she plays the bass. I feel that her VA has done a good job in conveying her feelings for Shinno, like how her voice trembled when she spoke to him or that outburst when she found out what Chika has done. 
 
Character: 8/10 
Given the number of characters, it can't be helped. Although every character has some development, I feel that they could have given more depth to each of them, particularly the older Shinnosuke and exactly how did he come around. Also, the boy-crazy Chika could have been given more exposition - we never knew if she was telling the truth or not when she claimed that 'nothing happened', because we only have an idea of what's her personality like.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Overall, I enjoyed the movie enough to write such a long review about it. Even after watching the epilogue however, I am left with more questions that I had at the start and I think that this movie would have a better reception had it launched as an anime series instead.  
 
Overall verdict: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful although this anime seems like the full plot is about time travelling, honestly the time travelling part barely felt relevant until the end of the series  
 
Story: 7/10 
the plot was just,,, well blend. the story was almost boring, and it felt like the plot could have included more, and the story had so much room for improvement, and the characters could have been better developed, but sadly this was not achieved. however, credit has to be due to the way the romance aspect of the show was handled during this series, giving you a smile on your face towards the end of the movie, 
 
character 8/10 
the characters were all interesting, but was not allowed to be developed in this film. the characters all had their flaws presented in the early stage of the film, but some were never fully addressed 
 
overall, i would not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a romantic musical anime, but if you are just looking to spend some time with your significant other or just chill in your room and kill some time, by all means go ahead

          
 
       Helpful Sora no Aosa wo Shiru Hito yo 
 
I was lucky enough to catch the movie in theatres as soon as it was released, I can safely say I enjoyed the movie but it’s definitely not rewatch worthy. Certainly not as good as the other movies released this year like Tenki no Ko or Fate/Stay Night Heaven’s Feel. 
 
There wasn’t anything particularly notable during the movie apart from the unusual setting and considerably weird plot... That... and my friend sleeping in the cinema. 
 
Well, that statement stands for itself. The movie’s concept is unique. It’s unusual setting which involves a form of time travel with an added twist. And a weirdly cliched plot with weird relationships. 
 
-SPOILER- 
 
Second-year high school student Aoi Aioi is an aspiring musician Aoi Aioi. Her older sister Akane's ex-boyfriend Shinnosuke Kanomura is a struggling guitarist. Aoi and Akane's parents passed away in an accident 13 years ago, and Akane gave up her ambition of going to Tokyo with Shinnosuke to take care of Aoi. Since then, Aoi has felt indebted to her older sister.  
 
Years later, Akane's ex-boyfriend, Shinnosuke, returns to town to perform at a music festival. At the same time as the re-encounter between the two former lovers, Aoi meets Shinnosuke's teenage self, who has traveled from the past to the present-and Aoi falls in love for the first time. 
 
-SPOILER END- 
 
There were... I must say, countless flaws in the anime. 
Firstly, was the fact that this anime barely had any originality in the entire setting of it. It was quite boring but I thoroughly enjoyed the concept and art which was mainly what kept me watching. That and the voice actors did a good job. 
Next, Aoi. The ending was what kept me thinking. The anime ended with the characters agreeing that Aoi is young and dumb but the thing about her is that she’s straightforward. My foot... Aoi has been a selfish kid throughout the entire anime. From a little girl to a teenager, she’s been selfish to a fault. She felt guilty because of that, of course she would... She doesn’t mean it. But instead of being straightforward and apologising or expressing her guilt by telling Akane she feels guilty for her selfishness and wishes to redeem herself. Aoi literally expressed her guilt with rebellion and resentment... Excuse me? 
 
In what world is that straightforward. 
 
Last but not least, why the hell was Young Shinno bounded in the room? That made absolutely zero sense! The worst part was that he was bounded by a freaking guitar. When the guitar broke, he was free. But the guitar was barely featured and the aspect of significance wasn’t given. Why was the guitar the catalyst? All that was said was the guitar was a gift of sorts from Akane. That made absolutely zero correlation to why it was the catalyst for his confinement. 
 
That’s not the end of it, there’s more. 
 
So why is it that I’m still giving the anime a 6/10? Because in its own right, the anime was okay. I could understand where all the characters were coming from, how they felt and how I can relate to them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the OST and the interesting correspondence between Aoi and Akane. 
 
-Spoiler- 
 
If you look at it closely, Akane’s boyfriend is Shinnosuke. She likes Shinnosuke and Michinko likes Akane! 
On the other hand, Aoi likes Young Shinno while Tsugu (Michinko’s son) likes Aoi! 
 
-Spoiler End- 
 
I loved all the characters and the musical cohesion that was supposed to be the main attraction. So it was pretty disappointing compared to anime like Your Lie in April where the musical romance was ways stronger.  
 
After thinking about it, Aoi was actually pretty useless. The anime made it seem like she was the only one that could change what’s about to happen but she didn’t do shit... She couldn’t decide between her sister and her sister’s boyfriend from the past. She didn’t help with getting Shinnosuke and her sister together. She didn’t do anything.  
 
Everything just sort of fell in place for her. From Michinko gradually accepting rejection and stopped wooing Akane... To the lack of crew members that led to Aoi joining Shinnosuke’s band... Even when Akane was in trouble and Aoi ran to Young Shinno for help only to find out that Young Shinno had met the current Shinno and afterwards talked the current Shinno into changing to a better person... Come on, that was your job Aoi... You’re supposed to be the Main Character not Young Shinno... 
 
What a mess really... 
 
Aoi was actually just the narrator. And a catalyst for fan hatred. 
 
Well... at least we can end off and call this an experiment for a newer approach similar to Anohana. 
 
This was an anime worth watching if you have nothing better to do. I rest my case.

Specialising in fashion design, Mikako dreams of becoming a fashion designer with her own brand. Living next to her is her childhood friend, Yamaguchi Tsutomu. Even though they have been close since they were young, they share a platonic friendship. However, Tsutomu has been gaining popularity, especially with the girls, because he seems to resemble a popular vocalist from a band and somehow, Mikako begins to see him in a different light. This is a story about how youths cope with dreams, love and friendship.  
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Mikako Kōda and Tsutomu Yamaguchi are students who attend Yazawa Art Academy, a special high school for the arts in Tokyo (named after the author, who makes a cameo appearance as the school's principal). They reside in the same apartment building where they have built a long-standing friendship since infancy. However, as has been humorously pointed out by their apartment manager, Mikako and Tsutomu's feelings have undergone an unmistakable metamorphosis.
Mikako and Tsutomu's friends inside and outside of the Akindo club also detect this change and wonder one thing: Will Mikako and Tsutomu embrace what is already community discourse or will they deteriorate into leading very bitter adult lives of not-at-all-significant brevity and dysphoria?
","PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN WHEN I WAS IN A RANT MOOD SO IT CAN BE PRETTY HARSH AS I HAVEN'T YET PUT ALL THE GOOD THING THE SHOW HAS YET NOR HAVE I WATCHED THAT MANY EPISODES. I will edit it eventuality when start watching it again. And to be honest despite how much the characters may annoy me the show itself is actually pretty good. I suggest giving it a go 
 
 
Story 
  
Mikako has a crush on her childhood friend Yamaguchi Tsutom. She ends up heartbroken because her love ended when it just started. She found out he got a girlfriend. Trying to forget about all of this she decided to from a circle who participates in flea markets.   
 
First episode is boring but this anime is actually slowly growing on me. I did like it a bit until the characters started to annoy me which I will explain later.  
 
Art  
 
That art is kind of weird at the start but you will just get use to it. It not so bad that it takes away from the experience. I had no problems at all wth the art.  
 
Sound 
 
Like everyone says this is a great aspect of this show. They chose the prefect songs to play at the perfect times. No of the songs feel out of place and it just brings you into the moment also ageing sure to have variety. (some would argue they use it quite a bit though)  
 
Character  
 
I really hate Mikako. Her jealously is ridiculous. oh no somebody is dating the one I like so of course she's a bitch. when in actuality she is a pretty nice girl. So many times she has said nasty things about her. She even throws a slap at the boy because she saw them kissing. She doesn't even have a right to slap him like that since she isn't his girlfriend. I admit she does try her best to get over him and get rid of all this jealously but it doesn't really work.  
 
Although I do love her red hair friend and thank her for being the voice of reason. I can't stand it when occasionally she acts like the two are going to get together like it's already guarnteered.  
 
In fact I don't know whats the point in even making the boy look like a celebrity. It's not like he enters show business or anything. They could have just added good looks and be done with it if they wanted a reason why girls would like him so much.  
 
Good things about the character is that they all have their own dreams and ambitions in life.  
 
Enjoyment  
 
if it wasn't for the characters and things I mentioned up above I would have actually enjoyed it way more  
 
I do not hate this show but there were just some things that were to hard to ignore  
 
Girlfriend does have a personality but ever since she started dating it's just ''hey let's hang out and shop'' they don't even brother letting her say anything else when she had the potential to be interesting 

          
 
       Helpful I might as well write a review of this anime since I was the one who provided (most of) the raws, translated it and reviewed each episode at least three times before it was released, which in my opinion counts for at least something.   
 
Well, as much as I am loathed to put labels on what are clearly three-dimensional characters, here we have a show where Ai Yazawa pretty much presented us with what could be a psychological profile of a tsundere before such a term even came to existence. She's brassy, full of herself and can sometimes be unfairly cruel, but that is just a front she she feels she has to put up in order to shield her vulnerable side. 
 
Yes, it would be convenient to say Mikako is the way she is because of the childhood trauma of a divorce (and what her Mom did afterwards). But alas, the reason behind her disagreeable personality is artistically anticlimatic.  That is simply the way she is, as is evident from the flashbacks from her childhood and later when she becomes ""honest with herself."" This is the place where I feel the anime succeeds because we  become too used to seeing the lead female character who is cutesy, klutsy, timid, moe or whatever stereotype that is supposed to appeal to the regular anime audience. She is truly one of the more variated full-rounded characters you'd find in any narrative. 
 
The main drawback from this show, like a lot of the shoujo anime that aired around that time (Marmalade Boy, Kodocha) is the number of episodes.  I really believe they could have more effectively told the story that they presented if they instead aired around half the episodes.  Of course I am talking about filler episodes that sometimes introduced inconsistencies (***spoiler****e.g. why would Mikako be unable to sell her wrong-sized clothes at the second flea market if she was able to sell out all those exact same clothes at the first flea market?***spoiler***), but that is a minor quibble compared to the parade of episodes that occupied the middle featuring a love triangle between three supporting characters. They could have easily settled that matter in a handful of episodes, but they stretched it out over at least ten episodes, padding those with situations based on uselessly masochistic self-abnegations so contrived that my suspension of disbelief almost never recovered. 
 
But thankfully, it didn't overtake the main story of the show, which was the real draw in the first place.  It's clear the creator had a lot of fun with her inaugural anime adaptation and it shows through her somewhat unconventional artwork and character designs. The whole thing sort of reminds me of ""Doug"". The animation certainly shows its age, although it's pretty solid for what was shown at the time.  For those who are expecting the quality put into Yazawa's other two animes by Madhouse Studio, be warned that you've been spoiled. 
 
The music, mostly provided by Mikako's seiyuu Rumi Shishido might be an acquired taste for some (for those who don't like unsteady singing voices),  but it grows on you, at least it did for me. The story, as long as it focuses on the two main characters, is pretty solid-grade work as it navigates you through the ups and downs of a teenage girl trying to cope with her contrary personality.  As for enjoyment - well I wouldn't have spent at least 62 total hours going over the series if I didn't enjoy it. So in the end it would have received a higher grade for the story and characterization if it weren't for the mostly repetitive fillers.

          
 
       Helpful I started watching this because I am a fan of Yazawa Ai. I was so happy to know that she has done a number of manga's and anime's other than NANA or Paradise Kiss. I loved Paradise Kiss so much but did not know that it is a sequel of Neighborhood Story or Gokinjo Monogatari. I had to rewatch it because Mikako, Tsutomu, Rika and Norijii were all in Paradise Kiss. I love how the character's Yazawa creates are all in the same dimension because you really feel like your favorite characters are getting older but still living their lives as if they are real people. Such uniqueness from Yazawa.  
 
Now I wasn't too thrilled with seeing the opening of this anime because it looks so old, the characters are drawn in a funny way, none of the female characters have boobs and the music was kind of blah. But, somehow, you get hooked on the show and start to enjoy it without realizing. 
 
Story (9) 
Story is great. I love that everyone is in a Art school. Each character has goals and aspirations that are different from typical anime out here so I enjoyed that. Also because I can relate to most of the characters as well. Mikako wants to have her own brand and sell her handmade clothes. Her friends study, work hard and make everything that they by hand to sell at the flee market. It just goes to show that hard work really pays off! There's a lot of love triangles that takes place in this anime. It might become too much at times but just follow along. Great story. You see the characters unfold when the time is right and you get to learn a lot from this anime too. 
 
Art (7) 
Of course the art isn't all that great but it doesn't matter because the story and plot is what keeps you watching. Also, I realized that even though the females are drawn a certain way and don't seem to have womanly features such as breasts, hips and thighs, they are still beautiful in their own way. Especially with the several fashion ideas and clothes they wear. I kind of liked that because you don't have to draw a busty woman just to make her look sexy. It's all about the personality of the person, or in this case, the characters.  
 
Sound (7) 
Many of you aren't going to like the music. it took me awhile to get used to it but I grew to like it. 
 
Character (9) 
I love the characters mainly because it's a creation of Yazawa Ai. But also since I am a big NANA lover, i like to think that Mikako is Hachi and Risa is Nana, Risa's boyfriend is Ren and Yuusuke is Takumi.. But that's just me and my fantasies lol I grew to love all the characters even though some of them annoyed me. Mikako annoyed me through half of the show because she is actually a tsundere character to the fullest. But I learned to appreciate and love her and her personality because most girls go through the same feelings and thoughts. Everyone has thought of something that isn't true or loved a person so much but couldn't tell him so you be mean to them for no reason. Or when you see your lover talking to someone else you get jealous. Mikako goes through so many emotions that you learn to love because she is like most people, even yourself. There's a lot of ups and downs in this anime and in the end, it will be all worth it. 
 
Enjoyment (9) 
I enjoyed this very much. I liked the story, I liked the characters, I like how creative everything is and the journey of a young girl trying to sell her fashion brand clothes, with the conflicts of relationships and family. Yet she still tries her best to become successful. Her and everyone else in her group. It's a bitter sweet kind of anime. The one thing I hate about this anime is the filler episodes and the constant flashbacks. Sometimes it would be so long and so repetitive that it can take up half of an episode! So, its ok when you know when to skip a few minutes but all in all its a pretty good watch. 
 
Overall (9) 
I was going to rate it a 7 at first but after finishing the show and looking back on it, the story was really great. Especially for an anime back in the 90s with a story like this. I really enjoyed it and to everyone that has seen Paradise Kiss, please watch this anime and watch Paradise Kiss again. You will enjoy it 10xs more because now you fully understand each character and the message being sent about women, aspirations and goals, and conflict with love and family. Thank You.

In their department are people who share the same passion for games. There is Yun Iijima, whose specialty is designing monsters; the shy Hifumi Takimoto, who prefers to communicate through instant messaging; Hajime Shinoda, an animation team member with an impressive figurine collection; Rin Tooyama, the orderly art director; Shizuku Hazuki, the game director who brings her cat to work; and Umiko Ahagon, the short-tempered head programmer. 
 
 New Game!  follows Aoba and the others on their adventure through the ups and downs of game making, from making the perfect character design to fixing all the errors that will inevitably accumulate in the process. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Having been inspired by the character designs of a particular video game when she was younger, Aoba Suzukaze, a high school graduate, begins working as a character designer for the video game's developer, Eagle Jump. As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere. 
 
The rest isn´t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don´t want to concentrate or if you´re a Moe fan anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

4,14349,137,6.181243665,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Little Witch Academia,"For young witches everywhere, the world-renowned witch Shiny Chariot reigns as the most revered and celebrated role model. But as the girls age, so do their opinions of her—now just the mention of Chariot would get a witch labeled a child. However, undeterred in her blind admiration for Chariot, ordinary girl Atsuko Kagari enrolls into Luna Nova Magical Academy, hoping to someday become just as mesmerizing as her idol. 
 
However, the witch academy isn't all the fun and games Atsuko thought it would be: boring lectures, strict teachers, and students who mock Chariot plague the campus. Coupled with her own ineptness in magic, she's seen as little more than a rebel student. But when a chance finally presents itself to prove herself to her peers and teachers, she takes it, and now it's up to her to stop a rampaging dragon before it flattens the entire academy.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'School']","Little Witch Academia takes place at Luna Nova Magical Academy (ルーナノヴァ魔法学校, Rūna Nova Mahō Gakkō), a prestigious school for young girls training to become witches. Having been inspired by a witch named Shiny Chariot, a girl named Atsuko ""Akko"" Kagari enrolls at Luna Nova Magical Academy to become a witch, but struggles due to her non-magical background. This all changes when she discovers the Shiny Rod, a powerful magic relic left behind by Chariot.
One of the main themes in the franchise is Akko trying to live up to Shiny Chariot's ideals by showing the world that magic is still a wonderful thing, while Luna Nova struggles for its continual existence because the general public regards wizardry as outdated. In the TV series, this background element is expanded into a plotline in which magic is waning across the world. The secret to restoring the flow of magic lies within the forbidden Arcturus Forest, sealed inside a magical locale named the Grand Triskellion erected by the Nine Olde Witches, the legendary founders of the academy.
The key to undoing the seal lies in a sequence of seven magical words and the Shiny Rod, an artifact which reacts only to the wielder's genuine desire to spread joy and happiness. When Akko gains possession of the Rod, Chariot (secretly one of her Luna Nova teachers and the Rod's previous wielder) tries to guide her on the path to restoring the power of magic to the world. However, Croix, Chariot's former best friend, had also coveted – and was denied – the power sealed within the Grand Triskellion due to her selfish ambitions. As a result, she schemes to unlock the Grand Triskellion by force with use of artifacts powered by negative emotions she developed with her technomagical abilities and try to deter both Akko and her rival along the way.
","Warning possible Spoilers  
 
For something that was only 26 minutes long I was actually pretty impressed with Trigger and considering I'm a Harry Potter this felt like a very nice parody of it. 
 
The story is about 3 witches called Akko, Sucy and Lotte who always end up in trouble with the magic they cause at Luna Nova Magical Academy and this time is no exception. 
Now for 26 minutes this one episode was able to show me that you can make a Magical School that isn't Hogwarts and make it fun, the characters despite how dysfunctional they are were really funny and pretty much has a message that with teamwork and determination you can conquer any problems like what happened here where a giant monster was unleashed and it took the 3 Witches brains and teamwork to beat it. 
 
The characters were actually very likeable and funny plus with the antics that Akko, Sucy and Lotte cause it can make any day with them feel like an adventure. 
Akko the Main girl doesn't do very well at magic and whenever she does cast a spell it usually causes more harm than good, but her determination always brings her on top in the end because of her sheer devotion to finding a solution to a problem. 
Sucy is the more cynical witch who loves to brew potions with weird and dangerous ingredients and uses Akko as a test subject for these potions, despite being very gloomy she is actually funny and will sometimes make an evil smerk when she can do something mischievous. 
Lotte is calmer and is usually very worried about Akko's well being because of her incidents, she likes magic that can communicate and summon spirits or fairies. 
 
The artstyle was done really well and I liked the look of the characters and the Academy looked really cool too like a parody version of Hogwarts with it's Georgian type architecture, the uniforms looked very cool too very befitting of the term witch, the monsters and spells looked very elaborate too. 
 
I enjoyed what the episode gave in terms of comedy and adventure like when Akko and the others went into a dungeon to find treasure which brought about a dragon to terrorise the Academy, also the conversations between the 3 girls was really funny as Akko loved to point out how everything goes bad for her while the others correct her or point out something that causes them even more trouble was really entertaining. 
 
Overall this was a nice 1 episode type show and and hopefully since a series has been made from it that will be as good if not better than this.

          
 
       Helpful This is an underappreciated masterpiece that not many talk about. Yoshinari You is a genius and is one of the people actively saving the anime industry. Believe me when I say this, this anime ACTUALLY ENTERTAINS YOU, A LOT. There so much anime out there which are just so bland and boring to sit through, every second of this anime, brings joy. 
 
Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if an anime is worth watching you usually don't want to read all that much. 
 
Positives 
 
- A short story which leaves room for expansion yet ties up the major loose ends and sticks to a three act structure incredibly well. 
- The characters are all very different from each other, none are stereotypical archetypes and each are likeable in their own way. 
- The soundtrack is not something I noticed too much, but it was enough to create the correct atmosphere for the scenario's. 
- The animation, I feel like this really needs to be stressed, by god the animation is amazing, everything is so smooth I think this might be the smoothest and most consistent animation i've ever seen. 
 
Negatives 
- Hard to think of many. 
-People don't appreciate as much?? 
 
 
Like I said, it's very difficult for me personally to find faults in Little Witch Academia, I would recommend this to almost anyone and am certainly looking forward to the future of this project. 

          
 
       Helpful Really, what's not to love in this one episode ? 
 
Trigger, the masterminds behind Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, are at it again and they didn't disappoint.  And as my rating shows, this show has no weakness.  
 
-Unique chara-design that is also adorable and engaging. Pixar-level stuff, dare I say.  
 
-Character developpment for everybody  
 
-Epic fight scenes with speed, showmanship and suspense 
 
-Fun all around. I'm not a fan of shojô, harem or college-girls anime but what can I say ? It gets the job done. I had fun and I want more.

4,5941,138,6.170244131,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Cross Game,"Kou Kitamura and Aoba Tsukishima are often at odds—even though their families happen to be close friends and business partners. Although the only child of a sports shop owner, Kou has never been interested in playing baseball. Despite this, he possesses an impressive batting ability honed by frequent visits to the local baseball batting center run by the Tsukushima family. On the other hand, Aoba loves to play baseball and is a star player with exceptional pitching form. 
 
However, these two seemingly complete opposites share something very important to them—Wakaba Tsukishima, Aoba's older sister and Kou's destined sweetheart. Admired by the quarrelsome duo, Wakaba often finds herself the catalyst to their never-ending rivalry. But whether or not they realize that they have more in common than either would care to admit, only time will tell. The game of baseball may just be what the pair needs to ultimately overcome their own personal struggles. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Sports']","At the start of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the same neighborhood as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their children go back and forth between the two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.
Part Two starts with Ko in his third year of junior high, as he continues training in secret. When he enters Seishu High School, he joins the baseball club along with his childhood friends, Akaishi and Nakanishi. However, the interim principal (the regular principal is on medical leave) has brought in a new head coach, and he in turn brings in transfer students from other schools as ringers just to play baseball. This team, led by their star, Yūhei Azuma, is the clear favorite of the school. Because the three friends refuse to take evaluation tests to join the first-string team, they are placed on the second-string ""portable"" team under the former head coach, Maeno, who has to use the Seishu Junior High School field for practice. This causes a rivalry between the two parts of the team. In the first summer practice scrimmage between them, the portable team loses by only a narrow margin.
During the summer vacation, while the first-string team plays in the prefectural qualifying tournament for Koshien, Maeno has the portable team practice at a recently closed elementary school with the support from a mysterious old man. The portable team also has six practice matches with other local high schools, all of which reached semifinals or higher in the regional preliminaries. Near the end of summer vacation, the interim principal decides to dissolve the portable team. However, Coach Maeno asks for a rematch scrimmage with the first-string team, after which the losing team would be dissolved and that coach would leave. The portable team, playing with Aoba, wins a narrow victory. The first-string team is dissolved, and the head coach and the interim principal leave to work at other schools.
In the spring, Ko becomes a second-year student and Aoba enters Seishu High School. Yūhei, who stays at Seishu despite having been on the former first-string team, moves in with Ko's family after the first-stringers' dormitory is closed. The reformed Seishu team goes on to prove themselves by defeating Sannō High School in the first round of the summer prefectural qualifying tournament. However, they lose to their second-round opponents, Ryuō, in overtime, ending Seishu's hopes of Koshien for the year. Ryuō subsequently reaches Koshien, advances up to the semifinals where they are narrowly beaten. However, Ryuō then goes on to win the spring invitational Koshien tournament later that same year.
As Ko and Aoba enter their summer break, a girl named Akane Takigawa with a striking resemblance to Wakaba moves in next door to Ko. This causes mixed feelings among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had also liked Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach in the form of Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.
When the prefectural summer baseball tournament starts, Seishu starts with a dominating shutout against its first-round opponent, Matsunami Municipal High School. In the second round, they face Sena Municipal High School led by Tatsumasa Miki, a former Seishu first-string player, which in the first round defeated the team headed by Seishu's former head coach. Seishu wins with a nearly perfect game, ending Part Two of the story.
Part Three starts with the prefectural tournament still in progress. After another win by Seishu, Akane is hospitalized due to an unspecified illness. Initially, Akaishi's play is affected by worrying about Akane's condition. Ko continues to perform well and promises Akane to go on a date with her if Seishu reaches Koshien. However, Akane's illness is more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery on the morning of the prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her more than anyone, but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth. In the final chapter, the morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane recovering in the hospital and Ko and Aoba head for the train station holding hands.
","I have to say, the art and sound is fairly good in the show.  It brings out a natural and lively yet peaceful environment in the anime.  However, I have to say the enjoyment was a total failure for me.  I fell asleep on nearly watching all the episodes and realized that even if I watched 1000 episodes, this story would never reach or even hint on the climax.  The characters are alright, but they are boring in their own way.  The female protagonist is your normal average good looking tomboy girl, and the male protagonist is a little strange by being clueless but being reliable at times, however its not so extreme as to be ""interesting"".  Both are fairly normal characters.  The story was pretty average too.  There is no thrill, but only a boring attitude that stays much too calm in the entirety of the show.

       Helpful TL:DR review:  
For all intents and purposes, Cross game can be seen as an alternate world retelling of Anohana. In this world, instead of slice-of-life we have baseball as the focus of the show and instead of angst ridden characters of Anohana you have more grounded, well rounded characters deal with the same themes of loss, lonliness and identifying one'e self worth. Watch if you like slice of life. As a sports anime it works, but its mostly about the characters and less about the sport itself.  
 
Full review: 
I liked Anohana for what it was, a story of loss and coming to terms with missing your first love. However I was almost turned off by the ludicrous characters on display. Cross Game does it miles better as its characters arent prone to self-pity nor do they burden themselves with needless regret just to add drama. The characters for the most part simply move on as most people would do in such ciscumstances.  
 
The plot of Cross Game in 5 mins is essentially lead character Ko and neighbor Wakaba both of whom were born on the same day like each other a lot. This causes a lot of anger on the part of Wakaba's younger sister Aoba. A tragic accident causes the death of Wakaba and the anime deals with how Kou moves on with his life while still interacting with the rest of Wakaba's family namely her 3 sisters, Aoba, Momiji and Ichiyo. The characters all are fairly realistic in that they still miss Wakaba but dont wallow in self-pity but rather choose to look towards the future. Along the side there is baseball which is a big passion in Aoba's life. Why Ko decides to take up baseball as a sport and how his relationship with Aoba progresses forms the crux of the story. Make no mistake about it, Cross Game has elements of baseball in it and it has tropes used in other similar sports anime, however the focus here is on the relationship between Ko and Aoba and the other characters from the baseball team. The baseball story is more of a side arc rather than the major focus.  
 
 
I love the characters of Cross Game for the most part. The one character I didnt like was Wakaba. She is potrayed as this perfect girl who is loved by all the boys and idolized by everyone. Noone had beef with her, she was universally loved... essentially the same garbage we were fed about Menma in Anohana. The difference is that in Anohana, Menma returned as a retarded ghost whereas here Wakaba stays thankfully dead for most part of the anime. I say most part because Wakana returns towards the later part of the series as clone-trooper 6191 AKA Akane. Apparently another girl who just happens to look exactly like Wakaba with the exact same character traits like Wakaba just happens to move next door to Ko and Aoba. I will let the mathematicians in the house calculate the odds of that happening. This clone-trooper also gets her own ""Your lie in April"" arc at the very end to add some needless drama. Wew lads.  
 
Thankfully the rest of the cast for the most part are fun. Ko is very grounded for a sport anime protagonist. He isnt a whiny, loud-mouthed, never give up, thug-life guy with massive hidden potential (looking at you Shoyo Hina-fart!!) He didnt start playing baseball to become the best in the world but rather for reasons much closer to home. He plays baseball simply to fulfill a dream Wakaba had. Even towards the end, he wants to be the best pitcher in the world not because he wants to be the best but its the only way he knows to get closer to Aoba. Aoba is another star in the show. Classic tsundere type, fighitng desparately to be part of the dream Wakaba had all the while hurting inside coz she knows she would never be part of a boys baseball team. She loves baseball but she wants so badly to part of the Wakaba's dream that she puts her baseball dreams on hold so she could atleast cheer on Ko from the sidelines. Great character growth throught and the banter between Ko and Aoba is generally of a very good quality. Some of the side characters themselves are very well rounded with a good example being Akaishi. Another guy who had a silent crush on Wakaba, reforms himself from being a bully to become a catcher so he can help make Wakaba's dream a reality.  
 
 
The visuals are good. The character desings are a bit umm.. You take Ko, Aoba and Wakaba/Akane and shave them all bald, they all have the same face. The backgrounds are serviceable. The animation however is very good. The music is entirely forgettable. It does its job of staying in the background. Not a single track was actually memorable.  
 
 
Conclution:  
Cross game is easy waching. Its not a bad thing. There are no complex multi layered characters. The biggest takeaway is the undeniable feelings of positivty one gets from watching this. Anohana was mostly negative with a positive ending. Here the tone of the anime is by and large positive and the life potrayed here is charming and brimming with childlike innocence. The message is of hope, to cherish the memories of those you lost but to move on and not be held back by your loss. Lovely anime, not the most original story and some characters and the drama they bring (aka Akane) was uneeded but overall great.

Two years later, G&G Entertainment released a 35-minute animated version of the drama, Between of One Year, consisting of highlights from the drama and new scenes dealing with the final moments of Eun Chae and Mu Hyeok's relationship. The script was supervised by the writer of the original live-action drama, Lee Kyung Hee.",['Drama'],"Cha Moo-hyuk is a part-time scam artist working the streets of Australia. He was abandoned by his parents as a child and adopted by a couple in Australia. However, he was mistreated by his foster parents and thus roams the streets, cheating tourists out of their money. It is through one of these scams that he bumps into Song Eun-chae.
Eun-chae is the fashion coordinator and childhood friend of famous Korean singer, Choi Yoon. She sees Yoon as her life's focal point and does everything she can to please him. Yoon visits Melbourne, Australia to do a photoshoot with another famous Korean actress, Kang Min-joo. Yoon asks Eun-chae to get him close to Min-joo. It breaks Eun-chae's heart but she does so. One day, Eun-chae's luggage and money are stolen by the same band of criminals as Moo-hyuk.
Tired, hungry and helpless, she wanders the streets until she bumps into Moo-hyuk who, moved by her plight, manages to find the stuff stolen by his gang and return it to her. She returns to Korea and bumps into Min-joo and Yoon, who are now a couple.
Several weeks later, Moo-hyuk receives an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. At the wedding, he is accidentally shot twice in the head when someone attempts an assassination on his ex-girlfriend's husband. The doctor saves him but can only remove one bullet. The remaining bullet is lodged too deeply and cannot be surgically removed. It's killing him, and he has no longer than a year to live. Guilt-stricken, his ex-girlfriend gives him a stash of cash and tells him to go back to his native Korea to find his birth parents. He does so, and finds out that his mother is famous Korean actress, Audrey. Her son is Choi Yoon and both mother and son are adored by the public.
Moo-hyuk can't help but feel betrayed because his mother is doing so well in life, whilst he was suffering and has little time left. He vows revenge and starts by getting close to Yoon, becoming his road manager. He plots to bring Yoon and his mother down, but also falls in love with Eun-chae. Yoon becomes injured in a car accident; he will die without a heart transplant. Moo-hyuk is suddenly faced with the decision of saving his brother or letting him die as revenge.
Moo-hyuk finds out that his mother did not abandon him. His mother had an affair with a married man, and Audrey's parents instructed Eun-chae's father (then Audrey's chauffeur) to give away Moo-hyuk and his twin sister as soon as they were born. Audrey was not cognizant of the fact that she had given birth to twins, and was simply told that her child had died. Eun-chae's father thought he was ""saving"" Audrey's reputation. Audrey had adopted Yoon in memory of her son.
Eun-chae's father admits to the truth and tells him he is willing to accept any punishment. Moo-hyuk tells Eun-chae's father that one day he will receive a punishment.
Moo-hyuk kills himself in a motorcycle accident so that his heart can be transplanted into Yoon. Before his death, he calls Eun-chae and tells her, ""I'm sorry. I love you."" His heart is given to Yoon, who makes a full recovery. One year later, a heartbroken Eun-chae goes to Melbourne and to his grave, and dies next to it with a small red bottle, leading the viewer to believe she committed suicide by drinking poison. This is the punishment that Eun-chae's father receives - the death of his own daughter.
","I liked this anime, but I recommend everyone to watch the Korean Drama before watching.  
 
This anime summarized the plot using overall 30 mins when the Korean Drama is 16 episodes so it might be hard to see/understand what is going on.  
 
It indeed skipped a lot of scenes from the original. 
 
It has a lot of sadness and overall great music in the story and in the credits. The art is nice so are the characters (if you understand the plot).  
 
If you like short anime like this or a shorter story instead of the Korean Drama I do recommend you watching it.  Especially since Korean anime are so rare.

","Well, I started watching this anime thinking ""this is gonna be one more of those 70's super robot anime where a somewhat random gets chosen to pilot the robot and he shouts every move he makes and he basically just fights the monster of the week"". 
 
And, to some extent, I was right, as that is what happens in more than half of the episodes, but fortunately that's not the only thing that happens.  
 
Recapitulating, the story is about a race of human-like aliens attacks the earth as they need a new planet to live, but it won't be a straightforward plot as we will have power struggles, rebellions, coup d'etats, treason and moral issues like pacifism and obedience in the mix. So, it's an interesting story! 
 
The mecha fights are probably the least interesting part of the show, just what you would expect coming out from Mazinger or any super robot anime.

4,743,142,6.127351439,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Umi ga Kikoeru,"Ocean Waves is a high school love story set in Kochi, Japan. Morisaki Taku and Matsuno Yutaka are best friends when a girl from Tokyo named Muto Rikako transfers to their school. Excluding herself from group activities, she's eventually labeled a snob. Matsuno has a crush on Rikako, so it's no surprise that he gets a little jealous when Morisaki and Rikako start spending more time together. The rumors around school get worse, but Morisaki still insists there is nothing between him and Rikako. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","In Kōchi, Taku Morisaki receives a call from his friend, Yutaka Matsuno, asking to meet at their high school. He finds Yutaka with an attractive female transfer student, Rikako Muto, whom Yutaka was asked to show around. Rikako is academically gifted and good at sports, but also arrogant. Taku believes she is unhappy about leaving Tokyo.
On a school trip to Hawaii, Rikako asks Taku to lend her money, as she has lost her own. As Taku has a part-time job, he lends her ¥60,000. Promising to repay him, she warns him not to tell anyone.
Back in Kōchi, the third year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako has not returned Taku's money and he wonders if she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretense of a concert trip, only to discover that their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money. He races to the airport.
Rikako's father thanks Taku, repays the loan and arranges a room at the Hyatt Regency. Rikako explains that when her parents were fighting, she had always sided with her father, but had now discovered he was not on her side. Taku offers his bed and attempts to sleep in the bathtub. The next morning, Rikako kicks Taku out so that she can change clothes to meet a friend for lunch. Taku wanders around the city. After catching up on sleep at the hotel, Taku receives a call from Rikako asking to be rescued from her former boyfriend, Okada.
Back home, Rikako ignores Taku, but tells her friends that they spent a night together. Taku confronts Rikako in class for hurting his best friend. She responds by slapping him and he slaps her in return.
The autumn school cultural festival arrives and Rikako becomes more distant from the other girls, many of whom openly dislike her. Taku sees Rikako defend herself from another student who tries to assault her. Taku comments that he is impressed with the way she handled herself. She slaps him but runs away with regret. Yutaka punches Taku to the ground, calls him an idiot, and walks away. None of the three talks to each other for the rest of the year.
Taku, Yutaka, and Yumi reconnect at a class reunion several years later. Rikako does not attend. While reminiscing about school, Yutaka comments that that the reason he punched Taku was because he was angry that Taku had held off on pursuing Rikako because of Rikako's mistreatment of Yutaka (and Yutaka's unrequited love for her). He was angry his friend had foregone a beautiful possibility on his account. The two watch the sun set and the ocean waves. Later, however, when Taku glimpses Rikako from across a platform, he realizes that he had always been in love with her. Rikako sees him and he smiles.
","This is a very slow uneventful movie, it shows their high school lives in great detail really well. Like how the students reacted when a school trip was cancelled, or the everyday intereractions and bullying at school. There were certainly interesting events like a sudden trip to Tokyo, and lots of slapping. The start of the movie very little happens. Although the movie picks up the pace when Rikako asks Taku for money, which leads to a series of events.  
 
However the characters are not very likeable. The main character Taku, he does some incredibly stupid things that make him unlikeable, Rikako is a more interesting character especially when we learn more about her parents and what life was like for her before going to her current school. Excluding Rikako all the characters seem rather one dimensional, like Taku’s friend who seems to be a nice guy and that’s it, while Taku is both nice and stupid at times.  
 
The film also lacks a clear sense of direction, a purpose. The film shows the scenes about Taku and Rikako, and their high school lives, and that's it. Although it does reflect their high school experience reasonably well. It also results in a film that can feel rather too slow at times. 
 
The music choice, especially the main theme is odd and doesn't suit the moment. It uses a ringtone like theme which sounds out of place. The animation is very simple and suits the film well. 
 
This film reflects the characters’ high school life well, although it's unlikeable characters and barely existent plot makes this a disappointing viewing for a Studio Ghibli film. 
 
Constructive feedback is appreciated :) 


          
 
       Helpful Jesus. I thought the general consensus that this was one of Ghibli's worst features would be an exaggeration, but that description is spot on. Usually I only do reviews of anime when I care enough to do a full analysis, but that isn't the case here. I'm just disappointed enough to write a quick summary, especially after seeing a flurry of reviews claiming that this movie isn't as bad as other people seem to think. 
 
Even though I respect your opinion if you think that this movie is ""good"" or maybe even ""great"", having that thought after watching this movie is something that I find unfathomable. I think that Ocean Waves rightfully deserves the reputation it has and is one of the most aggravating film experiences that I've had to sit through in a while. 
 
ART: 
 
Nothing to critique here; typical early Ghibli style and charm. 
 
SOUND: 
 
The score is forgettable at best and off-putting at worst. Some scenes were coupled with undeserved orchestral swells that made moments feel even more artificial or exasperating than they already were. Voice acting was good for main characters but occasionally spotty for the supporting cast. 
 
CHARACTER and STORY: 
 
Here we go. If you don't already know this movie's reputation, viewers tend to hate the female lead, Rikako. I had seen this trend before watching the movie and was fully prepared to disagree with or at least criticize that line of thinking. ""She can't be that bad,"" I thought. ""Surely some people just don't understand her motivations or are blowing her personality out of proportion. Right?"" 
 
Boy was I wrong. Not only do I completely agree with this sentiment, but as of now, she is one of the most unlikable characters I have ever been forced to watch. I've seen non-villains and villains alike in movies, people who are antagonistic scumbags that have committed atrocities and all kinds of abominable actions, yet they all seem more human than the self-centered, deceitful, underdeveloped Rikako. As the movie goes on, she only continues to grow more inhuman, irritating and repugnant. 
 
""But that's the point. This is a story of a girl tearing two best friends apart and the struggles of youth. That's why it's a drama."" 
 
Is that really the point though? Cause I don't think so, and it doesn't seem like the writers thought that either.  
 
Romance is also listed in the tags, and that seems to be what the story is shooting for, especially with how the movie ends...except that no one in their right mind would find this movie romantic, nor is the romance given proper development or a conclusion. In fact, the romance doesn't even really begin, it's just implied within the last minutes of the film. If you tried to tell me that this was a romance movie before I looked at its Wikipedia and MAL pages, I would've laughed in your face. 
 
The story and ""romance"" in this movie consists of Rikako being a selfish, manipulative, uncaring asshole and two guys falling in love with her anyway. Her motivations for being an asshole are cliche (you could probably guess them without watching the movie) and never justified. We are given some superficial dialogue about why she turned out this way and then the movie expects us to somehow forgive her for being such a terrible character, even when none of the reasons for her actions are resolved or acknowledged in a meaningful manner. 
 
The two male leads are flat and one-dimensional. Not only do they have seemingly no reason to love her (besides the fact that she is attractive) but the movie doesn't even attempt for either of them to get close to her in any significant way. She uses Taku and then abandons him just as quickly. Yutaka tries to befriend her and fails miserably. This is somehow enough to make the friendship between Taku and Yutaka fall apart.  
 
The movie's third act is short and pointless. Taking a walk together is enough to fix Taku and Yutaka's friendship. A reunion at a bar suddenly makes all the character's reveal how they've ""grown"" over their time in college, when really the only character that has developed in any way is an irrelevant girl that was barely in the movie. The rest of the them haven't changed at all. What's even more laughable is that after all the pain she's caused them, Taku realizes at the reunion that he still loves Rikako...for some reason (this is especially hilarious when the only memories that he can recall are of her being an asshole to him). What you're looking at is a movie where almost nothing happens, and what does happen is not justified or impactful in any stretch of the imagination. The melodrama is neither entertaining nor well-executed, and you will leave the movie wondering what the hell you're supposed to take away from this experience. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
A movie hasn't made me this upset in a long time. This is not a feel-good slice of life and it's also not a romance. It's a drama, and it handles that label with extreme laziness and ineptitude. Unlikable characters with nonexistent development. Meandering dialogue. No sense of direction. A rushed ending. I'm not sure if this movie has any positive aspects. What I am sure of is that this movie barely scrapes over the hour mark and it almost feels like two.  
 
The premise is not inherently terrible. Watching a friendship deteriorate due to a manipulative person is a classic plot that could've been handled well, but it doesn't even feel like the focus of this movie; it's just something that happens out of the blue toward the end of the second act. But the romance doesn't feel like the focus of this movie either. So what the hell is the focus of this movie anyway? Rikako being an asshole? Yeah, pretty much. 

          
 
       Helpful Ocean Waves gives the feeling of typical teenagers. Realistic, calming, and understandable. The characters are simple but likable, with each character's point of view touched upon at one point or another during the movie. The story had no particular twists or turns, just a matter of fact- ""this can happen to you"" type feel. I'm personally not a huge fan of the soft, 90's animation style. The characters always seem fuzzy and not as expressive as I'd like, which is why I gave it a 6/10. The OST was fitting for the storyline and allowed for nice visualization. Overall, it was good.

4,17074,143,6.097514763,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Monogatari Series: Second Season,"Apparitions, oddities, and gods continue to manifest around Koyomi Araragi and his close-knit group of friends: Tsubasa Hanekawa, the group's modest genius; Shinobu Oshino, the resident doughnut-loving vampire; athletic deviant Suruga Kanbaru; bite-happy spirit Mayoi Hachikuji; Koyomi's cutesy stalker Nadeko Sengoku; and Hitagi Senjogahara, the poignant tsundere. 
 
 Monogatari Series: Second Season  revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching. A new semester has begun and with graduation looming over Araragi, he must quickly decide the paths he will walk, as well as the relationships and friends that he'll save. But as strange events begin to unfold, Araragi is nowhere to be found, and a vicious tiger apparition has appeared in his absence. Hanekawa has become its target, and she must fend for herself—or bow to the creature's perspective on the feebleness of humanity. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Vampire']","
Most heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's black and yellow tracksuit (the colors of a bee). Although it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror, and action, the series primarily focuses on relationships and conversations between its characters, which make heavy use of Nisio Isin's signature word play and metahumor.
","Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime. 
 
Story: 10/10 
The storytelling in the Second Season is slightly different then its previous seasons. As almost each arc is told by one of the supporting characters with the help of Araragi and Shinobu who are the main protagonists. Each specific arc in the series is told at different times ranging from summer to winter season in the story. The story itself requires many to watch the previous seasons as the Second Season is fairly complex. The complex story is appealing as it usually surprises me in the ending of the arc. The Story in the Monogatari Series is truly unique as each arc is slowly united into another arc which show the outcome of the consequences that Araragi or another character makes. The pacing in the story is slow likes its previous season. The Season Season does not contain really any fanservice unlike Nisemonogatari except more of an occasional comedy while still maintaining its seriousness in the storytelling. I did not like that the Otorimonogatari arc was pushed aside to be resolved until another arc was finished. The second season was also missing the Hanamonogatari arc.  The ending of Season Season however was great as it paves the way for a new season in the future. 
 
Art: 10/10 
The series excels very well in its unique art style and visuals. A lot of the visuals and scenery that were hand painted were beautifully incorporated into the anime. The art style is realistic as the illustration utilizes the light and shadows in the background to create a wonderful setting for the story without using too much color. I believe the art style fits the story as fine like its previous seasons. The art style was relatively the same quality as before. Near the end of the season the opening visual of the Koimonogatari arc seemed outdated and old. The backgrounds are definitely memorable as VOfan's illustration is very distinct in his paintings and drawings. The character designs were appealing along with the hair style. Each character looked different and special in their own style. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The characters that were portrayed in the previous season fits the different characters great. I believe the voices actors were chosen to fit their typical role for the voices. The background music is a big key to the art and story of Monogatari. By using the beautiful art style and sound like the previous seasons it allows the series to set up a bright or gloomy setting for the story. The soundtracks enhanced the action scenes for the different arcs. The OST that was used in the anime is intriguing and I would probably listen to it when it gets released. The OP/ED always have been one of the best which changes every time a new arc starts or ends. The Nekomonogatari: Shiro, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari OP/ED were one the most notable and best in my opinion. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Many of the characters in Monogatari were well-rounded having a human flaw and strength. They all bare the traits of human nature. Some of the characters are either clever, manipulative, innocent, wise , selfish and brave in someway. The characters reacted in a realistic way; learning and understanding the problems that pop up in the story. I was not able to relate any of the characters together as they were all special in their own way. Some of the characters did deteriorate to the point where they were willing to risk anything to change the outcome and or hide their true intention. I believe it is fine for the characters to deteriorate as it will be interesting to see how it progress in the future seasons of the Monogatari Series.  Shinobu and Kaiki would be the foils for Araragi and Senjougahara in the series as play a strong support role in the last 2 arcs of the season. The main antagonist in the story had a open motivation which to some may seem insane or extreme, however we are told slowly on how the antagonist become this way near the end of the season which is realistic due to natural human behavior of being selfish. We are not really told much in the second season about Ougi Oshino but it seems most likely that the character is the second antagonist in the future. The supporting cast was just fine and perfect without it being overcrowed as Monogatari mostly focuses on the one  supporting character for each specific arc. The main character Koyomi Araragi is the most prominent and memorable character just like the in previous seasons. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
I believe many people will like this anime as the art and story arc are fascinating. I think non-anime/manga fans may like this anime for its unique style but some individual maybe discouraged due to the slow pacing. I might re-watch the entire series in the future if I read the light novel. I think re-watching the series will help me understand some of the information that I missed the first time. If they had complete Monogatari Series translated or straight from Japan I would definitely buy it because I love the story telling with the occasion comedy and action in Monogatari. The Monogatari Series is pretty memorable as it ended year on a good note. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
As you can see, SHAFT continues to bring out a compelling anime series that will satisfy many of its fans with its great story and unique art/sound from the previous season. 


          
 
       Helpful To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face? 
 
The Monogatari Series is one outstanding series. The light novel is well written and the animated series is beautiful. One important aspect of Monogatari Series is that there are many tropes and themes where viewers and readers can enjoy. Monogatari Series provide a variety of interest and it will make the audience want more. What is understandable is the fact that the underlying themes in Monogatari Series make the series stand out. 
 
	One theme that is shared throughout the series is random act of kindness. This theme is important because it shapes people psychologically. These random acts of kindness can vary from giving directions to a stranger to saving a person’s life. If a person is in need of help, it is best to help that person out. Even though there are more themes and tropes, they are all able to connect beautifully. Monogatari Series also have dark themes. These dark themes are used to portray reality and fantasy. To discover the truth behind the dark themes is to uncover the mystery behind apparitions. The saying goes: if there is light, there is also darkness. 
 
	Monogatari Season Two is the continuation of Nisemonogatari. Studio SHAFT plans to animate the whole light novel. There will be a total of three seasons. Monogatari Season Two focuses on Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Onimonogatari, and Koimonogatari. These titles are significant because they relate deeply to the story. For an example, Kizumonogatari, Kizumono means ‘damaged good’, but also ‘a woman who has been deflowered’. Monogatari would mean story. Based off the title, it foreshadows the underlying dark theme.  
 
	Since there is a sequel, the introduction of Monogatari Season Two provides a recap of what happened previously. The sequel started with Nekomonogatari White. Therefore, the story continued from Nisemonogatari time wise and a continuation of plot to Hanekawa in Nekomonogatari Black. Though, Nekomonogatari Black took place before Bakemonogatari. This may be confusing, but the timeline and plot is completely different. Araragi is helping out people with apparitions and it would be boring if the plot was to be linear. As the anime progress, characters have special appearance in certain situations. There are multiple characters and each character has their own arc. In short, each character is important to their respective arc. There are interactions among these characters even though they are not focused in these arcs. Although they are not focused, it gives insight to the character and provides development. What is given for sure is that this technique is smart and well used throughout the series. 
 
	Animations are one reason to seek interest in an anime. If the art work is great and the animations are smooth, most people would tend to watch it because it is appealing to the eye. When it is appealing to the eye, it is easier to enjoy the anime and not complain. One reason that makes the Monogatari series good is because of Studio Shaft. Studio Shaft tends to make unique animations. Unique animations as in great camera view, amazing art work, detailed background and effects. There is also a gag where Studio Shaft likes to put their characters in a difficult head tilt. This is just for comedy purposes, but it is indeed interesting. This can be related to paintings as they have their own form of interpretation. Last but not least, the characters are very detailed, the transitioning is beautiful and the art is crystal clear. 
 
	As the story progress through, the characters adapt to changes. The adaption can be either negative or positive. It is truly boring to watch a static character. Seeing a dynamic character can trigger new events. Having a dynamic character allows the plot to be flexible and create suitable settings. This is important because Monogatari focuses on Araragi and apparitions. As Araragi progress throughout the story, he will learn and experience new information. This is also the same for any other characters in Monogatari. Since there are dynamic characters, there is a beautiful resolve. The resolve can be either a good ending or tragic ending. As characters face an obstacle, they would have to overcome the experience. The journey may be short or long, but the experience is all that matters. 
 
	The character of Araragi Koyomi is notable throughout the Monogatari series. His goal was to protect those who he cared for. To achieve these goals, he has to fight against apparitions and try to help the victims face reality. There are times where people tend to seclude themselves away from reality. Reality is definitely harsh and not pleasant for those who struggle. What makes human the superior race is that humans overcome their problems and advance forward. Throughout Monogatari Second Season, Araragi has starred in most of the arcs and made a huge impact on the plot. Besides the fact that Araragi is the main character, there are other characters that are significant. 
 
As each arc starts, the audience views a nature that a character has hidden.  
 
“Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.” – Greta Garbo. 
 
This quote pretty much sums up the dark themes from Monogatari Second Season. Each character has their own hardships and it is tough to see them face their own problems. Characters such as Hanekawa Tsubasa and Hitagi Senjougahara have their own problems to deal with, but doesn’t show it until their respective arc shows. To acknowledge these problems, each character is related in a special way. Other characters such Oshino Shinobu, Hachikuji Mayoi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko also has their dark secrets. The audience grasps on these secrets and expands their curiosity. These characters are brought over from season one. These characters undergo more development and thus the audience learns more about the character. There is also an apparition that dwells under the host due to their problems. In order to solve the problem, the character would have to adapt and face reality to overcome their problem. 
 
	The voice actors and actress are kept the same. This is generally a must since there is a sequel. It would be quite awkward for a character to have a different voice actor or actress unless it was meant. Nobody in Bakemonogatari had different personalities causing it to have different voice actors or actress. What is known for sure is that the audio is great throughout. The opening is normally made by the arc’s main character. For an example, Nekomonogatari White starred Hanekawa Tsubasa so the voice actress of Hanekawa would sing the opening song. It is unique and it requires money and effort to be made. This is one way to show that Studio Shaft is trying to keep the same format as Bakemonogatari. 
 
	The audio for Monogatari Season Two is great. The opening is kept classy with the main character of the arc starring in the opening. For an example, if Hachikuji was the main character of the arc, Hachikuji will voice the opening and have a unique opening animation. This concept was started in Bakemonogatari and was brought over. I really liked this concept and it was used beautifully in Monogatari Second Season. 
 
	Overall, Monogatari Second Season is a good anime to watch. It is a genre that all could enjoy. I am sure that SHAFT poured their hearts out to appeal to their fan base and the general anime audience. The story is worth following up upon and the light novels are a great read. One cannot judge a book by its cover until its contents was seen.  
	 


          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Honestly, I'm surprised... surprised I was able to make it through to the end of this show.   
 
I'm afraid the long, unnecessary, drawn out conversations that constitute this entire series are a severe test of my patience. More on this in a bit. Due to this being the sole emphasis, the characters should be crucial right? 
 
Well quite frankly there is only one good character in the show, and this guy ends up being the true hero. He is the only character I like. To avoid spoilers... I'll just say, to my severe disappointment, that it doesn't end well.   
 
The rest of the main characters are immature, irrational  imbeciles. Sorry, but I hate tsunderes or whatever Senjougahara's personality is. Aragagi is as bad as any typical shounen protagonist who thinks he can save everyone. The only difference is that's he's a pedophile, not that really I care about that detail in particular - that's not even one of the things I hate about him. I hate the fact that every girl falls in love with him, when there's really nothing special about him. Is it that he's such a goody-two-shoes?  You can find white knights everywhere. His existence itself is probably the main reason I hate Senjo - the fact that she loves someone like him, that she's willing to die for this guy who doesn't understand anything. I don't remember much from Bakemonogatari as I saw it like 5 years ago, but to my recollection the only reason she's given is that it's because ""he is who he is"" or some vague bullshit like that. Yeah, whatever. Ignoring the fact that Hanekawa loves him too, she to me is a soulless creature, a vanilla. If you watch, it's well documented in those oh-so-long conversations as to why that is, in my opinion. I'm trying to put this in a nutshell because describing how I really feel about these people would require a long-winded essay each.  
 
I don't know; maybe Nisio Ishin doesn't intend for these people to be likable. For those of you who don't know, apparently the writer likes to intentionally make main characters who are unlikable and unrelatable. I’ve learned this from reading Medaka Box. If so, considering the ending and all the implications... he's pretty good at that. Pretty deep stuff, I'll give him that. 
 
Now back to those conversations - those endless dialogues between characters that I don't particularly even like. 
 
Take the very first episode for example. Hanekawa meets a tiger. Then her house burns down. Then she gets yelled at by Senjo. Three significant things happen. None of them take very long - around a couple minutes each. That's what like 6 - 10 minutes on the meat of the plot? The rest of the 20-minute episode was spent having unnecessary conversations and soliloquies.  
 
Yes, I'm well aware that that some of this banter leads to some important plot conclusions later. But too much of it is trivial and could easily be shortened without losing anything other than the weird fan-service or whatever it is that so much effort is spent on. The interaction between Hanekawa and Senjo that centers on taking a shower together at the end of the episode goes on for several minutes and well into the next episode. Then it gets even worse - only one thing truly necessary to the plot that happens is another short sighting of the tiger. I mean the majority of an episode is some long drawn-out, redundant small talk. Overall the first arc, 5 long episodes, could easily be shortened to one or two episodes. Most of the show is like this. 
 
We're getting to my point on why this is the main problem with this show. It's not like I wasn't paying attention to all this dialogue. Rest assured. I weathered the storm, waiting patiently for some meaning, some payoff, hanging on to nearly every word. Because naturally I'm always curious as to what is the point. What is the conflict? What is the goal? It's hardly ever obvious in this show when it's there at all. 
 
In a later arc, an episode begins with Araragi and a mysterious creature named Ougi having a conversation about traffic lights. This takes around. four. whole. minutes. Why is this a problem? Well, this conversation is happening for one of three reasons apparent to me: 
- It's leading up to something important to the plot. 
- It's some kind pretentious symbolism. 
- It's part of that weird fan-service or whatever it is that draws people to this show that I don't fully understand. 
 
In the end it doesn't really matter which of these three possible reasons this is conversation is happening, because on the surface it's a pointless conversation. On the surface, I don't know why they are having this conversation. On the surface, it's a long drawn out conversation about nothing, leading to nothing until way later. That is if it leads to anything at all. 
 
The point is that if most of the time I'm listening to long seemingly pointless conversations waiting for an eventual meaning, then watching this show has become a chore. It has become a job filled with boredom and ennui. Because it's not like many of these conversations are particularly fascinating. This is why the ""four whole minutes"" I emphasized about the traffic lights example doesn't seem very long in retrospect, but it felt very, very long. The vague connection with this traffic thing doesn’t show up until a while later. And this kind of thing happens often in this show. 
 
I will say in fairness, the plot was there. And it was mildly interesting. The time travel and the last arc were kind of alright. But it almost felt like the plot just was a backdrop for... conversation porn... because on the surface this is a show about people who stand around talking. I understand why this is.  
 
This series is based on light novels. And this situation might work well in books, but it doesn't work very well on screen. In an attempt to keep it interesting and dress up the fact that people are just standing around talking all the time, the animators even feel the need to flood the screen with constant camera angle shifts, queer poses, flashy patterns and loops, and surreal art. It gets old and irksome pretty fast.  I’ll admit that some of the dialogue, mainly the dialogue that unsubtly advanced the plot, was interesting. There wasn't enough of this kind. 
 
The important thing though is that the plot is a backdrop for the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, all described and analyzed in vivid detail by all these conversations and soliloquies. The important thing is that, small talk aside, the significant dialogue places that much greater emphasis on all their awful traits. That is why this show, why these people left a bad taste in my mouth.  
 
I didn’t enjoy this show because it started out badly with *very* slow pacing and ended badly with a frustrating ending in my opinion, ruining what little redemption it could have had.  Yeah, I’m aware this series is probably not over. But I also didn’t enjoy it because I didn't care for most of the protagonists, and there was simply too. much. talking.

(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Romance', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"I dislike being mean when i give a review, but i promised to myself to be sincere every time i give one. 
 
Marginal Prince falls under the category of ""it was so BAD it made me LAUGH"". People who reviewed about this being terrible weren't joking to you, truly... the only reason i didn't drop it off from the start was because it gave me a sheer amount of laughter in every episode. 
 
Welcome to the world of Marginal Prince! The worst Anime based of a dating game yet to be made.  
Main character (who is a dude instead of the main girl in the game) is the new guy in this amazing all-boy academy. At the beginning it seems that this will fall in the category of ""new guy in school who gets fawn over by everyone"", but in reality Marginal Prince is wrongly labeled, it is NOT a shounen ai... and that makes the story even more pointless.  
The thing is that THERE IS NO STORY. We have random pieces of plot scattered everywhere dealing with the character's back stories that we don't really care about.  
 
The worst yet most hilarious part is that the characters sing. Yes. They sing. Out of nowhere. IN THE RAIN.  
I love my good musicals, but... this wasn't suppose to be a musical, or is it? 
 
Everything is random and pointless.  
 
I don't suggest you to watch it but if you really want to i bet you at least will get a few laughs on how WTF everything is.  
 
 

          
 
       Helpful There wasn't any review written for this anime, so I thought I would help out and write down a little. 
 
Story: 
A boy transfers to a school on a small island. A lot of bi-shounen guys walk around. At first he isn't really accepted, but because he never gives up everything turns out right.  
I was really disappointed, because they could have done so much more with the story. But somehow they decided to keep it really predictable. 
 
Art: 
The art was pretty okay really. It had good details, nice colours. 
 
Sound: 
I give a 7, because of the singing. Every episode one of the characters starts to sing a song. That was just... really amusing. Well, go hear it for yourself ;). 
Voices where done well also :). 
 
Character: 
Biggest disappointment ever. They have this basic bi-shounen cast. Cool guy, nice guy, lolita guy..... and of course the main character is a dumb, but cheerful boy who eventually keeps everyone together and makes everyone happy.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I watched all episodes because of that strange singing every time. It really made me laugh.  
 
Overall: 
Oh well, a 5, because I'm not that strict.   

          
 
       Helpful Okay, This is under Shounen-ai and I believed it was so, until the ending. Around episode 10 I was just plain confused, suddenly there were a whole bunch of secrets, They had back stories and everything. It was just plain confusing, plus the sub-titles sucked badly.  
 
This show may seem like Shounen-ai at first but it is NOT it seems as though they are all just friends and they all fall for the main-character, Yuuta's sister. Which was in my opinion HORRIBLE, it was not Shounen-ai, the more I watched the show, It made me hate it.  
 
They sung in every episode, which was... Okay, it felt more like a musical at those moments. I remember when Joshua first sung he suddenly ended up in the rain and his jacket came off. It was confusing because.. it just was.  
 
The Genre on this show is set up wrong, I saw ZERO actions that related to Shounen-ai, No hugging and kissing at all. The last scene angered me at the most, where Joshua came up on a horse and pulled Yuuta's sister with him.  
 
At first I thought it'd be like Gakuen heaven, I was dead wrong.  
 
Disgrace to Shounen-ai.

","""The fastest way to happiness is to avoid looking at reality,"" 
 
I’m completely amazed by this anime. I have no idea why I haven’t heard of it earlier. I came watching this with absolutely no expectations, and after reading the reviews praising its greatness, I was surely expecting to be disappointed, or at least unsatisfied. Despite my worries, Denpa teki na Kanojo proved me wrong.  
 
A majority of the anime delves on the psychological state of individuals who were unfortunately succumbed to traumatic experiences. Because of this, much of the “antagonists” are made to believe that happiness can only be gained through taking other people’s happiness away. This is just a safe explanation as the events that occur during the climaxes of each episode will surely shock you. The build-up towards these climaxes are smooth and paced perfectly. It’s almost completely shrouded in mystery, giving us little doses of explanations that will make us wonder, but not exactly know what will come forth. This results in a satisfying viewing experience.  
 
The atmosphere and mood perfectly reflect on the show’s themes, with repeated glimpses of dark streets, broken signs, and barren buildings. It shows the right amount of blood and gore, leaving you feeling irked and disturbed, but not excessively so. The frightening imagery is amazingly displayed to show us the extent of such disturbing actions, without overstaying its welcome. Truth be told, the animation is perfect for this type of show. 
 
The characters are in the spotlight, and that’s exactly what you would expect from a psychological thriller. While MAL doesn’t exactly label Denpa-teki within the psychological genre, I personally feel like it has a lot to say about the state-of-mind of the “antagonists”. Despite the problems being quickly resolved, the shock value is going to really make a lasting impact on you. It makes you watch in awe the amount of extremes people are willing to take to fulfill their happiness. 
 
For being two episodes, it’s a shame the anime wasn’t longer. It had the potential to completely cover the themes it was trying to convey to the viewer, but because of its short length (even shorter than the runtime of an average film), it did not have the capacity to fully express its topics. Even so, this anime has done more than enough to satisfy me, and to also make me contemplate the reasons for why people would go through such lengths to fulfill their own view of what it is to be happy. I know this is an anime so it’s all just an exaggeration, but it’s fascinating to wonder about the state-of-minds of actual deemed “insane people” sometimes. All in all, Denpa-teki na Kanojo is a show that I am surprisingly impressed by.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 10/10 The story is outstanding for a two episode OVA. The storyline and the *SPOILERideaofhappypointsSPOILER* are original. The pacing was great, the plot wasn't given away too much at the beginning nor the end. Information and the plot were given away bit by bit along the two episodes. I especially liked the effects in the anime. For example, when the image of the very same statue pops up at regular intervals. Another example is when only words, letters and maybe a character or two shows up against a black background behind them. But it's not just the words, letters and characters on the black backgrounds, it's also the CONTENT in the words, letters and backgrounds. As I'm terrible at explaining, I'll just have to do with another example. ""It has reached him..."" So WHAT has reached him? Who knows? The ""..."" also means that something will bound to happen sometime. This adds the feeling of mystery and darkness into the anime.  
 
Art: 7/10 I absolutely love the backgrounds. The backgrounds were drawn well and were extremely detailed and physically attractive. The animations were also clearly planned and well thought. For example, in the sky in the majority of the scenes, the clouds moves slowly along like it would be in real life (yes, I've even noticed that), but in most anime, the clouds would just be static. This adds to the effects of reality. However, the character designs were a bit off to me. Sometimes, the eyes were too high and the hair & clothes were too plain and simple which contrasted with the beautiful backgrounds and pulled down the overall mark for the art (especially Juu). I would have gave the art section a 10/10 if the character art were more decent. Also, the Characters' thoughts and feelings were clearly portrayed. You can easily perceive how the character is feeling by their facial expression.  
 
Sound: 9/10 The background music brings out the atmosphere and gives you the type of outcome you would expect in the anime. For example, you wouldn't expect fluffy fairies and recipies for cupcakes would you? Another good point is that the background music stops and enters at the correct moment. This includes when the setting is in a normal, everyday classroom and usual conversations. However, I find that the school is a bit too quiet to be a school. It's peculiar to find a school with only a few people who were actually talking. I expect a school to be much busier than that. The voice actors have also done an excellent job, the emotions, thoughts and feelings were portrayed clearly through their voices. Their voices were also neither too high pitched or too low.  
 
Character: 10/10 The characters' personalities are realistic and can be related to people in reality. There aren't any Mary Sues/Gary Stus appearing in the anime. I can see a decent amount of thought put into character development. They're fairly realistic and not the over-exaggerated stereotypical -dere character. At first glance, it seems that Juu's personality is the only one which is properly developed. If you find that the other characters' personalities are a bit too 'plain', don't forget that the anime is mainly in Juu's perspective. It's impossible for you to see deeply into other people's personalities.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 It could be just me. I personally really enjoyed this anime. I especially liked the background music(or it could be just me or the fact that I just like creepy/depressing music). In my opinion, this is amongst one of the best thriller anime I've watched so far.  
 
Overall: 10/10 Overall, I personally believe that Denpa Teki na Kanojo is an outstanding anime for a two episode OVA. It's clearly well thought out and portrays reality. The strong points are character development and the story(and my enjoyment)

          
 
       Helpful Let me start off by first saying this OVA should've been a full series, Watching this anime made me realize why I first started watching anime in the first place.   Maybe it's just me but the ever repeating cycle of School based animes with boring leads and stereotypical archetype females became quite dull; that being said Denpa Teki na Kanojo is a breath of fresh air that left me hungering for more. 
 
In my eyes their are several reasons why i will watch an anime through and through -A. Well written story with no plot holes, B. Great Cast of characters that you really like and C. Great Director and Staff who have proven themselves before.  This anime has all 3, but the biggest reason I believe this anime succeeds is the characters.   
 
Juuzawa made this anime for me, I loved his character (then again i like delinquents and/or characters that don't give a crap)  FINALLY! I MEAN FINALLY! a character in a school setting anime that isn't a pushover that does anything the girls tell him to do.  Ochibana complemented  Juuzawa perfectly,  The reasoning for her attachment to him is a bit quaint but truth be told that doesn't matter.   
 
Im not gonna mention parts of the story because this is a 2 episode OVA, any mentioning of the story for an OVA this short feels like a spoiler.  Director Kanbe, Mamoru did a great job with this one, the voice actors match all the characters spot on, and the dark yet upbeat feel of this anime makes for a great watch. 
 
It's a shame that an anime as good as this couldn't get a full season considering the crap that Japan spews out.  I would've given it a perfect 10 but considering how short the OVA is I can only give it a 9

4,12355,146,6.011263583,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki,"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student. As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family. 
 
Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society.  Wolf Children  is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Fantasy', 'Slice of Life']","In Tokyo, college student Hana falls in ""fairy tale"" love with an enigmatic man. The man reveals that he can transform into a wolf, and they later have two wolf/human children: A daughter named Yuki, and a son named Ame. Soon after, their father is killed in an accident while hunting food for the children.
Hana's life as a single mother is difficult; Yuki and Ame constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, get into fights, and Hana has to hide them from the world. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social workers concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and becomes friends with some of the locals.
One winter day, Ame almost drowns in a river after trying to hunt a kingfisher, but Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to let her go to school like other children. Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school. Meanwhile, Ame is more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.
In fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, Sōhei, who realizes something is strange about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets angry, transforms into a wolf, and inadvertently injures him, leaving a scar on his right ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, Sōhei tells them a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame. The two become friends.
Yuki and Ame fight over whether they are human or wolf, especially after Yuki forces Ame to start going back to school, to which he refuses. Two years later, a fierce storm gathers and Yuki's school is let out early. As Hana is about to leave to pick her up, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, so she follows him. The other children are picked up by their parents, leaving Yuki and Sōhei alone. Yuki shows Sōhei that she can transform into a wolf and it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.
As Hana searches for Ame, she slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father, who tells her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see Ame fully transform into an adult wolf and run into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.
One year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame's wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud to have raised them well.
","While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, bizarre as it may sound, of Christopher Nolan and his style of movie-making. You know, complex stories with multiple twists that try to intrigue you up until the end credits (and sometimes beyond). For the most part, they succeed, yet my problem  with his movies is a consistent lack of believable, living characters, all I see are puppets who are there for the sole purpose of letting the puppeteer tell his story. 
 
Well, Wolf Children is a complete opposite of Nolan's style. The story is very basic with but one unusual twist to it which is revealed even in the title. This anime, however, features a whole cast of characters who are practically leaping out of the screen. Some may consider it a flaw; personally, I don't require a sophisticated story to make the experience enjoyable for me. And, you know, since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies are considered classics despite having the most basic plots imaginable, I believe it's true for a lot of people.  
 
This anime is a perfect proof that sometimes you don't need to make up a story, you don't really need to force conflicts. There are even no antagonists here. What I consider this title to be is a genuine representation of life. And it is really all you need: life has conflicts, life is difficult as it is. You don't really need to invent anything else, you just have to make it feel real. 
 
This movie manages to do just that, in no small part thanks to its pacing. It has a very unique feeling to it, despite covering a big period of time, it still manages to take its time. There are a lot of still and slow scenes, sometimes silent or practically silent to allow the atmosphere really sink in. I tend to admire movies that successfully utilize this storytelling tool since it really shows the advantages of visual media. Yes, i am a confident proponent of the ""show, don't tell"" idea. 
 
Speaking of ""show"", the art was kind of a mixed bag for me. The movie looks a bit like a sketch, yet it stays consistent with its style. In the end, it doesn't come out as lazy artwork but instead as a choice to make the atmosphere soft. It took a bit for me to get used to it but it was never able to take me out of the experience. I guess that's just my personal attraction to detailed and perfect art instead of the hand-made feeling the creators are going for here. 
 
The music is often absent, it only comes in at truly dramatic moments to make sure they leave a desired impression. It's not used to reflect the characters' feelings, this title uses it only to supplement its narrative, not to replace it. For what it's worth, it's adequate. The voice acting was, again, adequate. Just your standard set of good actors doing a good job. 
 
Talking about characters themselves would mean spoiling the show, since its narrative mostly has to do with exploring their personality, so I'm not going to do this. I'm just going to say that they all feel like real alive people, and are very relatable; especially the mother, she is just all around a wonder of a human being.  
 
Overall, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, mostly because of its tone being not for everyone and the artistic choice but it's definitely great and one of my favorite anime movies from now on.

So... 
 
THE GOODS: 
I think the story was pretty good and fairly original. But it's not the story who had a big impact on me, it's the characters. 
I can't even describe how much I loved the characters, especially Hana. I honestly can't recall, except Nagisa from Clannad, a more pure character. Like she is such a nice and kind-hearted person that it melted my hearth. It was so so overwhelming that from time to time I started crying.  
And there are her children who have a spectacular evolution through the whole movie. 
The sound and the art were also pretty good. 
  
THE BADS: 
I honestly can't recall anything bad. You will enjoy it from start to finish. It may be a little slow from some, but I think it has a good pacing. 
 
I don't give it a 10/10 because it doesn't have that *spark* that made me gave other anime or movies a 10/10. 
It doesn't mean it isn't perfect how it is.

In hopes of satisfying his mother's wishes, Sora enters Kuzuryuu High School to become a member of the basketball club and compete wholeheartedly in tournaments. However, Sora is disappointed to find out that the boy's basketball team is nothing but a retreat for punks who have no interest in the sport.

Determined to revive the basketball team, Sora challenges the boys to a match against him, where his quick feet and swift movements overwhelm the group.

","This anime starts off really really slow, like black clover slow. the first 2 episodes adapt 1.5 chapters each. It does start to pick up the pace after a few episodes tho. One thing that you have to keep in mind if you choose to watch this is that the source material for this was released in 2003. So almost every sports anime thats come out in the past 10, or so, years that you think ahiru no sora is similar to was actually made after it. This also partially explains the art style. 
 
Now to the actual review. (this will be updated eventually when ive watched all 50 episodes and my opinion of characters is based off what actually happens in the anime and is not skewed by what i know they will or wont do because ive read the manga) 


          
 
       Helpful Review is probably gonna change in the future. I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in real quick. 
 
The sports anime is usually not the genre I get into but I like the MC in this one so I stuck with it. He is a generally likable and has a good attitude. But of course he is likable because he is the underdog of the show. He is the little guy with a a lot of fight in him and his goal is to win the inter high basketball tournament like his mom. 
 
The other characters are where I have a problem. They have barely any skill yet are a bunch of ne'er do wells who for some reason hang out in the basketball club. Now I get we are to watch them grow but their skills are so unbelievably bad. Here is an example: Momoharu is incapable of scoring a single basket EVEN WHEN HE GOES FOR A DUNK! I know I have no place on a court but even I can at least get 2 or 3 baskets in out of maybe 10 shots, but this dude is like cursed to NEVER make a single basket even when it is handed to him. I can't say much about the others because even though it has been 12 episodes there hasn't really been any growth or time to get to know them and their strengths all that much. 
 
The art and sound is pretty good, especially the sound because it does a good job at mimicking the sounds I would here at a real basketball game. All in all, a solid basketball anime but I think Kuroko no Basket is still better

          
 
       Helpful An another sport anime, if you don't like those type of anime pass away, Ahiru no Sora didn't revolutionize anything. But If you like this genre then give it a try. 
 
I'll compare this anime in my review with Kuroko no Basket, same sport and popular anime. 
 
Date of review : 22/12/19 (will probably make some edits further the anime advance) 
 
Story : 7/10 
 
A generic sport anime but not driving by the shonen spirit (for now). 
 
Player's skills seems logical, contrary to Kuroko no Basket, and character's background is interesting, again in Kuroko the characters background is kind hollow (IMO !).  
 
I find more interesting to follow the progress of a team, as a whole, because it make the story more coherent and it make the characters more lovable. 
 
Need to mention that's the anime explain the rules of BASKET (!) when in Kuroko I didn't recall to read (I read the manga) or watch (and watch the anime) the rules explained. It's nothing but I appreciate the efforts to, at least, understand the depth of basketball (don't practice this sport lol). 
 
Art : 6/10 
 
As always in the first episode the animation is good, have been bait by this, but globally it's VERY average animation even during a match which is a pity. Unfortunately it didn't got the same budget as Kuroko no Basket. But well expect a way better animation in important matches. 
 
Sound : 6/10 
 
Not a fan of the OP and ED.  
 
In the seiyuu part, even if I am a fan of Kaji Yuki, his dubbing is ""okay-ish"" not spectacular as Eren or Silver Mask (Arslan Senki) where he push his voice to the limit but his character don't give the oppurtunity to express himself so I feel a bit disappointed (not his fault but well, I'm conflicted). 
 
For the other it's good, the voice match with the characters (yeah I minimize the others unlike Kaji Yuki... :X ). 
 
Character : 7/10 
 
As I wrote earlier, the character's background is interesting. The motivation to push them to play and train is coherent and understable (for the key players I precise).  
 
As a whole they don't have any default, except some stereotypes but well I'll give a pass because it's not really annoying. 
 
Enjoyment : 9/10 
 
My shonen spirit who was more or less dead, because of the disappereance of good shonen have burst with this anime. I repeat nothing spectacular and because I starve some shonen energy I overestimate this anime but I am really enjoying watching this anime.  
 
I have followed the last season around 10 animes (more at the beginning but dropped some in the way) and this one, was my most awaited each week. 
 
Overall : 8/10 
 
I give a 8 because of the story, the consistency of the characters and the shohen spirit (totally subjective point).  
 
Cant give an higher score because of the weak point inherent of the animation which is low. 
 
So I recommend it if you're neutral or like sport and the animation is not a mandatory point for you. Otherwise pass away.

4,9890,148,5.983343809,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Major: Message,"Thirteen years have passed. Following an injury that put Gorou's career as a pitcher into a standstill, he prepares to restart his baseball career as a fielder. His family struggles with his decisions, especially his daughter Izumi, who doesn't know enough about her father to understand why he is so absent from their lives. Gorou will stop at nothing until he's in the game once again; everything is now for the sake of the only gift he has to offer his children: Baseball.  
","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Shounen', 'Sports']","The story of Major follows the life of Gorō Honda from kindergarten to his career as a professional baseball player. The story focuses on how the main protagonist overcomes tremendous challenges.
Subsections are divided according to the official website's story sections.
","Major does not have a recurring family team before Major: Message came. Although a sports anime, Major: Message is a wonderful family drama. I am gonna evaluate this anime as a special because it functions as one so my evaluation will be different 
 
Major is all about struggles. But Message is a different one, a family struggle. Unlike those generic sports anime, Major portrays real life responsibilities. Responsibilities between two things: work and family. In Major: Message, Goro's responsibilities are his kids and Shimizu and baseball. Those two are the main conflicts in the story that generate drama. And I found this actually compelling for a special. Its fleshes out characters, it develops Goro from a stubborn boy into a adult. Eh, Major cannot be more amazing than this though.

       Helpful As an OVA, Major: Message's point is just to bring the entire series to a close. Gorou, who has faced many many struggles so far, but have always received support from his friends and family, becomes the one to support his family, with his only gift he can give to his kids, baseball. 
Throughout all seasons of Major, we've seen Gorou grow from a talented reckless kid, to a championship-winning professional in Major League Baseball in USA, while retaining his recklessness. But the biggest influence he's had is arguably from his dad. So now that Gorou has become the father, he sought to be the role model to his kids, the way his father became his. And the only way he could do that after his injury, being the reckless that he is, is to show his kids, Izumi and Daigo, the result of his hard works; to show them that an obstacle is just another challenge to help them grow. 
I know there won't be another season of Major, but if there ever is, this time it'll be the story of Izumi, the way that Major was the story about Gorou.

4,2454,149,5.944003237,Romatic love story between a couple who struggle to be together,Kimagure Orange☆Road: Ano Hi ni Kaeritai,"After the TV-series of Kimagure Orange Road, Kyosuke and Madoka have finally arrived at the point where they are close to graduation and have to decide where they want to go to college. Naturally, they want to go together, so beside all the studying they also have to look for a proper college where they can enter both. 
 
Hikaru, still a year from graduating, wants to support Kyosuke as well and does that in her own way. But while she does that, Madoka feels jealous and tells her feelings to Kyosuke. 
 
And then Kyosuke has to take action to finally decide on the girl he loves... thus concluding the story of the Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']","Kyōsuke Kasuga and his family had to move several times after being seen using their esper powers. Upon settling for the seventh time, Kyōsuke briefly meets a pretty girl who gives him her straw-hat and falls in love with her on sight. On the first day of school he learns this girl is his junior high classmate Madoka Ayukawa, who, contrary to his initial impression, is feared as a tough and no-nonsense delinquent. Their underclassman (and Madoka's best friend), Hikaru Hiyama, sees Kyōsuke use his powers to sink an impressive basketball shot and falls in love with him. Kyōsuke ends up dating Hikaru while constantly struggling with his feelings for Madoka due to his indecisiveness. Likewise, Madoka has feelings for Kyōsuke which she masks with her capricious nature for fear of hurting her friend Hikaru.
","This is the first movie which could be called a spin-off because it's an original piece of work written by Kenji Tereda, the main scenario writer for the TV series rather than based off the original Manga. 
 
It takes on a more serious tone during the summer when Kyousuke is preparing for university entrance exams. There's no mention of supernatural powers nor are any used, just your slice-of-life romance. Kyousuke's originally kind indecisive character is changed to be more cold and decisive so it's no longer a romcom and can be quite bitter which is probably why it was ill-received. Even Izumi Matsumoto criticised the work, suggesting viewers took it as a parallel world story instead because of how harsh it was. 
 
The supernatural powers were partly what made the original TV series fun so with the sudden change in mood and powers left out, it just feels like your bland romance movie.

          
 
       Helpful It's not often I see an anime movie based on a series that's really worthwhile. Most of the time the movie just feels very generic and dull compared to the series, like it's something they created for the sole purpose of making money. I've been disappointed by the One Piece movies, Bleach movies, Ranma movies... They had their cool points, but were overall pretty bland. This movie is not like those movies. 
 
The animation wasn't really anything special; it was about the same quality as the series. 
 
I really wasn't expecting an Ushiko-Umao reference in the movie. It's been a while since I watched the series, so it was just a nice surprise and probably the only really funny part in the movie.  
 
Spoilers below, it's hard to talk about the movie without spoiling it since he makes his decision sorta early in the movie. It's based more on their feelings and how things go after that, not indecisiveness. 
 
Kyosuke finally tells Hikaru how he feels in this movie. It's pretty tough, but... well, it was always very one-sided from the start. She was always just pressuring and forcing him into stuff simply because she thought he looked cool the day he used his power to shoot a basketball through a hoop? I always thought Hikaru just seemed really shallow and stupid, so it's pretty easy to accept her defeat.  
The movie starts off in black and white as if to set a more serious tone... it also ends in black and white after the story is explained and it returns to the point where the intro ended. Something about this feels just feels kinda incomplete... It didn't just set a serious tone, it set a kinda depressing one, like all the fun's been sucked out since Hikaru's been turned down. Are Kyosuke and Madoka happy together? They sure didn't make it look like it. Did Hikaru accept reality? I dunno what the point of her ""bang"" at the end was. The black and white thing makes me feel like the two aren't happy and like Hikaru didn't move on... 
 
The movie gave the conclusion we were all waiting for, but it could've tied things up a little better, I think. It doesn't handle that very well by itself, but the second movie gives a more concrete ending.

          
 
       Helpful There comes a time in your life when you have to decide over something so painful. 
 
The goofing days are finally over. Kasuga and Ayukawa are finally graduating from high school and they're moving on. This is Kimagure Orange Road without the out-of-this-world Power, over-acting Hatta and Komatsu, and crazy time-travels. What's left in this movie is raw human emotion. This is the ultimate conclusion to the Kasuga-Ayukawa-Hikaru love triangle. 
 
Kasuga Kyosuke has to choose. I won't say who he chooses. But it's what the movie is all about. 
 
Before you watch this, think first. If you want to remain happy with Kimagure Orange Road's TV series conclusion, then don't ever watch this. The indecisive yet sensitive-to-others Kasuga is gone. The understanding Ayukawa is gone. The jolly and heartwarming Hikaru is gone. The Kasuga twins just make some brief appearances. Jingoro is turned into a passive cat. Hatta and Komatsu are still as horny as ever, but they're toned down, and perhaps are the only sources of humor in the movie (and they didn't do well). And for the first time since I started watching the franchise, I kind of missed the bozo Yuusaku. 
 
The falling leaves. The telephone talks. Secrets were finally revealed. Each scene was made with subtlety and utmost care so as to deliver to us what each character really feels. They were made more human. They run after who they love. All defenses put aside, they show their hidden sides and deepest doubts and fears. 
 
There are some parts that were totally silent except for the voices of the main characters, which was good, since it emphasized the movie's meanings more. The art, well, is still what it is: outdated. I can't really say I enjoyed the movie; it was too emotional. I was a bit shocked with its content; it was really a departure from the feel of the TV series. This is no romantic comedy, this is drama. You could feel the uneasiness, the uncertainty, the bitter parts of adolescence, embodied by Kasuga, Ayukawa and Hikaru. 
 
Even though it doesn't contain the same warmth of its prequel, the story could be looked at as something that is more reality-based. We have to grow up. We have to take separate roads. Still, with all the emotions surrounding it, this is a worthwhile work to watch and is as gripping as any movie, only it will leave you will a feeling of nostalgia and loss, and a bit of relief and bittersweet happiness, too. 
 
My suggestion: watch something jolly after this.
