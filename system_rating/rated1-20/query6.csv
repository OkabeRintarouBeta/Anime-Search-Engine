After discovering Mariya's secret and becoming stuck with him as her roommate, Kanako's life has become a series of misfortunes.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shoujo Ai']","Maria†Holic revolves around a high school girl named Kanako Miyamae, who due to a childhood incident is scared of boys and breaks out in hives if a boy touches her. During her second year of high school, she enrolls in an all-girls school hoping to find a female romantic partner. However, her ideal candidate, Mariya Shidō, turns out to be a sadistic cross-dressing boy.
","I had a love-hate relationship with the first season of Maria Holic. It was like a train wreck - I knew how awful it was going to be, but I couldn't look away. At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.  
 
Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But, it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.  
 
I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me.

          
 
       Helpful Maria Holic Alive is the sequel to the above-average anime, Maria Holic. To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided. 
 
Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako's transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako's crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there's still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it's nothing too serious. 
 
The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting. 
 
The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing. 
 
Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.  
 
Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic. If you're looking for comedy anime, go watch something else instead. 

          
 
       Helpful The story for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1, in other words the only unique thing about it was the fact that it had a perverted teenage girl instead of a perverted teenage boy. That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10. 
The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10. 
The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10. 
The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10. 
The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10. 
The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

6,195,1,10.96914941,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Onegai☆Teacher,"One day, Kei Kusanagi notices a strange glowing woman by the lake. He discovers that the woman is actually an alien officer from the Galaxy Federation named Mizuho Kazami, and even more shocking—she's also his teacher! In spite of this setback, he and his teacher gradually get to know each other and a romance blossoms between them. However, soon enough, the principal of the school finds out about their relationship. The solution? Get married! 
 
Together, the newlyweds must keep their marriage a secret, not only from Kei's high school friends, but also the Galaxy Federation.  Onegai☆Teacher  is the fragile but comedic love story of an alien and her student. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","Please Teacher! is a story mainly revolving around a tight-knit group of friends in high school and how they cope with several life-changing events that are never too far off from intimate relationships. The main character is a boy named Kei Kusanagi who suffers from a very rare disease which causes a comatose state referred to as a ""standstill"" whenever he is under severe emotional distress.
Before the beginning of the story, Kei, at 15 years of age, had fallen into a ""standstill"" lasting three years after witnessing the suicide of his elder sister. After recovering, he quietly moved away from home in order to avoid social difficulty due to his long absence, and began living with his uncle, a medical doctor, and aunt. Due to the strange nature of how he came to live there, Kei wanted to keep the situation a secret from his new friends for fear of being ostracized as being too old to associate with them. After Kei had established himself in his new surroundings and had entered into a close group of mutually supportive friends, a Galactic Federation starship had entered Earth's atmosphere stealthily, approached Honshū Island and landed surreptitiously in Lake Kizaki.
The story begins with Kei suffering a minor 'standstill' while in the vicinity of the lake, witnessing several unexplainable phenomena happening there, and then watching as a beautiful half-human alien named Mizuho Kazami materialize beside the shore. Kazami was sent to observe planet Earth by a seemingly benevolent Galactic Federation in order to prevent humans from making developmental mistakes. Kei, upon observing the materialization, attempts to escape the pursuing Kazami. Kazami is under strict orders to prevent her true identity and mission from being discovered. During his attempt to escape, Kei falls into the lake. Kazami rescues Kei and, using information from his identification, is able to return him home in secret. The next day, Kazami has become Kei's new homeroom teacher and next-door neighbor.
During assisting her in moving in, Kei suffers another standstill, and while in a weakened state explains his predicament to the compassionate Mizuho, who ends up revealing her own origins and purpose on Earth. Several accidental activations of Mizuho's teleport technology (which were inadvertently caused by Kei) eventually place Kei and Mizuho in a couple of compromising situations in front of his uncle and aunt and his school's headmaster, but Kei protects Mizuho from charges for an inappropriate relationship between student and teacher by impulsively stating that they are married, resulting in an actual civil marriage that later blossoms into genuine affection for each other. The headmaster relents, partly because he, too, had married a former student younger than himself and can understand their situation personally. Both are allowed to stay so long as they do not reveal their status to the other students, and do not engage in any public displays of affection.
The remainder of the series concerns the budding intimate relationships between the close friends, one of whom (Koishi Herikawa) is romantically interested in Kei, and another (Ichigo Morino) who has suffered even greater loss of time from the same disease as he has; the problems of having to maintain the secrecy of the marriage; an interfering parent and sibling visiting from the Galaxy Federation; and Kei learning to overcome the ever-present threat of another lengthy 'standstill' stealing more of his life, particularly as he has fallen deeply in love with Mizuho and desperately wants to remain with her.
Eventually Kei falls into another major ""standstill"" and in order to bring him out of it, Mizuho has to use her technology which is against the law. As a result, her status on Earth is revoked, she is banned from the planet and all memory of her is erased from everyone's, including Kei's, minds. With the help of her mother and sister she sneaks back and is devastated to learn that Kei, who she is deeply in love with, has no memory of her. While helping her move back in, Kei reveals that his memory has returned and the two express their love for each other and get married again.
","""Onegai Teacher"" is a series I avoided watching for a quite a while despite its popularity at the time I was getting into anime. One of the reason I avoided it was because back then, I didn't think I would like romance anime. Eventually, I came across it being aired on an internet TV channel. So I watched it. And I hated it. Now, several years on, and having watched and liked plenty of anime of the romance genre, I've come to realise that it's not anime romance that I hate per se - it's bad anime romance. And the romance in ""Onegai Teacher"" isn't just bad... it's diabolical. 
 
But then, what do you expect, given the premises of ""Onegai Teacher"" (which, by the way, is my second reason for avoiding it for so long)? I mean... just look at its synopsis: An undercover alien - and it just so happens that she's a beautiful woman - who is working as a teacher has her secret identity discovered by a student. And this students ends up having to marry her in order to protect her... this has got to be a bad joke right? RIGHT? Sadly, it's not even a joke - the anime is dead serious about its story, and it is every bit as ridiculous as the synopsis suggests. So anyone who is put off by that should probably avoid this show at all cost (unless they're up for a good laugh about how bad it is).  
 
Rather unsurprisingly, the worst aspect of ""Onegai Teacher"" is its farcical story. The whole student marrying his fit teacher scenario is obviously a fantasy of forbidden love lifted straight out of someone's head and, like a typical fantasy of this type, it's seriously lacking in the coherency department. The whole thing is weakly held together by gimmicks, contrived twists and bucketload of cliched coincidences and compromising situations of the type often found in harems. 
 
Hand in hand with the bullsh*t story is a weak cast of characters. Thanks to the unbelievably convoluted storyline, the characters are little more than poor puppets, constantly doing inexplicable things for inexplicable reasons, just so that the latest ""twist"" will keep the story on its intended track. As a result, most of them come off as horribly unconvincing.  
 
The majority of the characters have undeveloped personalities. The severity of the underdevelopment seems inversely proportional to the amount of screen time for the most part. Topping the leaderboard, we have the main characters Kei (the student) and Mizuho (the teacher). Kei is your average harem lead type loser, with a personality so bland that perhaps the most remarkable thing about him is how utterly unremarkable he is. Oh yeah, he's also armed with what's got to be one of the biggest character plot device gimmick ever - his ""stand still"" syndrome, which I nearly forgot about due to the overpowering blandness of his personality. As for Mizuho, note that the second half of the opening credits of ""Onegai Teacher"" mostly consist of her in various cute poses as though she's modelling for some ""Monthly Moe"" magazine... and that pretty much sums up what she does for most of the show neatly - even her voice sounds like that of a pr0n star. 
 
At the other end of the spectrum, we have the ship constrol system with an overdeveloped personality. The ship control system actually has a physical form - it's an obnoxious little... thing (for lack of a better word) called Maria. Despite just being a ship control system, it's been given a personality that, amongst other things, has a tendency to meddle in people's lives... presumably so that it can give the story a convenient push in the right direction when it needs it. It's probably meant to be a amusing, cute little mascot, but as you may have guessed already, I found it to be an annoying little sh*t instead. 
 
The only character that I kinda liked is Herikawa, whose personality seems genuine enough that I was able to sympathise with her problems. I found out later that she is voiced by my favourite voice actress, so that might have something to do with it. Another character worth mentioning is only worth mentioning for being outstandingly annoying - it's that ultra cliched girl with the monotonous voice. I honestly don't see the point in those type of characters, and I can't even begin to describe how that flat, emotionless voice grated on my nerves.  
 
Good characterisation are often backed up good script. The reverse is also true. The piss poor characters of ""Onegai Teacher"" is underlined by its corny, lathargically repetitive script. In addition to having one of the lamest catch phrases ever - ""It's top priority!"" or ""It's very important"" depending on the translation (and it's one that doesn't improve with highly repetitive use either) - half the dialogues seem to involve calling Kei an idiot in one way or another. Most of the character's own monologues also involve calling Kei an idiot. OK! OK! I get it already - Kei's an idiot... I could have told you that from about 2 min into the first episode! Also, about half the epsiodes seems to end with our ""hero"" saying things along the lines of ""It finally feels like the teacher and I are moving on!"" Well, they seem to have trouble moving on from the same two lines in the script, let alone anything else! 
 
The one good aspect of ""Onegai Teacher"" is the music. Even though I didn't think the opening theme was all that, the rest of the music is several leagues above the story content in terms of quality. There's not much to complain about the animation either, though Mizuho's hair colour stands out in a bad way for being pink/purple. All these matters little though, as the story and the characters are what makes ""Onegai Teacher"" an unsalvageable wreck.  
 
Ultimately, ""Onegai Teacher"" is as bad, if not worse, than its title and synoposis suggest. It's an abomination of a romantic comedy where the attempted romance drama fails miserably thanks to its ludicrous story, and where the comedy is as lame as a legless camel (I suppose you could argue that's gone beyond lame, but lets not be too pedantic). Still, I can't deny that I laughed quite a lot - not with it, but at it, because it's one of those shows that's so bad it's actually really, really funny. 
 
One thing that does surprise me about ""Onegai Teacher"" though, is that it doesn't contain any obvious fanservice despite the nature of its premises. But if you're disappointed to hear that, don't worry - there's an OVA episode that makes up for this oversight... but that's another review for another day. 


          
 
       Helpful Onegai Teacher is an alright show with some interesting ideas and some good characters, but it's wrapped in a completely ridiculous scenario. 
 
The premise behind the events in Onegai Teacher is pretty absurd.  Oh, the alien side of things is OK, if fairly standard. There's nothing much to either endorse or complain about that.  But I could not suspend my disbelief for any decent amount of time over Kei's illness, it was just soo silly.  I don't like the 'mystery illness' plot device as a whole because it always seems so very contrived, and Kei's illness has convenience and contrivity coming out the wahzoo.  Even though we get a faily bare bones explanation of what the disease is, what sort of stress brings on a standstill is applied pretty inconsistantly. 
 
Fourtunately the show sidelines the illness for the first half of the show and concentrates on the characters.  Aside from episode 4 being oh so very convenient, this part of the show is alright.  But when we get to the reason behind the illness, it's difficult to take seriously.  The conclusion to this is done via the introduction of a new character we only saw previously in a couple 1 second flashbacks.  Because we know so little about this character and the relationship between Kei, this part of the plot loses a lot of impact.  However, that part of the story does have a sound basis so it's not too bad.  If the illness itself wasn't so absurd that part of the story would have been much better. 
 
Where the show does shine is the characters.  The relationship between Kei and Mizuho starts off quite timidly and grows at a steady pace, and even though the Hyosuke and Kaede thing comes out of nowhere the show runs with it and makes does a good job of it.  The group of friends work quite well together.  The only characters that didn't come off well were Ichigo and Mahou.  Ichigo was just too flat and emotionless to be convincing, and I didn't like Mahou at all.  I assume she was supposed to be a character like Skuld from Oh! My Goddess, but instead of coming off as someone who adores her sister, she looks like a vindictive, possesive bitch. 
 
There's nothing much to say about the animation and artwork.  They both do their jobs well, if not standout.  Thought character designs do a good job of making each character look quite unique, and the artwork is quite colouful.  The music compliments the show, but it's pretty standard stuff.  The OP and ED are alright, but again, nothing particuarly great abou them. 
 
The dub work was good overall.  Bridget Hoffman does a fantasitic job as Mizuho Kazami, she portrays her timid earnestness very well.  Ichigo's voice was far too deadpan, even for her character and Kei did sound a little too weedy, but the others did a good job overall. 
 
The underpinnings of Onegai Teacher are too silly to take seriously, but it's got some good characters in it and some amusing jokes so it's not all bad.  More a reccomnedation for fans of the romance genre.

          
 
       Helpful Before I begin this review I’d like to thank Google for helping me find this show completely by accident (honestly though, I’d prefer it if you didn’t ask what I was really looking for). 
 
Onegai Teacher (or Please Teacher for the U.S release) is the logical conclusion of all the wet dream scenarios of lonely students who wanted to bone their teacher in high school and the producers who wanted to make a profit off of them. Since I, like possibly most of the people reading this was a lonely guy in high school that had no date this story concept immediately appealed to my sensibilities as a nerd. I watched it, yet I hated it. Publicly denounced it, yet continued to indulge in the guilty pleasure. This is probably the first bad review I’ve written where I’ve actually watched the anime from beginning to end. And why is that? Because this is the scariest fucking anime I have ever watched in my life. Allow me to explain 
 
The soon-to-be-victim in this tragic affair is Kei Kusanagi, an eighteen-year-old high school student who suffers from seizures that he calls “stand-stills” (yeah, they’re called seizures dude), wears glasses and has a pale complexion. So, basically the Anthony Michael Hall of high school characters, but of course his life is about to change. Enter Mizuho Kazami, who has a mysterious past but it is implied that she’s trying to leave behind her career in pornography where she had to take it from behind by two bald guys ten years her senior in order to pursue her dream of becoming a teacher. Oh yeah, she also lives right next door to Kei in his neighborhood and has the hots for him. Really? REALLY?? Really, really? Kei doesn’t even try to woo her besides help her move into her house. All he does that can even come close to a come on is that he trips and plants his head right into her cleavage, which from what I’ve read it is required by law to have at least one of these scenes in all harem or romance anime.  
 
So these two start holding hands and breathing on each other for the first few episodes which is pretty much the equivalent of them having hot Amish sex until they’re caught by Kei’s legal guardians. To cover up the fact that Mizuho is a cradle robber in return for making sure Kei gets an A in her class they decide that Kei and Mizuho need to get married. But, they have to keep it a secret to avoid a scandal. Oh boy, here comes the hijinks! The rest of the series is twelve episodes of giving the male viewers blue balls while they live vicariously through Kei the-MILF-Master Kusanagi.  
 
But, don’t be fooled because that is only half of the story. In fact, did you know that Mizuho is an alien? Yeah, that’s right, a fucking alien! No, I did not just make that up, nor did I pull some M. Night Shyamalan shit on you. It’s made clear pretty much from the beginning that Mizuho is in fact an alien and she wants Kei to stick every inch of his manhood into her hot reptilian vajayjay. It almost kind of makes sense, since the story takes place around the year 2011. What’s the shit that girls can’t get enough of in 2011? Twilight. Mizuho probably beamed that book up when she tried to study up on what human females find attractive and logically concluded that human males that look like Edward Cullen get massive pussy. It would also make sense that Mizuho would want to jump Kei’s bones because according to Twilight it’s perfectly acceptable to act like a total pedophile and bang a high school student because Kei is of course the most desirable male among the other students. She has been slowly seducing Kei throughout the series: wearing revealing outfits and squeezing her boobs together when the opportunity presents itself. All while wearing her fake human skin to attract unwitting human males. Why does she do all of this? Because her planet is dying. Yes, her being there to simply study the humans is a smoke-screen. In fact the only reason she is there is to breed with the humans on Earth in order to propagate her species. Though Kei even though he does know probably doesn’t mind the arrangement: He gets sex from an older woman who superficially anyway, looks smoking hot and cares about him. However, it’ll be pretty awkward when Mizuho and Kei have kids and he has to explain to the nurse at the hospital why they all look like human-xenomorph-hybrids. Along with the male killing ritual that's tradition on Mizuho's homeworld after she successfully conceives the children of her mate.  
 
In conclusion: worse Species remake EVER!

If that's what you're thinking then congratulations people you win.  
 
Kanako is attracted to the same sex, and hates the opposite sex so much, that whenever she comes in contact with boys, she breaks out in hives. Sound familiar (*cough *cough) Girls Bravo. Things are going well for Kanako, she's sharing a room in the dorm with the beautiful, strong Ryuken Ishima and the care taker of the dorms is this cute, young lady with cat ears, *note: I don't know if that cat ears are real or not, but who cares, sooo damn cute (≧∇≦) But the best of all is Mariya Shidou, a young first year girl with long blond hair and an infatuating smile, enough to make any man get a nose bleed or even Kanako for that manner. Beautiful, polite, intelligent, grandchild of the former school chairman, oh yeah there's just one other thing, she's a guy (≧∇≦)（⌒▽⌒)（　ﾟ Дﾟ)    (Ｔ▽Ｔ) 
 
Yep a dude, and Kanako may have incidentally stumbled upon that little secret, but Mariya will make sure her little secret doesn't get out. Will Kanako be able to survive? A maniacal cross-dressing mastermind , a rude maid, a strange out of this world creature living inside of a gym bag, and also the fact that Kanako gets a nosebleed every five minutes because of the drop-dead gorgeous women there. I guarantee, after watching this, you may just become a holic for Maria Holic. Need a tissue anyone?  

          
 
       Helpful Do you think Catholic schoolgirl yuri is dumb and completely unbelievable? 
 
Do you think the premise of a guy convincingly crossdressing as a girl to satisfy some ridiculous pact at an exclusive private academy is dumb and completely unbelievable? 
 
Do you think massive nosebleeds are dumb and completely unbelievable? 
 
That pretty much sums up the series, and its sequel.  
 
Kanako is a lesbian schoolgirl who goes to the same all girls' private school where her parents met (worse than it sounds) to meet her true love and instead of indulging her depraved fantasies is sidelined by hot trap Mariya and her maid, Matsurika. Mariya correctly ascertains that Kanako is a threat to the school, herself, and humanity and makes it one of her goals to utterly shut her down before she harms the innocent. 
 
The anime lampoons the Catholic yuri genre (how the writers have no idea what Catholicism is), hot traps (yes there is a pact or something but really Mariya just crossdresses because he and the audience like it), and the entire nosebleed/accidental pervert genre. 
 
Animation, voice acting--especially during the particularly manic scenes, soundtrack, and character design are all top notch. The show tends to get bogged down only when it tries to give us some exposition and background into some of the girls at the academy. The best parts are where Mariya, oddly the straight man here, plays her sadism off of Kanako's idiocy with the help of her stoic maid. The nosebleeds are played straight, with Kanako often at a huge risk of bleeding out, and pretty much every relationship trope is shot down and the show even comments at how stupid each one is. 
 
Also one of the priests is essentially Gintoki with red hair. 
 
If you like Manzai series, Shaft, hot traps, and really really are sick of schoolgirl yuri you're probably really going to enjoy this. It's also aged really well over the years.

Within those different ways, though, there comes the fragmented short stories carried by different characters whose one thing in common is they all happen to be pursuing education under the same roof. Admittedly, the whole thing may seem sappy at first glance but with excellent execution, the saccharine could become something genuinely sweet-- and Tsurezure Children did just that. 
 
It is difficult to pick the best pairing out of the bunch because each pairing is relatable in their own way. However, Gouda-Kamine pair does manage to be the most grounded and realistic because it deals more into what happens after the classic love confession. Chiaki-Kana pair is totally represents that hilarious phase in life on which no matter what one does, friendship can truly ruin the possibility of romance. Takao-Chiyo pair is probably the most adorable as the two of them navigate the life irony of which ""what is unlikely is not necessarily impossible"". Nonetheless, there are pairs that, unfortunately, do not deliver the equally satisfying sweetness. Takano-Sugawara pair takes more screen time than other pairs but somehow their stories ultimately feel more anticlimactic. Kaga-Nanase storyline feels exciting yet it ends very abruptly. Lastly, there is that Casanova named Katori who, as more episodes roll in, feels like he has overstayed his welcome. 
 
Is Tsurezure Children a good fixture? Yes. However, the fragmented structures may not be for everyone. Like a double-edged sword, the more we as the audience invest ourselves into one of the pairings, the more we crave for longer screen time for our favorites. Funny enough, this anime truly captures the reality-- that sparks always fly all too fast and that more romance always requires more time.

       Helpful This is a solid, romcom show. 
 
It's certainly not your normal, slow romcom. In fact it flips many of the common tropes on it's head. Slow development? Nu uh, how bout they're all mostly in relationships already. Holding hands??? Well yeah, but how about kissing too!!! This show is cute, funny, has great pacing. Tons of cute couples and couple hopefuls. My details are a little fuzzy so I'm being vague. As I remember it's about multiple couples who are loosely tied together one way or another. Most scenes only featuring one or two couples at a time. A loose thread holding the show together is good enough though as the characters really do carry the show on their own. I feel like i didn't enjoy this show as much as some people, it's probably deserving of an 8. To me it's a passable show with many tropes turned on their head. It's sweet, short, and the ending is cute. The manga is probably recommended as it's longer and complete, but this show does what it wants to accomplish, and does it well. Fully recommend for romcom and slice of life lovers!

          
 
       Helpful Was watching this while each episode came out each week. I ended up forgetting about it and just now finished it.  
 
But this was a fun show that has some pretty awesome moments in it. Such as one of the characters sister being messed around with by the girlfriend. 
 
While i do enjoy this and it's fun . The issue i have with it is two things. 
 
1. The story doesn't have an actual ending for a lot of the characters. Such as the Student Council President and the Delinquent and more.  
 
2. While it isn't really bad. It can be annoying how its not just one story in a row. We get one story chopped up into pieces over multiple episodes. This can be alright but for me i just wish we could watch all of one duo's story with it not being over the span of 12 episodes.  
 
The show also has in my opinion two of the greatest couples in anime of 2017 
AkagixRyouko and TakanoxTakurou  
 
I really love these two groups. I would honestly love to see AkagixRyouko have their own story. They are really good on screen and funny. The other Duo is also pretty good. I don't know if they could do their own story by them self. 
 
Really good story and is fun to just watch.

Many years later, when they are both adults, the princess is magically transformed into a human and sets out to find her love. But the local wizard believes her to be a vampire, and banishes Xu-Xian from the village in order to save him. Xu-Xian's pet pandas Panda and Mimi set out to save him and bring him, in the process becoming leaders of an animal gang. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Romance']","Xu-Xian, a young boy, once owned a pet snake in West Lake until his parents forced him to give her up. Years pass and during a violent storm, the snake magically transforms into the beautiful princess Bai-Niang. Bai-Niang finds Xu-Xian, but the lovers are separated by a local monk, Fa-Hai, who believes that Bai-Niang is an evil spirit. Xu-Xian's two panda pets, Panda and Mimi, try to find Xu-Xian. In the end, Bai-Niang gives up her magical powers and remains in human form to prove that her love for Xu-Xian is genuine.
","白蛇伝 - Hakujaden is based on a great folktale of ancient China called ""白蛇傳- Bái Shé Zhuàn"". The ""Legend of the White Snake"" is quite old, but also very popular, with countless versions in folklore, literature and drama. The version chosen for the anime adaptation is beautifully romanticized and provided with some additional characters. A fairy tale about a snake spirit who falls in love with a human. 
 
Story: legendary, nicely romanticized, but deviant from the original (6/10) 
The original version of the legend has literary significance, is considered as one of the four great Chinese folktales and is a lot older than the available written text from the Ming Dynasty. It was first performed orally as an opera. It was about a man-eating demon fought by Buddhist and Taoist priests. However, this legend has changed dramatically since its beginnings. In the course of time, the demon became more representative and sympathetic, transforming itself into a snake goddess and her quest for love in the spirit of the times. Political interpretations are also common but that is another story. Furthermore, the legend is a historical sentence for the Chinese with reference to the idyllic West Lake (西湖) and the beautiful, well known Leifeng Pagoda (雷峰塔) at Hangzhou (杭州). Despite its considerable age, it is a beautiful fairy tale (in this version) about a monk Fǎ Hǎi (法海) in ancient China trying to prevent the love between the man Xǔ Xiān (许仙) and the beautiful immortal snake goddess. The superficial moral of the fairy tale can be interpreted in such a way that everything can grow and change and love can overcome everything. It may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but the way the story is told and the content is immediately reminiscent of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and that is not as far-fetched as it seems at first glance. Xǔ Xiān and the Snake Ghost Princess fall in love like Romeo and Juliet and have to face the challenge of having the courage to face the displeasure of their different worlds. It is up to them to master the greatest challenge and prove that their love is nevertheless faithful and enduring. A closer look at the fairy tale unfolds that the story reflects the major philosophical influences rooted in many different aspects of Chinese culture, the Daoist theme of immortality on the one hand and Confucian and Buddhist influences on the other. 
 
Characters: MC simple, the animals catch the eye as well as steal the show from MC (5/10) 
The main characters are a bit simple but it is quite possible that Uehara, Shin and Yabushita, Taiji have tried to prevent a further alteration of the main characters of the original legend by adding more characters. Although the main characters are very lovable, their development is determined only by the basic feeling of love. Unfortunately, they are therefore destined to remain somewhat obscure and abstract. The side characters, especially the cute animals, literally steal the show from the main characters. Let's look at the characters in detail. 
 
*The description of the characters may include spoilers, so check out the anime first.* 
 
Lady White 
The White Snake (Goddess) transformed herself  into a very beautiful girl named Bái Shé Zhuàn to visit the West lake of Hang Zhou and is attracted by the beauty of the scene. Lady White immediately fell in love with a human being (Story briefly). Her character is very interesting because she is portrayed as emotionally strong, with a deep willingness to fight for her love. Even if it is a variation of the original legend, the depiction of her character development on this basis would have been very nice to see, and also a little sensation, because it would have been about the depiction of a very emancipated young woman (remember: 1958). That's why I find it a pity that so much potential for character development has been given to the characters of the animals, who are all busy maintaining the relationship between their owners. But on the other hand, that's the reason why the side characters are especially cute. 
Xǔ Xiān 
His character is also interesting, but not because he is very strong. On the contrary, he is portrayed as  good-nature but rather weakly, and not just since the anime. In the story, the ""evil"" monk encourages him to give his wife something to drink. The monk has the ulterior motive of revealing the true nature of the goddess as a snake. The man is described as easy to persuade and unstable, a man in the broadest sense, but not very masculine. 
Xiǎo Qīng (小青) 
She used a trick so that Xǔ Xiān and Bái Shé Zhuàn could meet and fall in love. Her character is best described as beautiful, smart and loyal. In addition, her character is a historically anchored figure and was already present before the anime version. The character was added to the original legend a long time ago, but is already an integral part of it. A version of the legend says that Lady White bought a snake from captivity and thus saved it from being eaten. The rescued snake also turned into a woman, Xiǎo Qīng. Thankful for her rescue she decided to serve Lady White in the future. Their relationship is aptly described in the anime as very trustily, like sisters. 
Monk 
Fǎ Hǎi the Buddhist monk, has also undergone a fundamental change, like the demon of the original legend. In the original version he was in the fight between good and evil, meanwhile he has to take on the role of the bad guy. But he plays his part pretty well, I think. His motivation varies depending on the version. In the more rare version he wants to protect the man from what the snake goddess conceals. In the more common version he is just jealous of Lady White's abilities and wants to harm her. 
The animals 
The most challenging plot points are highlighted positively and understandable by the animal side characters. The little Panda (Ailurus fulgens) and the bigger Panda are very cute and with more screen time and adventure their characters are more detailed than the main characters. As mentioned above, this is a bit sad. 
 
*Spoiler alert end* 
 
Visuals: well done for the first Japanese full colour film (7/10) 
The animation is well done, although at the beginning it looks like a silhouette animation (about the first four minutes). Later on you will see that a lot of effort has been put into creating lively characters that move smoothly. The Toei animation film looks really good for its age and the colours are beautiful and rich. Please remember that this is the first Japanese full color animation film to be released in America, and despite the turbulence of that time, it was created as a classic children's story. The characters actually have an Asian appearance. Even Miyazaki, Hayao, wrote in an essay in 1979 that he was inspired by Hakujaden and decided to become a manga-ka. The style is quickly reminiscent of Disney, especially Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, but at that time the animation industry in Japan was mainly influenced by Disney. It took until the early 1960s, when Tezuka Osamu entered the animation industry by founding the production company Mushi Productions as a rival to Toei Animation. He was already famous, invented the ""Large Eyes""style and is known for his imaginative stories and characteristic adaptations of the unmistakable Western European ""look"" of Japanese animation. To cut a long story short, the animation is probably not what you would expect at first when you think of anime, but nevertheless the movie is very well done for this time. 
 
Sounds: BGM well done & fitting, VA remarkable (7/10) 
The BGM was composed by Kinoshita, Chuji and underlines the scenario very well. It almost feels like the show is accompanied by a good musical. Although there are not so many dialogues and the Japanese dubbing is only mono, and therefore difficult to understand from time to time, it is remarkable but not really surprising that there were only two speakers: Miyagi, Mariko and Morishige, Hisaya, so that all the characters are literally spoken by one woman and one man. 
 
Hakujaden is legendary and deserves respect because, on the one hand, it is an important part of animation history and should therefore be seen in the historical context of its time. The decision to use a legendary Chinese folktale as a concept for an anime can certainly be seen as a valuable contribution to reconciliation between the two countries. On the other hand, it has inspired many others. For me the show is funny, touching and beautiful and, as an Anime Fan it doesn't hurt to be interested in the beginning of Japanese animation history. Take a look - it's worth it. 
 
Thanks for reading and have fun watching! 


          
 
       Helpful If you are looking for a very old anime to watch for, let's say, a challenge or simply because you are curious, this is a very fine specimen. I t works too if you are looking for a movie to watch with a kid. It's a fairytale with an oriental setting instead of a European one. 
 
     First of all, I'd like to say don't panic. The movie starts with a song in shadow theatre style. It's only the opening of the movie giving the background of the story then comes the lovable old animation style. The story is that of a forbidden love between a human and a youkai. The world does not care about them and left them alone except for one annoying monk. The art is very beautiful. The animation is smooth. The colors are from dull. The music is a mix of traditional Chinese music and scores from black and white movies. The characters are lovable. The supporting characters are mainly animals and their action is found adorable, although ,personally, I liked watching the humans more.

       Helpful Hakujaden is an interesting case, the very first Japanese animated feature film in color and somewhat of a hallmark in Japanese animation. So much so that the thing that actually got me to watch it was it's being selected as the no.1 anime of all time by the anime magazine Animage. 
 
Dated is probably the best way I can describe the film, it has some quite wonderful, fluid animation, stunning even. Interesting use of colour, blurred objects in the foreground, and baring a few jaring cuts and character expression it looks simply great, often taking much from both traditional and modern art creating a unique aesthetic. The other aspects however lag behind significantly.  
 
It is an adaptation of an old Chinese legend merged with a book name of which I can't remember and as a result, the story comes of as rather basic. The characters act as is usual in a legend or a fairy tail of that period and that is to say that they lack said character, they simply move along with the plot as the plot moves along with them. The villain of the story is somewhat of an exception, as he really is only the assigned villain, never really operating from malice or any kind of evil intention, but rather trying to help our hero Xu-Xian with what he sees as a haunting and a problem, where a problem is really not. The story is told primarily through rather intrusive naration, detailing things we already know on several ocasions and in that sense again feels like a relic of it's time.  
 
The sound is all rather choppy and unclear due to the movie's age, and the voice acting ranges from passable to bizzare. Music however is quite nice, if not very memorable. 
 
With the main cast all being bland and uninteresting, genuinelly the most engaging characters are the animal comic relief, quite obviously inspired by disney. Their designs are great, their animation allows for a wide range of movements and unlike the main cast they exert at least a little character of their own. There is one genuinelly wonderful and entertaining fightscene where a tiny panda beats up a bunch of animals and becomes their leader, and the movie is worth a watch just for that, and as a case study to see how anime has developed.

6,12355,5,9.373379692,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki,"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student. As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family. 
 
Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society.  Wolf Children  is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Fantasy', 'Slice of Life']","In Tokyo, college student Hana falls in ""fairy tale"" love with an enigmatic man. The man reveals that he can transform into a wolf, and they later have two wolf/human children: A daughter named Yuki, and a son named Ame. Soon after, their father is killed in an accident while hunting food for the children.
Hana's life as a single mother is difficult; Yuki and Ame constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, get into fights, and Hana has to hide them from the world. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social workers concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and becomes friends with some of the locals.
One winter day, Ame almost drowns in a river after trying to hunt a kingfisher, but Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to let her go to school like other children. Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school. Meanwhile, Ame is more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.
In fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, Sōhei, who realizes something is strange about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets angry, transforms into a wolf, and inadvertently injures him, leaving a scar on his right ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, Sōhei tells them a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame. The two become friends.
Yuki and Ame fight over whether they are human or wolf, especially after Yuki forces Ame to start going back to school, to which he refuses. Two years later, a fierce storm gathers and Yuki's school is let out early. As Hana is about to leave to pick her up, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, so she follows him. The other children are picked up by their parents, leaving Yuki and Sōhei alone. Yuki shows Sōhei that she can transform into a wolf and it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.
As Hana searches for Ame, she slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father, who tells her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see Ame fully transform into an adult wolf and run into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.
One year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame's wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud to have raised them well.
","While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, bizarre as it may sound, of Christopher Nolan and his style of movie-making. You know, complex stories with multiple twists that try to intrigue you up until the end credits (and sometimes beyond). For the most part, they succeed, yet my problem  with his movies is a consistent lack of believable, living characters, all I see are puppets who are there for the sole purpose of letting the puppeteer tell his story. 
 
Well, Wolf Children is a complete opposite of Nolan's style. The story is very basic with but one unusual twist to it which is revealed even in the title. This anime, however, features a whole cast of characters who are practically leaping out of the screen. Some may consider it a flaw; personally, I don't require a sophisticated story to make the experience enjoyable for me. And, you know, since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies are considered classics despite having the most basic plots imaginable, I believe it's true for a lot of people.  
 
This anime is a perfect proof that sometimes you don't need to make up a story, you don't really need to force conflicts. There are even no antagonists here. What I consider this title to be is a genuine representation of life. And it is really all you need: life has conflicts, life is difficult as it is. You don't really need to invent anything else, you just have to make it feel real. 
 
This movie manages to do just that, in no small part thanks to its pacing. It has a very unique feeling to it, despite covering a big period of time, it still manages to take its time. There are a lot of still and slow scenes, sometimes silent or practically silent to allow the atmosphere really sink in. I tend to admire movies that successfully utilize this storytelling tool since it really shows the advantages of visual media. Yes, i am a confident proponent of the ""show, don't tell"" idea. 
 
Speaking of ""show"", the art was kind of a mixed bag for me. The movie looks a bit like a sketch, yet it stays consistent with its style. In the end, it doesn't come out as lazy artwork but instead as a choice to make the atmosphere soft. It took a bit for me to get used to it but it was never able to take me out of the experience. I guess that's just my personal attraction to detailed and perfect art instead of the hand-made feeling the creators are going for here. 
 
The music is often absent, it only comes in at truly dramatic moments to make sure they leave a desired impression. It's not used to reflect the characters' feelings, this title uses it only to supplement its narrative, not to replace it. For what it's worth, it's adequate. The voice acting was, again, adequate. Just your standard set of good actors doing a good job. 
 
Talking about characters themselves would mean spoiling the show, since its narrative mostly has to do with exploring their personality, so I'm not going to do this. I'm just going to say that they all feel like real alive people, and are very relatable; especially the mother, she is just all around a wonder of a human being.  
 
Overall, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, mostly because of its tone being not for everyone and the artistic choice but it's definitely great and one of my favorite anime movies from now on.

So... 
 
THE GOODS: 
I think the story was pretty good and fairly original. But it's not the story who had a big impact on me, it's the characters. 
I can't even describe how much I loved the characters, especially Hana. I honestly can't recall, except Nagisa from Clannad, a more pure character. Like she is such a nice and kind-hearted person that it melted my hearth. It was so so overwhelming that from time to time I started crying.  
And there are her children who have a spectacular evolution through the whole movie. 
The sound and the art were also pretty good. 
  
THE BADS: 
I honestly can't recall anything bad. You will enjoy it from start to finish. It may be a little slow from some, but I think it has a good pacing. 
 
I don't give it a 10/10 because it doesn't have that *spark* that made me gave other anime or movies a 10/10. 
It doesn't mean it isn't perfect how it is.

***SPOILERS*** 
 
 
The plot. It's about some vampire girl who is being hunted by some kind of organisation( wasn't really explained why, maybe because she's a vampire) and she wants to have kids from guy-protagonist ( isn't explained either why she wants it). 
 
In the beginning plot doesn't make any sense, actually the plot doesn't make any sense at all. I understand that it's pretty hard to explain a decent plot in 60 minutes. I mean they could at least try to do it, but they didn't. The plot has so many holes in it. As an example, It's like you are watching an anime from 10th episode and there is only one episode left. After you have watched last one, everything doesn't make any sense. I guess they tried to make something out of nothing. The story is really corny. 
 
Briefly, plot sucks. That's pretty much expected from short ovas. 
 
Animation and Sound were ok I suppose. Nothing really special. 
 
The plot didn't bother me as much as characters did. Oh man the characters. I'm talking  about the main two characters in particular. Worst characters I've ever seen. I really don't have the words to describe them. 
 
Actually, all my hatred is towards the male lead. I mean, when he meets this girl for the first time, she wants him to come  for a talk and then she basically says that she wants kids from him. And then he goes like ""Uhm.. okey let's do it'', excuse me WHAT???????? Are you shitting me? Who the fuck would accept that when he first meets a girl. He really stands out from all characters. The other characters were bad, half of characters didn't make any sense by this I mean their pressence in the story. The writers could as well not introduce the half of the characters. 
 
Conclusion. It's just simply terrible. Unless you want to see some naked tits or just willing to have another anime in your watched-list, dont watch it. If you're going to watch it, you will just completely waste your precious time.

6,586,7,8.829188396,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,"A collection of three classic Japanese horror stories: ""Yotsuya Kaidan"", the story of a wife betrayed by her husband who seeks vengeance even in death. ""Tenshu Monogatari"", the story of forbidden love between a goddess and a human, and ""Bakeneko"", the story of a mysterious cat monster with a vendetta against a certain family.  
","['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Fantasy']","
","When I started watching Ayakashi, I did not have any high hopes for it. Horror as a genre is not easy to pull off successfully. But Ayakashi was pretty good at what it does. It is not the kind of horror that scares you or disturbs you, but it does leave a strong impression on you. It is probably more reasonable to classsify it as an anthology of tragic dramas than a work of horror. All the stories are set in the classical Japanese period and they accurately portray the cruel and harsh conditions of that era. The horrifying elements are not that of the paranormal monsters but rather of the violence and cruelty that is part of the humans. 
 
The animation is pretty good, especially in the ""Bake Neko"" segment with some pretty unique artwork. The background score is pretty much on the mark, creating the appropriate atmosphere to complement the plot. ED track is among my favorites. I was instantly hooked the first time i heard it. The Characters are what make the story intriguing. It becomes all the more significant during the ""Bake Neko"" part which is more or less a whodunit thriller. Can't wait to check out ""Mononoke"" which is a spin-off from ""Bake Neko"" segment. 
 
If you are a fan of anime set in edo era, be sure to add Ayakashi to your collection. It is binge-worthy in my opinion. 
 


          
 
       Helpful It's difficult to provide a single rating, considering the series consists of three separate arcs of unrelated stories. They even have differences in their art style, making it even more difficult. So I'll just mention my opinion of each story below. 
 
 
The first arc, a famous revenge story named Yotsuya Kaidan, is my least favorite. I can say, however, that it is dramatic and that revenge is served in the end. It has an overall grim and depressing tone, and if you're not in the mood for that I would suggest you skip it. It's definitely horror to the core. 
 
 
The second arc is more of a tragic love story between a human and a spirit. This one is quite depressing as well, but it has moments of comedy thanks to a pair of side characters and there is more positivity in general. The art and colors are less grim than the first arc and is definitely an upgrade from the previous episodes. 
 
 
The third arc is most likely the reason people watch this series. The story about the bakeneko and medicine seller is a leap above and beyond the previous two. The artstyle and colorful decor and outfits more than make up for the darkness in the previous two stories. Not only that, but there is some mystery and tense dialogue that carries the episode along. The character and style proved popular enough to warrant an anime of its own called Mononoke. 
 
 
All in all it was entertaining enough, if only because it's different in content from most animated series I have seen so far.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
In this anime the story is based on three different short traditional folklore stories from Japan. They are mostly horror stories, however I would say the the last two ones were dealt more with mythical phenomenons and were not so scary. Specifically, it is not as scary as Japanese horror movies are a days. However it is kind of psychological and revolves around issues that have some kind of melancholy into them. It is definitely a very good way to learn about Japanese literature while getting entertained.  
Art:  
The art is not manga art actually. It resembles ukiyo-e, which is a type of traditional Japanese way of drawing. Nevertheless the last story has a different type of art and is a prequel to the anime Mononoke. The last stories art is more like manga art but it seems as if the surface in which it was drawn was some kind of wrinkled paper, I don't really know the reasons which the artists decided to make it seem that way but in my opinion it doesn't really look attractive that way, though the characters design was quite pretty. 
Sound: 
The sound was mostly Japanese traditional music which made the story more intense and interesting. On the other side I found the ending really nice, because it wasn't completely traditional music, it also seemed to have some elements of more modern music. 
Character: 
There wasn't any character development at all, but it seemed like at those times folklore legends/stories didn't really deal with character development (maybe there was some in the second story). Generally these types of stories concentrate more on the topic of revenge and hatred encountered in the plot. 
The characters were kind of similar between them, I must state that all the stories deal with women that have been deeply hurt because of some man, in one way or another. 
Enjoyment: 
Finally I found this show really enjoyable because I learned new things about Japanese culture and their traditional stories while I experienced some of the Japanese classic horror aura which made me think about how it evolved to Japanese modern horror encountered in movies such as Ringu or Hanako-san.

6,1142,8,8.566613605,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Hachimitsu to Clover II,"The sequel and final installment to the highly popular series once again delves into the life stories and love lives of Takemoto Yuuta, Mayama Takumi and Morita Shinobu. The story continues where the first season left off, after Takemoto's self-discovery journey around Japan. Of course, the love triangles and tribulations they face will continue, and eventually decide the paths to their future. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Josei', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Yūta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live in the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo. One day, they are introduced to Hagumi ""Hagu"" Hanamoto, the daughter of a cousin of Shūji Hanamoto, an art professor, who has come to live with Hanamoto and has become a first year art student at the art school that everyone attends. Yuta and Shinobu both fall in love with Hagu, but Yuta hides his feelings and tries to be a friend to Hagu while Shinobu expresses his love in ways that seem only to scare Hagu, such as calling her ""Mousey"" and constantly photographing her. Hagu herself, though initially timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up to the three.
The group comes to include Ayumi Yamada, a master of pottery who is well known by her nickname ""Tetsujin"" (Iron Lady), who becomes very close to Hagu. When not at school, she helps run the family liquor store. While Ayumi is popular with many young men, she falls in love with Takumi, who does not reciprocate her feelings and considers her a very dear friend. Instead, Takumi pursues an older woman, Rika Harada, a widowed friend of Professor Hanamoto who runs an architecture studio she founded with her late husband. The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about themselves.
","Ah, Umino Chika's masterpiece, Honey and Clover. I first saw this more or less two years ago, initially thinking it was just some generic romance anime. Needless to say, I suddenly fell in love with it from the moment in season one, episode two, near the ending, when Takemoto was carrying Morita on his back. Cue. The piano stopped. And right after that, he said, ""It hurts"". From that point on, I knew I was watching a different kind of anime. I guess remembering that random scene from an episode proves that it had an impact. 
 
Season one ended gracefully, you could accept it as ""ending"" and it can have a sequel as well. Either way, we've got a lot of questions left, like what happened to Mayama, Rika and Yamada, or is Shinobu really that much of an idiot that he couldn't fight for Hagu, as well as what would be Hagu's answer after ""I'm glad you're back"". I was literally jumping with joy when they decided to make another season. Everything was concluded at Honey and Clover II. 
 
These kinds of anime is the reason why I still love the medium animation. 
 
Color pastel-type work at its finest. They're at an art school, after all, so the art should be top-notch. JC Staff is enough said; almost anything they make delivers, and delivers well. I love how they abused the blurry, almost-dreamy look of the show. Some may find it a bit ""girly"", but, well, it fits the opus. It stays loyal to the manga's designs too. 
 
One of the BEST parts of watching Honey and Clover is listening to its wonderful, wonderful music. ""Dramatic"" and ""Waltz"" got us in season one, the piano renditions of the songs were especially amazing. Now we've got ""Fugainaya"" and ""Split"", which are really blessings to the human ear. I may be wrong, but almost every episode has a different insert song with it, which was brilliantly scored to match the scene it goes with. I especially liked the song at episode nine and the song playing on the last scene. Epic. 
 
The factor that propels Honey and Clover to its fame is its characters, and the story that they individually have, interconnected with each other. It's a story about growing up, maturity, and coming-of-age (jobs, decisions, etc) after all. Maybe it's my age, but I find its story stunningly touching and awe-inspiring. Before Honey and Clover, I thought most modern works lost the magic of storytelling. Characters were easy enough to identify with. Themes of unrequited love, talents, ties, lifelong goals, finding oneself, hardships and trials; they're all there, wonderfully packaged.  
 
Takemoto's still the unsure, melancholic character that he was at season one but you could see he's grown up a little and learned more about how life goes. He's the banner of H&C, he represents adolescence. Morita lost most of his eccentricity and we get to see the deeper side of him, as well as the people he's closest to. Yamada, well, is Yamada, still with her unrequited love, but of course, with a twist at season two. We get to see more of Rika, Professor Hanamoto, and Mayama. But, definitely, Hagu's part on the succeeding story is probably the biggest plot point of Honey and Clover II. 
 
What really makes this a modern gem is the way it was presented; it was music, characters, and story weaving in and out of each other in perfect harmony. At times I really find myself asking why is aging this bittersweet. Honey and Clover II is the right way to end the nostalgic series, and if you want to watch something that isn't flooded with moe, giant breasts or extreme harem, and instead want to see something of a mature slice-of-life anime, see this. 
 
One thing's for sure. It did have meaning.

Title: Honey and Clover II 
 
Anime: Honey and Clover II was once again produced by JC Staff (famous for their work on Revolutionary Girl Utena and Excel Saga), and directed by Tatsuyuki Nagain (famous for his work on My-HiME and iDOLM@STER XENOGLOSSIA) this time around.  It aired on Japanese TV from June 29th to September 14th, 2006.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside. 
 
Story: Honey and Clover II picks up where Honey and Clover left off, and finishes up the remaining manga material. 
 
I like this follow-up.  It answers questions it left unanswered last season, and resolves all the relationships that were left hanging at the end of last season.  And there are some absolutely heart-breaking scenes in here. 
 
Something just seems to be missing here, though.  I just can't really put my finger on it.  I think it has something to do with the mood -- it seems less centered around the realism than it was last season.  Not that it's not realistic, because it still is, but... I don't know how to explain it. 
 
It's good and all, but it's just not the same as it was last season.  Probably comes with the director change. 
 
Art: Just as beautiful as it was last season, though it seems that they used brighter colors than they did last season than some of the more muted colors that they tended to use.   
 
Music: There's another piano version of either the OP or ED that plays a lot and is really beautiful.  Background music is about the same as last season. 
 
The insert music is still done by the same artists, from what I can hear, and still appropriately fitting. 
 
The OP is still done by the same wailing banshee lady, but the animation for it is pretty neat again.  The ED's not all that remarkable, again, but I can live with it. 
 
Seiyuu: All the same actors as last season, except for the twelfth and final episode, where Kenji Nojima replaces Hiroshi Kamiya as Takemoto's VA, due to an accident that the latter had that rendered him unable to record the episode; Nojima does a pretty good job of staying as close to Kamiya's performance as possible, but you can tell that it's not Kamiya.  Good performances though, as always. 
 
Length: Twelve episodes was the perfect length to take care of everything they left untouched last season, I think.  Any longer, and it would've started to drag a bit. 
 
Overall: A good follow-up to last season, but it's just not the same.  If you want to find out how everything eventually resolves, then definitely watch it.  Just be aware that it might not be quite the same impact as the first season made on you.

       Helpful My first time writing a review, I stumble upon this anime while searching old anime since I thought that, most current anime are mostly fanservice. 
 
Excluding the actual story, it have a totally (even though not direct) Life Lesson specially for those who are currently in a existencialism (did I spell that right?) crisis. 
Since it is a sequel I was actualy expecting something more like Season 1 but I was wrong and totally shocked me. 
 
Story 10/10 
It's ok to judge me since I started watching anime at about 2010 so I was already used to action animes and fantasy genre, though I've watched a few normal one but this is currently one of the most wonderful story I have known this date. 
 
Art 9/10 
I can't actually put it into words but, I think it's pretty smooth or something near that word. 
 
Sound 9/10 
Honestly, most of the male voiced song that I heard this past few years was alright, thought not really that much touching, except for this, even though I can't understand the language, without reading the subs it sounded wonderful to the ears and heart.

Iku loves her big brother and wanted them to stay together, so Iku is willing to anything to keep them together. But Yori wanted to have Iku as a lover, not as a sister loyal to her twin. ","['Romance', 'Shoujo']","Twin siblings, brother Yori Yuki and sister Iku Yuki, had been extremely close since childhood. However, Yori's feelings toward Iku were more than innocent affection, and only grew stronger over time. Ashamed, Yori distances himself from Iku by pursuing a relationship with Iku's friend Tomoka Kusunoki and plans to transfer to an out-of-town high school. This does nothing to help him forget his lust for his sister, and when the twins get into a fight, Yori confesses his love to Iku. She initially rejects his advances, but fearing rejection may drive him away, she reluctantly kisses him. Yori tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him, and over the next several days, they try to begin a more intimate relationship, hidden from their parents.
Iku is torn between guilt at committing incest and her desire to remain together with Yori. However, when she discovers both Yori's relationship with Tomoka and his plans to leave, Iku realizes that she has fallen in love with him. She confesses to Yori, who accepts her feelings, breaking off his relationship with Tomoka. The twins then enter into a sexual relationship, and Yori is torn between elation and guilt. He maintains his plans to transfer to a different school, as he believes staying would prevent the two from acting like a normal couple. He suggests to Iku that they could keep their relationship if they lived somewhere no one knew them. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch.
Yori arrives at his new high school, while Iku begins living under the care of Yori's friend Haruka Yano and attending classes at a different school. Haruka is aware of their relationship and helps them meet in secret, but also begins to fall in love with Iku. When Haruka ultimately confesses to Iku, though, she rejects him. Tomoka is also enrolled at Yori's new school and tries to reinitiate their relationship, but he rejects her. Consequently, Tomoka plans her revenge against Yori. She attempts to get the twins caught visiting each other, and to blackmail Yori into sleeping with her. Although her attempts fail, she continues to plot against them, culminating in an attempt to have Iku raped by a group of classmates. In the process, Iku's visits are revealed, causing Yori to be expelled.
Yori transfers into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo Azusa, the daughter of one of their parents' friends, Dr. Yuugo Mori. She resembles Yori more than Iku, and when her father invites the Yuki family over to his house, Yori begins to suspect that Dr. Yuugo may have had an affair with his mother. Dr. Yuugo soon confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly confirms his suspicions with a DNA test. When confronted, the twins' mother admits to knowing that Yori is Yuugo's son, having kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Suspecting that Iku was adopted, and therefore not biologically related to him, Yori then reveals their relationship. Their mother insists that they are in fact siblings, and eventually reveals that they are in fact half-twins, the result of heteropaternal superfecundation. Iku is the daughter of her husband, while Yori the son of Yuugo Mori.
To avoid being separated, Yori and Iku run away from home with Haruka's help. While in hiding, Yori finally chooses to end their relationship and reconcile with their parents. He ultimately leaves the family to go somewhere he can never be found, hoping that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Iku falls into a deep depression and resolves to find him again, no matter how long it takes. Ten years later, Iku is a sales representative for a company owned by Haruka, from whom she has rejected several marriage proposals. During a trip to England, she encounters Yori once again; when they recognize each other, they embrace, and Yori asserts that he is still in love with Iku.
","Okay, before I start, I stopped mid-way between it. I couldn't watch it anymore, it just got weird and I couldn't lock my doors... so if someone walked in, that would of been the most embarrassing moment of my life. So, I watched about 20-30 minutes of it, and for what I've seen, It's uh... kinda weird. 
 
Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru follows the story of a teenage boy named Yori, about 18 years old who is in love with his younger twin sister. Sounds weird, right? But, it doesn't stop there. His relationship with Yuki was much better when they were children, but it has gone colder since he has grown up. Therefore, I don't know he decides he wants to make his sister feel better. Does, uh... inappropriate stuff with her. 
 
The animation is pretty standard. It was made in 2005, so I don't blame the animation. It's pretty decent for such an old OVA anime whatever it is, but, yeah other than that the animation's great. 
 
The music, I haven't heard much of it, but from what I've heard it sounds pretty good. Most of the music is emotional, since this guy is trying to have sex with his sister or something like that, he also makes out with his sister, I don't really get that, but, hey, it's an anime. But, all incest aside, the music is great. 
 
Haven't seen every character, but they seem fine. Yuki is a girl who is aside the incest thing at the start, but then she just gets into it for some reason. Yori is another guy who also has very inappropriate feelings for his sister and kind of admits his feelings. The characters are very developed, I think, but I've only watched 30 minutes, I dropped it at that point. 
 
I was actually quite enjoying this anime, or OVA at the start, the story was quite developed and everything seemed fine. But, when Yori decided he wanted to have sex with his sister, I was like, ""NOPE. FUCK THAT SHIT, SOMEONE MIGHT WALK IN.""  But other than that, I would of watched the rest of it, but... as I stated above I cannot lock my doors. And live with my family. Because, I'm not old enough to move out yet, and I'm still in school. 
 
This I'm giving a 6 overall rating, above average considering the story was quite interesting at the start, but I had to drop the anime when Yori decided he wanted to have sex with Yuki. Just... can't deal with that in a house full of 14 people.

          
 
       Helpful 'Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru - I'm in love with my little sister' is a very serious and dramatic anime. In fact it doesn't even behave like an anime. There's no overly ecstatic or some other anime-resembling intro. No slapstick comedy, no weird over the top situations. Everything here is taken absolutely seriously. Think Koi Kaze, but with more drama.  
 
It's hard to believe how well this anime does at conveying the feelings of the characters to the viewers, considering we're only given a single 49 minute OVA episode. I'll remind you - this is NOT a movie.  
 
The story revolves around twins of opposite sex, Yori and Iku. In their youth they're very attached to each other and every moment is blissful and full of joy. As time passes by however they grow distant, especially Yori. The reason behind that is more complex than it first appears to be for yori is in fact in love with his twin sister. The story shows us how both characters try to cope with the realities of life and the difficulties sibling couples face every day. 
 
The setting is as realistic as it can only get. The characters attend a highschool, live in a middle class familly somewhere in the suburbs of a large city. The realism of the setting and the believable plot and how the writers and artists worked together to combine the two is trully remarkable. 
 
Even though this anime is focused on an incestual relationship, there's no sign of lust in the male protagonist and you won't really feel weird watching this. This is a story about a man who genuinely loves his sister and his devotion and respect for her are staggering. In other words, it's not like Yosuga No Sora or some other borderline hentai animes where the attraction was mostly sexual. Yori is a real man with rules and a clear sense of right and wrong. 
 
The sound is very appropriate for this kind of anime and my favourite - classical music. The opening with the violin theme simply took my heart. To say that I was overjoyed would be a tremendous understatement. Likewise the art is good and for an OVA, very well drawn. 
 
I don't really have any complaints in any department. Story, art, sound, characters etc. they were all very very good and I enjoyed this anime to such an extent that it will be going into my favourite anime list, which is in my forum signature. I really wanted to give this anime a rating of 10 straight away BUT a single 49 minute episode was not enough to make this as dramatical as it should have been. It somehow feels rushed and that prevented me from giving it the highest score possible.  
 
That said, I still consider 'Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru' to be nothing short of a masterpiece and I recommend this to everyone. Give yourself a treat and watch this anime. It'll stay with you forever.

          
 
       Helpful You might imagine that an anime dealing sympathetically with incest would be quite original, deeply psychological, an enthralling drama...this series isn't any of those things. It is a shallow, pandering heap of rubbish. The unhappy couple are a moody, selfish, unsympathetic wretch and a revoltingly twee, thoughtless moeblob. Cynically presenting these character qualities as a double sexual fantasy really gets up my nose. Sexual fantasy characters need not lack genuine good qualities, but a pair constructed without a single one are particularly irritating. Their incestuous passion is never explained and barely analysed, giving the story the depth of a puddle and reducing the characters to parts in a sexual machine. The plot and especially the dialogue barely ever rise above cliche and the animation is entirely unoriginal.

Based on the very popular manga by Etsumi HARUKI, it is about ten year old Chie, ""the most unfortunate girl in Japan"", who manages her family diner while her unemployed yakuza father and her mother are separated. This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy.  
 
The story is set in Osaka, which has a totally different culture from Tokyo. After the success of the movie, a TV series was made, and Takahata worked as the chief director. 
 
(Source: nausicaa.net)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Seinen']",none,"There are very few words needed to describe this movie. Let's say, it is a classic Takahata.  
 
Do not go in there expecting an emotionally heavy movie like 'Grave of the Fireflies' or even something fantastical like 'Tales of Princess Kaguya'. These movies were magnificent but you cannot compare them to Jarinko Chie because they aren't of the same genre and they aren't trying to achieve the same thing.  
 
'Chie' belongs to the same category as 'My Neighbours The Yamadas', meaning, for this genre, it is one of the best you can get out there. This movie is mature, it is deep but it is very well directed so that it is light and funny with just a pinch of drama. The story is simple and it is just as poignant as any other because that's a story which you believe, which you know can happen, which you know has happened. It is your average dysfunctional family, trying to get back together. This movie has characters who are real and believable and likable. They all have flaws and they all have their distinguished idiosyncrasies and they all come out as fully developed human beings which you can never get enough of.  
 
Sure, technical wise, it is nothing like 'Fireflies' but the style of the animation suits the mood of the story and the quality is actually pretty high. For the dub, the Japanese did a wonderful job but, and I'm gonna say this knowing that many might disagree or even be completely unaware of it, I believe the French dub is really good as well. Trust me, I'm a very demanding person when it comes to dubs and I must give credit where credit is due. The French dub was amazing. 
 
At the end of the day, 'Jarinko Chie' is just a pleasant story that you can watch over and over again because the characters are so true to themselves and you can easily relate to them. This was a movie of my childhood and shall forever remain my favourite from the master Takahata.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Slice of Life']",none,"This OVA completely stripped away everything unique and interesting about Di Gi Charat. Dejiko is no longer the cute, temperamental, sassy protagonist everyone grew to love. This series portrayed her as a cookie-cutter anime girl: Complacent, shy, easily embarrassed, who spends her days doing little more than hoping the guy she likes will notice her...nothing like her original personality at all.  
 
The plot was dull and uneventful. The art was lackluster compared the the original; even the colors were a lot duller.  I really don't understand why this was created, and I kind of wish it hadn't been. 

          
 
       Helpful I have absolutely no idea why does this even exist. It has barely anything to do with Di Gi Charat universe. It's not bad, but I think this should have been own anime in itself. But I guess nobody would care about it in that case. 
 
The story is incredibly average at best and very predictable. Yet, the pace is really good and it's pretty interesting how many things they were able to squeeze into two 24 minutes long episodes. And while I knew how the story would end, I will admit that I was at the edge of my seat at the end, which definitely delivered. 
 
When it comes to the characters - Dejiko was stripped of any personality she previously had and became a very flat character. It's hard to imagine that such a temperamental, assertive and over all not-to-be-screwed-with girl would turn into such a shy girl that only hopes that senpai will notice her. I am glad that at least Puchiko kept her sarcastic and sassy personality, which I loved. There is also a Rabi~en~Rose in few scenes, but she doesn't talk or interact with main characters in any way, but it was nice to see her. 
 
The art style is pretty cute, but veeery simple. It can't match the art style used in Di Gi Charat Nyo. Colors were not so vibrant and some things reminded me of original Di Gi Charat - especially the use of simple sketches in crowded scenes. 
 
So, nothing that special, really, I'm afraid. I am giving an extra point for absolutely amazing and catchy music, as is always the case with Di Gi Charat. And another extra point because I am currently in love, so it had a slightly bigger impact on me - reviews are subjective after all.

          
 
       Helpful ===Foreword=== 
As you might know, this is a spin-off from Di Gi Charat, which I have never seen or read about in any great detail, so there is some stuff on which I just can't comment or write enough detail about. 
 
===Animation=== 
Not the strong point. The colours are simple, without any gradients used. The backgrounds are simple as well, but nicely drawn. The character designs are quite simple too, but they are cute. The notable thing is that as soon as there many characters on scene, like crowds, they are just drawn plain white with black lines. Something that doesn't actually ruin the animation in any way, or doesn't annoy the person watching it. Running animation is I think one of the better points. Sometimes there is a chibi scene thrown in, but they are done fairly well and are not annoying in any way. Overall the animation is poor, but I don't think it's a factor that affects the overall rating by much, but I was expecting something more complex than this. 
 
===Sound=== 
This special features quite a nice OP and ED, and fairly good background music, which is a bit on the simple side. There is also a French song in the second episode, which is quite good as well. 
 
===Story=== 
Since this is only two episodes long you can't expect anything complicated. It's a simple story about a girl who meets a boy. An unexpected encounter which starts off everything, and a misunderstanding as well to create some drama. It's a rather light and sweet story. Considering the fact that they had only two episodes I think that it was done quite well, with a good conclusion. 
 
===Characters=== 
This is a section on which I won't be able to comment too much since I don't know what the characters were like in the original Di Gi Charat. Overall they were good. Though this special lacks characters, but what would you expect from a two minute special? We barely get to know the names of four characters, and the rest is there just for comic relief. Overall the characters are good, and some are cute as well, like Puchiko. :) 
 
===Enjoyment=== 
I enjoyed watching this, since it was nice to take a break from all the other serious anime around which fills my mind with questions and useless answers, and also had a laugh over some light comedy which fits in well. However don't watch this if you want to see something serious. Watch this if you want to take a break and need something light, then you'll see the hidden beauty of this...

6,32013,13,8.293529107,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Oshiete! Galko-chan,"At first glance, Galko, Otako, and Ojou are three high school girls who seem like they wouldn’t have anything to do with each other. Galko is a social butterfly with a reputation for being a party animal, even though she is actually innocent and good-hearted despite her appearance. Otako is a plain-looking girl with a sarcastic personality and a rabid love of manga. And Ojou is a wealthy young lady with excellent social graces, though she can be a bit absent-minded at times. Despite their differences, the three are best friends, and together they love to talk about various myths and ask candid questions about the female body. 
  
 Oshiete! Galko-chan  is a lighthearted and humorous look at three very different girls and their frank conversations about themselves and everyday life. No topic is too safe or too sensitive for them to joke about—even though every so often, Galko seems to get a bit embarrassed by their discussions! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']",none,"Girls talking about their bodies and it's has some comedic charm to it? 
 
Oshiete! Galko-chan is an anime short mainly about Galko voiced by Azumi Waki the gyaru, Otako voiced by Miyu Tomita the otaku and Ojou...the ojou voiced by Minami Takahashi and they for the most part get into conversations about their bodies. Oddly enough this actually works as the three main cast members of the gyaru, otaku and ojou have somewhat ""playing against the type"" sterotypes of their sterotypes. Galko is actually shy and gets nervous when talking about ecchi things, Otaku is actually very talkative and teases Galko ALOT with comedic misunderstandings and Ojou is rather aloof and most of the time comedically missing the point. 
 
The relationship between these three characters really do make this anime short worth it even beyond the vulgar girl talk. 
 
The other minor characters do get thier time in the limelight though they are primarily used with a punchline to Galko, Otako and Ojou's conversations at times. 
 
The comedy for this anime short comes from either extremely witty teasing humor between the characters or just vulgar talk with a good punchline by the end of the episode. 
 
The animation by studio feel, the character designs are decent enough though some of the clique characters do come off as slightly generic, there are a few ""unique"" character design choices, as for background is moderately ok. The animation isn't something to brag or talk about in detail, but overall the animation is managable and consistent with no blatant errors considering this is an anime short. 
 
The last episode however does bring in a VERY good theme of ""don't look at a book by it's cover"" and it's blatantly and cleverly shown through the interactions of Galko and Otako and brings this anime short from merely talking about girl's bodies and being ecchi and witty about it to talking about the stereotypical archetypes of anime and saying ""who cares about the stereotype?""...the anime characters can be something beyond just ""gyaru"", ""otaku"" or ""ojou"". (Note: LA isn't saying it's a HUGE revelation or taking huge steps to bring this theme into play, but it's subtle and somewhat low key in HOW they portray it). 
 
Oshiete! Galko-chan is one of the hidden gems of the Winter 2016 anime shorts (the best hidden anime short gem goes to Sekkou Boys by the way) and LA will say this like the theme of this anime short, ""don't look at a book by it's cover"", this anime short is NOT just about vulgar girl's bodies talk...it has something more, just...how about opening the book?

          
 
       Helpful I don't know how to write a review, so I'll jump right into it. Note that I use a weighted system, as follows: 
 
Story: x/10 * 2 
Characters: x/10 *2 
Visuals: x/10 * 1.5 
Enjoyment: x/10 * 1.5 
Sound: x/10 * 1 
Total: x/80 
 
Story - 4/10 * 2 = 8/20 
There's very little story to this. Most episodes revolve around some sort of rumor that is introduced at the beginning by the narrator. Later, there is an attempt at an actual story, but it is executed too late, and fails quite miserably.  
 
Characters - 3/10 * 2 = 6/20 
The characters are almost all extremely one-dimensional, except for Otako. Galko is defined by just two traits, her large breasts and her being a gyaru. Ojou is defined by her naivety and her implied wealth. Otako, however, is a bit different. Although Galko and Ojou simply accept the world around them, Otako questions her surroundings and fools around with Galko in an almost intellectual way. There are several minor characters that are introduced, and they're even more bland. They are often defined by not two, but just a single trait. Don't expect character development, the writers didn't think of that. 
 
Visuals - 4/10 * 1.5 = 6/15 
The visuals are, for the most part, not too bad. The backgrounds are occasionally bright cheerful colors, as is our protagonist's outfit and appearance. However, besides this, the visual quality is not very good. Characters are plagued by having QUALITY faces often, and there are many scenes where corners are cut in terms of visuals, with lips not moving with the chin, mouth covered by an object, and other things of that nature. This occurs in almost every anime, however, so there is a bit of slack for that. Character designs are average, with Galko obviously being the most thought-out character in terms of her appearance. Besides that, the characters are very indistinguishable. 
 
Sound - 4/10 * 1 = 4/10 
The sound is of average quality, by every meaning of the word. Nothing too bad or too good in this regard. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 * 1.5 = 12/15 
It's a funny show. I will give it that. The humor is very feminine, but despite that, I still managed to laugh, as it is a nice change of pace from regular comedies that cater to a predominantly male audience. The jokes are dirty to an extent, but at the end of the day it's nothing too spectacularly over-the-top. 
 
Overall: 36/80 = ~4.5(5)/10 
Watch it if you want to relax with a decent show that shows high school life from the perspectives of girls.

          
 
       Helpful When my sisters enter high school, there are things I'll want them to know, and there are anime I'll want them to watch. One of those is Madoka, because it's about giving yourself the power of happy endings. One of those is this show. 
 
The girls on this show talk about their bodies. They talk about it lewdly, naming specific parts, but also honestly and realistically, in a way I would expect from highschoolers. They don't have big sit-down speeches with older family members about periods; they talk about breast size and water physics. They don't make fun of the size of those breasts, either-- the girls only mention it in good fun, and the boys point out their differing body types without putting them down about it; the worst they say about any of them is that they simply aren't their type. 
 
These girls also break their archetypes. The ""party girl"" can be an utter otaku, the nerd can have fun teasing her friends, and the percieved airhead can have lots of hobbies. And, all of these girls can be friends without a clear explanation-- they're just in close proximity and get along, and that's how so many friendships start.

It is the beginning of a series of strange events, which involve him activating a giant mecha, the RahXephon and finding out that many people, including his own mother, has blue blood, and that he was actually living in a self-encased dimension where time moves slower than that of the outside world. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Psychological', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Ayato Kamina and his classmate Reika Mishima are in middle school and are a young couple, still dealing with some awkwardness. However, the sudden appearance of visitors from an alternate dimension, the ""Mu"", tears the two apart. All of Tokyo is enveloped in the giant hemispherical Absolute Barrier, which looks very similar to Jupiter, and they become separated into the world inside and the world outside.
Three years later, Ayato, who was left inside, has become a high school student. He has been taught that the world outside has been obliterated and feels as though his memories of Reika  are a distant vision.

In order to prevent this from happening, Haruka must kill Ayato, whom she has finally found once again. Will Haruka be able to tell him how she feels and save Ayato and the world?
","Ah, the Rahxephon movie. How much you get dismissed. 
A lot of things you might hear about the Rahxephon movie is how most of it is just copied and pasted from the series, how it's rushed and makes very little sense. This is true. BUT you need to take into consideration two things: this movie was not a theatrical release, but a made-for-TV special. Secondly, NHK demanded this movie from Bones with a ludicrous deadline that they barely completed as it is. So, with that in mind... 
I think, as a stand-alone ""movie"", it sucks. Which is no great surprise to anybody. I do, however, think it's a great supplement to the series. It's really best if you watch it DIRECTLY after seeing the last episode with no break in between. I find it's like End of Eva for me, in that it should theoretically be very confusing, but actually clears up a lot I didn't understand about the series' ending. 
The movie is technically an AU or re-telling, but even so it helps clarify the series' version rather than make a completely new and bizarre one. So, as long as you're talking about it as part of the series, I really don't think it's so bad.

          
 
       Helpful Somehow, after watching the movie, some things were more clear to me, but it wasn't enough. the movie isn't some other story as it should have been to my opinon, after watching what Bones did to eureka7 movie. 
The movie is like copy past of the series but with new scenes and make some thing more clear, the problem is, the series have many things to understande that building in each episode and episode, the movie didn't do something like this and just put a 26 episodes in one movie and skipping so much important things, changing characters and also deleting characters, it's not good, but it's not bad either. 
Still, it's still RahXephon... but not the RahXephon I loved so much, recommending watching the movie right after complete the anime, so you will understand much more. for me, I need another good watch on the TV-anime to clear some things, and... because the story I falled in loved in and like other psychological animes, I love rewatching.

          
 
       Helpful It's been a while since I watched this movie and my memory of it as a whole was not very special, its just that it's music is one of my most favorite. With that this review says it all. I re-watched the movie a few days ago...just to clarify myself about it and boy was I thrilled. 
 
The music was as I remembered...absolutely captivating! The movie as a whole was what would call a nice, good anime but with nothing out of the ordinary. The story was very confusing at times..indeed for those who haven't watched the anime series it can get very troublesome as they won't know which end's which. But it gets better eventually, though as the plot is so rushed you won't get any time to settle in. On the whole its plot needs the support of the movie to survive than the the other way round. 
 
Artwork was ..for it's time..nicely done..especially w.r.t Rahxephon. Again however the scenes are so rushed that you don't get to grasp the full meaning of each picture..for example the Dolems (giants) were given too inadequate a time compared to the anime series, they mentioned even briefly..you start to think them as side characters whereas in the anime they hold an almost pivotal position. 
 
Characters in the movie fared of better..at least select ones.. than most other aspects of it. In particular mental growth of the main characters is clearly visible. Here too though some mismanagement made it's way in for some characters who were proudly introduced but then conveniently ignored. 
This contributes to a lot of headache in understanding the story. 
 
In the end however, the soundtrack impressed me a lot..even if little else did. The music is absolutely fantastic..though it has only one real song. Then again you might expect at least this from an anime whose main theme is a musical world. The assertion that the movie was saved only thanks to its music would hardly be unfair. In particular a certain soundtrack in the middle of the movie almost made me cry. I would thus definitely recommend the movie to any lover of anime music, I can virtually guarantee that you won't be disappointed. 
 
In a sense a person can truly enjoy the movie only if he hasn't seen the anime first...otherwise the whole plot is spoiled. That's the way it worked for me.

Enjoyment - 10 
 
To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself! 
Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women? 
 
Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you!

          
 
       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.  
 
Art: 7 
I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.  
 
Sound: 8 
I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

One day, she plays the Kokkuri game by herself and summons the fox spirit Kokkuri-san who, upon seeing her unhealthy lifestyle, takes it upon himself to become her guardian and raise her properly. Thus starts Kohina's new life of being haunted by various unique spirits.
","Gugure Kokkuri-San is a very cute anime and I enjoyed it. This is a great show to watch on the weekend when you have not much else to do. The idea is interesting and the show is high up there on my favourites. 
 
Story: 6 It's not too special because there's nothing to be achieved or done. The first half of the show was very entertaining, but later on I became bored. The comedy aspect helps the show deliver a story and keep you content. 
 
Art: 10 The art style is great, not much else to say.  
 
Character: 10 Each character has their own powerful personality unique to him or her. The character designs suits each character well. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 The element this show plays on most is comedy and it excells at that. I didn't enjoy it as much on the second half, but I was content. Character communication is very entertaining. I wish some characters showed up more often however. 
 
Overall: 7 A show I am glad that I watched. 

          
 
       Helpful Gugure Kokkuri-San has come to an end. Another ending which make me feel ugh, what to watch again. Honestly this is the funniest anime to watch in 2014. This reminds me of barakemon and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun, those two anime shows were really great. I really like the voice actors typically Daisuke Ono, who voice of course Kokkuri and Sensei from Barakemon. 
 
 
So here are my results: 
 
Story: 8/10, I thought it might follow the plot story like Inugami running away from home and thought he will be search by the members on EP 10, but well he is completely ignored. Funny, it may contain mix up plots since it' published in Manga, so yeah.but still it's good to watch 
 
Art: 8/10, I have no comments on this, but good job on Kokkuri-San especially when she's a girl.  
 
Sound:9/10, The OP song was really catchy, I couldn't bear to skip it. The ED song to was really touching, that feel, you know. 
 
Character: 8/10, They are okay, I can say but what I wish is to see Kohina real emotions but nahh, she rather be a doll and eating cup noodles, I respect that, cause i eat cup noodles too 
 
Lastly enjoyment : 10/10, I say this is really a good anime to watch though it has mix plots and weird stuffs, but it's a good time to watch after doing some stressing works, yeah. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
 
This was a good anime to watch and I rank 2nd after Amagi brilliant park for this.  
I totally RECOMMEND all of you to watch this anime, not Amagi of course. 
 
 
I hear there's a special 5mins episode for this, hope it will be funnier! 
 
And hopefully there will be 2nd season, IF. 
 
Thanks! Peace

My overall rating for Ongaku Shoujo is 7/10. Is it good as a slice of life movie? Im not sure but its definitely a nice comedy.

          
 
       Helpful So I heard that an anime called Ongaku Shoujo was going to be made this year. Then I saw it was a 25-minute OVA before that, and I sat down to watch it. But I won't lie, this OVA is really bad. 
 
I mean, seriously. I've never seen something so absolutely insipid, vapid, and downright annoying. It's basically about two girls, a shy blue-haired girl and a perky blonde haired girl, who run into each other thanks to singing, decide to become idols, and a lot of drama happens. That's it. There's absolutely nothing about its storyline that makes any effort to stand out, it doesn't even try to make use of its potential or be interesting in any way. It's just a cookie cutter cutesy idol drama anime with no substance to it at all. Many anime I've seen that were similar to this one happened to pull off the premise much better, and the ham-fisted drama near the end really didn't endear me to it at all. It doesn't help that the characters are bland, empty, and have no substance to them at all, and their voice actresses overact to hell and back, and every single line that comes out of their mouth is hammy, screechy, high pitched, and downright grating on the ears, which is a shame because I know these actresses can put on MUCH better performances. 
 
Honestly, the only good thing about this OVA is the animation. It's bright and colorful, very stimulating to the eyes, and the character movement is very fluid, almost KyoAni-like in its smoothness. Unfortunately, that's where the OVA's good qualities end. 
 
But all of its flaws absolutely cannot compare to what I feel is the biggest detriment of this OVA: Haru. 
 
She alone basically ruined the entire OVA. Simply put, she is annoying as hell! Not only is her design really stupid-looking (Why does she have that big bow in her hair, along with all those other hair clips?! They're not necessary, and it looks way too tacky!), the show tries to present her as a fun, perky, enthusiastic, cheerful girl who wants to be friends with Eri, the blue haired girl, but the way the anime executes her overall character makes her come off as unrelentingly bratty, self-entitled, selfish, and almost creepily parasitic in her persistence in attaching herself to Eri in some of the worst, most dangerous ways possible. She's also a complete idiot who not only does stupid things, but never gets punished for them. For example, when she goes to school, she brings a cat with her, and the teacher doesn't even call her out on the fact that she brought a cat with her. Aren't cats not allowed on school property? She also has absolutely NO respect for privacy and boundaries whatsoever. She goes through Eri's belongings, goes after her in the hot springs, and worst of all, when Eri is struggling with reading a book out loud in class, what's Haru's solution? Why mess with her body without her consent and physically UNDO HER BRA RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! Oh, and at the end of the OVA, her solution to making Eri come up on stage is to put every embarrassing photo she took of her on display, on a big LCD screen, IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE AUDIENCE, EVEN NUDE PHOTOS, THEREBY HUMILIATING HER IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! 
 
You see what I'm getting at here? If someone did that to me, I'd report them for sexual harassment! But does Haru get in trouble for it? Nope! Well, to be fair, Eri does call out Haru on everything she's done, but it doesn't stick because it's all played for comedy, and Eri is meant to be seen as just a prude who won't accept Haru's so-called ""friendship."" Sakura, Eri's friend, is even worse in this regard because not only does she completely ignore Eri's discomfort and never makes any attempt to help, but outright encourages Haru's dangerous behavior! Seriously, if this were a horror or a Lifetime-drama movie, I'm pretty sure Haru's behavior would be presented in a much more dark and serious light, as it should be. But the anime doesn't realize the ramifications of Haru's actions and tries to make the audience see it as nothing but cute and endearing!...which it seriously isn't. At all. Honestly, I wanted to jump in there and save Eri from that parasitic little brat. She deserves better than to be their target. Also not helping matters is that Haru is extremely egotistical and self-entitled, convinced that she's hot stuff and is a great singer...when she actually sucks really bad at singing. Eri even tells her such. 
 
So...yeah. This OVA really could have been something good. Unfortunately, it's just not good. At all. This, my friends, is the prime example of how a really, really bad and badly written main character can completely ruin a show in its entirety. Thankfully, it seems like the creators realized this as well, since from what little they revealed recently, the upcoming TV series features a completely different storyline with a plethora of new characters, with Eri and Haru being just side characters now. I hope to God that the TV series doesn't make the same mistakes that this OVA did. Then again, Birdy The Mighty Decode turned a flawed OVA into a great TV series from what I've heard, so it can happen. 
 
But in the end, though, Ongaku Shoujo is utter crap, all because Haru's a little shit.

If you dislike Jun as a character, you will hate this. 
 
If you like Jun as a character, you should hate this. 
 
I enjoyed Happiness! a bit more than most people but it was a while before I watched this. I was always kind of interested in it as Jun was my favourite character so an episode focused around him sounded appealing. He's cute and unabashed and open about his dress habits and he's  queer as hell. He's a great character there really isn't much of in anime. So often traps and crossdressers will be reluctant or weirded out by their situation. But Jun is totally happy with it - he owns it. He knows he's cute and he has a thing for Yuma and he makes it obvious. That's why I loved him. 
 
When I envisioned this show I imagined they would run with how Jun had been established in Happiness! - he would be shocked at being a girl, maybe even horrified. As he had expressed basically no desire to be a woman, that'd have made sense to me. He was just happy as who he was.  
 
But what they decided to do was introduce an entirely new and out of nowhere character development - that all along Jun had wanted to be a girl. And that he's elated to become one in this story. This was annoying to me as it kind of undermined what made Jun appealing as a character in the series. But I'd have been willing to accept it had the tone of the episode, or the writing for that matter, actually reflected it. Instead the fact Jun wanted to be a woman is just a kind of throwaway gag. Sure it's a light hearted gag anime...but if that's the case...maybe don't throw in such a weighty topic? Maybe do what I had suggested and not have Jun's reactions be ""thank god I'm finally a woman!"" 
 
Let me say that I don't think the premise of this story is entirely worthless. I think it could have very easily been handled much better and in a less offensive way. The introduction of the fan club had me certain they'd recover the unpleasantness of this episode with an arc around self acceptance. Jun, in his new body, assures his upset looking fan club that things will proceed as normal. Surely they will seem sad at his change, I thought - surely this will lead to him, in the end, realising he doesn't and shouldn't need to change himself to find happiness?  
 
Nope. Just a throwaway visual gag about him smiling and that making them happy. No one tries to assure Jun he was fine the way he was. Nothing remotely close to that. 
 
The tone gets even more twisted; despite Jun's happiness, his classmates are now overcome with uncontrollable rapacious lust because he has become a real woman (despite not physically changing appearance wise)? And as a result he chooses to foresake his new sex. This is why I said at the start that if you can turn your brain off you might be able to like this. I can't - this is just a horrific piece of writing. Jun learns the lesson of it doesn't matter what you want, give it up because if you don't men will rape you. What? Enjoy watching the original series now knowing all the while Jun is actually utterly miserable because his body doesn't match his gender identity. Enjoy especially all the times Yuma is incredibly callous and insensitive to him! 
 
Getting away from the writing - production wise this is about on par with the original series. The animation is as sloppy but the sound is fairly nice with some tolerable background music. The editing is characteristically snappy and fast paced. 
 
Overall I can't recommend this to anyone, really. It's a rare example of an adjacent property making its source material actively worse. My opinion on the series Happiness! has diminished in light of this and I don't see myself rewatching it any time soon as a result. I'll try to forget this exists if I ever do rewatch.

In order to save his love, Rama goes to Lanka with the help of an army of monkeys and friends of the forest.

       Helpful In 1992, Japan and India were celebrating 40 years of strong diplomatic ties. A part of the celebration was this project. Which was worked on by Japanese & Indian animation studios alike and based off of the Hindu epic, Ramayana.  
 
I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with the epic. As such, I probably won't notice if the film gets some details wrong. You'll have to wait for the anime versions of The Iliad, Beowulf & Journey to the West to see me get into heavy scholarly detail about adaptation differences. 
 
Story:  
 
We open with a countryside being terrorised by demons. Or maybe they're just British imperials in funny outfits. In any case, a Hindu holy man beseeches Vishnu for guidance. A golden light tells him to go to Ayodhya and bring Prince Rama who can defeat the imperial demons. He does as he asks and Prince Rama handily saves the countryside and finds himself a pretty young bride, Sita, during the journey. Everything is looking up for him until his father sends him into exile to keep a promise and his wife is kidnapped by the demon Ravan.  
 
The biggest issue with the film's narrative is that scenes don't always flow smoothly. Take Sita's abduction for example. We see Rama chasing a demon disguised as a golden deer. He seems to barely move out of sight when he shoots it. We then watch his brother, Lakshman, get fooled by the demon faking his voice. So, he pours holy... salt around Sita to protect her. He leaves. Ravan disguises as a priest tricks her into crossing over the salt and has time to escape before they return. The point I'm making here is that, as presented, this sequence doesn't work. It looks like Rama should have enough time to return about five times, maybe six, before Sita is taken. There are other scenes like that too. Hanuman's trip to the Himalayas is really abrupt. 
 
It's also a bit weird that there's a musical interlude in the middle of the film where all we do is stare at a vacant screen. I don't mind them having musical numbers but at least give us something to look at while they play. But on the subject of musical numbers, Hanuman gets a kind of weak song where he repeats that he's Rama's emissary for around three minutes and it's just kind of a boring, overly repetitive number.  
 
That being said, the film is presented in a very old fashioned epic style that works pretty well. It comes complete with great, heroic deeds, imposing trials, fallen heroes and divine intervention. I'm not sure how accurate it is to the source material, but it does have that aesthetic and it is pretty interesting.  
 
Characters: 
 
I can't say the characters are very complex. Rama and his people are those kind of generic, heroic characters you get in these old epics. His villains are demons who are there more to be strong imposing threats than fleshed out characters but some still get sympathetic moments. Kumbakharna when greeting Hanuman being the big example.  
 
Art: 
 
The monster designs are pretty interesting and the action sequences flow pretty well. It is a little weird when they show Ravan flying a plane with a dragon motif or they show monkeys in mechanical siege towers. Somehow, I don't think that's fully accurate to the source material. And the ordinary human characters themselves don't have the most interesting designs. But I will credit the people who made this for picking an art style that does capture the feeling of an old epic.  
 
Sound: 
 
The voice work is fine. They got some pretty well known Bollywood actors like Arun Govil, Amrish Puri & Namrata Sawhney. Their performances are good but there's an unfortunate issue that crops up from time to time with the sound levels being mixed awkwardly. Which can result in a character's speaking volume changing quite drastically from one scene to another or the sound effects overpowering the voices.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Let the scenes breathe. Maybe this would result in a musical sequence or two having to be cut or just in a longer film, but it would help the pacing to have more build up in some key scenes.  
Give some visuals to go with your musical numbers. Maybe something as simple as Rama's army preparing. You could even get away with a slide show if you had strong enough stills but when you have a five minute musical number give us something.  
The sound mixing. I think the performances would come across as much better if not for the mixing problems and that would make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ramayana is not one of the best children's films out there but it still manages to be pretty solid. If I was watching this as a kid instead of as a cynical adult, I'd probably be absolutely riveted. Still, I'll give it a solid 7/10.

","STORY - 6 
 
The story is the same as the 12-episode anime's first episode, with minor differences in the script. It sets everything up very nicely. The ending of this version is much more dramatic than that of its counterpart, but in a good way. The downside, however, is that it discontinues; you would have to watch the 12-episode version to find out what happens next. 
 
ART - 4 
 
Being an ONA, I cut it some slack. It's on par with low-quality GIF art, which I can excuse in exchange for the decent job on the characters themselves, and the recycled backgrounds are understandable. However, some of the conversation scenes include stationary characters at a long-distance shot that was eye-hurtingly bad. One thing I did like about it was that it maintained the feel of a visual novel, with unusual clip splicing (usually with character profiles). 
 
SOUND - 5 
 
Nothing good or bad in particular about the soundtrack. The OP and ED are typical anime music, and the background music is elevator-worthy. I suspect it was taken directly from the game; it did lend to the visual novel feel. The voice acting was decent. 
 
CHARACTER - 6 
 
The characters are presented much the same as in the 12-episoder. Makoto is a little more obviously violent, and Katsura seems to have more personality immediately evident. The lack of complicated character animation, however, failed to bring them out. Particularly in Sekai's case, the focus was directed on fan service. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 5 
 
Watching this was sort of a novel experience, no pun intended, due to the very visual novel feel. However, the animation quality was off-putting, and the familiarity of the script made it a little boring.

Not a bad anime, but there are better things to be watching, including the other version of School Days.

       Helpful OK, to get it from the top: 
This episode is a game promo, so it may be treated only as its commercial, or the anime series preview. It perfectly fullfills the requirements, but nothing more than that. Actually, it's slightly rescripted first episode, or vice versa, doesn't matter. If you seen the ONA, you don't need to watch the first episode, if you seen the first episode... you know the rest. Its benefits just like the first episode's — it catches you and doesn't let until the next dose of series 
 
It cannot be taken separately so if you've watched this, just know — you're on the hook 

          
 
       Helpful Back in the starting era of my anime (or rather, my anime days ;)), I would binge-watch WatchMojo's crappy TOP 10 lists in hope to kill some time, that until I stumbled across the infamous “TOP 10 anime characters deaths”. 
It was then when I picked up interest in anime for the first time, and it was all thanks to Makoto's featured death. School Days ONA is a pointless retelling to the first episode of the original series, just a complete replica with no extra effort put on neither the animation, not the audio work and the reason behind it is still just as oblivious. 
Now I like my School Days as much as the next guy (probably not), but this, this was just utterly despicable to put as a standalone release, unless you haven't seen the show in ages and just wanted a quick reminder on how it all started, I'd suggest keeping all the distance you can from this low-level trash. I'm still haunted by how awful the animation is that I'd swear the pixels are easily countable within the range of any first-grader. And let me raise “another” exclamation mark on the low-quality voice acting, besides Kotonoha's, everything sounded like seagulls screaming at a potato webcam's integrated microphone.

Usually I don't like watching shojo animes I rather prefer read shojo mangas, because I think that in the manga we can clearly see how much the mangaka is talented and got skills ...Well, anyway, ... 
 
Hatsukoi limited I don't have a damn idea why I loved it so much ... The story is so educative I think, in fact it shows the different love problems the teenagers are having between hesitatation and temptation, the story is told in many diffrent scenarios and each time it focus on one character only. 
 
I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes) 
 
I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(.

Well with this anime..it's more divisive than ""in love"" actually... 
 
Hatsukoi Limited follows several unrequited relationships and each of the earlier episodes focuses on one set of relationships while developing the ones from the previous episode in tandem, which makes one elaborate love dodecahedron. 
 
Well since this is a relationship-based romance naime, LA needs to start off with the characters themselves and their relationships. Let's start with Ayumi Arihara voiced by Mariya Ise, one of the genki ditz of her girl group who has a crush on Mamoru Zaitsu voiced by Miyu Irino but his older brother Misao voiced by Kenji Nomura also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality. Next we have Rika Dobashi voiced by Minako Kotobuki a calm yet athletic member of the girl group who has a nice romance with Haruto Terai voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in which they have this superiority inferiority complex towards each other. Next is Nao Chikura voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, one of the more shy member of the girl group and Hiroyuki Sogabe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai had a crush on her BUT she also has a fleeting romance with one of her former art club seniors by the form of Yukito Renjou voiced by Akira Ishida. Next (YES, there's still more!) is Misaki Yamamoto voiced by Rie Tanaka and Mamoru Zaitsu has a crush on her BUT Misaki likes Ayumi's older brother Yuuji voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino (in which HE has a sister complex and doesn't really have feelings for Misaki), next is Meguru Watase voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in which she and Gengorou Takei voiced by Kazuya Nakai DO have feelings for each other ALONG with their love of swimming but Meguru has other worries but that a bit later. Second to last is Koyoi Bessho voiced by Aki Toyosaki who has a brother complex to her older brother Yoshihiko Bessho voiced by Satoshi Hino in which he has feelings for Misaki and FINALLY we have Kei Enomoto voiced by Shizuka Ito, the alpha *ahem* bitch of the girl group in which she has a violent tsundere relationship with Etsu Kusuda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma the local pervert of the series and friends of Sogabe and Mamoru and later on Enomoto gets a rival in the form of Sumire Fudounomiya voiced by Ayako Kawasumi. Did you get all that??? 
 
Ok in all honesty, the relationships ranges across the board and even the ""great relationships"" has skewed priorities to the ""horribly awful relationships"" have a silver lining. In terms of favourites and worst romances in the anime itself, LA thought that Chikura's and Dobashi's were some of the best one-shot romances with hardly a gleam of skewed priorities to them. Misaki's, Meguru's and Ayumi's were ok relationships with a few problems to them (Misaki's due to the fallout results concerning Mamoru, Meguru's for skewed priorities such as -sigh- her big boobs and Ayumi's for not being developed enough not just to Mamoru but to Misao as well and it's NEVER resolved...completely). LA would place Koyoi's relationship to be of comedic relief in a ways and NOT meant to be taken seriously, even if it's incest and you know LA rule with incest in anime (as long as it's their completely serious about it's subject matter of incest or it plays it up for the sake of comedy with no seriousness and dignity towards it's characters and Koyoi's is essentially this) thus Koyoi's only focus episode is a bit grating but it's only for the sake of comedy. -sigh- here we go...LA REALLY didn't like Enomoto and Kusuda's relationship, Enomoto for always having her belief that they need to be handsome and rich in order to even START dating her (see what LA means by alpha bitch?) AS well as Enomoto's CONSTANT tsun and violent verbal and sometimes physical abuse to Kusuda just because he's being perverted and eyeing someone else, Kusuda is no better as he's one of the main source of pervertedness in the anime besides the stray panty shots. Relationship-wise it's one of the most destructive relationship in the anime and by the end of it even with Enomoto and Kusuda's realization LA still hated the both of them by the end of it. 
 
Well here's also the thing, be it relationships that has no flaws and it's the perfect romance or one of the most destructive ones and LA didn't like them one bit, the perfect romance will have quips of completely idealistic to the destructive romances to be too harsh or unbelievably pessimistic and because of that LA chose Ayumi as LA's favourite she's in the middle of having flaws in her relationships but she's also idealistic in a ways. 
 
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the character designs were pretty to typical designs for the vast amount of characters in this anime and sometimes LA mistook characters for other similar looking characters (see Yoshihiko and Mamoru...no seriously...one time LA ACTUALLY thought this at one point), the backgrounding is typical but nothing to gawk at either. Finally the comedic moments does use the chibi visuals (both facial expressions and their entire body at times...Koyoi and Ayumi being the main culprit what with both of them being the comedic reliefs). The animation overall is decent with some level to detail on it's character designs but not much beyond that. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well this voice cast is JUST amazing, from Mariya Ise to Ayako Kawasumi and even Sayuri Yahagi!. Yes, LA did have a HUGE problem with Shizuka Ito's character but it is her CHARACTER LA didn't like, her vocals were still suited to Enomoto nonetheless. LA's favourite voice actor would go to Mariya Ise along with Ryoko Shiraishi. Nonetheless fantastic vocal line up!. 
 
Hatsukoi Limited for LA's experience in watching this anime ultimately depends on how you view the characters and their relationships in which they entail, you might hate some of the characters or you might love them and their relationships for the one true pairing or you see both the good or the bad towards one of the relationship. LA overall felt VERY divisive about this anime due to this but ALSO thought it had shades of wasted potential towards some of the relationships it had going for it.

          
 
       Helpful Usually I am not a huge fan of 12 or less episode series, but this was among one of the few that I really enjoyed. Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there. 
 
As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females, and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two. 
 
After the first few episodes I wasn't really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series.  
 
I'd suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure.

(Source: MangaSeven)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Seinen']",none,"this anime .... sigh 
 
so saintia shou is like none other  of the saint seiya anime series why you may ask? 
 
simple, saintia shou feels like a bad fanfiction created by a girl.any type of manly bravery is gone, reduced to atoms, instead we have beautiful men with luscious hair and in sparkling armor coming to save young ladies in trouble, from athena to shoko.  
 
most of the saint seiya entries never had amazing plot, but this one is just histerically bad, the villains never felt good , not enough development on their side and eris is just a joke, the worst she ever did in the entire series is that she made some saints fight and some already dead souls come back to life. noone died, noone got injured, nothing, absolutely nothing. 
 
The worst though is probably the saints, these ""saintias"" almost never work as ""athena's shadow"" as the story wants to believe, and they are saints they are not something else since they were a saint's cloth they don't wear a special saintia cloth,yet almost none of them wear masks, the only new character we saw that is a female and wears a mask is the peacock saint. and probably the most reasonable character in the entire series. these santias never really feel like a normal saint wood that would trade their life at any point if it meant to save athena, they are all very soft and without much reason to fight. for some reason they were stronger than silver saints although seiya and the others were getting absolutely destroyed by silver back in the original. and this anime makes you want to believe that the events happen simultaneously but there are so many issues in terms of the timeline it really makes no sense. 
 
This version of Athena is the worst it has ever been, really week, really vulnerable but dumb and trying to go alone in the place of the main enemy. enough about the characters that both lack the depth and the motivation to even be there, especially that more than 80% through the anime, it sends in a saint we have never seen on the screen before and wants to care for her, and feel like ""they have come so far to get here"" where besides 3 which we saw relatively early we really don't know anything about them, i would say we barely know anything about any of the characters. And enough about the females the males were not that great either, they do their job well enough as golden saints at being strong and stuff but almost all of them lack any of the complex and more serious nature.  
 
Now to talk about the art, this is by far the worst looking saint seiya entry, and what is really sad is that during the pauses at the middle of the episode we see the manga art of the girls, and it looks, so so so much better than the anime, Athena in the 1988 anime looked leagues better than this Athena in the anime, the special effects for stuff like the attacks are also very lazy and boring, only in episode 9 i saw just something a bit better in the punching move of the MC, but it's still worse than any of the other ryu sei ken's i ever saw. the animation overall of the anime is also pretty boring and bland, the character designs all look really weird. it feels like a 1 girl team made everything in this anime. the fact that i think at parts the 1988 anime looks better than this says a lot. 
 
probably the best thing about this anime is the mediocre soundtrack, worse than most of othe saint seiya entries from the past,but still good enough that you don't mind watching the anime with sounds on. 
 
enjoyment: the worst thing about this anime is that it doesn't even carry on the feeling of the original saint seiya in anyway, you could maybe argue that the golden saints are not that far away in terms of character, and that still mostly carries on to saga, milo and aiolia, besides 1 of the saintias none of them really care for athena and/or following her around as a shadow. i have heard that the manga is better but i review the anime a 4/10 since it lacks almost everything the original had and it is no doubt the worst entry in the saint seiya animated series.

          
 
       Helpful If you're a Saint Seiya fan I recommend watching this. Saintia Sho revolves around female saints known as Saintias. What's the difference between these female saints and the female saints that wear masks? well these Saintias are Athena's personal body guards who work in the shadows. It perfectly fits with the timeline of the original series. Its gives you a new story revolving the Saintias while giving you iconic and nostalgic scenes from the original series. Believe me, keep watching and you'll enjoy it.  
 
This is my first review because the creator of the manga needs help. The manga did not sell as much as she intended it to do and therefore the animators are working with very little and under extreme conditions to bring us new episodes. Even though this is the case they're doing an awesome job. Many people do not know this and are complaining about how fast paced each episode is. I am trying to do my part and write a review in order to increase its popularity because I truly enjoy this series. Anyway's, be sure to give it a shot.

          
 
       Helpful And we haven’t even hit July. 
 
Because seriously, how much longer is this franchise going to suffer? Hasn’t it been humiliated enough? At this point it almost seems like it has been victim of a curse, since after the utter failure of the Heaven’s Overture movie in 2004 the franchise never knew again of a new installment that had been both successful and satisfying. Acts #2 and #3 of the Hades arc were mediocre with a bullshit conclusion coming right after a fantastic and spectacular act #1, and then the show was followed by a series of bad spin-offs which mostly only contributed to sink the reputation of the original. Omega with its excessively kiddy approach didn’t do it any favor, Legend of Sanctuary movie was almost like a terrible CGI version of Seiya’s equivalent to Dragon Ball Evolution, Soul of Gold was just a bad excuse to sell more shiny and expensive action figures, and the single time they hit something right with the competent Lost Canvas, the japs just didn’t give a fuck and the prequel series was cancelled probably forever. Now, Saintia Shou is the latest attempt to put the franchise back in track but unfortunately it has turned out to be the complete opposite; it gives yet another stab wound to an already badly injured franchise and has made it hit a new low. (Ironically, I’m convinced the only way to “save it” or really redeem it is precisely making what always has had to be done; the Heaven’s Arc, precisely the continuation of the movie that started the bad-luck streak!).  
 
First of all I can’t say I’m disappointed since after so many mediocre offerings, I never had many expectations with this one and I just watched it because well, it’s another addition to the universe that bears the name of one of my all time favorite shows and I just watched it out of curiosity. It’s not like I was genuinely excited from the beginning. So instead of disappointment, what I’m really feeling after completing this is only deep lamentation and regret for the bad luck its name and reputation have had to bear… once again. I really can’t believe what I saw. This is by far the worst adaptation of Seiya I’ve seen, and judging by the awful overall score it currently has in the site, I think I’m not alone here. When I thought nothing could be more awful and insulting to the legacy and reputation of the original series after Omega and Soul of Gold, well, I was wrong, it could! So much that I don’t even know where to start from to explain, nor how. 
 
Simply put, the story is plain bad and the execution even worse. The latter is just so mind-bogglingly horrible that it almost feels like the staff wanted to troll the fan on purpose. It almost feels like an utter joke. The low budget assigned is no excuse. Many shows have been made with low budgets and their staffs have come up with creative ways to overcome that constraint in order to anyway make them at least acceptable, but this wasn’t the case. You just can almost tell like the staff just never really cared about this show and put very little effort. Heck, even with early Dragon Ball Super you could tell they were giving something more than a damn! 
 
**Some spoilers of the original series**. 
 
The story expands the original Seiya’s universe by introducing a new class of female saints known as “saintias”-who are not the same as the traditional female saints presented in the original work by Kurumada- in an attempt to create the female version of Saint Seiya featuring 5 female warriors protecting the Earth and the goddess they swear allegiance to from the threat of other gods because wouldn’t it be sooo cool to make female versions of action shounens with female heroines instead. Saintias are not saints strictly speaking; they are just maids/bodyguards serving and protecting Athena and are not forced to use masks unlike traditional female saints, which seems to be really the only difference, since “normal” female saints well, also train, serve and protect the goddess. So, why having a different, new class now? The reason is one and only one: because it obviously would have looked so weird to have a cast of main heroines all wearing a mask all the time without ever seeing her real faces! Obviously, from a commercial perspective it wouldn’t have worked at all. It’s understandable, so it can’t be an issue really.  
 
But what is an issue and what comes as inevitably annoying is how bad the story tries to fit with the events of the original, since it chose to chronologically take place within them. We are in this occasion asked to happily believe that at the same time Athena was carrying out her Galaxian Tournament (who now we are told had assumed her role before this event, not after it), she was confronting the threat of goddess Eris and that this totally didn’t interfere with the celebration of the former since it couldn’t be the case since in the original obviously this never existed and we don’t wanna establish inconsistencies, right? It now inevitably feels weird that in the original Athena had never ever mentioned anything about Eris and neither the golden saints and the Pope that were similarly aware of her existence and threat and also how the bronze saints seemed to be totally unaware of both the conflict and the saintias themselves who were also protecting Saori considering how close they were to her. It just makes things harder to believe, since the original now makes it look like all this had been something going on in secrecy when it didn’t have to be the case. It’s hard to believe now that the Pope was also concerned about Eris when in the original it looked like he was dedicating his whole time to the recovery of the Sagittarius golden cloth and her conflict with Saori from the distance. It also looks, while feasible, so convenient that Eris had been seemingly defeated right before the start of Sanctuary’s assault under the orders of the Pope only to show up again and make her comeback right after the conclusion of the same Sanctuary conflict because -obviously- it couldn’t be another way if we didn’t want to introduce more questionable circumstances. 
 
Athena vs Eris round was yet another Athena’s classic damsel in distress countdown, this time lying in between the Sanctuary and Poseidon clashes. What looked so funny is that now Athena had to face another one of these death curses, in a matter of just hours right after she had miraculously survived the previous one! It looked so silly, please, somebody give this lady some time to breathe! I know this was also the case in the Asgard to Poseidon transitions, but at least in those arcs there was more creativity regarding the type of threat Athena was facing (in Asgard she’s not really running a risk of dying, she was only slowly losing her energies) and it wasn’t THAT immediate! It comes as surprising that after 3 decades and several installments, the amount of creativity here is this low, and that they had opted for this way when the original already presented creative ways to showcase the same plot-structure. Additionally, some other elements of the conflict looked quite laughable. A floating temple under a giant tree about to collide with Athena’s Sanctuary? Memories and regrets of the dead become “alive” under the awakening of Eris thanks to how much blood was spilled in the 12 Houses’ fights? Really? Not to mention that Eris herself is a terrible, lousy enemy to begin with. While her motivations are interesting enough to consider her a decent villain, it can’t be helped that she literally looks like an evil Disney fairy-tale movie witch that doesn’t inspire a single pinch of true intimidation and authority unlike other goddesses like Artemisa or other previous female enemies like Hilda and Pandora which were portrayed in a much more respectful and serious way. Laughing maniacally with this “I am so evil and I seek destruction, muahahaha!” voice and face totally goes against the more serious nature of all the enemies of the franchise. The voice actress behind seems like she thought she was playing the evil witch role. It’s sad to see how Shou sells itself as something to take seriously, but at the same time takes these tactical decisions that are more suitable for a kids’ morning cartoon. I don’t see here the same adult tone of the original which is what I and most of the fans think when thinking about Saint Seiya. 
 
It didn’t help the fact that it also unnecessarily depicted in different ways some events in the original just because it wanted to be more faithful to the source. For example, now it turns out that Saori and Saga had already met before the conclusion of the Sanctuary arc like it was the case in the original, partially ruining the great sense of tension and suspense this decision established by making the two parts not knowing each other until the very end and fighting in blind since the start. It also turns out now that instead of the bronze and gold saints beautifully meeting, taking a bow and walking with Athena all the way up to the Pope’s house and lastly everyone involved confronting Saga in Athena’s temple, Athena this time just walks alone, meets Saga in the middle of the road, there’s no Gemini cloth abandoning and testing Saga’s will, no one-last-time Saga’s evil side trying to win while explaining what drove his actions to everybody followed by Athena’s inspiring, compassionate answer, and no Gemini cloth’s helmet crying! And the final suicide moment comes as totally uninspiring as opposed to the gripping one we saw in the original. This show doesn’t make justice to that fascinating final encounter. While Shou’s version of the events is the real manga version, honestly, I feel the first anime version pulled it off way better and improved upon the source by caring to make the moment more thrilling and memorable, actually managing to make a powerful impact. Also… no Seiya being hit by Saga while he was aiming the shield to where Athena was lying at the last minute! Like, come on! If something already worked great, what’s the need to make it work not so great!? 
 
Oh, and finally…now it also turns that Milo and Aphrodite always knew about the truth regarding Saori…and still stopped and delayed the bronze saints in their way up! Making honestly no sense. I can’t help but feeling this new story would have been a better idea had it not developed in the same universe as the original but rather in another new one. That way none of the aforementioned issues would have ever been a thing.    
 
Moving on to the execution, the series is just too god-damn short for its own good. One of the most notorious and main problems in the series is that they decided to make something that should’ve lasted at least 25 episodes in… 10. There’s just so much relevant stuff going on in such a small amount of episodes that at the end it feels like you’re watching in 3x unintentionally. The rushed feeling of storytelling is so damn high that at the end the whole series feels like it was just a very long recap of something bigger, and as a result hardly the viewer can give a damn about anything that’s going on because it utterly fails to immerse him in the story at all (especially regarding Athena vs Eris supposedly grandiose clash between the saintias and the dryads and ghosts armies that lasted the grand total of… 3.5, yes, 3.5 episodes. How could they really expect to build and develop an exciting and memorable clash in just 3.5 episodes? It’s virtually impossible to do so, and at the end the conflict is rendered as something only anecdotal, like a forgettable, short non-canon extra movie).  
 
Everything from beginning to end feels like a quick fulfillment of a checklist. Have you ever seen one of those short franchise-specials that quickly summarize an entire arc or storyline of the parent series? Like that Rurouni Kenshin Kyoto-arc that ridiculously squeezes in 1 hour a 30 episodes long story? Saintia Shou feels virtually like the exact same thing…except that this is a normal series, not a special! It totally lacks a sense of natural progression. You can really tell like if there were some missing scenes that naturally connect all the events of the story and that ultimately are the ones that actually can make the viewer care about what he’s watching. The amount of time to develop the story was so little that as a result there was no space to properly build the tension, the digestion after its release and the viewer's immersion into the world that would have made this at least minimally interesting and entertaining. Fights and conflicts also, given this, do not feel thrilling nor impactful enough (even the ones involving the popular and beloved golden saints) something the original series knew how to pull off so well. Every single event here, be it from the introduction, development and conclusion, like just…come and go! Without trying to leave a proper impact, a proper trace, and do not carry a single bit of emotional weight at all. To such an extent that even Soul of Gold looks like a masterpiece regarding this in comparison! 
 
But obviously, there was no budget for 25 episodes, so they had to do the best they could, but honestly, if the result was going to be this bad, it would have been better not to adapt anything in the first place. 
 
In addition, in Shou everything, how can I tell this?…feels so incredibly and annoyingly.. fake! In Shou everything is depicted like if it was a fucking children’s school-break game. Nothing feels remotely real. There’s no sense of realism. No sense of seriousness. Everything feels so IN YOUR FACE. No sense of watching something that at least TRIES to feel real. Many characters here behave and talk like they were actors not giving a damn about the fictional work they were realizing because they were being underpayed or not payed at all! Or because they didn’t feel it was “relevant” enough…like one of those high school festival plays nobody involved takes seriously enough. It feels that amateurish. It’s embarrassing and painful to watch to say the least. 
 
The series, again, due to the extreme rush and compression of events, also fails to make us care about and relate with all the set of new characters, including the protagonist Shouko, who essentially is the female version of the determined, kind-hearted and impulsive Seiya by mirroring -and paying homage- to his themes (separated from her sister at a young age, a mythological-horse as a guardian constellation, the same iconic technique, among others). With the exception of Shouko, virtually all of them felt like empty shells. All the rest of saintias that were not Shouko, how can I put it? were just…there. None of them is introduced properly, and given the short run there was no time to do anything remotely engaging with them, which is what was seen. Not even their cloths look distinctive enough from each other. I’ve read that the series omitted a lot of relevant content present in the source in this regard. The only one that matters here is Shouko and all the rest are almost shown like they were just the backup singers, as opposed to the original which brilliantly knew how to make relevant all of the 5 main members, even from the start. Here, we don’t get to care nor get along nor feel anything for them. Consequently, why should I care what happens to them if the show does nothing to make me care for them to begin with? Here, the all-time fan (who is honestly the only one that was going to watch this show) will only care for the characters he always knew from before, this is, the golden saints and Saori.  
 
There were also some elements that felt so out of place for a “Seiyaverse-based” installment that made me feel I was simply watching another franchise. A saintia riding a frickin’ motorbike like she was taken out from a cyberpunk movie? A vampire loli enemy that looks like taken out from a dumb fantasy show? A chinese girl acting like she was taken out from a Rumiko Takahashi comedy? And a fight against a fuckin’ giant TEDDY BEAR, among others? None of this feels appropriate in the very serious mythologically-based universe of Seiya, more so if the installment takes place in the same original timeline. In fact, it is quite annoying. A saint driving a motorbike doesn’t look “mythologically” romantic, it looks instead quite… mundane.  
 
And I haven’t even mentioned anything about the god-awful animation yet! While the show is in most of the episodes beautifully drawn, using again the beautiful artstyle by Shingo Araki in (most of) the character designs, the same can’t be said about the animation. How can we feel true excitement from battles when movements are limited to showing a character’s body just stiffly shaking in a corner of the screen in front of a sea of fast moving parallel lines and that’s it? With no sense of realism at all and looking incredibly boring to watch? We don’t even see any type of minimal scratch or body damage after any character has been hit by an attack! This is quite curious considering this was not even shown by TV! 
 
Music didn’t help either. How can I describe it? Most of the BGM here feels like taken from a kiddy Marvel comics' videogame. Really. Completely failing to set the proper serious and fascinating moods like it was the case with the original. I just couldn’t believe it when I knew that the same guy that gave us the amazing, captivating and full of personality score of Hunter x Hunter (1999) could make in this occasion a score this uninspiring, generic and forgettable. The opening wasn’t bad, but didn’t feel fitting either, since it looked like an opening from something like frickin’ Madoka Magica. 
 
Despite all of the above, I have to recognize the show still presents some points that I liked and that were nice additions to not render it a completely worthless experience from an all-time fan perspective. It was good to see for example how it is mentioned here the realistic outcome that not every boy sent to train to foreign locations to become a bronze saint got to achieve it and came back with the cloth, and that some of them developed an understandable disdain towards Saori after years of mistreatment in the foundation, as brought to light in the figure of Toki. It was good to see how Saori feels guilty about this and overall how the series explores much more in depth how does she actually feel in regard to her role as a goddess and protector of the Earth, its meaning and implications, her anxieties, and how her actions in the past have impacted the world she’s supposed to defend, making her a better developed character, something we never really got to see in the original. I also liked the explicit inclusion of the conversation among Shion, Saga and Aioros regarding the future of the Sanctuary and the new Pope. And that the golden saint that got the most screentime and participation this time had been Milo; he has always been to my eyes one of the coolest golden saints of all and it felt very welcome to see him enjoying most of the spotlight. Nonetheless, obviously all of this just isn’t enough to compensate an overall terribly executed story and show.  
 
Rushed, horribly directed, horribly animated, uninspiring, unexciting, unpassionate, unmemorable, devoid of any soul and made by a staff that looked like they just didn’t care, Saintia Sho only served to sink even more the reputation of the franchise after the streak of entries ranging from mediocre-to-terrible like the conclusion of the Hades arc in the original, Omega, Legend of Sanctuary and Soul of Gold. Watching adaptations like Shou honestly made me want to go back to the time when I wasn’t caring about anime anymore (which was a long time span), so that I didn’t have to be curious to watch entries like this one, spoiling my good memories in the process and missing the old staff of the original series who actually put love and care in their work. 2/10.

I don't know any other way to judge it using MAL's arbitrary score system, so I'll completely avoid mentioning it in this review. 
 
There is no real narrative here. It's very much a character-driven story, but to sum it up: It's about the relationship between Akane and her twin brother, who she perceives as better than her in every way. She aims to become better than her brother and aim even higher in life than him, initially out of jealousy, but she's now using it as an excuse to interact more with her brother and establish a stable relationship that they once had. I'm really digging deep here, and that's about as far as the narrative goes. As you can see, it's not anything ground-breaking and the premise is rather cliche. Throw this in with the rest of the Shoujo anime.  
 
This premise might be interesting if both Akane and her brother were interesting characters, but they're really quite bland. Especially her brother, who is merely a stereotype that we've seen from every anime ever. The guy who speaks with an emotionless tone but actually experiences a plethora of emotions, though he has trouble getting this across. Akane is the generic, cheery girl who is an airhead most of the time. What about those characters sounds interesting? By themselves, there's nothing. Presumably, the interactions between the two are the highlight of the characters, then? No, not really. The characters are just dull, bland and utterly generic. 
 
The art and sound are serviceable; nothing to write home about, but nothing that might provoke profuse bleeding of the eyes or ears. Simply mediocre. 
 
I got no enjoyment out of this whatsoever, but if the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a watch. If you have 5 minutes to throw away, why not throw it away for Romantica Clock? Of course, you'll end up having to read the manga if it actually intrigues you and if you're not the type of person who likes manga, just give it a miss. Romantica Clock fails to even hit mediocrity, after all.

          
 
       Helpful Before everybody gets their otaku panties in a twist about this ""show,"" and how incredibly short and uneventful it may be, go read the manga. This mini-series has basically compiled itself to be a very short add to the manga while still giving the audience teasers to what the series is about, but clearly the manga elaborates on these details and gives the reader much more background to the characters and plot to the story. So don't see this as an anime ""series,"" see it as a teaser trailer to the manga series. If you're interested in what you see but wish there was more to it, go read the manga. If you find this ""mini-series"" annoying but are wondering ""What the hell man?!"", go read the manga. If you just like cute stories, go read the manga. The manga is enjoyable, and well put together. In the first chapter you get a lot of background story to the characters and a better understanding of what the story is going to be trying to accomplish. It's a good read. So don't knock the teaser trailer until you've read a few chapters of the manga.

Of course we all saw this coming. Yes, a 4.  
 
I am rating this as what it was meant to be and that is a trailer I'm assuming from other reviews. It did have the advertisement vibe to it yet it wasn't satisfying. There should be only 1 episode if its going to be a trailer, not 3 episodes that viewers have to chase around to see what this is going to be about. You'll probably understand more about the manga just by reading the summary.

6,6351,24,7.765167109,Seems to be a love story but actually not,"Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen","Included in the 8th and final DVD of Clannad ~After Story~ is an extra episode set in an alternate universe. Here, Fujibayashi Kyou is the main heroine in place of Furukawa Nagisa. 
 
Love can be wonderfully exciting, but also extremely painful. Fujibayashi Ryou, Kyou's sister, is in love with Okazaki Tomoya, the male protagonist. With the help of Kyou, Ryou manages to sum up the courage to ask him out and now Tomoya and Ryou are a couple. However, as things progress, Kyou begins to acknowledge her feelings for Tomoya, and a love-triangle is formed. 
 
As everything is revealed, the sisters learn the pains of love and try to decide between the two loves of their life: Tomoya, or each other. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","
Clannad's story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.
The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a strange girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.
","Well...It was a refreshing OVA after I finished After Story...but it didn't had any big impact on me...maybe because I was thinking that Kyou & Ryou are not a good match...or maybe because I was allready happy for the happy ending in After story...dunno why but all I can say that.....it was difinetley a nice OVA...but it was not good enough to make me cry...nor even make me sad...I just watched patiently until the end and no reaction...it was like [Ohhhh well...I gues this could happen if Tomoya doesen'e meet Nagisa and all his other friends except Ryou and Kyou. 
 
It was refreshing but nothing else...I still like better the OVA with Tomoyo arc...And as a matter of fact I AM a fan of Tomoyo x Tomoya couple...no affence to Nagisa,Kotomi & Kyou lovers...Is just that Tomoya's perfect match is Tomoyo....and that's all I have to say... 
 
Overall...a good OVA...but not as splendit as Tomoyo arc or the 2 seasons....I gave it a 8 [don't go shooting me now -]

          
 
       Helpful Clannad: After Story - Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Kyou-hen in a word: NotClannadEither 
 
It's basically the same idea as Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen so I'm going to give it the same review: 
 
All this is an alternative reality with the characters. It doesn't give more to the main story of Clannad and Clannad After Story. If you have played the visual novel you might enjoy it more than I did, but I didn't gain anything from watching it. 
 
The art was good, the characters were their usual selves, but I adore the relationship between Nagisa and Tomoya and their relationship wasn't the focus of this story. So I kind of checked out on it.  
 
If you want to watch it, just to see the Clannad characters back in action, go for it, but I will probably never rewatch it. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I wasn't a big fan of Clannad (rated 5, 8 for After Story) partly because I just didn't like Nagisa. The way she ended up how she ended up annoyed me personally and I was never really a fan of her personality. I always thought of Kyou as the best girl so this OVA was perfect.  
 
Really, the story was just great. Basically what I wanted to happen in the series but I think it acutally worked better for an OVA.  
 
The romance was good. The characters were swell. The developments in the story were on point.  
 
Like I said before, I'm a little biased because I really am not a fan of Nagisa, but this OVA was great. It did feel a little crammed and if the split it up into two parts it may have been better, but it definitely worked.

6,325,25,7.754285424,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Peach Girl,"Peach Girl is about an average high school girl, Momo Adachi, who everyone thinks is a beach bunny/slut because of her tanned skin. The actual reason she is so tanned is because she was on the swim team and tans very easily. She likes a boy, Toji, who she heard only likes non-tanned girls. This causes her to question who she is and have low self esteem. She spends a lot of time trying to remake herself into the girl she believes he wants; however, she has a friend, Sae, who likes to go behind Momo's back and make her life terrible, mostly by trying to take Toji away from her. All the while there's another boy, Kairi, who is in love with Momo. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Momo Adachi is a former member of the high school swim team. She tans easily and her hair is bleached out; unfortunately, she is stereotyped by her ignorant classmates and is forced to endure rumors about being an ""easy girl"" who has had many sexual relationships. Her only friend is Sae, who is actually responsible for spreading the nasty gossip due to her jealousy of Momo. Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her sights set on the boy. Momo's life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his. He reveals to Momo that she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started.
Things become even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spreads rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. The rumor about the kiss between the two is true, but it was Kairi who initiated it while Momo remained stunned by the interaction. When Toji is hospitalized, Sae convinces Toji to break up with Momo. Thanks to Kairi, he finds out about all the lies and rumors Sae has made up. Toji saves Momo from being bullied (thanks to Sae's lies again) and tells the truth about him and Momo, resulting in the students apologizing to Momo and hating Sae. Toji and Momo get back together, but Sae later tries to complicate their relationship again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji is initially defiant, he reluctantly breaks up with Momo to protect her. Momo is heartbroken at first, particularly due to not knowing that it is part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually begins dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon begins to fall in love with him. When it is revealed to Momo why Toji broke up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arise and the love triangle intensifies.
In ""Sae's Story"", Sae is left back a year, for she was always skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win her over. He takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp; one day when Sora tried to follow Sae, she threw a rock at its paw and injured it. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, and he later turns her down. Sae meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs make Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people who care for her.
","When I began watching this anime, I checked it out because it seemed girly and fun. I have a thing for love triangles and this one seemed perfect. BUT I have to say it let me down terribly. So every one should take this as a WARNING review. I will include all the pros and cons of this show. Kindly keep in mind that I am writing this as a newbie to anime. 
 
The show starts out funny and without making much sense. I expected typical slapstick humour and a bit of romance. The first episode was hilarious but from then it went from being a bag of mixed emotions to utterly painful to watch. This is my first in experiencing difficulty in watching an anime. It was like a bad Asian drama with crappy writing.  
 
I have never seen a girl as indecisive as Momo. Just when I expect that she will redeem herself, she does something which made me struggle to like her. I think the last 4-5 episodes did permanent damage to her character. The writing and her actions were way out of line. No matter how much I enjoy the 'being with two people at once' concept, Momo was the height of indecisiveness. She wasn't that great to begin with and these actions made her even less likable. She kept going back and forth between both guys which was plain tiring to watch. I actually have to say I disliked her immensely. I also have the complaint that she cried too much. 
 
Touji wasn't great till some episodes, but there was a time when I started liking him. Then he disappeared from the radar and when he came back, I didn't care about him anymore. There was nothing about his character that interested me. He and Momo got on my nerves pretty badly when they enjoyed being lovey dovey or making out. 
 
The only character I cared about was Kairi. If he hadn't been there, I would have dropped this show by the 2nd or 3rd episode. I really found him funny and loved his many sides. Then again the writer tries to throw in stuff and make him into an indecisive jerk. I was okay with that too. Then came some more dumb situations and all that was left was a poor version of Kairi who had become the victim of bad writing. His character had so much potential but the writer ruined it all by the end by making him mopey and annoying.  
 
Then there was Sae who I absolutely despised. She was a tad too good at manipulating people. She provided for most of the drama and was a catalyst for most of the plot. I couldn't believe it but she turned out to be very entertaining in the last half. She remained herself and toned down her evil side a little. I liked what she did to get the couple I wanted in the end together. Her actions aren't forgivable, but since she went through hell herself I thought it was alright. 
 
The only reason to hang on for the show is its ending. It was how I wanted and Momo finally picked the right guy. I still wasn't happy that she was making out with the other guy till minutes before she decides to choose him. I, as a viewer was still in doubt whether she still stuck to him forever or not. Momo wasn't very reliable. 
 
Anyway- the anime has great humour which also gets lackluster by the end. It is a roller coaster in a bad way, because say that you enjoy riding it but it always makes you feeling ill. The experience of watching this anime was similar. I enjoyed it but I am not too happy with it. I am just glad that it is over. I think I need a break from romantic anime.

          
 
       Helpful Oh gosh. so many switches of the girl protagonist between the two guys >.< That was horrible. Every episode I just kept wondering How is it darn allowed for the girl to switch her love interest every time she gets hurt and the first one who comes to sooth her broken heart suddenly becomes her love interest !?!?! 
 
Story[3/10]: I was very displeased with how the characters especially the girl protagonist acts. She has be shown to have a tanned skin due to her beeing a swim team member in the past. Come on !! They could have shown some competitions of swimming. Her achievements in the field, and how she couped up in adjusting in society somehow despite her skin colour. But NO. Nothing of that sort. Its just girl likes guy. He likes her back. But there's her so called friend there always to ruin her life (So darn hated her in the show.) They break up somehow. There's another guy who also kinda likes her. Then she starts liking him too. But he has another true love pfffffff. My eyes were rolling cause of all the pointless scenes. Jeez *sigh* 
 
Art[6/10]: Not the best of art but its watchable. Not too much of background scenery. 
 
Sound[6/10]: Voices were good for all characters. The openeing is kinds fun to listen to. 
 
Character[4/10]: All fail. Indecisiveness, Weakness, Dumbness, its all there. 
 
Enjoyment[4/10]: The romantic moments between the characters were shown fairly not in some darn ecchi partly hentai manner in which most series now a days have started to show. That's about the only thing I was satisfied with. 
 
Overall[6/10]: All in all really disappointing storywise. But if you want to pass time try it out.

          
 
       Helpful the only thing that got me starting this show was Funimation channel. it seemed really interesting at first, although the story line is cliche. but i decided to give it a try. already from the first episode, i could tell that Momo was going to be a pain to watch. she was so obsessive with toji from the get go. but it wasn't until later on that you could really see her obsessiveness. she threatens to jump out windows, get's angry when she sees her boyfriend talking to someone else other than her, and she waits 5 minutes for her boyfriend. any later than that, she assumes the relationships over. pretty obvious she's desperate for a boyfriend....she just get's plain annoying. her decisions were plain, and her love life over exaaggerated.  
 
everything about this story is unrealistic. i had heard many peopple say ""this show is amazing! i can relate to it so much!"" .......ok? u cannot relate to this story what-so-ever. it makes no sense. many plot twists seemed like they were just made in an attempt to keep the story going. like when Kairi decides to go on a whole trip walking the whole summer. yeah right, like his parents would let him do that in the first place, but basically the creators only made him leave so that they could try to make the drama greater by bringing in toji again. momo's feelings are always unclear. and she's such a sap and goes with the flow too much. if she cries and someone comforts her once, she immediately thinks ""this person was there when i was feeling down. i love him"".....SHE CANNOT CHOOSE!!!! if i were kairi or toji, i would dump her. i just don't see what they find so captivating and attractive about her. she cannot hold a decent relationship even if her life depended on it. 
 
basically, the characters could've been so much more. Momo is out of the question. she is no doubt the most annoying person in this whole show. Toji is just some freak stalker who can do nothing but stalk Momo, hoping to be her comfort when kairi makes her cry. that could be depicted as sweet, but later on it just get's creepy. he'll begin popping out of no where seemingly having no plans that day, and you'll wonder what he does with his life. Sae is...annoying, yet smart. she gets annoying because all she wants is to ruin someone else's life, but then again, she is clever. she uses her resources wisely in order to get what she wants. and she has backbone. but still... she is pretty annoying. the only thing that kept me going through this show was Kairi. he seemed aloof, loveable, and a sweet sensitive guy. his methods to cheer up momo were cute. but then after a while, he too began getting on my nerves.  
 
i'm not gonna say much about the art. the art was good. it was different than others. but it had it's awkward moments. they didn't seem to focus too much on the quality of the opening. in many occassions, Toji looked like either a bird or a fish. and the sound wasn't good either. at first the theme songs seemed okay and fit the story quite nicely, but then they just got annoying again. like everything else in the story. the ending wasn't too good, and the opening seemed okay at first. but as you can guess, you get tired of hearing ""baby low tension"" it just loses it's catchiness. 
 
so as you can see, this show was a fail of slice of life. the creators tried to make it entertaining and easy to relate to, but it just didnt happen. i found myself groaning in disgust at most of the episodes, and the only reasons i actually finished this show was because  
1. there was nothing to watch 
2. something in me still believed that this show could get better 
3. i didnt want to leave it unfinished. 
 characters were bad, soundtrack bad, storyline bad, and...yeah that's basically it.

One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.

God this is a bad OVA. I have not read the original manga, but I watched this out of some twisted sense of curiosity. By the end of the anime I could care less about the cardboard-cutout stereotype waffy-uke and emotionally-stunted seme and just wanted to smack them both.  
 
Here's a general rundown of what happens: they get together, then break up for no reason. Angst ensues. This happens OVER 9000 times in a forty-five minute period, and at some point, Izumi is so angst-ridden he COUGHS UP BLOOD. I think there is some Magical Soul-Healing Buttsecks (R) in there somewhere. 
 
Whatever. 
 
If you are desperate for your yaoi fix, read a naughty bedtime story or a doujin. This sort of anime right here is one of the reasons the genre is so hated even by gay men themselves.

       Helpful Hey folks, this will be a review for Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara. In short, this anime isn't very good. 
 
The background info you need is a business woman named Chisato and a bartender named Sora are married. Each episode has a starting scene but it always ends up the same. Wife comes home from work, is handed a drink of some kind. She becomes drunk which makes her more bubbly and bright as a character. 
 
As for enjoyment, its really lacking. I don't think this is some bad example for children like some others. However it is boring, repetitive, and trying too hard to be cute. Each episode is the exact same with a new drink. Wife comes home and has her glasses on and hair pulled back. Drinks the drink of the day and then takes her glasses off, lets her hair down and pulls a cute face. For some reason they also list out some of the ingredients for the drink as if we will make it at home, or care for that information.  
 
I think they were trying to capture the essence Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken, which is actually a good show imo.  
 
TLDR: Boring and repetitive. Not even worth the 3 minutes to see a single episode.

          
 
       Helpful Honestly, I stumbled upon this anime bored out of my mind; and as I was looking for good anime to watch, I came upon this series. Looking for something that felt like nothing more than a casual, happy-go-lucky type anime, this satisfied what I was looking for. 
    The jist of the story is that a corporate businesswoman named Chisato is married to her bartender husband, Sora. Chisato is normally very quiet and conserved at her job, but hides the fact that she has a large alcohol intolerance, essentially being a ""one-shot wonder"". This anime is a nice little relaxing series about her getting drunk and the cute happenings that ensue. 
    There's honestly not much to critique about the anime; I mean, the episodes are only a few minutes long. The art and sound were on par with expectations, and there is a lack of character development as there is no real storyline to this series. 
   I definitely enjoyed this as something no more than a cute, romantic anime I'd watch all over again in my free time. But if you are looking for something with a storyline, or something with development, I suggest you go look someplace else.

6,39022,28,7.663964238,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Ling Feng Zhe,"The Leader will talk about how Marx met his wife Jenny and their thwarted love story, as well as his friendship with Friedrich Engels, his close companion and co-author of the Communist Manifesto. 
 
(Source: Global Times)","['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Romance']","The Leader revolves around the life of German philosopher Karl Marx, focusing on his political and economic theories, his romance with Jenny von Westphalen, and his friendship with Friedrich Engels. In a press release, Marx was described as ""a great man standing upright between heaven and earth, whose ideological system established through his entire life awakened all sleeping proletariat across the world and deeply influenced the historical development of the world"". He was also characterized as ""an ordinary man of flesh and blood"", whose love for Jenny and friendship with Engels ""became legendary"".The series depicts Marx's life from his graduation from Trier High School in 1835 to his college years, where his philosophy changes from Kantianism to Hegelianism. His early affiliation with the Young Hegelians and his work on the newspaper Rheinische Zeitung are portrayed. Marx's exiles and ideological feuds with Ludwig Feuerbach, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and others are also shown. The poverty of his family is explored, and Marx's participation in the International Workingmen's Association and conflicts with Mikhail Bakunin are highlighted. The series ends with his death and the worldwide impact of his ideas.
","The Leader is a work with the ability to set any revolutionary's heart alight with pride.  It is not often that these kinds of cartoons carry with them such weight, but this is no ordinary cartoon.  It is a work designed to inspire a new generation of Marxists to carry forth the torch of Communism to a brighter tomorrow.   
 
I was deeply impressed by the characterization of Marx and his comrades.  This show is not just a picture of Marx, it is a mirror in which the audience can see themselves reflected in the actions of Marx and the revolutionaries of the past.  The Leader makes Marx more than just a face in a textbook, it makes him human.   
 
Technically, the show is lacking in many aspects.  The art is sub-par, with the transition between 2d and 3d being quite jarring at times.  The sound design also leaves much to be desired.  However, it would be improper to place as much weight on these aspects as the true meat of the story.  This show needs neither impressive visuals nor immersive sound to draw the viewer in with its powerful message of revolution.   
 
Overall, I was astounded by the degree to which this show moved me.  As a show produced under the direction of the Communist Party of China, I was suspicious that it would dilute Marx's revolutionary character, but it seems even the revisionist CPC recognizes his great contributions to the world.   
 
I understand that to one ideologically opposed to Marx, this show might be rejected on its basic premise.  However, I believe that even a reactionary can be moved by this humanization of Marx.  Too many people understand Marx only by ""Marxism.""  They understand him only by the number of deaths that are falsely attributed to him.  But to truly understand Marx the philosopher, one must understand Marx the revolutionary.

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to Karl Marx the animation: The Daddy of Communism. 
 
As a (fake) Chinese, I can tell you zero things about Karl Marx because the British education system has failed to teach me history of other places other than ‘Great’ Britain. My parents as ex-members of the communist party didn’t educate me on the topic either, if any Chinese is reading this, they are probably calling me out to be a traitor, as they have already, many times. 
 
With that said, I genuinely do not know too much about Karl Marx, nor have I read any of his work, while you might argue that I can’t possibly review this not knowing about the main character, I want to give you my two cents anyway in regard to the purpose of the anime. After all, this is suppose to educate those who do not know about him right?  
 
The premise of the show stated that the anime is made to commemorate Marx 200th anniversary with a serious tone, while most of us (in the west) is taking the piss out of it. I can’t unseen that joke someone made on tumblr calling this as Xi Jinping’s way of making communism appealing to the younger generation, as hilarious and meme like that text post was, some truth lies underneath it. One simple click on Google will tell you that the anime is in fact funded by multiple government authorities, ie. The Government’s Marxism Office. It’s definitely propaganda alright. After more clicks around the internet and watching the anime myself, I don’t really understand who the target audience is. 
 
Responses from the public: 
 
Since I never read any of his work, I can’t confirm how accurate the dialogues are. But I don’t feel like I’ve learnt much from the anime. One of the criticisms I’ve seen Chinese people commenting is that the content doesn’t appeal to a specific audience, it’s too simplistic for those who knows about Marxism, but too complicated for those who know nothing. 
 
There’re not many negative comments of the show under the episodes, the review function for the anime is blocked on the Bilibili platform where the show is streamed (I wonder why). I had to look else where for reviews. On the site Douban, out of the 1527 reviews, 50.3% are 1 star and the anime have a rating of 4/10 (as of today 07/03), if that doesn’t tell you something about how bad the show is, I don’t know what will. People don’t seem to have a problem making sarcastic comments and rating the show 1 star due to the quality of it. What’s bloody hilarious is that people are commenting on how Marx will be disappointed if he knew that Bilibili is charging people to watch the latest episodes, capitalism at its finest, yeah baby. 
 
The ONLY reason I can write this review a week early is because I have a paid membership with Bilibili and I have access to the show. I guess it sucks to be you if you can’t afford one, huh. 
 
The animation, music, writing: 
 
The first thing you will notice is that the animation is damn awful, it’s so inconsistent, it switches from 3d to 2d and back to 3d then 2d and 3d and 2d every 6 frames, it’s really annoying and harsh to the eyes, as soon as you get used to the style it changes. Episode five was just a train wreck, the faces looked funny, there was illustrations inserted that was just in a completely different art style and appeared out of place. 
 
The choice of depicting Marx and Engels as hot bishonens is also a mystery to me, I’m not saying they weren’t hot when they were young, I don’t know I can’t find any photo evidence of it (huh I wonder why), but this is what I mean when I say who is the anime for? It’s supposed to be serious toned propaganda for the communist party, yet they adopted a Japanese bishie otome game style. In episode 3, there’s also a weird ass aura between Marx and Engels, the whole show seems like a doujin to me. The ED is also one hell of a meme, the lyrics is all glory and communism with a comical rap section. 
 
It really feels like it’s very low budgeted, neither the animation or writing is great, disappointing considering the government funded this. The pacing of the story is too fast, many characters are introduced but never gets another mention, the concepts are glanced over and never discussed in depth. In episode five, Marx literally aged 20 years and they skipped over probably the most important parts of his life. Engels on the other hand has about couple minutes of screen time the entire show, considering he is equally as important as Marx, he did co-write the The Communist Manifesto for god sake, oops, sorry my bad, god doesn’t exist in communism. 
 
If the purpose of the anime were to educate, I don’t think they should chicken out on the details. Literally everything that was said in the show have gone over my head. 
 
Would I recommend this? It’s up to you and what you want out of this, watch it for a good laugh but don’t expect anything out of it, if you are even remotely interested in Marx, I presume you are intellectually enough to read some books and journal articles. 
 
Enough shit from me, I will now educate myself by reading a free copy of The Communist Manifesto. Ride on my comrades, peace and out.

This January there was some strange news from China, the airing of a Karl Marx animated series usually called Karl Marx the anime, but actually titled The Leader. There was quite a bit of fuss on news sites and social media, but oddly once episodes started floating around the net it quickly disappeared. It doesn't seem to have gained much traction even in the circles that make image reactions and jokes. 
 
I found a youtube channel that not only uploaded all seven episodes but had also fansubbed the Chinese dialogue into English and Russian. I watched the whole show, and I think I see why it didn't last. Using the channel statistics as a guide, episode one has 100,000+ views, episode 2 though plummeted to 15,000 and the drop continued with the last episode getting around 7,000. There's a lot to untangle so I'm going to break it down a bit. 
 
**Expectations** 
 
I wasn't expecting much going in, its a biopic of Karl Marx that's seven episodes long. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, but at least four of those minutes are dedicated to credit sequences and a preview of the next episode. I was expecting more of a brief timeline and introduction to his ideas and inspirations. This seems to be what they were aiming for and some episodes mostly live up to this but the rest fall quite short. 
The Look 
 
Bluntly the show is very incompetent, both in animation and story structure, it seems to have deliberately gone out of its way to show off how poorly made much of it is. There's no consistency, it switches between 3D and 2D animation styles arbitrarily, the models are extremely janky in movement and stick out from the backgrounds. They often look creepy especially when laughing. 
 
The models are also recycled heavily, Marx doesn't appear to age or change his clothes much from age 17 until the 1850's when he starts to show the beginnings of a beard. His wife Jenny is usually seen wearing her wealthy noblewoman dress and her maid is wearing a sexy formal French maids outfit. The crowds are some of the laziest I've ever seen, a good chunk of multiple episodes are dedicated to Marx giving a speech, and we get reaction shots from the audience, but what's weird is that these audiences usually stay motionless until the speech is finished, and then they applaud robotically. Most do not even emote during, and many not in the front row despite being clearly visible often do not have faces. 
 
 
This is not the worst example of lifeless crowds, this is only the first example. From the first episode, about two minutes in 
 
It looks cheap and it's very jarring. Even the show opener highlights many of the worst features of the animation. But what's really strange is that the first episode is the cheapest looking one, every other episode while not perfect is an improvement. Now animations having spikes and drops in quality is nothing unusual, budgets of both time and money can affect production, but I've never known the opening episode to be the one that's the cheapest looking. I honestly had to pause the episode multiple times to process what I was looking at, it's not just that it looks bad, it often actively confuses. 
 
I think the last episode looks the best, and it's much easier to follow, but that's mainly because aside from an epilogue it focusses mostly on Marx coming to terms with his age and ill health. The section with him and his wife Jenny was surprisingly quite emotional. 
 
 
**The Education**  
 
 
I was expecting this to be a brief introduction friendly to people who knew nothing of Karl Marx, and I think that was the intent, but it often falls short. I personally think it might be better to skip episodes 1 and 2 and start with 3, not only do the production values increase but not much is lost. Though later episodes do still have some pretty serious issues.  
 
It presents the information in small chunks, but sometimes it does so in a way that only makes sense if you were already familiar with the topic at hand. The bits on Hegel and Kant are pretty blatant examples. Episode 2 covers the deep impression Hegel made on Marx, particularly the ""Dialectic"" but it doesn't explain what that is, and both philosophers and many others that pop up in the show are reduced to some very quick summaries that rely on terms that aren't in common usage.  
 
Another time Marx is outlining his ideas on Historical Materialism, and his brief explanation is overlaid random scenes on a street in Brussels, but the connection between what he's saying and the imagery is not made clear. 
 
Episode 5 the highpoint for me, is the best at this, it takes its time explaining some of the passages from Capital, and its framing works in the episode. It also has effective use of colorful imagery, the Vampire like a capitalist relationship. Other than that its main problem is its brief run time, big and important ideas and lessons are briefly mentioned and then everything has moved on. 
 
 
**The Revisionism** 
 
 
This overlaps a lot with both education and looks, but I wanted to make this its own section for clarity sake. While focussed almost exclusively on Marx, -with one exception to be dealt with later- it does reference and introduces, often for less than a minute some of the other political radicals that Marx rubbed shoulders with. Including his criticism of them. with the exception of Ruge whose briefly mentioned before he appears everyone else Marx interacts with just turns up is introduced by a brief nameplate, cross swords with Marx and either immediately leaves to be banished forever, or like Engels sticks around to become his admirer. 
 
Episode 4 takes this to the extreme. Wietling walks into the Marx home, is briefly introduced for his accomplishments, he then talks and moves incredibly smugly, talks about Christian communism for a bit and toasts himself before Marx speaks up. Every part of this scene, the dialogue, the character movements, facial emotions, etc. Is telling the audience to dislike him, but the argument between him and Marx is so quick and surface level its mostly just angry words. The only part of the disagreement that's clear between the two if you don't already know all about their ideas is that Wietling thinks workers allying with the bourgeoisie is a mistake because they are enemies, and Marx disagrees because of his views on history.  
 
Who was right? Well, we're supposed to sympathize with Marx and Wietling literally storms out of his house never to be seen again so I guess that's a win for Marx*. The International Working Men's Association is depicted as being the soul fruit of the labor of Marx, and it largely accords with his views. The reality was that it was a diverse body full of people he couldn't stand and didn't fall under his direct control until 1872 when it promptly hemorrhaged members and collapsed. 
 
In episode 6 there is a Marx/Bakunin standoff at the Hague Congress, Marx ridicules Bakunin as a conspirator, Bakunin has no allies, and he and his group are expelled. In reality Bakunin was never at the Hague Congress, Marx's motion to expel Bakunin failed, he was later expelled for questioning the new General Council, and when he left the majority of the membership also left, either to join him or like the other non-Marx non-Bakunin aligned groups like Blanqui's supporters simply to get away from the direction Marx was driving. The narration and the final episode don't acknowledge this at all, they give the impression that Marx's decision to prevent a split of the international, by well splitting the international was roaring success.  
 
This episode (heh) demonstrates a key failing in The Leader. It's supposed to be biographical, but it won't tolerate even mild and universally accepted criticism of Marx as a political advocate or as a human being. Marx is apparently faultless when I saw they were including Helene Demuth the maid I wondered if they'd dare depict him getting her pregnant. They didn't, it'd probably get in the way of depicting his relationship with Jenny as a fairy tale romance. His well-known binge drinking is also absent, at one point he even criticizes other revolutionaries for drinking too much. His behavior with his enemies real and imagined is always depicted as noble and correct, but it can't go into detail about their opposing views and criticisms even to set up their defeat, so it all comes across as extremely shallow, which also makes Marx the character seem shallow and clueless. Marx never really convinces by the power of his argument, he just registers his dislike and the reactions of the characters do the hard work of presenting this as a victory to the audience. 
 
 
**Self Sabotage** 
 
 
Again this is tied in with all the other examples. A bizarre fault with the show is that it kept undermining what it was trying to achieve. An early scene in episode one that seems based on that famous scene from Good Will Hunting with the Bully is supposed to establish Karl Marx as a genius but it totally undermines itself. Marx does this by reciting a very simplified explanation of Kant's views on dogmatism and skepticism, which shouldn't be a problem, but this is shown to stump all the other students, and more importantly, the scene immediately before that was Karl Marx in a classroom listening to his teacher tell him this. So we're supposed to be impressed by his ability to remember basic information told to him three hours earlier. 
 
Another example in episode 3 and 4 they address the poverty of the Marx family, but each time this done while the maid and his wife are onscreen in there expensive clothing, because they were too cheap to update their models. Shortly after criticizing Wietling, Marx starts ripping into Kriege's ideas on universal love, specifically the absurd notion that capitalists and lenders can be reached by appeals to their better nature. He's saying all of this to his good friend and dependable comrade Friedrich Engels, whom the show has established is a factory manager and was moved to become a Communist because witnessing the plight of the working poor appealed to his better nature. 
 
Lest you feel I'm being a bit hard, I personally agree with the criticism of Kriege, it's just that The Leader is just giving out mixed signals in its incompetence.  
 
Last but not least, there's the case of Pierre Proudhon. Engels gives Marx a copy of his Proudhon's new book Philosophy of Poverty. While Marx is holding the book unopened, two random people start throwing out snippets of Proudhon's beliefs. At which point Marx still holding the unopened book starts ranting about Proudhon's ""Petits-bourgeois"" socialism and declares he will write a criticism called Poverty of Philosophy. It was at this point that I wasn't sure whether some of the instances of self-sabotage were deliberate or not, Marx did write Poverty of Philosophy as an attack on Proudhon, and for many years it was considered a masterpiece in Marxist criticism.  
 
Until people started reading Proudhon's book, where it was discovered that many of Marx's criticisms were incredibly inaccurate if not made up. 
 
 
**Propaganda** 
 
 
AKA, the reason this was really made. The Leader isn't really supposed to be an educational text, its made to capitalize on Karl Marx and use his legacy to legitimize the Chinese Communist Party. The CPC fully supported the creation of The Leader, particularly the Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League and the  Central Office for the Research and Construction of Marxist Theory were involved. 
 
It was made and released just before the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx's death, and the first speech Karl Marx gives on the show “Reflections of a Young Man on the Choice of a Profession” was also chosen as an extract for Xi Jinping's speech commemorating the 200th anniversary.  
 
“If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually be at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.” 
 
 
Even the titles for the episodes sound like they were taken from propaganda posters 
 
1. Different Youth 
2. Defending the Rights of the People 
3. New World View 
4. Scientific Socialism Shines Brightly 
5. Great Work Das Kapital 
6. First International 
7. Marx Forever 
 
The name of the series The Leader isn't exactly subtle. But in case you didn't get it the last part of the final episode really drives it home. The ending credits are a timeline of key events in Marx's life, except for episode seven. In that episode, the timeline is replaced with a history of Marxism-Leninism, through to the present day in the People's Republic. Complete with a narrator praising Mao Zedong, then Deng Xiaoping then the Three Represents and then finally Xi Jinping. 
 
Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese Characteristics together will bring the people forward into a new era for China  
 
 
The intention is, of course, is crystal clear, Karl Marx is the indisputable leader of Communism, and the CPC is the heir to Communism, and so it is the heir to Karl Marx. 
 
There is some attempt to justify this posture though, in an early episode Marx is absolutely indignant at the oppression of peasantry by the landlord class, and the Paris Commune is criticized for not having strong central leadership. Also, Marx did briefly talk about the importance of theory adapting it to historical conditions and reality. Which the narrator echoes at the end by claiming that Maoism through to Xi is just the Sinification of Marxism. 
 
I also think though this is speculation that the propaganda potential of the series is the explanation for its poor production values, especially in earlier episodes. The series premiered on the 28th of January, with an episode a week, meaning it ended roughly around the anniversary date. If the decision to make the series had come late, with the anniversary being the hard deadline it must reach, then that would explain why the earlier episodes are the worst with the most obvious time and cost-cutting. The later episodes which look much better would have had more time available to work on. But even in the last episodes, there are obvious signs of short cuts in some sequences. 
 
**Conclusion** 
 
 
I think The Leader is doomed to be a curiosity unless the CPC believes it was successful at propagandizing to the youth of China I can't see this experiment being repeated. Its a shame but I don't recommend it, it's not without its charms, but the combination of animation issues, shallow information, and propaganda distortions -and there were many more examples I could have listed- leave this as something best avoided.  
 
Which is a shame, as I don't believe the idea of an animated series is without merit, the Manga adaptation of Capital was largely a success, the films Young Karl Marx and the West German film about Rosa Luxemburg were very informative and interesting to watch, and historical drama is becoming increasingly common and more refined. If the CPC didn't cobble this together to meet its targets and it was allowed artistic freedom it could've been something great. For all its faults the final episode was quite good so the people doing the actual work of making the production seem to have been capable of doing good work. 
 
* Incidentally this same episode covers the revolutions of 1848, during which time many of Europe's bourgeoisie eventually allied with their despotic aristocracy to destroy the more radical workers and student revolutionaries. So it seems like Wietling was largely correct on that point but this is never addressed.

But little does he know, that this is actually part of a plan for revenge. ",['Comedy'],"The story centers on Mai Tokiha, a seemingly ordinary high-school girl who has recently transferred to the prestigious Fuuka Academy with her younger brother, Takumi. The elite Fuuka Academy harbors a number of mysteries, involving both fellow students and staff. As they arrive at the Academy, Mai finds herself bound to a Child, a part-spiritual, part-mechanical creature, that can only be summoned and controlled by girls with the HiME mark.
Mai is told that she is one of twelve girls who have the aforementioned mark, and that they must use their powers to protect everyone from Orphans, monstrous creatures with abilities similar to the HiME's Children. Mai is very reluctant to become involved at first, because of her protective role towards her brother, but the other HiME quickly begin to manifest around her, each with very different motivations and goals for using (or not using) her powers. As the Orphans become more numerous and aggressive, Mai joins the other HiME's fight against them to protect those around her, including her friends, who are even drawn into the conflict as well. However, Mai and the other HiME soon find out the Orphans are not the only kind of enemy they have to fight, and as the cause of all of this is revealed, they find themselves facing the dark secret about their destiny.
","First, let me say that I gave this a 10, simply because I'm a big fan of the franchize and, surely, this special was pretty entertaining and nostalgic somehow. As I review, I'll give more suited rating. 
 
Story: It's a beach episode, actually. Yes, the good, old, never-getting-old beach episodes. But putting that aside, it revolves around tormenting Reito. Now's the time to say - if you haven't completed Mai-HiME, don't watch this. You won't get a thing. Now I must say, of all the specials I've seen, this is the most entertaining so far, it was funny, sort of a parody and hillarious. Some may not like that a lot of characters don't have lines and the special is only about the humour though. It was a simple story filled with smiles - Let's say an 8 ;) 
 
Art: I personally think, that the art is even more beautiful than the art in the anime itself. The animation was smooth, the shadows and light effects were nice, everything was drawn so well. There's this one scene though, when Reito turns back and looks at Mai and Mikoto - they got a little lazy there and it doesn't look alright. Still, a perfect 9/10 from me. This is by far, the special with the most awesome art I've seen up to date. And that's saying something. 
 
OST: Well, nothing new here, but if you're familliar with the soundtrack for Mai-HiME - then you shouldn't doubt that this gets a 10/10 from me. Also, never have I seen so many songs included in just one 4 minute special. Watch it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. The VAs did an awesome job as always, too. 
 
Characters: 9/10 Well, my only complain is that not everyone had their chance to shine, sadly. But still, for the 4 minutes at our disposal, the characters totally will grow on you once again. Everyone's acting like usual, but that's not always a bad thing. At the end of the special, I was already sobbing that there's no 2 season. They will make you feel nostalgic, that's for sure. Oh, and, Mai is acting pretty funny at the beginning so she actually made me like her a bit more, even though I'm not a fan of hers. And what's more - the heroine that brings me nuts /I'll save it for myself who she is/ actually didn't disturb me at all this time. It's all so nice and calmy; Perhaps you'll forgive those you hate, too. Even if just this once. Did I mention we have fanservice? Smoothly animated, too. 
 
Enjoyment:10/10  Well, I'm a Mai-HiME fangirl, so I didn't expect less. I knew I would enjoy it but really, it was even greater than I expected. If you are also a big fan like me, you'll most probably enjoy it. If not - you might; depends on your sense of humour :)

6,1803,30,7.479577013,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Dirty Pair: Lovely Angels yori Ai wo Komete,"Released direct to video in Japan after the original TV series was canceled, this OVA is actually the final two episodes of the TV series.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"Kei and Yuri, the World Welfare Work Association or WWWA Trouble Consultant Dirty Pai... er Lovely Angel team are at it again. This 2 episode OVA was to finish off the original Dirty Pair TV series which was cancelled after 24 episodes. I can only surmise that fan reaction was good and so the last 2 episodes got released as a 2 episode OVA. 
 
I was initially expecting something better, but Episode 25 of the TV series (1st episode of the OVA) followed in the same lines as the TV series. A short and simplistic plotline, with little to no character development, and the sound an animation had not improved at all. Not a good sign. In fact, what is sadder is in the 24 episode TV series the watcher actually finds Nammo (the robot) and Mughi (their cat) more interesting as characters. This is dispelled in Episode 26 though. 
 
The second episode of the OVA (Episode 26) was much more enjoyable. Kei and Yuri fight over a piece of cake at the start, making their cat &quot;Mughi&quot; the unwitting middlecat in their silly battle. They then decide to disobey orders to rescue their commander, Gooley, who is being held hostage. That episode showed more character development for the Dirty Pair than the previous 24 episodes of the TV series. 
 
Episode 26 was awesome on 3 levels, which actually elevated this anime from mediocre to fair (needed better animation to be Good). There was suspense, drama and a tight plot with emotional moments. Humor was evident, especially the scene where the 2 girls come out dressed as orange tabby cats, guns blazing! There were some great lines, like &quot;Men prefer breasts!&quot; and &quot;just like a woman you can't shut up!&quot;. 
 
Overall, this 2 episode OVA was better than the TV series, the second being much better than the first. For the 2007 standard, this series is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but nothing totally horrible either (except the old school animation). The characters and concept are very promising. The producers must have realized that with a little better animation, soundtrack and plot, the Dirty Pair franchise could take off - and they're right. 
 
I'm an outlier tho, I'm compulsive, so since I've seen one of the Dirty Pair movies (Project Eden) and liked it, I'm now compelled to watch ALL the rest of the Dirty Pair series. Here's to hoping the animation gets better for the rest of it.

His reconnaissance plane, Yukikaze (windblown snow) is the best tactical reconnaissance plane. His job is to collect battle information return safely to the base with the information. But one day when he about to finish his duty, an unidentified machine attacked him... 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Military', 'Psychological', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']",none,"Yukikaze is a breathtaking piece of work. At a glance it is unarguably about air battles, but don't mistake it for another 'Last Exile'. 
 
It is a mature work that requires a lot of effort in order to appreciate. The plot is complex and spirals in a maze that makes it hard to differentiate which is reality and dreams. Though it can be hard to decipher, it corresponds to the complexity of both Yukikaze's and Rei's personality.  The developing personality of Yukikaze and the repression of Rei's is fascinating and intriguing. Along with the frustration as an audience of the incomprehensible actions of Yukikaze and Rei resounds in Jack, who is Rei's commander and seemingly his only friend, it weaves an intricate story. Rei's inner struggle as he drifts between humans and Yukikaze is the feature of this show. Minus point for some plot-holes, but it otherwise leaves you gripping your seat through the battles and the winding plot gives a bittersweet taste at the end.  
 
The seamlessly woven cg and traditional artwork into the blend of raging air battle is absolutely heart-stopping. The sheer amount of detail is extraordinary and does justice to the story. The art direction emphasises the plots and the feelings of both pilot and plane, a feeling of isolation, alienation and occasionally frustration. 
 
This is not an anime to be missed for both lovers and haters of this genre. The time spent watching this was well-spent and most definitely unforgettable. 


          
 
       Helpful Gonzo spent a lot of money on Yukikaze. As a result it isn't just eye candy, it is one lush, decadent seven course feast. The meld between hand drawn and cg is near seamless and the characters are both beautiful and realistic. Afterburners generate realistic heat waves and jet fighters leave misty contrails in alien skys. The palette is somber and a bit dream like. Technical drawings are beyond reproach and much of the sound is taken from real aircraft and well matched to the action.  
 
The OAV is based on a novel, Sentou Yousei Yukikaze (Good Luck Yukikaze) by science fiction author Chohei Kambayashi. It is a mature and introspective, blurring the edges between the sane and insane. Between amazing flight sequences, the story muses about what happens to those who, in fighting to protect everyone else, distance themselves from the very thing they face death to protect. There is also a 2001: Space Odyssey like look at the relationship between a pilot and his seemingly sentient aircraft. It does feel like a lot of back story and character development was left in the novel or on the cutting room floor. Prepare to think hard and still not be quite sure what is going on especially in the middle episodes. 
 
The ending wasn't as strong as it could have been but it did deliver closure. I'm wondering if perhaps they spent so much money they had to cut production short. One wonders just what level of masterpiece this could have been had there been enough episodes to fill in the blanks.  
 
One reviewer calls it, ""A mix of military aircraft fanatic extravaganza, spectacular computer-animated aerial combat sequences, melancholy antisocial relationships, multi-layered allegory, and surreal imagery, Yukikaze is almost as strange and scattered as it is gorgeous. As interesting as it is, the plot seems to be missing key pieces and I'd call it something of an acquired taste."" I would agree. I loved it but not everyone will.

          
 
       Helpful Pros: very epic and detailed battle scenes. 
Cons: everything else... 
 
I was first attracted to this series purely by its title really. Yukikaze was the name of an eerily auspicious destroyer back in WW2. 
 
The series stages intensive battle action with futuristic fighter planes as well as epic background CGs. (As a guy, it's hard to not love those..)  The action is well presented, as I recall, with few or none repetitive missile firing/dodging clips, or stupid zooming in/out freezes, which tend to be prevalent in some other action animes. 
 
However, beyond the eye candies of the impressive battle scenes, I find the series having little else to offer. There is an alien dimension that has a portal to our planet earth, in which human exploration starts off defensive in nature to expansionary later. The alien dimension is later revealed to be some sort of collective entity (similar to AI) that only wishes to trap human inside and so to study them. The series is further enriched with its exploration on human-computer interaction, featured by the personified relationship gradually developed between the protagonist and his comrade AI Yukikaze as well as some additional touches on human greed, lack of mutual trust, etc. 
 
I must say, though, having promising ideas, nothing novel nonetheless, is far from enough to justify a good series. Developing the ideas thoroughly, perhaps on the way deploying some mind shockers, would do. Yet the series, while considerably lengthy altogether, is not quite there. There is much connection amongst the characters. Of the few interactions, the affection of the protagonist's big-brother-style superior towards the protagonist comes from completely nowhere. The obsession of the protagonist towards the AI Yukikaze remains a mere presumption of the series throughout the series without back up stories. And there is a whole sub-storyline of a news reporter that doesn't really assist the main storyline or create any shock factor. The series is good at mobilizing viewers' imagination by good visuals, but that's it. All the potential good stuffs really have to be imagined, as oppose to actually shown in the films. (Incidentally, I had trouble getting good quality copies of the series, which unfortunately further worsens my experience with the series.)  
Hence, overall, I gave the series 6/10, which I hope I have reasoned properly.

Sure, the art is quite good, same as the story line, which is as good as it can be in just 1 episode, but seriously, if you can't stand brother-sister relationships with no limit at all, you will find this anime shocking... 
 
Also, it comes quite close to hentai, it is extremely ""detailed"".  
 
Anyway, if you're planning to watch this OVA, prepare!

          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Incest something not really considered a good thing around the entire world yet in Japan it has some kind of concentration in some anime's, but actually seeing the brother and sister fall in love and actually having sex is a little too much for me. 
 
The story is about Aki Aoi and Sora Aoi (hence the name) who are both brother and sister, they have a close relationship and suddenly start developing romantic feelings for each other. 
That is pretty much the gist of the story basically it shows Sora's feelings for Aki increase and even though he tries to hide it and not accept it at first he eventually gives in just like his sister and they have sex which just felt really awkward and uncomfortable to watch, that is literally the story right there nothing more to say really. 
 
Since the show mainly concentrates on Aki and Sora the only development you get out of these people is the slow increase of their romantic feelings for each other although you do kinda see what characters their like. 
Sora despite looking like a woman is in fact a guy and surprisingly is the more mature of the family as he usually does the house chores and cooking, but he can seem like a weak person since he isn't very good at talking to girls other than his sisters. 
Aki on the other hand looks like an angel, but isn't very useful when it comes to housework, she even fails when it comes to cleaning her room yet she is very flirtatious around Sora and pretty much flirts with him to the point where he just gives to her. 
 
The artstyle lets say is very revealing much like your usual Ecchi and there really isn't much to say about it other than that. 
 
Pretty much the fanservice is off the charts and it even seems like a softcore hentai since there is a sex scene just without showing the private parts that would consider it a hentai, but everything else was there nude bodies, breasts and moaning hell there was even sound effects for the orgasms. 
 
Now when it comes to the Romance I'm really full on against Incest as long as the brother and sister are on the same page, but seeing them having sex with each other is just weird, uncomfortable and awkward this was probably one of the cringest things I have seen. 
 
Overall this is just something for people who could have their happy time considering how graphic it is, but honestly I would just stay away from this as much as you can before you scar yourself.

          
 
       Helpful Alright guys so this review will probably be the best and most accurate one! Basically its about a boy and his 2 sisters and one of the sisters love him (Incest). If you dont mind incest and LOVE ecchi as much as I do, then this 1 episode OVA is definitely worth watching! Its basically Hentai but it doesn't show private parts. But the scenes were enjoyable! Like I said, you cant go wrong with one episode lol. THIS IS NOT REALLY A SPOILER JUST FLASH BACK THAT HAPPENS IN THE 1ST MINUTE OF THIS ANIME (AHEAD). When they were kids they use to take showers together. But now its different but she still loves him the same way.

       Helpful Okay this is my first review :3 
 
Well, I think it's missing a review in Portuguese for the community about this incredible OVA. 
 
Asagao to Kase-san é simplesmente diferente de tudo que eu já vi (Sakura Trick, Strawberry Panic, Citrus, Bloom Into You). Retrata de um jeito espontâneo e sem exageros a relação entre as duas meninas principais. Não tem cenas desnecessárias, não tem situações revoltantes como Citrus (""Não podemos porque somos irmãs."") e a animação é simplesmente divina.  
 
A única parte que me decepcionou um pouco é que a menina mais alta parece ""o homem da relação"". Os pensamentos mais ""atrativos"" vinham sempre da Kase e a Yamada é mais envergonhada, inocente, o que causa um certo desbalanceamento na configuração dos personagens. Por que não pode ser duas meninas ""normais"" do colégio para se apaixonarem? Como ""Bloom Into You"" ou ""Strawberry Panic""? Uma sempre precisa ser masculinizada, algo que é um estereótipo na nossa sociedade atual. 
 
Então aqui fica a minha recomendação. Assistam, porque, realmente, vale muito a pena e o final é emocionante.

       Helpful It's short, it's yuri, it's beautiful.  
 
First off, you have to be aware of 2 things: 
- It is a promotional OVA for the manga with only a bit less than 1 hour. It basically summarizes/adapts a portion of the main story from like the first 11 (?) manga chapters.  
- It is purely romance, and yuri at that. So if you can't accept lesbian romance, this won't be for you. 
 
Other than that, it's simply a nice fluffy romance. There is no deep tragic drama (but it isn't completely plain either), it's the kind of romance you simply can lay back and enjoy the adorableness. 
 
The story revolves around Kase and Yamada, which are dating at this point. Kase being a tall, athletic, somewhat tomboyish and popular girl, while Yamada is basically the opposite by being small, clumsy, naive and insecure. 
__________ 
 
If you liked this OVA I highly recommend the manga, you get to see how they get together, many stories in between those 3 shown here, and also how it actually goes on after Yamadas resolve to go to Tokyo with Kase. That, and Yamada learns what a lesbian couple can do apart from ""only"" kissing... 
 
Personally, I hope that they will make a full anime adaption of this series. The characters are great, and the manga has enough content to cover.

","Although it isn't exactly long, I'll post a tldr regardless: 
1.Havent watched the original series yet? : The ova feels exactly like the anime and lives up to the hopes of the fans. Therefore this high rating.  
 
2. Liked season 1,disliked Zoku : Maybe you won't appreciate it.  
 
3. Liked season 1, love season 2 even more : The wait is over, you can probably rewatct it till they publish another few volumes and bring about a season 3. 
 
I've met people who liked the good old Oregairu part one and are put off by Zoku since things turned from being light hearted to intense. But then there are people who liked the show even more after Zoku. I obviously fall in the latter category.  
For those of you who liked season one over Zoku, this OVA won't be that memorable since it re-enact the feels from Zoku. Also, if you haven't watched the series and somehow stumbled upon this page and are wondering why everyone's giving it a 10 or so, the answer probably lies in the fact that people either absolutely love this anime or hate it. And since the release happened only yesterday probably the ones who disliked the show didn't bother to check out the OVA. 
Oregairu has always been a special anime for me. Also, since I just finished the OVA chances are that my opinions will be biased. But I don't even care about them being biased anymore since the mighty 8man and gang are back after almost an year.  
The story wasn't any deep, for those of you who aren't aware the 1st part of the OVA is a Canon and the second one isn't. The artwork was awesome as usual. The OVA completely retained the original style of the anime as mentioned by some other reviewers.

          
 
       Helpful 	As the release of Oregairu’s Volume 12 light novel is nowhere in sight, fans of this amazing series by Watari Wataru continue to thirst for any anime adaptation of what source material remains.  Luckily, for us, there’s volume 10.5 and this OVA covers this part of the light novels.  The wait has been gruelling, but as I burned through these 22 minutes, time passed awfully fast.  Does this short piece deliver on the heavy expectations of long-time fans? 
 
	Story (8/10): The events in Oregairu Zoku OVA happen in the midst of the second season.  As a summary, our amazing protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya, goes on a date with his kouhai, Isshiki Iroha, as she has requested weeks before, long forgotten in the main character’s memories.  The entire date is very enjoyable and is well adapted from the source material.  This enigmatic pairing has perhaps the best chemistry between Hachiman and a girl in the series because of the difference in behaviour that Iroha displays to him in contrast to her regular public image.  Their intriguing conversations have so many jabs and so much snarky wit embedded within them.  Hachiman and Iroha’s interactions carry the plotline for this OVA and make time pass incredibly quickly, a sign of an entertaining anime.   
 
         A portion of this episode is also taken by a hangout segment with the other two main girls, Yukino and Yui, and the cynical male.  This part lacks focus, as the evident lack of time can be seen by not adapting a different arc in volume 10.5.  They have replaced that slightly unnecessary section with an albeit filler 6 to 7 minutes, which brings down the story points marginally.  The ending photo is very satisfying however. 
 
	Art (8/10): Studio Feel does an amazing job with the art.  The visual quality in this OVA is comparable with the TV series or even better.  The style is very bright and polished.  Iroha looks amazing in this art style because of how bright her brown hair appears.  The backgrounds mainly comprise of standard urban scenes.  The main standouts are how beautiful the characters look.   
 
	Sound (8/10): The opening of this anime is my favourite of all time.  Yanagi Nagi is an amazing singer and the instrumentals are both uplifting and dramatic.  The chorus is incredibly catchy and the beginning hooks the viewer easily.  The buildup is effective in hyping up the viewer to the main portion with a fun drum roll.  Every part of the song is nearly perfect and even the lyrics relate very well to the anime’s overall message and theme (that of chasing one’s paths and ideals, pursuit of genuine relationships).  The soundtrack is the same as the TV anime, where some tracks may go unnoticed.  It has a few tracks that may stick out like the piano version of the opening, but the soundtrack itself is not spectacular.   
 
	Characters (10/10): The main character is my favourite character of any medium of all time.  Hachiman Hikigaya portrays the loner in such a way that it doesn’t alienate the viewer from his extreme viewpoint, yet easily relates his situations to the viewer.  Through the past two seasons, his deep character development and backstory along with the other main characters, Yui and Yukino, provide profound reasoning for how they act in the OVA.  Each character’s way of living makes sense through context, which makes each of these characters very likeable.  They all have individual, human flaws that make them endearing and a breath of fresh air from the standard anime cast.  
 
       From a superficial view, these characters look like cardboard cut-outs (Hachiman is an edgy self-insert harem lead, Yui is hot airhead, Yukino is generic kuudere jk), but they are given complex personalities that put them above the rest.  Iroha is also very interesting as a character.  She provides an interesting contrast between Komachi and her, where Hachiman’s little sister has a very cute and genuine personality and this other kouhai replicates the same personality type in a fake way.  The characters are all great. 
 
	Enjoyment (9/10): The date is remarkably enjoyable because of the shenanigans provided by it and the exceptional character interactions.  The OVA is mainly comedic or just slice of life because that is mainly the purpose of OVA type anime.  As explained by the story, this OVA episode definitely supplies any Oregairu fan with plenty of entertainment because anything of this amazing series is to be enjoyed.  When is volume 12? 
 
	Overall (8/10):  The Oregairu Zoku OVA is everything that the Oregairu fan wanted and possibly more.  After an unsatisfactory to the second season of the TV anime, anything decent involving more of Hachiman and co. is greatly appreciated.  Having a bit of source material left gives this OVA a good story and backbone for additional content and it delivers.  Although no OVA is spectacular or ground breaking, this one is still very enjoyable. 


          
 
       Helpful Somewhat of a mediocre OVA... which is strange because the first season's OVA was fantastic. 
 
This OVA does not continue the story of the second season but is rather a one-shot side story. It does not really advance the relationship of the characters  and does not reveal any important information, it's a bit more like the first season in that regard , given that it's mostly light hearted and flows pretty smoothly. 
 
However, the big flaw is that almost the entire run-time is dedicated to Hachiman and Iroha rather than Hachiman / Yuigahama / Yukinoshita. This is a massive downside to the OVA since Isshiki Iroha, love her or hate her, is not a main character, she became a strong supporting character in the second season but not strong enough to usurp most of the runtime of an OVA from the main cast. 
 
So I found myself struggling to complete this OVA. Not good, not recommended, can be easily skipped.

","When I saw this show being recommended after watching Lovely Complex, I had high expectations for it. I loved that show, so why not try something like it? I have a open mind for anime, I watch at least 5 episodes until I declare it unwatchable.  This is one of the few times I actually wanted to enjoy it, but ended up not doing that at all.  
 
I loved the main character girl, Kotoko. She was nice and overall the normal girl. But what I truly hated was Irie. While sure later in the story, its obvious they'll be together, the attitude of that meany makes me think that they will never be. He's mean and makes me want to punch him. What's even sadder is that she still likes him even if he treats her like crap. After a few episodes, I got tired of him and his pathetic attitude and gave up the series all together. Sure in Lovely Complex there were times that it was like this, but it wasn't in the very beginning and it didn't go on for like forever. So sadly, this is one of the anime that will get a low rating from me. 
 
Okay, enough ranting of story. :3 Let's keep going! 
 
Art was nice. Well drawn. Loved the emotions showed in characters and in background. 
 
Sound was nice also. Typical music in the background during show and opening and ending songs were good also. 
 
Character, I think I said it well in the intro but the rest of the characters were okay. I liked how they were, except the little brother and irie. 
 
Enjoyment was okay, but like I said the complete mean attitude of Irie really brought down the enjoyment. 
 
 
Overall? If they made it that Kotoko and irie be friend-ish (like in Lovely Complex) in the beginning and started the trouble in the middle, like Lovely Complex. It would've gotten me hooked, but sadly it didn't. So, I say a 3 out of 10.

       Helpful This amazing anime was aired almost  6 years ago and here I am, in the year 2014, still being stunned by how amazing it really was. The amount of emotions and character development just doesnt stop. There is hardly any cliff hangers which forces you to watch the next episode, no no no my friend, I continued watching purely because I just wanted more. Now, onto the review 
 
Story:  
Many viewers would probably judge this anime by its cover; a typical Shoujo and predictable. In a way, it kinda does, nevertheless, the story remained pure and innocent from start to finish. The concept of growing up and innocent love is just so beautifully portrayed. Not only does the story start from a simple high school crushes, the story continues further into the future, you really get to know the characters and the amount of emotions put into every scene. Another thing which was very well done was the pace of the story. What some viewers must understand is that this anime takes place in a matter of years, unlike other shows where the whole season was only.. say.. 1 school year. The events which takes place in the story and the emotional reactions was just so beautifully constructed and REAL. This story, didnt focus on any love triangle madness like other Shoujos, this one really focused on their bonding and self-fulfillment. And nevertheless, the ending was satisfying, no loose ends, even supporting characters gets their own closure :3 This is the type of storyline that I personally, speaking from someone from 6 years following the airing of this anime, is always seeking in todays mixed society. A nice, mellow, and smooth storyline  
 
Art and Sound:  
For its time, The art and drawings were well constructed. The backgrounds were beautiful. Im no art person but it was pleasant to watch :3 As for the sound and music. The OP and ED really set the mood.  
 
Characters:  
Oh My Lord, there is a mix of characters which just makes this show so enjoyable and wonderful! To start of, Kotoko. At first impression, She made herself out to be quite annoying and persistent and someone clueless on her surroundings but nevertheless, she was always so passionate and caring for the people around her. She was so entertaining to watch. and to see such character development in her just really made her pairing with Naoki more enjoyable to watch. Naoki was somewhat predictable but nevertheless, he really filled the void. His 'cold-heart' behavior just made all the sweet moments worthwhile. What i loved about this anime is that none of the characters  (except 1) was annoying. Even the rivals, strangely. You just cant help but love them all.. especially the Mum :P  
 
Enjoyment:  
OH, believe me, I enjoyed this anime to the NEXT level. I with they would make more stories like this. This kind of anime really was somewhat of a relaxing anime and something somewhat different. No love triangle mess, just pure love and journey of the characters hopes, goals and dreams. I will definitely will not forget this anime for a long long time.

Dumbfounded and skeptical, Saki is hesitant accept the request until Kokoro-chan reveals that Mohiro is a target of some cute, squirrel-tailed demons. 
 
Rushing to his side, Saki's overwhelming desire to save Mohiro activates her Love Power, and a daring confession awakens her as a Magical Girl. However, because her body is not suitable for combat, Saki's transformation turns her into a muscle-bound man clad in a pretty dress. Now, as a fully-fledged Magical Girl, Saki must team up with Sakuyo to protect the love of her life from the fluffy, demonic menaces that run rampant in her world. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']","An unpopular pop idol and middle high school student Saki Uno discovers that her mother, Sayori, used to be a ""magical girl"", but, as a result of back problems, found it necessary to pass her position down to Saki. With the help of a Yakuza-like mascot character named Kokoro-chan, Saki is able to transform into ""Magical Girl Ore"" to fight the cute-faced demons who threaten to kidnap her crush, Mohiro. Unfortunately, her magical girl form is that of a large, healthy, athletic, muscular man in a small, cute, girlish uniform, which is causing endless embarrassment to Saki. The situation becomes even more complicated when Mohiro becomes attracted to Saki's manly ""Ore"" form, and Saki's idol partner Sakuyo reveals her own attraction to Saki.
","Mahou Shoujo Ore presents a synopsis so great one may argue the actual anime isn’t necessary, since it’s unlikely it will reach the absolute zaniness of its premise. And to be frank, parody anime as a whole is a tricky business: jokes being repeated to exhaustion, plots that refuse to go anywhere (when it can afford to have a proper plot to begin with) and characters who are just basic archetypes tend to be the ground rule, which means the number of parody anime that manages to be something more than a bunch of random gags stitched together is ridiculously small. Binan Koukou Chikyuu Boueibu LOVE!, which also tackles the mahou shoujo/magical girl genre, made great use of its clichés in its first season a few years ago, while others like Hatsukoi Monster aimed to obliterate shoujo conventions, but in the end turned out to be nothing sort of a nonsensical mess. 
 
Thankfully, Mahou Shoujo Ore delivers much more than a glorious synopsis. It suffers from some of the problems I’ve mentioned earlier, especially since the plot struggled a bit to fulfill a 12 episode run, but it still manages to stand on its own two (muscular) feet. In fact, it’s a pretty solid parody title, perhaps even finding its way into the classic mahou shoujo canon someday.   
Still, the road traveled wasn’t always the most pleasant: things were rocky not only for our protagonists, but also for the show’s audience. 
 
“Unpopular female idols transform into brawny men in miniskirts in order to fight cuddly but evil demons” is the main gimmick here and the basis for most of the jokes, with commentary on idol groups and the anime industry appearing every so often. The comedy hits more than it misses, but since humor is subjective, you may find yourself scratching your head more than chuckling on some episodes given how inconsistent the jokes are. 
The first two episodes (aired back to back when the anime first premiered) are among the best structured, perfectly introducing the plot while delivering some solid laughs. A good amount of the humor is presented on how the animation for both the action scenes and character expressions are made to be pretty crude and abrupt compared to your average flashy mahou shoujo anime. The girls’ mascot turning out to be a scary looking yakuza with a soft heart is the best example of this. There’s a good amount of references which range from well-placed to “what was even that”, but they don’t overstay their welcome and are usually over rather quick. Still, this may test the viewer’s patience as the episodes go by. 
 
Animation is pretty crisp, the main focus obviously being the attractive muscular men that protagonists Saki and Sakuyo turn themselves into, but the aforementioned character expressions are also a treat to watch. The way the show makes fun of itself when they deliver some bad animated sequences is hilarious on its own, but when you realize it’s the same studio that gave us the extremely rushed and poorly animated Tokyo Ghoul:re adaptation, the irony is just too funny. Episode 5 goes as far as comparing Studio Pierrot Plus with a Godzilla-esque creature, showing that the writers clearly don’t give a f*ck. 
 
The characters are something of a mixed bag. They hardly change from the first episode to the last end card, to be quite honest. Character progression is still present though, albeit quite faintly, but it feels like it was tossed on to make the plot move forward for the most part. Saki and Sakuyo are likable enough for this to not be a major problem, but I can’t say much for the rest of the cast, although they aren't necessarily bad. While Saki's mom goes on to have an episode just to focus on her retirement as a magical girl, other characters like the male idol duo STAR PRINCE is basically there as plot conveniences, and this sucks quite a bit considering one of their members is both Sakuyo’s older brother and Saki’s crush. 
 
Voice acting is on point, with solid performances from the whole cast, though personally I feel that Kouji Yusa was underused as Hyuoe, with his best contribution being the vocals to some of the songs present in the anime. The opening track was the most generic song I’ve heard all season, but maybe the show was spoofing how simple your average mahou shoujo song is (WE MUST GO DEEPER!).  
The ending song fares a bit better and was stuck in my head for a while, not going to lie. 
 
Much like its protagonists, Mahou Shoujo Ore’s trump card is its charisma, which shines through even when the pacing is flimsy or the jokes are lacking. This is because it’s evident that the writers are having the time of their lives coming up with these (seemly) random situations. Every episode had at least one thing that I liked, be small jokes on the contracts the characters had to sign or the satire of idol “meet and greet” events, it has something for both new and veteran anime fans. 
 
Even if the series pokes fun at nearly anything, at the same, it feels like a love letter to the anime industry, embracing all the good and bad aspects of the medium. The confusing, but ultimately rewarding fifth episode showcases that very well, resulting in an inspired, lunatic masterwork that matches shows such as Gintama and South Park at their best. Name another anime which aired this season that referenced/made fun of Pokemon Go, anime production issues, School Days and the United States of America (and not just as throwaway gags, as this all contributed to the plot) in the span of twenty minutes. Yeah, even if you’re Barack Obama, you can’t. 
 
I enjoyed the heck off of this show (even with all its faults), particularly since I watched it with a good friend, and we breezed through these 12 episodes together always wondering what the hell would happen next. As much as it is silly, Mahou Shoujo Ore manages to stay unpredictable and vibrant from beginning to end.  
 
At the end of its run, I’m left satisfied for the most part. It’s a little show that is oozing with ideas and social commentary, even if some of it does gets lost among repeated gags and slow pacing. It didn’t turn out to be Madoka Magika part 4… but then again, who REALLY needs another Madoka Magika title?!

          
 
       Helpful Magical Bros turned out a way better and funnier than anticipated (or Mahou Shoujo Ore if you prefer). It's a thoroughly entertaining, if slightly uneven, magical girl parody that has plenty of funny meta-jokes, self-aware commentary, and a cast of likable characters. Perhaps it’s source material simply wasn’t long enough to be adapted into 12 episodes, but aside from some sluggish pacing around the series midpoint, it's a worthwhile watch.  
 
Even now, the plot synopsis sounds like a crazy fever dream. The first two episodes are supremely ridiculous parodies of a typical intro to a magical girl series. Protagonist Saki plays the straight man in a world of insanity, with hilarious well-timed reaction faces and her perfectly dumbfounded voice performance. Her mom already knows magical girls exist because she was one, contracted by the same scary yakuza guy who’s trying to sign on Saki. Even Saki's singing partner in their up incoming idol duo, Sakuyo, and their manager were totally chill with her magical girl transformation. Oh yeah, she transforms into a burly dude in a dress. Instead of using magic, she has to use her stick to beat the shit out of demons in bloody brawls complete with pixelated piles of bodies to censor the carnage.  
 
At first, it’s really funny to see how quickly everyone accepts her demon-fighting form as normal while she continues to freak out. This joke wears off as the show progresses, settling into a stable level of absurdity to give the story a chance to flesh out its characters. The show loves to make the joke of how much carnage magical girls would actually have to cause if they didn’t have flashy light effects, it comes up whenever Saki has to save everyday citizens from legions of fluffy demons. At the start of the show Saki has a typical fairy-like mascot flying around her while she dreams about becoming a magical girl and having her love interest Mohiro fawn over her; only to hilariously awoke to a ludicrous reality where her mascot is the mini yakuza guy floating around her and unable to even look at Mohiro without foaming at the mouth like your average horny harem protagonist dude.  
 
It’s not until both Saki and Sakuyo gain magical girl powers that they go from being total failures of aspiring idols (not one fan at their barren roadside concert) that they actually gain popularity. Seeing Saki’s offbeat singing pair with Sakuyo’s comparatively great performance is quite funny, especially when their manage bluntly criticizes how terrible she is. Thankfully the show gives him more screen time to become someone who’s actually likable, we understand why he’s so critical and wants to see them succeed by the end which makes the greatest development the series has to offer.  
 
Also, there’s a lot of singing in the first few episodes, the first sign that they’re stalling for time due to the meager 12 chapter manga being adapted. The singing was good unless it’s intentionally off-key then it’s quite goofy, Mohiro and his idol partner Hyoue were shown performing the show’s great ed song on a tv behind the girl’s empty streetside performance. Perfectly showing how far they have to go to catch up to Saki’s love interest who’s also Sakuyo’s brother.  
 
Their relationship quickly becomes something like a love triangle with Saki in love with Mohiro, Sakuyo in love with Saki, and Mohiro in love with Saki’s manly form. It’s sometimes cute to see but also the show occasionally portrays Sakuyo’s gayness as a threat to Saki (there was even a bad rape joke with Saki in bed crying while Sakuyo in manly form looming over her with a cigar). However, like most jokes in the show as it appears more often with increasing stakes it gets better. By the end, she becomes less of a threat and balances out to someone who’s trying to actually protect who they care about. It’s not a good portrayal of a gay character, but at least it doesn’t actively prevent you from enjoying the comedy.  
 
Ore takes any chance it can get to poke fun at the magical girl genre, idols, and the anime industry. It points out all of the glaring troubles idols face like not being allowed to date, the age limit, the extreme contract guidelines, and how they have to meet and shake hands with anyone (oh god the condensed milk joke). Also, like any good absurdist comedy, it's surprising and does whatever it can to subvert you expectations to maintain your interest. Whether it be a joke playing out differently than you first anticipating, or even the story taking a direction opposed to where it hinted it might go. 
 
The show also takes a whack at Kamen Rider the hero icon that was stomped out when Magical Girls became popular. Recurring character Ichigou Fujimoto is basically the embodiment of a modern Kamen Rider, living in a run-down apartment, having to make his costume out of trash, constantly being forgotten. He angrily scolds Saki for being one of those weak magical girls just annoyingly lingers around her from time to time. Like most of the supporting cast, he’s an entertaining digression from the main duo’s dynamic.  
 
It's clear that Mahou Shoujo Ore didn't have the highest budget. The animation is typically lacking, lots of camera shaking and so-so background art, but typically they make the best out of what they have. Whenever characters are drawn with the simpler style they're always expressing some over the top emotion like a typical reaction face would, so it saves money and improves the jokes. There’s plenty of jokes on the meager animation budget too; a monster that turns the backgrounds black and white, the camera cutting to the 'nice boat' meme during bloody action scenes, most hilariously the art quality being lowered to toddler level for one of the conflicts, and how episode 5 is a riff on the animation studio producing the show.  
 
The episode-long digression the show takes to rag on Studio Pierrot is funny and well made, but it has practically nothing to do with the show! It handles the Godzilla plot line even better than it’s latest anime incarnation, the monster representing an animator who just wanted the latest episode of Mahou Shoujo Ore to be released on time. Even so, this episode came out of nowhere and didn't develop any part of the story or characters. There's a lot of downtime in this show, so much so that it makes you wonder why they didn't shorten it to 10 episodes. The Godzilla episode was totally unnecessary, the hot springs episode was literally one joke for 10 minutes, so much singing, and the 'anime original' idol duo is just a copy and paste of Saki and Sakuyo but with less development. For all the time that Mahou Shoujo Ore wastes, it's mostly good content, and even when it's stalling out the plot progression it's still watchable.  
 
Score Breakdown: 
[Story: 6/10] Good twists, thoughtful commentary, pacing issues. 
[Art: 6/10] Lots of visual gags, detailed character designs. 
[Sound: 7/10] Nice music, emotive voice performances. 
[Character: 7/10] Likable and memorable supporting cast. 
[Enjoyment: 8/10] Absurd comedy, some repetition.  
 
[Final Score: 6.8/10] 
Mahou Shoujo Ore knows the limits of its budget and makes an enjoyable time out of it. I wish the insanity from the first few episodes was more present in the rest of the show, but I feel like I will remember this series more for the time it gave to develop the characters. Rather than leaving them as the one-note stereotypes meant to riff on similar shows, it surprises you and makes you want to see what absurd situation they'll be put in next. 

          
 
       Helpful A parody of the popular magical girl genre.  
 
Was it good? Not exactly. Actually, this show had some opportunities for success. The concept of a girl turning into a guy in a magical girl parody show isn't that bad. However, they seem to lose focus a lot. There isn't a lot of creativity when generating the scenarios of the episodes. For a parody and comedy show, it falls short completely. I mean, I'll admit, there are some scenes that are funny, but overall, it's pretty bad. There's just a lot of ""fluff"" and actual action, believe it or not, among all the episodes. Plus, there's a bunch of side characters that get entire arcs that are plain bad, like the mother arc, prisma arc, and the fujimoto arc. I just feel like the main cast isn't involved in those because the people making the show were running out of ideas what to write about. Honestly, if the episode scenarios weren't so bland, I think this show could have been very good. But instead, I just get some boring episodes. I mean, even the comedy isn't that bad. There are some good laughs out of those episodes, but the way the episodes turn out are just really predictable and mundane. You'd think a show focusing on comedy would have comedy, but I feel like there is more fighting than in an actual magical girl show. It doesn't focus on comedy, which is just a shame. Especially the ending, it tries to be comedic, but they really pushed it with the action.  
The characters aren't so bad, but Sakuyo is actually just hella boring. First of all, she only has a real personality when she transforms, and overall, there is practically nothing dedicated to her, other than the backstory we get. She's one of the main characters, come on. Do something with her, rather than just having her as an add on to Saki. However, most characters aren't bad. They just don't get much of a time to shine, since the plot is so boring. 
Unfortunately, poor storytelling does none of the characters justice, and this anime would be lifted much higher, if it only had better episode layouts.

6,30531,37,7.235976374,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Gakuen Handsome The Animation,"The school love story is set at Baramon High School, a private boys' school for the prefecture's most elite. The protagonist is a seventeen year old boy who transfers into the school and meets various major players on campus, such as the outlaw teacher, the soccer captain, and a childhood friend whom the protagonist has not seen for seven years. The school presents opportunities for friendship, love and conflict, and changes are now bound to happen in the main character's life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"Parodies are always a pleasure to watch, because we know that the authors themselves aren't serious at all. ""Gakuen Handsome"" wonderfully parodies the vast world of Boy's Love (BL or yaoi), exaggerating everything and taking the parody to a whole new level - from the art to the non-existing plot with ridiculous situations, and even adding references to poop. 
 
I first learned about BL parody when playing the BL parody game ""Kusoge"", featuring the same parody type (and ridiculously long chins) than ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
It was so funny that I searched for more BL parodies of this type, and I stumbled upon a walkthough of one of the ""Gakuen Handsome"" games by a Japanese YouTuber, and it was so good that I watched the entire thing, along with the two MVs of the official character songs that were as funny as the rest. 
 
I was so charmed by this unique and strange... thing, that I was overjoyed when an OVA was announced. 
So here is my review, though I don't really know if it can be called a review because the ""Gakuen Handsome"" franchise is so out of this world that it... it honestly can't be reviewed. But I'll try my best :> 
 
[Story & Characters] 
The plot of ""Gakuen Handsome"" parodies the undying scenario of the average naive young transfer student, entering a new school to be almost immediately surrounded by a harem of bishounen ready to die for him (thumbs up for the headmaster and his little sister pairing up to encourage him in his love life). 
All the situations were very funny, and ended up with such enormous nonsense that I laughed a lot. 
The characters, that remained just the way they were in the original games, are such enormous cliches that it's hilarious. The kind childhood friend, the dangerous young teacher, the serious class representative and the cold classmate, among others, were perfect in their respective roles. 
 
[Art] 
""Gakuen Handsome"" being... well, ""Gakuen Handsome"", you obviously can't expect much from this wonderful parody, and The Animation kept this same crappy Flash animation used in the previous games and MVs. The poor animation serving the non-existent plot is fully part of the enjoyment, along with the ridiculously pointy bishounen chins and the strange moves and dances that pop up for no reason at all. 
 
[Sound] 
Unfortunately, and at my despair, the production staff entirely recasted the voice actors, leaving behind the hilarious voice acting of the games (bye bye, Sakuya's voice that made me cry of laughter). Instead were, among others, the well-known voices of Hanae Natsuki (Kaneki Ken@Tokyo Ghoul, Arima Kousei@Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and Kahikara Tetsuya (Natsu Dragneel@Fairy Tail). 
The new seiyuu, being pros, did an excellent job with voice acting, but I feel that they made me laughed way less than in the games, because even there the voice acting sounded so unprofessional that it was used as a parody feature. 
In a way, I felt that the new cast was too professional for an unique license such as ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
About the rest of the sound - honestly, I was so focused on wondering what I was doing with my life that I didn't pay much attention to it. 
 
[Overall] 
I can safely say that I laughed way more with the original games than with ""Gakuen Handsome: The Animation"", especially because of the cast change for the anime. But it was still great to watch, and I recommend to every anime viewer who wants to have some fun and gently make fun of the BL genre. 
If you're interested in more things like this, I recommend the visual novel ""Kusoge"" (lit. ""shitty game) <3

6,1553,38,7.179239913,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Queen Emeraldas,"The story revolves around a race that seeks to dominate the galaxy. A lone mysterious female warrior, known to others as Emeraldas sails the endless planets of the universe- in her Seas of Star ship- fighting the tyranny of that merciless race. She is tormented by the memory of her lost love. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","The storyline follows a young boy named Hiroshi Umino (海野広) who sneaks aboard a freighter in order to leave Earth. As the freighter is flying through space they are attacked by an Afressian ship bearing the Skull and Crossbones insignia. However, the train is saved by a mysterious and incredibly powerful spaceship (which also bears the insignia) and is able to make it to their destination, a desert planet with a Western atmosphere, complete with saloons and bar fights. The boy meets up with another stowaway, an old man, and becomes friends with him. He tells the old man that he came to the planet in order to become a stronger individual. He gets himself a job in a bar with the roughest reputation on the planet to prove himself.
When the attacking ship, led by Captain Eldomain (エルドメイン大佐), lands on the planet to search for whoever attacked him, Emeraldas appears to confront him, demanding that he remove the insignia from his ship; ""Only two ships have the right to bear it!""  In the second episode, after a final confrontation with Eldomain and later with Queen Baraluda (女王バラルーダ), of Arfess (アルフレス), Emeraldas presents Hiroshi with the Cosmo Dragoon once owned by Tochiro.
Another divergence from the manga takes place here when Emeraldas states that there are five Cosmo Dragoons in existence (hers and the ones owned by Tochiro, Captain Harlock, Tetsuro and Maetel), whereas in the manga there are only four. Later, Hiroshi Umino and his elderly friend visit a planet whose inhabitants have been forced out by a murderous cyborg. This cyborg killed one of the planet's inhabitants and drove his son mad. Umino meets the son and his sister and with their help and Emeraldas', he kills the oppressive cyborg.
While the story can stand on its own, independent of Matsumoto's other works, it mostly assumes that the viewer has seen the other Harlock titles, especially Galaxy Express 999 (the TV series and the movies), which featured Maetel, Emeraldas' sister, but had the occasional appearance of Emeraldas (Note: Maetel, for some reason in the English dub is referred to as Mataire). The story of Queen Emeraldas is set five years after the events of the final Galaxy Express 999 movie and was designed to give Matsumoto's fans a further glimpse into what became of Emeraldas. However, of the other characters, most are only mentioned in passing, except for Captain Harlock who has a brief cameo appearance.
Queen Emeraldas first two episodes were produced by OLM, Inc. and licensed for American distribution by ADV Films, being one of their earlier releases on the DVD format.  Those two episodes also have regular runs on the Action Channel. In Japan, the remaining two episodes were produced by MAC (Multi Access Company) and were released the following year after the initial two, indicating that a separate contract (that is not yet forthcoming) would be required for anyone to license the concluding episodes of the story outside Japan.
","As one of the more mysterious and sufficiently badass women residing in the vast Leijiverse, her boundaries as a side-character rarely failed to aggravate me in her various cameos as the sincere fanboy I identify myself as. I'm talking about the space pirate Emeraldas who had to wait for 1998 to come before she finally got an OVA of her own. I just finished watching it and hopefully this review will provide a considerably more objective assessment than my rampaging fanboyism logically would allow.  
 
Story: 5/10 
 
The Leiji Matsumoto pattern has made it clear that a young and ambitious male protagonist is likely to emerge whenever a story needs to be told and Queen Emeraldas proves to be no exception. This time, the tale concerns Hiroshi Umino who ironically gets more screen-time than the titular character herself. Basically, the story is comprised of a series of coincidental encounters these two characters have with each other and the opponents they more or less face co-operatively as Umino aspires to grow stronger and explore the universe in the liberal spirit he shares with Galaxy Express 999's Tetsuro.  
 
I'd like to make it clear that this OVA seems to exist in order to provide some background information on a popular heroine and as such does not bother too much on developing its narrative. There is a troublesome lack of continuity present and it seems like Umino's repeated meetings with Emeraldas are just random plot devices created to establish a friendly relationship based on coincidence. All in all the story is not particularly strong but comes off as decent. 
 
Animation: 6/10 
 
For the first time I got to witness a Leijiverse title with detailed scenery, fluid movement and wonderful character designs. A most welcome delight! Queen Emeraldas applies a few instances of horrible CGI but generally maintains a great and stylistic approach that qualifies to the contemporary standards. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
Emeraldas was apparently deemed awesome enough to get her own theme song and, musical appeal aside, it does match her personality and epic characteristics quite a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is decent but seems to be a lot more timid. 
 
As far as voice acting goes, the two protagonists are portrayed in praise-worthy manners and Emeraldas in particular has the virtue of being voiced by the same woman who starred as Oscar from Rose of Versailles.  
 
Characters: 7/10 
 
Sigh. Assigning a 7 to the ""character section"" of an anime in which one of my favourite characters of fiction resides doesn't quite seem right. However, as much as I'd like to call Queen Emeraldas character-driven, even that term feels strangely out of place. There's nothing particularly wrong with the characterization, it's just that there isn't any in abundance. We get to witness Emeraldas's inner feelings; her motives and a past that has shaped her as the cynical heroine she has become. But those who watched Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express already knew those things about her and little of the material is actually new. Then there's the modernized Tetsuro and a few diabolic villains that create a diversity that's not as amazing as expected. 
 
All in all, the characters in this OVA aren't bad at all (look at the 7 damnit!) but given that most titles in the Leijiverse seem to be character driven, it certainly doesn't reach the standard. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Despite my harshness I'd like to emphasize that I greatly enjoyed this title as an opportunity to watch one of my favorite heroines show off in a story that seems to be designed in favor of her awesomeness. It quite accurately falls into the ""Guilty pleasure"" category with a heavy focus on space battles and fencing but still reaches at least mediocre heights of story-telling and disappointing yet sufficient character portraits. Recommended to somewhat initiated Matsumoto fans but might not work quite as well as a gateway drug.

          
 
       Helpful It's hard to really write a review, the last 2 OVA ep3-4. Are hard to find items.. in any form. For what was seen ep1-2.  This is worth the ownership, Great if a fan of any of the Harlock-Galaxy 999 Fans.  Again i feel i can not write a true review untill i see ep3-4

          
 
       Helpful I’m going to start off this review with a disclaimer: If you’re thinking about using this OVA as a starting point for getting into Captain Harlock, turn away right now. With that said, for anyone who’s already a fan you’ll probably enjoy this OVA just because it’s loosely Harlock related and that you’ve probably come to expect very little from anything beyond the original series anyway. 
 
First off, the few good things the series has: 
 
1. The story. Despite the shortcomings of basically everything else, the story itself is actually quite good. The series has great pacing, fun characters, and an interesting overarching plot.  
 
2. The action sequences. Although a little uninspired the fighting throughout is some of the best in Harlock. There are cosmo guns, gravity sabres, cloaking fields, energy shields, lasers, missiles, space battles, and a giant robot horse. 
 
Now, onto the bad: 
 
1. It’s not actually about Emeraldas. Despite what the title may have lead you to believe the series is actually about a young boy named Hiroshi who dreams of building his own spaceship. Emeraldas acts as his watchful guardian and that’s about it. If you were thinking you’d get to finally see a series with some focus on Harlock’s most alluring and mysterious ally you were wrong. 
 
2. Being an OVA you might assume its self-contained, well it’s not. The series doesn’t end on a cliff hanger or anything but it’s pretty obvious the plot was intended to continue on. 
 
3. The animation sucks (kind of). The first two episodes are pretty solid but the studio was switched halfway through and the latter 2 episodes are visibly worse. Especially the characteristic Leiji Matsumoto eyes which the second studio never seemed to get right. The series also has a penchant for 90’s 3D animation which I assume was all the rage at the time but now looks hilariously bad. 
 
4. The dialogue is terrible. By the end of this 4 episode OVA I estimate you will have heard Emeraldas say “I am Emeraldas” about 14 times. I don’t know what happened but the show really fell flat in this regard. 
 
Ultimately this is a series that you should only watch when you’ve exhausted all other Harlock options. In that regard it’s enjoyable enough, I certainly didn’t hate it but it leaves a lot to be desired. The real tragedy however is simply pondering what could have been. Emeraldas was a fairly underdeveloped character before this OVA and she continues to be afterward but it’s obvious they were setting up for something big. I’ll let you see how it plays out but there’s a lot of foreshadowing and then it seems to end before it even really gets started.

Unsubstantial episodic fluff? Check. 
 
The characters are also not Ore Monogatari!!'s strengths. Takeo's unconventional looks for a male shoujo lead feels gimmicky. While it's true that he was ridiculed by the girls he liked back then, it was glossed over and the series portrayed him as a someone who is much loved by everyone. Swap him to a bland looking guy  but retain his behavior and we will still get the same results. Suna is the most interesting character in the series for being observant while emotionally distant but was not given proper development. Yamato was not given much task aside from being cute and a doting girlfriend. 
 
You cannot also rely on the show's humor as it borders too much on slapstick or events which require the audience's suspension of disbelief (Takeo's blissful ignorance of a 'university exclusively for females' and the restaurant incident.) There are also some episodes that are reminiscent of countless romantic anime before and bore the heck out of the viewers. 
 
No major conflict occurred in this series which might shake Yamato and Takeo's relationship. What we received is their daily fluff that while admittedly sweet, is never substantial. Yet to dismiss Ore Monogatari!! as bland is also not warranted as it shows occasional moments of excellence. 
 
The musical score of Ore Monogatari!! was one of the year's most moving and was used in perfect timing with emotional scenes. The voice actors also did their best (although Takeo sounds grating at times) to bring these characters to life. Ore Monogatari!! is also a rare case where the ED is much better than the OP. 
 
When it gets its groove, it really stands out. In Ore Monogatari!!'s defense, it only took three episodes before Takeo and Yamato became a couple in the most awkward yet endearing way possible. The poignant scenes in this series are really moving and hit the right spot for shoujo junkies. The couple's technically second kiss counts as one of the finest moment of 2015. However, episodes revolving the side characters (Suna's sister, Shijou and Yamato's friend) and Suna are the better representatives of this genre for being believable and well-developed characters.  
 
These flashes of brilliance do not absolve this series for playing too safe and for following religiously to the tropes which made the shoujo genre dull.  So probably, maybe, it will be a long time before a series can dethrone Kimi Ni Todoke as my most favorite conventional shoujo series.

Story: 2 
The first few episodes were really good because it was something different (from what I've seen). An unpopular guy amongst girls, who's not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl's feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins... 
Or so I had hoped. 
 
I should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both like each other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on. So the focus then shifts to other people and their relationships but it's executed quite boringly. When the focus is back onto their relationship you can always expect Takeo to misunderstand, overreact or ""SUKI DA"".

After the first few eps, it becomes tedious to even watch it while eating. If you want to watch it, watch it for the first few eps then don't bother because they will basically be the same.

Most overrated anime this season. Starts of great then becomes 'mystery meat' stew where you basically know you're getting one of few choices and where each choice is bad in itself.

          
 
       Helpful I was reluctant at first to watch this thinking it was just a dumb anime to waste your time for, but I never been so wrong. I tried it and it was one of the best anime I've seen so far. It actually has a similar theme with beauty and the beast .  The bromance between Gouda and Suna has real feels on it and the relationship between Yamato and Gouda is just pure and absolutely sweet. I highly recommend this anime if you want to have an ear to ear smile and feels after watching it. I really enjoyed this series and would not even bother to rewatch it again someday.

(Source: Funimation Films)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Scub Coral
Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it has been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (スカブ・コーラル, Sukabu Kōraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (コーラリアン, Kōrarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are:
Command Cluster Coralian
The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its ""body"". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state.
Kute-class Coralian
A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels.
Antibody Coralians
Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z.
Human-form Coralians
Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them.
Trapar waves and lifting
In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (トランサパランス・ライト・パーティクル, Toransaparansu Raito Pātikuru), dubbed Trapar (トラパー, Torapā) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for ""lifting"" (リフティング, Rifutingu, or ""reffing"", according to some fan translations, as well as official translations in some countries) is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called ""reflection boards"" (""ref boards"" (リフボード, Rifubōdo) for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar—massive humanoid fightercraft—are a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral.
The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. 
An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the ""Amita Drive"", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the ""Seven Swell Phenomenon"". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.
","My biggest worry going into this was about the rumor that they were going to add original footage about Adroc Thurston and the Summer of Love. One of the key thematic arcs of the show was Renton's feelings of resentment for his father's reputation as a hero, having to live in the shadow of someone who lived this exciting life and became a hero to the entire world. We never got to see the Summer of Love in the show, so the gravity of what Adroc did got to be filled in by our imagination. How could they actually depict Adroc's sacrifice and make it stand up next to our imagination? 
 
By showing us just the last hours of his life and filling them with a million explosions as the world goes to fucking shit all around the main characters. 
 
The strategy of not explaining the complete nature of the Summer of Love or Adroc's part in the creation of the Silver Box that caused the Seventh Swell we see didn't just preserve the mystery of Adroc that is so core to the show: it accentuated them. Now we get to have our cake, this action-packed climax to the man's life, and eat it to by knowing just the right amount more about what occurred, such that the original show isn't tarnished. Not only is this a 10/10 masterpiece, it makes the original 10/10 masterpiece even better by proxy. 
 
But that's just the first 20-30 minutes or so. What the movie is actually about is Renton's relationship with Charles and Ray. I can't properly describe you the emotional swell I felt as the realization dawned on me that this wasn't going to be a straight rehashing of the show. The first part of this trilogy is a stylish re-edit of my favorite arc from one of my favorite shows of all time. I could cry. It was so beautiful to see, even if the 4:3 aspect ratio is outdated next to the widescreen of the opening and the remastered animation is still quite obviously TV-quality, not modern film quality. But what should we have expected? Bones to animate the sides of the frames so that all the scenes could be in widescreen while all the action was in 4:3? Nah. The Charles and Ray arc from the show can stand on its own very easily, so save that money for higher concentrations of original footage in 2 and 3, please. 
 
Charles and Ray is a microcosm of everything Eureka Seven was about. Renton meets them as the spoiled child who has rejected Eureka because of she wasn't the dream girl he idolized and expected her to be. He leaves them as someone who has a better grasp of the need to listen to other people and understand their differences so that he can respect them and go through the world more confidently. Making a movie about his relationship with them as a separate thing from his relationship with Eureka makes sense to me because it can be a standalone about growth in the aftermath of an undescribed massive disaster like Acperience was for Renton and Eureka. This very closely parallels how the show as a whole is about growth in the aftermath of the Summer of Love. More than that, the arc's presentation is edited and intercut such that the emotional gut punches of the arc just keep coming and coming and coming in an extremely methodical way. 
 
Using the lens we were given in Hi-Evolution 1 (and assuming for the sake of useful argument that 2 and 3 are strictly content from the show), I would totally expect someone only interested in watching the movies to get a good understanding of what Eureka Seven is about. They get a thematic summary with 1, then they'll see Renton grow up from nothing to a hero alongside Eureka while she does the same over the course of two more films. I'm extremely looking forward to that and whatever the hell they have planned for those soccer KLFs and idol singing in the next episode preview. 
 
Even if you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen the series, this is an unforgettable way to experience an excellent arc of it (again, my favorite) in a new way. See this. It's not a replacement for Eureka Seven; it's a peerless companion to it. SEE THIS.

Well, Studio Bones is at it again! Out of all the original series they make (and they’ve made plenty) Eureka Seven seems to be a favorite to many. But to be fair, why wouldn’t it be? The original 2005 series is a stone cold classic, with its arresting visuals, compelling lead romance, and just a grand adventurous tone through and through. I’ll make it no secret that I love it dearly, and its been my favorite anime for nearly 6 years now. It just does so much wonderful that I can’t help but wear a smile anytime I rewatch it. 
 
Unfortunately, with that much praise comes bank to be made on it. And with that bank comes Bones trying to make the magic strike once again. Their first attempt, Pocketful of Rainbows, was an alternate take on the series featuring some reused footage and had some interesting ideas going for it. It was never going to live up to the original, but for what it was it was harmless. The same cannot be said for their next attempt: the infamous Eureka Seven AO. Truth be told, I haven’t seen it myself. But everything I’ve heard makes it seem like seeing it would be the last thing any fan of the original would want. AO was pretty much the lowest point in the series, and many just thought it was done after such a botched follow up. 
 
Perhaps trying to wash away AO’s taint, Bones is taking the old horse out for another try. The Hi Evolution trilogy was announced last year, with the original staff and cast from both languages returning. With the first installment releasing last year in Japan, nerves have never been more on edge. Fans waiting with baited breath to see if they shit the bed once again. And from the first screening at Otakon last summer, reception was...mixed at best. Much of anitwitter was ablaze, claiming that the bed was indeed shat in; some going so far as to say that it was just as bad, if not worse than AO. But with its American release finally here, it must be asked: do those claims ring true? Is Hi Evolution 1 just another blemish on the original? Is it truly worse than AO? To answer this, I must put aside my biased love towards the original series. And now I can say with confidence that this new film is, surprisingly, really damn great. Though truthfully not for everyone. 
 
The overall plot of the film can be broken down into two parts: the first is the story of the Summer of Love. That often talked about but never shown event is finally shown in full glory, as is the story of the man who saved the world, Adroc Thurston. The second part shifts the focus onto the familiar face of Renton Thurston, as he reflects on his past experiences with both Eureka and his adoptive parents, Charles and Ray. For in this continuity, Renton was adopted by the Beams right after his father vanished, and so it’s from them he runs away from to follow Eureka. 
 
Let’s get the obvious praise out of the way: The Summer of Love section is amazing. The first 20-25 minutes is basically one big action scene, and it is jam packed with awesomeness. We’ve got Scub antibodies blasting away at KLF units. We’ve go lasers and missiles flying sky high and exploding into big beautiful bursts of color. We’ve even got a giant missile that transforms into the equivalent of a rave party; god almighty, it is amazing. But it doesn’t stop there, we’ve got plenty of great character moments to boot. It’s great to see Charles and Ray again, and they get a bulk of the early action in the scene. Holland and Dewey actually looking out for and calling each other “brother” is something i never knew I wanted, and it's amazing. It’s impossible to watch it without feeling pumped up. 
 
What’s more, they actually manage to one-up the original series by actually giving Adroc some character. In the series, he was dead by then, and more acted as a symbol for many of the characters. Here, he’s given some depth and it’s quite well done. The film portrays Adroc as a man who genuinely wants to help the world. Someone who is desperate to stop a doomsday plan he created, and laments all the pain caused by his actions. It really succeeds at humanizing him, making him more than just the legendary figure of the original show. All those elements makes his sacrifice all the more powerful in a truly beautiful sequence. The entire Summer of Love was just one big lump of fanservice to the original show, meant to please the fans in every possible way, and it unquestionably succeeded. And then the rest of the film happened and things got more complicated. 
 
See, the controversial reception this film has doesn’t come from the story being told. No, it comes from the way that it was told. Hi Evolution 1 takes a decidedly non linear approach to telling Renton’s tale. Signaled by the words “Play Back” and “Play Forward”, the film leaps throughout parts of Renton leaving the Gekko and his reunion with his adoptive parents. Fans of the original series will recognize these events, in particular Renton’s encounter with the Vodarac girl and his specific reason from running away in the first place. Many have complained that this style of storytelling was too confusing and hard to follow, but for me it wasn’t so. Everything followed a thematic throughline about Renton’s maturation, and it didn’t hop along too large of time gaps. Plus, if you’ve seen the original show, you should know where these events line up time wise. The criticism perhaps comes from how unexpected it was, which while certainly true proved to shake up the original version of these stories. 
 
To be frank, the film basically requires you to be familiar with the original series. It doesn’t really touch on Renton’s life aboard the Gekko, nor his relationship with Eureka; instead assuming you already know about everything Renton went through and giving the new information needed for this trilogy. Some may be aghast at those changes, and while I sympathize, I must also disagree. Had the film gone over that material it would’ve basically been the same as in the original series. Then you would’ve had people complaining about how the film retreaded too much of the same stuff. Some may certainly argue that reusing moments from the series in the first place was a mistake, and while that may have merit, the way they went about telling it was the most interesting approach. 
 
Some will also be disappointed to know that the focus is kept primarily on Renton. In fact, the film kind of turns into a character study of him, squaring in on his reasons for running away and his own problems with relating to Eureka. The elements explored are similar to the ones from the TV series, but they are different. Most notably, it is much harsher on Renton. This section of the original show was a dark time for him, and this film carries that over very well, and then some. It explores how, while he genuinely wants to be a good person, it’s difficult for him to understand what people really want. This was lightly touched on in the series, but here it’s put more front and center as the big character hurdle Renton has to overcome. It’s no coincidence also that the scenes taken are the ones that most strongly reflect that theme. 
 
His encounter with the Vodarac girl proved to be the key example of that hurdle in the original series, and it’s just as much here, but different in a subtle way. In the original, after Renton is brought back to the Swan, Charles comforts him by saying that he doesn’t begrudge his actions; that what he did was “the right thing to do as a human”, but that they didn’t know if the girl really wanted what Renton thought she did. In Hi-Evolution, while Charles still sympathises with Renton, he’s fairly more harsher on him: saying instead that Renton did what he truly thought was right, but that there was no way he could have known if it was for the best. It’s a subtle change, but Hi-Evolution’s version call Renton’s actions into question more and is shown to have a bigger impact on him. And while we don’t see much of her interactions with Renton here, Eureka is shown to be different as well. She’s a lot colder emotionally than she was initially at this point, and her conversation with Renton before he runs away shows that as well. She, too, was more willing to draw attention to Renton’s actions, and the repercussions they had. As such, in the same way that Adroc’s sacrifice is strengthened by his characterization, so too is Renton’s when he once more leaves Charles and Ray. The production name of this film was “Renton Seven”, and that is undoubtedly what this feels like; a story about Renton, his maturation, and where he will go from here. 
 
If I had to point to the films largest shortcomings, it would be its attempt at trying to appeal to newcomers. Text appears often that is meant to explain certain elements that may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Some are actually quite helpful and interesting, such as one explaining the Trapar Waves and the military connections of the characters. Often, however, it’s just running down information that is somewhat unnecessary, and often actually spoil some parts of the series. If they wanted to get newcomers in, they shouldn’t have revealed Eureka’s identity as a human form Corallian, for instance. In fact, I get the feeling that even the writers were aware of the issues with the constant text, and actually played them for laughs in some cases. There’s a text line about helmet wearing rules in Bellforest, and even one explaining what tacos are. Still, the text is somewhat easy to phase out of your mind. But it was a mistake to try to appeal to newcomers in a film like this. This is a film for fans, first and foremost, and we already know most of this stuff.  
 
In terms of visuals, the film devilers in a way you may not expect. Obviously, the Summer of Love is the high point: it’s a delectable smorgasbord of mecha action, gorgeous shot composition, and is a true sight to behold. It’s probably some of the best giant robot footage put to the big screen, and among the best Bones has produced. But after that, the film heavily uses footage from the original series during Renton’s portion of the film. Many have criticized this as a lazy move, and while new footage would’ve been amazing, its use is actually kind of smart. Using it during the primarily flashback-centered part of the movie is thematically appropriate; just as Renton remembers what’s happened to him, we too remember seeing these events from the original. But they didn’t just slap the old animation on and call it a day; they’ve actually cleaned it up quite a bit. Subtle changes to the line work, new background elements, even redrawing some scenes for a greater effect. What was once the Ray=Out magazine is now a governmental propaganda magazine, Hardfloor album covers are seen on Charles’ wall. My favorite would be a certain character appearing to have a vastly different role here, even if she doesn’t appear physically. It succeeds in giving off a surreal vibe; a feeling that what your watching is Eureka Seven, but is still different from the original. Admittedly, the aspect ratio change during this part is annoying, but it’s a minor detail for me at least. 
 
Naoki Sato returns to the score, and it’s as great as ever. The film doesn’t rely too heavily on his original pieces from the TV series (I think they use one song from it and that’s it). Highlights include pretty much the entire Summer of Love sequence; that booming orchestral score is just eargasmic (is that a word? I hope so). In a surprising move, german trance musicians Hardfloor composed a song for this: Acperience 7. Playing during the Summer of Love, it’s a techno feast for the ears, and a straight up banging tune to boot. Considering that Hardfloor’s “Acperience” song was used as the title for a number of the TV shows episodes, it’s very fitting. Additionally, the ending song, Hiroya Ozaki’s “Glory Days”, is a phenomenal piece that really captures the feeling of the series. 
 
As for the VA work, I watched the english dub. Somehow, Funimation managed to pull off the impossible and got the entire original cast back. Equally amazing is that they slip back into their roles without much of a hitch. It’s great to here all these voices again, especially Patrick Seitz and Melissa Fahn as Charles and Ray. Hell, they even got Dewey’s VA back, and he does great too. The big new addition is Fred Tatasciore as Adroc, and while I was surprised when they first announced him, within the first few lines he sold me completely. He captures all the pain and anguish Adroc goes through while also never seeming too overdramatic. In short, he’s exactly how you imagined the character sounding, and is probably the best performance in the whole film. If I had to critique the acting, it would mostly revolve around Renton. Not that it’s a bad performance; it’s quite a solid one on the whole. It’s just that Renton sounds...different. Johnny Yong Bosch still voices him, but either he can’t pull off the same voice as the original or the dub decided to tone down the pitch he originally used. Regardless, it’s still the same Renton voice underneath, and you get used to it quickly. Either way, it’s a stellar dub all around. 
 
Of course, this is only part 1. The film ended with a preview for Hi-Evolution 2 which looked so insane and crazy that it made me even more hyped for it. It would seem that this series is going to be one giant, big tribute to everything Eureka Seven. If so, than this film can only be truly judged as part of one whole entity that is the Hi Evolution trilogy. Even those who disliked this film, from what I’ve seen, expressed interest in the sequel, curious as to where this is all heading. And that’s really what this film was: a giant piece of set up for the sequels. But rather than have it just be that, the crew at Bones decided to make it something truly memorable and different, yet still feel like Eureka Seven.  
 
I can, of course, see why many would dislike this film. But the claim that this is worse than AO is just nonsense; at least this is set in an alternate universe and doesn’t screw up the original shows plot. Hi-Evolution 1 ended up being an interesting and very well done jumping off point for things yet to come. It succeeds in reminding you of what the feeling of Eureka Seven is, while also providing enough changes to keep you interested. At the very least, the Summer of Love part is worth seeing, but I enjoyed the rest of the film just as much. I know I’ll be there for everything to happen in part 2, but until then, all we can do is wait for that day, that most glorious of days, to arrive. 
 
To be Continued...

          
 
       Helpful Reuse a whole lot of old animation that's lying around And make Johnny Yong Bosch come back to reprise the role, force him to do a different, shittier voice for some reason. Fuck it, who gives a shit. Who cares like, just animate a bunch of title screens and jerk off onto it before passing it along to the editor who's sleeping on the job or getting blown by a stinky smelly dirty TRANNY. Seriously just pad out the movie with a big obnoxious ""PLAY BACK!!!"" title screen that's probably taking up 10 minutes of the runtime. Oh yeah just cut out key plot elements. Like almost all of them. Nobody cares right? fuck it. Also cut back and forth through different parts of the story. That might make it seem deep as FUCK. Like what's the difference between being artificially confused and confused with intricacies?! Could have been a cool prequel but this is just like, a weird fuckin mess just like when I shit after Taco Bell. Oh am I rambling? kinda like this movie I paid 20 bucks for and I want a godamn refund. This movie has made me want to stop being a fucking weaboo and go to business school or some shit. Go bang a bunch of hot BABES. Become a fucking ALPHA MALE FUCK YEAHHHH! FUCK THIS ANIME SHIT! I'm going to shit this back out onto Funimation's chest or whoever is responsible. I don't give a fuck just give me a chest to shit on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

","I'll make this review short and simple, as the anime was just that. 
 
I must say, I find myself surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this. I find that I enjoy objectively watching yaoi in attempts to find stories of romance that I enjoy. This one actually caught my attention.  
 
Although I am strongly against what i call the 30 minute I love you, I did very much like the idea. A man forced to marry someone he doesn't love, only to find the one hes been waiting for right under his nose. The bit about the human trafficking wasn't entirely necessary...but eh, I can live with it. My only other issue is that Al was a bit too perverted for my taste... 
 
The Seiyuu's and the art were as good as I could have asked for, and I love the serious tone! I'm a business kind of person. 
 
All and all, well done for a two episode yaoi!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so the anime itself was short, it was slightly rushed and stacked. The plot was faint, but as a yaoi it was good. 
Story was good, because it was obviously a love story. The idea of it being held on a cruise ship and outside of Japan was good. The story takes place in an equally romantic place, Italy. And while the whole idea of an affair happening among the main characters has been done, this one didn't over exaggerate on that factor too much. In fact- the wife seemed mellow about it. The molestation is another element in the story that just presents another evil to the story I suppose, and I think gives another reason for the mains to fall even more in love. 
The artwork was,,,,,well personally to me amazing! The way both main men were drawn just brought out the sexiness and the beauty. Especially Al- his blond hair, so shiny- and Ranmaru's whole body, and his kimono- very nice. The backgrounds and scenery were nice too, and detailed. 
Both sound and character were 8. The majority of the sounds were either fighting or sex- oh and the woman's rage. It was decent and just made certain scenes stand out. Characters didn't have too much background, enough for the story and to the characters themselves. and how what was there was explained eventually and made sense.  
Enjoyment over all- it's yaoi...gonna love it. I appreciated the artwork and the awesome characters. I would recommend if you're into romance and something different from the usual one-shots. ^^

          
 
       Helpful As anime's go this one is never going to go down in history as the greatest love story ever told.  Nor is it going to be notorious for breaking tabboo's or showing some shockingly graphic scenes.   
 
That doesn't mean to say though that you won't enjoy watching it anyway.  If you're into yaoi, Ikoku Irokoi Romantan is a nice, short OVA that can provide you with a little boy love fix.   
 
The story isn't groundbreaking but it's enjoyable to watch, the characters are a little bit predictable but I couldn't help but like them anyway.  There are some quite unrealistic scenes in it which might leave you thinking; Oh that would never happen!    
 
But the point of this anime isn't to bring shocking realism to a gay love story.  The point is that it's a fantasy.  There are a couple of hot scenes if you're into your boy smut &amp; there are some quite funny moments as well as a little action thrown in for good measure.   
 
I don't think non-yaoi fans would like it all that much but for anyone who wants to watch themselves a non-heavy and fun boy-love anime, then give Ikoku Irokoi Romantan a go.

This heartwarming story of love, desire and... bloodshed continues as Sakura's normal everyday life slowly crumbles into a bloody mess. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Magic', 'Ecchi', 'Comedy']","Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan tells the story of 13-year-old junior high schooler Sakura Kusakabe, who twenty years in the future develops a technology that causes all women to stop physically aging after they reach twelve years old in an attempt to create a ""Lolicon's World"". However, this act accidentally creates immortality amongst humans, thus offending God. Dokuro Mitsukai, a member of an order of assassin angels that are called Lulutie, has been sent from the future to kill him. Believing that Sakura can be redeemed, Dokuro decides instead to keep Sakura so occupied and distracted that he can never develop the immortality technology. In response to her reluctance to complete the assassination mission, Sabato, another assassin of the Lulutie order, is dispatched to ensure the mandate of God is carried out. Using her feminine wiles along with her electric baton as her weapons of choice, Sabato seeks to kill Sakura herself and Dokuro is forced to oppose her. In so doing, Dokuro pits herself against the will of Heaven itself in order to protect him.
Ironically, she herself quite possibly poses a greater threat to his well-being as a result of her capricious and highly volatile personality. Due to her impulsive nature and super-human strength, she often carelessly or unthinkingly kills him with her massive spiked kanabō (club), Excalibolg, only to regret it moments later and return him to life with angelic power accompanied by her whimsical personal chant of ""Pipiru-piru-piru-pipiru-pii"". This repeated trauma, along with myriad other problems she causes for him, prompts Sakura to ultimately question whether her ""protection"" is worth it and ponder that it might be ultimately preferable to simply allow Sabato to kill him permanently and put an end to his perpetual misery.
","Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Going into the second season I was really expecting it to be just as bad as the first season yet there were actually a few elements that made the second season a bit more tolerable to watch. 
 
Story (3/10) 
 
The story continues with Sakura and Dokuro doing random stuff however the second season only has 2 episodes whereas the first had 4 which to me was an improvement since it meant not having to watch it as long and another slight improvement was the antics that the duo got up to which actually didn't involve much of the school or their schoolmates instead it focused on a more select group of characters which felt a bit more decent to watch. 
Once again though the story goes nowhere yet even more this time since there wasn't really a story to begin with in the first place although I did like the moment where the characters got trapped in a prison made to contain angels which did add a bit of suspense because we didn't know how they were going to get out of there. 
 
Characters (3/10) 
 
Now the characters are a little better not because of Sakura or Dokuro because they are still the same, but because of some characters in season 1 getting some more screentime like Zakuro and Zansu who felt like the only decent characters of the show and I really liked how they used these characters more especially Zakuro who seemed like a waste of a good character in season 1, luckily they decided to make her a main character this season which made the show a little more tolerable to watch. 
 
Art (8/10) 
 
Once again the art is pretty much the only good thing about the show and the show does improve the character design's this season although I don't know why they turned Dokuro's hair from a light purple and into a turquoise blue which didn't make any sense however I did like some of the locations especially the angel prison which may have looked bland it actually held it's fair share of traps which was pretty interesting. 
 
Sound (2/10) 
 
The op this time isn't as bad as season 1's op, but that isn't really saying much to be honest it's still ear bleedingly hurtful to listen to. 
 
Extras: 
 
The comedy was a little better since it didn't fully focus on Sakura getting smashed into bits so many times by Dokuro instead it puts the characters into bad situations and tries to make their actions funny which was an improvement. 
The Ecchi side was a little heavier too even having a bath scene with Sakura, Dokuro and Zakuro which was a little steamy, but nothing I haven't seen before. 
 
Enjoyment (3/10) 
 
Overall this was a small improvement over the first season and it sucks you'd have to watch the first season to get here then again it's not really worth you're time as the improvements this season still weren't enough for me to give it a much higher score. 

          
 
       Helpful Overall, this has been a positive year so far. Lots of really strong series, nothing too bad. Obviously, that had to change at some point. Which is why we find ourselves looking at the follow up to Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan, a terrible anime from Hal film maker about an angel who beats her love interest to death, brings him back to life and that's basically the big joke that we kept getting. I'm not looking forward to this one, but let's move in and see how many more gruesome domestic abuse scenes they can cram in and treat as humorous.  
 
Story: 
 
We pick up where the last series left off. Sakura is living with the angel sisters, Dokuro and Zakuro.  He's trying to live a normal life and get the attention of the girl he likes at his school but that's consistently ruined by Dokuro torturing and murdering him, but it's okay because she brings him back to life afterwards and that makes it funny because... people dying horribly and gruesomely is hilarious according to this series.  
 
The humour is much the same kind of thing that the first series offered. We have gross out humour with the over the top gore effects and perverted humour that's really used more as an excuse to show Dokuro and Zakuro in skimpy outfits than it is for actual comedic attempts. This is one of those series that seems to be based firmly on the idea that sex and violence sell and you don't need any charm or clever witticisms. After all, even semi-clever jokes would have interfered with this OVA's mission to route your blood flow away from the brain. The humour is also quite repetitive with Dokuro getting angry and mutilating or murdering Sakura with little or no provocation. It really shouldn't be possible for a joke to get stale with less than an hour of content, but they manage. So, does this one have any legitimately funny moments at all? Personally, I thought that Corpse Party did the over the top violent humour much better and it wasn't trying to be funny.  
 
Characters: 
 
This cast of characters is pretty horrendous. I'll give comedic series some leeway when it comes to character complexity since they really only need to play off of each other well for comedic purposes, but this cast doesn't even have that much going for them. We get the same few unfunny pay-off reactions repeated.   
 
Art: 
 
The artwork is pretty lazy with fountains of blood gore effects, really basic character designs and minimal backgrounds. The most effort they put in is for the tacky fan-service scenes. Which shouldn't be surprising after the first series.  
 
Sound: 
 
Like the first series, the theme tune is easily the best aspect of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2. However, it is weakened a bit by being a pretty lazy remix of the first series' theme tune. Rather like Toei did with Futari Wa Precure: Max Heart. The acting is either obnoxiously exaggerated or emotionless and dull, depending on which character is speaking. Which is a pity since there are some really good actresses here. Chiba Saeko, to give an example, voiced Nina in Code Geass, Azmaria in Chrno Ctrusade & Natsuki in Mai-Hime/Otome. She can give such strong performances. It just doesn't happen here because there's nothing to work with.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There are some “jokes” that imply that Zansu is romantically interested in Sakura. Aside from that, there's really not any.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
This series is not good, at all. It's crude, tacky and generally tasteless with the same basic jokes the first OVA had. So, if you're a fan of the gross out/ fan-servicey humour, you might get a kick out of it otherwise, I would stay far away. For myself, I was not amused. I was quickly annoyed by the series and tired of its nonsense. I give Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 a 2/10.  Next week we'll move away from sequels and talk about Charlotte. 

          
 
       Helpful Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 can basically be described as this: Over the top comedy and violence, complimented with pointless story and echhi-ness on the side.  
It picks up where the first season left off, (well with the cast appearance anyway) and gives you even more of what the first had to offer. 
 
Story: 4/10 
Honestly if this anime series could talk, it would say: &quot;Story? What is this story of which you speak of?&quot; Because quite frankly there is none whatsoever, if you have ever seen season one then you may be surprised that everything the actual storyline (if you can even call it that) had built up to that point, seems to have gone right out the window. In fact it kind of confused me when I started this second season. The way the first half ended left many things up in the air, and instead of continuing it from where it left off, it simply just decided to put all characters together as one big happy family, whether or not they actually were so in the first half. Anyway, there is no plot at all to speak of, basically we see Sakura (main male lead) get into all sorts of over the top situations with Dokuro-chan and her friends. Whether it be simply taking a bath together, (in their swimsuits no less) or getting trapped inside some magical box. It does differ from one another so you don't feel you are re-watching recycled content scenes from the first part. They also boosted the over all &quot;echhi-ness&quot; factor and over the top &quot;violence.&quot; So whether you either loved or hated Dokuro-chan's content before, it will mostly increase two full this time around! So if you are new to the series, just be aware that it contains more extreme themes regarding these. Oh and they also added about two new characters, nice for its 2 episode length. Though I personally would have liked for it to continue further than that. There is no character development whatsoever.......nor an actual ending to this either, as you could basically switch the first and last episodes with each other and it wouldn't make much difference. And the way they threw the story out, this series could honestly keep going on for an eternity, all the while making you laugh the entire way. Honestly I just found this title drop dead hilarious at times, as many on the comedy scenes are pretty darn clever......dirty and bloody as they may be. 
 
Artwork: 8/10 
Bright colorful, sharp and lovable, and definitely on par from what you would expect of the series. (though they seem to have given the overall characters a bit more of a mature-er look to them) The character design is not fully different from what you may be accustomed to wanting, but the design and artwork truly have a distinctiveness to them. I especially like how they cut and copy actual animal faces, (or even real life historical characters on occasion) and stuck them on selected characters; Whom of which have been cursed by Dokuro-chan herself! So yeah it varies on the artwork, most of the time you'll see the standard colorful fair, and others you'll see real life western style paintings and character art playing a role in the wackiness. Backgrounds were good and detailed for the most part, but never really come off as anything great or unique, and look pretty standard overall. 
  
Soundtrack: 6/10 
They actually re-made the opening theme from the first part, its okay and all but just isn't quite as carefree and happy as the first. The ending song was pretty beat-ish, basically it has all the characters in yukata's (summer kimonos) dancing to this happy kind of drum beat, all the while singing along, which may tempt you to sway along with it. The background music is pretty forgettable though, nothing really stands out as most are just generic sounding pop beats. I honestly didn't even notice the BG most of the time. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
Great as usual, all the characters retain their varied personalities from the first half. From Dokuro-chans innocent yet murderous intent, to Shizuki's (supporting role) tender caring attitude. Which is quite nice considering nothing in this title is taken seriously, and I am glad that the company went out and actually gave each character a good variety of persona's! Though I think most viewers out there will either love or hate a guy named Zansu, as he can be an extreme in the personality department. Not the most memorable cast out there, but great for this style of anime. Though I feel I should stress it once again, zero character development. 
 
Bottom Line: 8/10 
&quot;Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2&quot; ups everything in content from the first season, chances are you will either love it or hate it more depending on your taste. It remains a solid watch for what it brings to the table. If you like echhi-ness complimented with over the top comical violence, then you will absolutely love this series, if not then you will loath it all the more and find it overall pointless. Good solid watch for fans and viewers who can appreciate its approach in comedy content.

It hits all the natural stages of 2000s generic highschool anime; A cast of wacky, but pretty one-note characters - complete with big, candy-colored hair and matching, big eyes, gimmicky accessories, big hands and feet and more thick, slightly disproportionate bodies making them look younger than they are, as was typical for contemporaries like Negima, Uuchuu no Stellvia or Key-Adaptations, inviting for a lot of doujinshi.

Introducing aliens into the mix as well as putting a lot of stakes into random competitions add to the wackyness and keep things as fresh as the stale character archetypes will allow it to be. 
Episode 21 shows some of these ridiculous competitions, as well as hinting at what will result in the club briefly falling apart in episode 25, only to reunite by the end and getting right into the tearjerking finale, though not resolving everything and leaving some threads hanging since the Manga is still ongoing. 
Lottery forever indeed. 
 
And, honestly, the more I think about it, it's the kind of show everyone would've watched back at the time. 
The OVA doesn't exactly have anything to comment on what it presents; it's just what was popular and common at the time, re-packaged into an amalgamation of as much of it as possible. It's a must-watch for every fan of Genshiken, as well as anyone who can appreciate this aesthetic and these storybeats, but it doesn't really stand on its own outside of those demographics. 
 
But as someone both enjoying Genshiken and always interested in Anime trends of a time I personally wasn't around to experience, I thoroughly enjoyed this OVA and recommend it to anyone matching my description - although probably not more than once.

          
 
       Helpful These are 3 episodes of Kujibiki Unbalance which were the 1st, 21st and 25th episodes. This is the fictitious anime that the Genshiken guys were always watching, and after watching these 3 episodes, I think I liked it as much as the Genshiken guys did. These OVAs are definitely a MUST WATCH for people who liked Genshiken. 
 
The 3 episodes I watched were just like previews of the show so I'm not so sure about the story. As from what I've understood in these 3 episodes, the story is about a boy named Chihiro that got into Rikkyouin High School, his encounters with people there, a reunion with his childhood friend he promised to marry, and the Kujibiki, a school tournament, festival or tradition thing in which all the students face all kinds of battles for a whole year, be it sports, cooking, and silly competitions like enduring extreme temperature (synopsis says it's a battle for student government positions). It's a pretty fun and interesting story. 
 
The art is really good. Everything looks great and the original character designs are nice. Problem is, only the designs were nice, most of the drawings seen are unattractively non-proportional and makes the characters look bad. Still, the animation is great, the characters move well and the action scenes are impressive. 
 
The sounds are great. All the characters' voices are perfect. The soundtracks are nice and well fitted, and so are the effects. It has an attractive OP song and the ED song is good as is. 
 
All the characters are great and likable. They have all kinds of fun personalities which makes the show comedy-funny and action-cool at the same time. 
 
People would enjoy Kujibiki Unbalance as much as the Genshiken characters did. It's an anime of almost everything just like Seto no Hanayome. These 3 episodes are so good that viewers would want to check out the Kujibiki Unbalance 2006 alternate.

6,3613,44,6.946393197,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Toshokan Sensou,"Toshokan Sensou  tells the story of Kasahara Iku, the first woman to join the Library Task Force. In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people. 
 
This anime follows Iku and her fellow soldiers as they protect various special books and artifacts from the oppression of the Media Enhancement Law Commission. A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.","['Action', 'Military', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","The background of the plot is based on the Statement on Intellectual Freedom in Libraries that went into effect in Japan in 1954 (amended in 1979), and the terms are a little different from the Freedom of the Library Law that appears in Toshokan Sensō.
The simplified declaration:

It is the most important responsibility of libraries to offer collected materials and library facilities to the people who have the Right to Know as one of their fundamental human rights. In order to fulfill their mission, libraries shall recognize the following matters as their proper duties, and shall put them into practice.

Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials.
Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials.
Libraries guarantee the privacy of users.
Libraries oppose any type of censorship categorically.When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.

In Library War, the fourth chapter of the Freedom of Library Law states:

 Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials. Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials. Libraries guarantee the privacy of users. Libraries oppose any type of improper censorship categorically. When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.
The details will be amended anytime according to the Media Betterment Act and its enforcement.
The premise of Library War involves the Japanese government passing the Media Betterment Act (MBA) (メディア良化法, Media ryōkahō) as law in 1989 which allows the censorship of any media deemed to be potentially harmful to Japanese society by deploying agents in the Media Betterment Committee (メディア良化委員会, Media ryōka iinkai) (MBC) with the mandate to go after individuals and organizations that are trying to exercise the act of conducting freedom of expression activities in the media.Ep 01 However, local governments opposed to the MBA establishes armed anti-MBA defense force units to protect libraries from being raided by MBC agents under the Freedom of the Libraries Law. The conflict between MBC agents and library soldiers has continued to 2019, when the story begins. In accordance with the Japanese era calendar scheme, 1989 in Library War is rendered the first year of the fictional Seika (正化) era, rendering 2019 as Seika 31.Library War follows the life of Iku Kasahara, a new recruit in the Kantō Library Base who joined in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantō Library Defense Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship.Ep 01 After joining, however, she finds the pace to be very demanding, and that her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo seems to have it in for her and working her harder than the other recruits. On multiple occasions, Kasahara shows herself to be reckless, particularly when she puts Dojo in danger by not securing a criminal in the base's library, and later getting involved with Media Betterment Committee agents despite not being a high enough ranked official; in both instances Dojo has to help her out of trouble. Despite these imperfections, Kasahara is enlisted into the base's Library Task Force, an elite group of soldiers who go through rigorous training in order to respond during difficult operations. This is partially due to Dojo realizing that he did not give Kasahara adequate training, so he gives his recommendation that she join the task force,Ep 02 of which he is a member, in order to correct this mistake on his part. Other recommendations come from the captain of the task force, Ryusuke Genda, and second class task force library officer Mikihisa Komaki who is the same rank as Dojo. Along with Kasahara, another new recruit named Hikaru Tezuka is also enlisted into the task force who is much more capable at the position than Kasahara. Kasahara continues to try her best in the face of difficult challenges while protecting the books she has sworn to protect. As the story progresses, a romance blooms and Iku and Dojo make romantic feelings for each other evident.
","Usually my reviews are a catalog of what I didn’t like in a series but, I don’t think I can love this anime more. First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. I have no complaints to mention here. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is the lack of rewatch factor. It’s short at only 13 episodes, features a strong(?) female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being.

          
 
       Helpful 【 The following is a review of : Toshokan Sensou and Toshokan Sensou: Kakumei no Tsubasa 】 
 
Toshokan Sensou, or Library Wars, it's English name on Crunchyroll, is beautiful monotony. As many of you already know, Production I.G. is known for animating very pretty things.  
	 
	• I.G. collaborated with GAINAX for the End of Evangelion and other very successful projects. You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn't worked on much.  
	 
	• This isn't always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on character building. 
	 
	• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don't get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.  
	 
	• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I'm the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she's a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.  
	 
	• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell's 1989 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults. 
	 
	• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There's no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series. 
	 
	• I mean, c'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn't want genetically enhanced humans.  
	 
	• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don't care about the armed feud between these people and the government? 
	 
	• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I'm okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we're being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL! 
	 
	• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!  
	 
	• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn't help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?  
	 
	• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister. 
	 
	• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it's definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn't know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism. I give Library Wars a 5/10 and hope that Takayuki Hamana does better with the Lyrical Nanoha films.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is quite unique,  but not bad my any stretch.  The storyline is most likely to most unique thing about it, followed by the characters.  The art and sound are pretty typical. 
 
Story:  Something that could definitely happen in America, probably already started happening,  but on a much more technological level.  The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don't know your history,  it's bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop this 
 
Art:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,  not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across. 
 
Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say. 
 
Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn't even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh.. 
 
The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes. 
 
If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book.

6,11135,45,6.945964073,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Hybrid Child,"The skilled craftsman Kuroda created artificial humans called Hybrid Child—creatures who are neither machines nor dolls, but rather a reflection of the love shown to them. While they can feel human emotions and have their own consciousness, they are not real humans and require love to grow. 
 
Kotarou Izumi is the young heir to the noble Izumi family, so it is frowned upon when he brings an abandoned Hybrid Child he found in the garbage into their household. His family even attempts to throw away Hazuki—Kotarou's name for the Hybrid Child—multiple times when he is not paying attention. But through overcoming these obstacles, their love and the bond connecting them grow stronger. However, ten years pass before a horrifying realization dawns on them: a Hybrid Child might not have an endless life span. 
 
 Hybrid Child  is a collection of three short love stories, depicting the relationship between the artificial humans and their owners.

In my opinion it is considered a masterpiece, I could not even wait for sub that I already have finished seeing in raw version. I read the manga in the past, but then upon hearing the news that it would become an anime I immediately had doubts, which instead have turned into satisfaction. It has really exceeded my expectations, despite already the manga was wonderful. 
 
Start by saying that I absolutely prefer it to the other of Shungiku Nakamura (""Junjou Romantica"" and ""Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi""), perhaps because it is presented in a different tone. While the first two are romantic-comedy, Hybrid Child is dramatic themes and gloomy.  
Essentially, it speaks of these dolls that with love and affection (but also negative feelings) grow to physical and mood. 
There are three different stories in this anime which correspond to episodes 1, 2 and 3-4.  
The first story revolves around Kotaro Izumi, a boy from a rich family, who finds a boy-doll (Hazuki) in the trash; despite his parents are against it, he does not give up and continues to care for him.  
The second story talk about Yuzu, another boy-doll, which is adopted by Ichi Seya. This story has an important meaning, especially because it tells us that in life things that happen isn't always happy, but also sad. 
The third story, my favorite and the most dramatic, portraies of friendship between Tsukishima and Kuroda (or maybe love?), they are two sons of chieftains important. Unfortunately the unexpected happen and Tsukishima must take responsibility for everything, but with disapproval of his friend. 
Then we can deduce that the protagonist of Hybrid Child is Kuroda, also because it appears in all three stories. 
 
Take me to the point of being moved is a difficult feat, but ""Hybrid Child"" has done it. 
The designs are very well made and the animations are quite fluid.  
Another thing that surprised me a lot, is the soundtrack: it's beautiful and it's put in the right place.  
Hybrid Child is really amazing although it only has 4 OVA.

       Helpful This anime is a masterpiece. It's original, beautiful, honest, and gut-wrenching. Please watch it. If you're into yaoi, if you're not, it doesn't matter, it deals with love in its purest form and it's wroth watching. 
 
Anime don't usually make me emotional, and I certainly didn't expect this one to. But from the beautiful music to the moving dialogue, the story moves fluidly through the episodes, separate but they all come together in the end. You won't regret watching it, so just do it.

She deals with issues such as accidentally witnessing her homeroom teacher kissing, and worrying about experiencing physiological changes before her friends. The series depicts a 12-year-old girl's innocent worries and first love. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","Hanabi Ayase and her best friend, Yui Aoi, are 6th graders in school. When Hanabi is chosen to work with Yuuto Takao for an upcoming test, she begins to fall in love with him and they both start dating. Yui also falls in love with Kazuma Hiyama, after he protects her from a classmate who talked about Yui behind her back, and they start dating as well.
","12-Sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki 2nd Season continues off from its prequel. It is about 6th graders growing up and learning 'bout love and are trying to understand what ""adulthood"" is about. Firstly, the plot sucks. The drama has been always shit and the good moments are too short (mine is like last few episodes). 
 
Main plot consists of: 
1. Introduction and pairing partners, 
2. Dates. 
 
That's it. The others are just fillers with side characters, and almost every side-character is annoying. You can just see episodes that pair the students at the start and then skip to the last episode, and you'll see the main plot. The other episodes are a bit useless because they are used to clarify that this anime is about kids growing up and knowing about love, and it doesn't really connect with other episodes. 
 
Animation is fine, it's colorful and looks alright on most cases. Occasionally, animation quality drops and few scenes reused backgrounds from previous ones. 
 
There are also scenes that you'll really be familiar with if you watch all the episodes, and here are some examples: 
1. Running around like idiots 
2. Date in mall 
3. Heroines trying their best 
4. Boys being assholes 
5. Heroines wondering about adulthood 
6. Cringy dramatic moments 
etc. 
 
Opening song and ending song are nice to hear, but nothing stands out or memorable. The voice acting is mediocre, but lines for the side characters made it more displeasing. 
 
My enjoyment is mixed. Few episodes are actually enjoyable, but most of it are pure cringe. 
 
Overall, the cringe makes it meaningful for a bad series like this one. Is it better than the first season? Yes, of course. Do I recommend you to watch it? If you like to cringe and waste time with random animes, I'd do so.

          
 
       Helpful So lets keep in consideration that this anime is 100% for a younger audience (specifically probably 12 yr old females). I feel like a lot of people ignore this aspect when rating: So anyway 
Story 7: There wasn't really much plot development to the second season. There was some drama put in but essentially it was just showing the characters remaining as couples and growing as couples. That was basically the point of the anime so it fulfilled it's duty. 
Art: The art was consistent and fine- my only issues was the wonky eyes. The problem is the eyes are large, wide-set, and basic and the eyebrows are just lines so when the animation on the eyes isn't perfect it is very noticeable. It isn't the worst thing and is common in a lot of anime. 
Sound: Voice acting was great but they re-used the same sound effects over and over and the sound effects were just meh. 
Character: Some new characters were introduced and they added some variety to the story. There was also character growth but nothing too major. 


          
 
       Helpful The second season of 12-sai keeps things the similar to the first season. So if you expect some huge development for the couples or deep relationship drama, you most likely will be disappointed. Although at some points it actually took a more serious approach to their relationships. (fights, thoughts about the future and how long their love will last, approval by family) 
 
Those things are still handled really lightheartedly and resolved in a very short time, so mostly you'll still see the same rosey childish approach. Yes - it's childish, it's cringy, but that's exactly what this show is about. Love from the view of little children. 
 
Quality-wise I didn't notice any change, so art, animation and sound pretty much are the same as in the first season.  
There's also only one single new (relevant) character to it, which basically is the male version of Cocoa (aka makes you wanna punch him in the face), and tries to steal Aoi from Hiyama. 
 
I rated it slightly lower than the first season because I felt that it was kind of a waste to mainly focus on those stupid one-sided love rivals (like Cocoa literally never had the slightest chance) at the cost of less development for the actual couples. 
 
So if you liked the first season, this one will probably be to your liking as well.

Story: 2 
 
Boy meets girl, other boys are asses. Her classmate also likes said boy and is trying to manipulate the two of them apart when they were assigned a lesson together. Cliched as hell. The merit this story had was lost on the fact that these are 12 year olds doing stupid shit in front of their teacher, and the teacher not once intervenes. Even when the whole class is up in the middle of a presentation and blaming each other for messing up on purpose as part of some conspiracy against the boys for being jerks. It literally just portrays her as not even being in the room its ridiculous  and there is nothing here for anyone outside of kids falling in love over something meaningless. 
 
Art: 3 
 
HOLY SHIT WHAT ARE, oh those are your eyes I thought those were some flesh eating parasites clinging to your face, my bad. 
 
Shoujo art at its worst, I mean seriously I understand they are kids, but there is a freaking limit on how big eyes can get before its just stupid. Oh and don't forget that this is a 14 minute OVA with fucking stills. Yeah mind as well have went with manga 2.5 or some shite because that was just appalling.

Enjoyment/Overview: 4/3 
 
This isn't the worst thing I've seen, but it could've been. It was short so sitting through it wasn't so bad, but five minutes in and I felt like it had been a half an hour already. This was a very bad attempt at making something that was short and told a legitimate story. Not much here for anyone and would never recommend unless I hated you, seriously don't waste your time. If it wanted to be good or in the very least mediocre they would have been better of going with 3 min episodes instead and have better fucking animation. THIS WAS 2014 PEOPLE SERIOUSLY. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful My scoring of this show might seem weird at first but you should be able to see why soon. this super short story is adorable in its presentation however it is so very realistic in its storytelling. The story involves a class of 12 year olds and they react and do things you would expect from 12 year olds. the main point i liked about this anime was that the relationship was one of the most realistic i have seen. as they don't understand the real meaning behind a kiss there is no faffing about with the development. as kids normally do they say they love another person quickly and there relationship develops at a quick pace usually ending quickly also. this is presented outstandingly within this show. This really is a quick review for a quick show but i loved it. 

          
 
       Helpful The first few minutes of this short may give the impression that this is another cheesy romance story aimed at the tween-age audience. The main character is excited about being “grown-up”, and yet we adults know those in the tween-age years really aren't as grown-up as they think. Something to keep in mind is that in the mind of many kids in their tween-years they are “grown-up” – meaning they're no longer little kids, but not yet adults either. This time period is a complicated time period of discovery for this age group. 
 
That is one of the charms of this particular short – it manages to capture the complicated feelings of a tween as they start the transition from being a child to being an adult. The work also covers other subjects that result from that including many of the peer issues this age group does in fact have to deal with, and it manages to do so in such a short period of time. I felt more drawn to that, then I did the actual romance aspect. The ending for the piece wrapped everything up nicely as well. 
 
The art work on the other hand isn't much to write home about. I think one of the things that stood out to me was the fact I've seen this style used in so many shows that I didn't feel it stood out. The only time it did was when the artists depicted the characters feeling bummed out, and I personally feel there is a better way to portray that feeling then the way they did. On the flip side it's not ugly art except for that point either. 
 
The sound for the music fit the piece as well and was pleasant to listen to. Again though it didn't stand out. The voice acting though had a nice blend, and worked for the characters. 
 
I felt the characterization was spot on – this is how kids in their tween-years act. In some ways it is sad as some of the behaviors are bothersome, but it also reflects the fact they are growing up. I think that this is a major pointer for the piece.  There is also the fact they don't over exaggerate the stereotypes used. Hamana Kokoa for example could easily have ended up being like Koshiro Miya from the Yumeiro Patissiere series.  
 
Ultimately I enjoyed picking up the piece despite the fact I expected it to be a typical fluff piece. The reason for this is because the characterization was accurate for the age group, nor was I forced to suspend my disbelief for this piece. There is also something heart warming about the piece as well.

Considering the title it's kinda odd that she has very much so blond hair in the anime but that's a small nitpick I'll mention just for the fun of it. 
 
 
The show pretty much starts out like an Worldmasterpiece Theather show with a girl going through her day-to-day life as her father the doctor from the town helps patients together with Jeanie's mother.

Characters 
 
_________ 
 
 
The main three characters Jeanie, Stephen and Bill are overall strong written characters with their own will, hopes and dreams. 
 
Jeanie herself goes through quite a bit of character development throughout the series and never breaks away from her beliefs and certainly isn't afraid to open her mouth. 
 
Stephen however is a bit of a mixed bag as he tends to sometimes lean more towards his flaws than his stronger sides. Ultimately however he serves for a good love interest for Jeanie and isn't just a handsome boy for her to swoon over. 
 
Bill is the most impressive of all, considering the time this anime takes place it was very refreshing to see what they did with his character and his struggles were very believable. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Good 
 
_________ 
 
 
The anime has several strong parts throughout the 52 run episodes where it feels quite realistic and introduces problems for the characters to solve that give quite some character development. 
 
Also what I especially liked was how the show would introduce side characters in a way that made them seem like bad people but then would turn around and show in quite realistic ways that every person in the world has their own reasons for their behaviour and actions and that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone who seems to be a bad person is a bad person. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Bad 
 
_________ 
 
 
Sometime mid-way into the series an unexpected plot twist arises which honestly makes the series far worse than what it could've been. The series does however recover after awhile but then falls in the pitfall of repeating the same type of problem in a different fashion all the way up till the last few episodes making the ending feel less satisfying than it could've been. 
 
_________ 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
_________ 
 
I enjoyed Jeanie for what it was, but I think that if I had known beforehand that the show's strength went down in the second half I would've enjoyed it more for the simple fact my expectations were higher after the first stronger half. If you're looking for an old-school anime with enjoyable characters and like anime such as the Worldmasterpiece theater ones then I whole heartedly recommend you give this one a try!

First of all, The first season, The first season wasn't really that great It was Average/Mediocre for me. 
Mostly because at that time there were other school Idols anime which dominated the genre of School idol. But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point. 
 
It's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the μ's and want to perform at Love live, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it. 
 
The first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way. 
Sunrise has made a big chance in every part. 
 
This season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode. 
 
The story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal. 
Now that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and μ's story 
 
Like any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED. 
The music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with ""Snow Halation"" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment. 
 
The visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??). 
The CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched. 
 
Love live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks. 
Like i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season. 
 
Like any other anime It has come to it's end, the μ's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the μ's!

In life, people encounter different forms of happiness. Some people find it in the places they visit. Others discover it in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. And yet others still find it in the bonds of everlasting friendship. It's with this last part in mind that Love Live! School Idol Project 2 ""sets the stage."" When it comes to a feeling of togetherness, no other show comes close. 
 
STORY 
 
Love Live! 2 begins where the first left off. That is to say, the girls of Muse discover that a second Love Live is being hosted, and it is their goal to achieve their dream of conquering the ultimate School Idol prize. 
 
LL2's main focus is in its idols, singing, and dancing. And for the majority of the show, this focus is executed very well. The show's highlights are definitely the compositions that the girls sing and dance to. Many of the songs deal with the problems and feelings they are experiencing at that time. Whether it is about a sense of love or feeling the need to be the group they've always been, the songs do a wonderful job of capitalizing on the shows overall themes. 
 
With that said, what LL2 does better than LL1 is that it forgoes the misplaced melodrama. Instead, LL2 captures these beautiful emotional moments that leave the viewer both incredibly happy and extremely sad. I found myself getting towards the tears and burning throat when watching particular scenes, because after viewing the girls for so many episodes, their plight and their overwhelming love for one another really started to get to me. It's not something on the level of Clannad: After Story, but it is definitely hard not to get somewhat emotional over what is occurring. 
 
When the show isn't making you feel so down, it sticks to its method of comedy quite nicely. The show does a nice balance of character gags, jokes, and reactions that show-off the cute girls being cute. With the comedy, the show also delves more into its characters. It forms characterization for those that needed it and expanded upon those that already had it. I enjoyed this approach more, since it allowed me to see different sides to the girls than them just being cute. 
 
My teeny-tiny gripe with the story is in the ending. Not being shown anything afterwards, but if they somehow retcon what they did, it kind of defeats the purpose of the scenarios and events prior to it. I hope this isn't the case, but the way things are left off, I am led to believe that this is so. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Once again, LL2 does a fine job in the animation department. One of their best talents is in their facial expressions. They usually use more frames than needed (this is a good thing!), making their face movements more detailed than in other shows. The same can also be said for their general body movements as well. The show is not afraid to go all out in terms of animation. 
 
The same quality is again found in the dancing portions as well. I was a fan of the mix of CG and 2D from LL1, and I was a fan of the technique here as well. 
 
The art style itself is again rather plain, and the character designs are not terribly unique, but it's not something that should turn anyone off. One thing I found to have increased was the use of lighting. It seemed to have more of a presence this time around, such as with sunsets, night-time locations, and general sunny daytime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
LL2 features the same nine characters that it did in LL1, and the whole cast is quite likable. As with LL1, I'll focus on three (different) girls to talk about. 
 
Eli started off being the student council president and was rather stalwart in her ways in dealing with keeping the school open. But after joining Muse, she learns to not only integrate herself with others but also on how to have fun. She used to be rather strict and unforgiving, but the girls have her learn that sometimes just being with others can make your day that much brighter. She is one of the eldest in the group, and therefore one of the more mature and beautiful, so her character was always nice to see. 
 
""Nico-Nico-Ni!"" When you probably read this phrase, I hope you re-read it and performed its accompanying hand gestures! Nico is the girl who is both quite prideful but at the same time very sensitive to the things around her. She wasn't quick to accept that there were others just like her, but she realizes this season that the girls are not only their to further their own dreams but to further Nico's as well. Nico, over the course of the series, grows up from being a rather difficult to approach character to an understanding and caring one. It just took a few ""Nico-Nico-Ni's!"" to get there. 
 
Finally, one of my favorite characters from the show is Umi. Umi is serious, determined, and yet shy in certain situations. She looks out for everyone too, especially Honoka. While watching the show, she had some of the best reactions alongside Honoka. Plus, she's able to switch from being quite angry to severely cute in the blink of an eye. Muse literally couldn't have started without her and I'm glad that her character was as good as it is. 
 
Once again, LL2 does a nice job of displacing the screen-time among the entire cast. Nobody ever feels left out, and those that actually seemed to get less screen-time than usual actually got quite a bit more. None of the characters are to die for, but I still like them all the same. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP and the ED for LL2 follow the same pattern as the first season. That is, the OP is a School Idol song that is there to get you ""in the mood"" for the show while the ED is there to demonstrate the skills of the singers. I didn't enjoy these songs as much as LL1, but can still appreciate the work put into them. 
 
The soundtrack's most important elements are once again the rest of the School Idol tracks. My favorite is probably ""Snow Halation,"" but all of them were performed quite nicely and were amazing to listen to. I also thought the inclusion of the first OP was rather clever and a joy to hear once more. 
 
As a little aside, I feel like it is best to listen to all of the School Idol songs with the appropriate dance animations. Otherwise, I don't think you would get the full experience out of it. This is more of a personal feeling than a fact, so take it with a grain of salt. 
 
The voice acting is also wonderfully done by the whole cast once again. Each of the girls sings and acts their heart out, and I really couldn't ask for more than what we got. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
To be honest, I've never seen another idol show before this one. Going into this season, I knew what to expect: lots of laughs, great singing, and pretty darn good animation. What I didn't expect was the previously mentioned emotions that the show was able to elicit from me. I really like it when a show is able to make me feel enough to care about what is happening on-screen, and the show was able to accomplish this. 
 
I'm one of those dudes who likes to watch the cute girls do cute things. Honoka's infectious smile, Rin's cat-like way of talking, and Hanayo's pleas for help constantly put a smile on my face. One of my favorite moments from the show was their reenactment of each other's personalities. It was always funny to see them joke around with each other in these ways because the show does it so well. 
 
Most importantly, Love Live! School Idol Project Season Two does more than just making you feel happy, watching cute girls, or containing lots of singing and dancing. It leaves you with a sense of wanting more, and I truly hope to see the girls of Muse make their much needed return. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Good, both funny and emotional but with an unclear ending 
 
Animation: Good, art style is plain with nice dancing/non-dancing animation 
 
Characters: Good, more of the girls of Muse 
 
Sound: Great, OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs all performed exceptionally 
 
Enjoyment: Great, cute girls, dancing, and singing, who would have thought 
 
Final Score: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
The second season of Love Live is... kinda meh, at least, compared to the first one. 
 
It started out with the same story quality as the first one. It has moments of interesting character development, while also having moments where the plot feels slightly contrived. A few times, characters seem to speak up to give them screen time or to steer the story in the 'right' direction, even if it's somewhat out of character. This particular point seems very prominent, either because I expected more or that's the way it really is. Anyway, no real disappointments here except in episode 9. 
 
Even though things seemed to be going fine, disaster befell the protagonists. Faced with overwhelming adversity, they still chose to press on helplessly. There was no hope. 
 
Suddenly, everything was okay. People had helped them even when, logically, their efforts would have been fruitless. Seriously, they could could surely try but it should not have been possible. 
 
It felt to me that they, the writers, wanted to up the stakes exceeding the previous season then realised they couldn't solve it realistically. 
It was still enjoyable though, plus, the last few episodes was what sold me on the previous season so I figured there was still hope. Episode 11 was headed in a hopeful direction with heartfelt moments. 
 
Episode 12 was okay up until the rather contrived ending with the overt intention to make people tear. Felt forced and didn't work. After what seemed to be a finale, episode 13 seemed to be to tie up all loose ends on a positive, if somewhat sad, note. Unfortunately, it was dragged out with several scenes and character actions meant to evoke sadness, but felt too forced to do so. 
 
Overall, it started okay and sometimes good at first, but the ending, among other things, was a letdown. 
7/10

6,3239,50,6.868925385,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Cream Lemon,"A collection of short stories, ranging from soap opera (the Ami series) to fantasy (Rall series) to horror (Cream Lemon Dark) to parody (Pop Chaser). It does deal with a lot of heavy perversions ranging from S&M, male rape (by a bunch of females, that is), bondage, torture, yuri (lesbian love) and incest. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Parody', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Hentai', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Yuri']","Cream Lemon is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including fantasy, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, mecha, magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the Cream Lemon series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.
Cream Lemon often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.
","Story: 7/10 
Art: 9/10 
Sound: 9/10 
Character: 5/10 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Overall: 7/10 
 
First of all I'd like to get this out of the way; THIS IS PORN. The characters and plot are all there as a set up to sex. This being said, if I only watched it for porn why would I choose to watch Cream Lemon as opposed to millions of videos on numerous websites of an unsavory nature? The reason is that this is much more than porn. With unique and strangely appealing storylines, fantastic visuals, and good audio, Cream Lemon has become a classic of all anime, not just of the hentai genre. 
 
That being said, during the sexually explicit scenes, some of the fetishes (especially the bondage in the Escalation series), can be a bit overwhelming and detract severely from anything that makes this show anything but pornography. 
 
I have only seen the first 16 episodes however, because these are the only ones available (that I could find) with English subtitles. Also this series may prove difficult to obtain and I was only able to find it through torrents. 
 
Cream Lemon is an episodic show with new characters and different settings in each episode with the exception of a few multi-episode series. The stories surrounding each episode are extremely varied ranging from science fiction (Star Trap and Pop Chaser) to World War II era Japan (Black Cat Mansion) to pure fantasy (the Rall series) although most if not all of the other episodes feature some aspects of school in them. 
 
The animation in Cream Lemon is superbly done and even looks good today despite being created in the 80's. The motion of characters is generally fluid although there are many sex scenes which do not always hold up to this standard. I would like to draw specific attention to the animation in ""Black Cat Mansion"" (episode 11) which was simply spectacular and brought out the story in very vivid detail. The only episode which was particularly unappealing in terms of design was the first episode of the two-part Mako series in which faces were just plain ugly or expressions were animated rather lazily. 
 
In general the music was enjoyable and featured many piano pieces (especially in the escalation series) but also had some guitar stuff and, of course, had porno music going on during sex scenes. 
 
I can't really say much about the characters being exciting or anything for the most part as their primary function was to lead to the sexual encounters between themselves and others. Almost all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. Some characters are enjoyable due to their personalities or due to the inherent humor of the episodes. 
 
What I enjoyed most about Cream Lemon and watching it episodically were the differences between episodes. Some could be very funny and a few made me LOL a few times (Pop Chaser, Star Trap and Narisu Scramble). In some of the episodes the plots were so surreal in fact that you could even laugh at the premises of them even if the episodes themselves were not explicitly humorous. 
 
Others had decidedly good plots despite being only to facilitate sex. An example of this is the Ami series which, if there were no sexually explicit scenes, easily comes off as simply a drama, albeit possessing a plot which involves an incestuous relationship. Another is the Rall series which focuses more on action scenes (scenes which did NOT involve sex) and in my opinion had less focus on explicit sex even though there were several scenes in which it did surface. This is about a village being attacked by a great evil (who wants to violate the women obviously) and a mythic heroine who must save them.  
 
Overall this series is worth watching once and I feel that at least one or two episodes would be appealing to the average male (I doubt females would have any interest whatsoever). Thank you for reading :)

          
 
       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in  
the 80s and though most of it's stories are absolutely abhorrent, it is indeed, interesting to see how a multitude of genres are coming together and being integrated here while the scenes act as side stories that the characters develop from. It seems that what ""Cream Lemon"" wants to accomplish is anything from what people usually expect out of your prototypical hentai series, by trying to incorporate a tons of characters and signifiers that would give more meaning to the sexual content or sort of avoid having the sexual content become too much of a repetitive arena and distraction for the narrative. Instead of throwing in a sex scene in just because, 'Lemon' wants it's viewers to think and analyze about the content, enjoying it for non-perverted reasons too. That being said, I don't recommend watching the entire series but, I do recommend giving at least, a few episodes a try just to see what the craziness is really like. 
 
It doesn't have an overarching story either so, you can basically start anywhere you'd prefer. I'd also advise doing some research on what some critics have said to be the strongest episodes. Otherwise, you will be in for a painful experience not enjoying it one bit as the show is quite mercurial in what it provides. For me, I like high fantasy so, I stuck with those instead and officially stopped there.

Under the guise of young mecha conceptor Ladios Sopp, he is compelled by an old friend, Dr Ballanche, to save his two latest Fatimas Lachesis and Clotho. And so began the stories of the Joker System, as well as Amaterasu's love for Lachesis.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","The Five Star Stories takes its name from the Joker Star Cluster where the stories take place. The star cluster is made up of four stars: Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern. The ""fifth star"" is a large comet named Stant that passes through that sector of space every 1,500 years pulling with it its own collection of orbiting planets.
In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the ""Super Empire"", controlled all 4 solar systems of the Joker Cluster. They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Cluster. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for ""Joker Calendar"" and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized.
The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered ""fatimas"" are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar heads that dominate the battlefields. Warfare between nations is commonplace and few still hope for peace.
Mortar heads are the combat mainstays of the Joker Universe. They are mecha which require superhuman reflexes and skill to control, and are therefore only utilized by headliners with Fatima copilots. Fatimas are humanoid creatures genetically engineered for a life of service on the battlefield. Fatimas are necessary copilots for mortar heads and mentally merge with the computer systems of these devastating machines to control weapons, communications and other vital processes. As such, Fatimas are designed to have computational skills rivaling any computer.
As of the 2013 May issue of Newtype, the setting of FSS has changed to fit the lore of Mamoru Nagano's 2012 film Gothicmade. MH (Mortar Headd) has been renamed GTM (GothicMade), while Fatimas have been renamed AF (Automatic Flowers).
","It's a beautiful show, with distinctive character designs and richly drawn backgrounds.  And the prettiest of pretty-boy main characters to boot.  And yet...  
   
The thing is, Five Star Stories is a very long-running and popular manga series.  In fact, so long running is that it started in 1986, and is still coming out three decades later.  It's a massive exercise in world building (or, rather in this case, multi-solar-system building), with a back-story that stretches past a thousand years, far too many characters to count, and intertwining machinations that would take hours to explain.  Think Dune.  Think Legend of Galactic Heroes.  It's a massive amount of material.   
   
And here, you have a single, one-hour OVA, to cover it all.  Or, to be more succinct, to introduce it all.     
   
An almost impossible task, and unfortunately it shows.  There's a ton of exposition that has to take place, all sorts of explaining of concepts and people, and it's a whole lot to take in at once.  You spend half the time just trying to suss out who is doing what and why, and it never really sinks in.     
   
I guess if this whets your appetite, this is to entice you to check out the manga.  Which, was probably half the intention of this one-shot OVA in the first place.

          
 
       Helpful The Five Star Stories is a notoriously complex and detailed manga by Nagano Mamoru, who also worked on L-Gaim, a mecha show that Yoshiyuki Tomino fans should be familiar with.  
 
 
The movie, however, had minimal involvement from Nagano, and only tells the story of the first 3 or so volumes of the manga or the first ""book"" released here in the U.S. and so by the end it feels like it has just set the stage for an epic, interstellar adventure filled with androids, robots, and androgynous gods. And that's it. That's where it stops. This could be seen as a major flaw, and it is, for those who don't ever plan on reading the manga. For those who have had the pleasure to experience the story on paper though, this movie is a great visual treat. The story we get to see is nothing but an introduction, so it does feel a bit weak, even if there is an action packed climax at the end. 
 
 
The art style gives away the era it is from quite easily, and will invoke nostalgia in many veteran anime viewers, and possibly repulsion by those newer and more spoiled. The mech design, though barely seen here is fantastic. I can't stress enough how amazing Nagano's mechanical designs are. If you can get this movie in 1080p, DO IT! 
 
 
The music from what I remember was great, the notes that bombard your ears as soon as the title screen shows up is very fitting for the type of story this is. The theme played in the credits is catchy and again, very nostalgic for its era. 
 
The characters are all great, and I love them. But this is from the perspective of one who has read the manga. You don't get to really see their full potential here, but there are some glimpses of what they may become.  
 
 
This movie is just fun to watch, I wouldn't say it's the pinnacle of cel animation, I'd shift more towards ""Do You Remember Love?"" for that, but this is definitely up there. For those interested in this series, I recommend this movie as an introduction, then the manga as a followup. Grab yourself every artbook you can find, I know there's gigabytes of material out there, they're all worth it, Nagano is fantastic. 
 
 
Any fan of mecha, especially of the fantastic variety (Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Dunbine) should look into this series. You won't regret it. 


          
 
       Helpful If you're into sci-fi/mecha-related anime from the 80s chances are you are aware of the existence of Five Star Stories and you're probably wondering whether to watch it or not.  
 
This will be a fairly short review wherewith I will try to answer this question. For those of you who don't have time nor patience to read the full review, here's a short answer: no, just don't. For the rest of you, here's why you should avoid this anime and save 1 hour of your life that can be spent in so many better ways. 
 
There isn't much to say, actually. The story is a complete mess: a weak and rushed plot that explains almost nothing (and the few things that are explained are confused and not well developed) is a bad thing on its own, but if you add no character development at all... well, you have a bad anime. And that's what it is: not horrible, not trash, it's just a bad anime that isn't worh to be watched. 
 
Interesting mecha and ship design and decent animation aren't enough to save it from a 4 out of 10, and the character design is weird. This anime offers no enjoyment so don't even bother and just ignore it.

He reluctantly teams up with his obsessive stalker Yuno Gasai (who also possesses such a diary), and she takes it upon herself to ensure his safety. But there's more to the girl than meets the eye, as she might have other plans for her unrequited love...

His only friends are Deus Ex Machina (デウス・エクス・マキナ), the God of Space and Time, and his assistant Muru Muru (ムルムル). Deus transforms Yukiteru's phone into a Future Diary, capable of predicting the future up to ninety days. Yukiteru discovers he and eleven others are part of a battle royale survival game orchestrated by Deus. The aim of this game is to eliminate the other diary holders, the winner to succeed Deus as god and prevent the Apocalypse. Yukiteru finds himself protected by Yuno Gasai (我妻由乃), a charming but psychopathic classmate who obsessively stalks him after they had promised to go stargazing together a year before.
Two major players they encounter are terrorist Minene Uryu, who wants to destroy all religion after her parents died in a faith-fueled war; and Keigo Kurusu, a police officer who wants to end the game. Later, Kurusu betrays Yukiteru and Yuno when he discovers his bed-ridden son is suffering from a terminal illness. He assassinates diary holder Karyuudo Tsukishima and frames Yukiteru and Yuno. Minene turns to detective Masumi Nishijima, exposing Kurusu's crime. In his shame, Kurusu eliminates himself from the game.
John Bacchus, the city's mayor and designer of the Future Diaries, tries to manipulate Yukiteru's debt-ridden father Kurou into stealing his son's diary. Kurou fails, unintentionally murdering his ex-wife Rea, and is then assassinated by Bacchus' men. Yukiteru vows to win the game and resurrect his parents. He and Yuno target the remaining diary holders, Minene, Bacchus, and Kamado Ueshita who runs an orphanage. Meanwhile, Yukiteru's astute friend Aru Akise, and Nishijima investigate the discovery of three corpses in Yuno's house, two being her parents, and the third identified as being Yuno Gasai, bringing her identity into question.
Kamado's diary, which can give others substitute diaries, is connected to a supercomputer, giving citizens in the city Future Diaries as part of Bacchus' plan to help humanity evolve.

Minene sacrifices herself to destroy the vault but fails, only for Aru to witness Yuno access the vault and kill Bacchus. Wanting answers, Aru confronts Deus who reveals the boy is an artificial human designed to observe the game and keep it in balance, but confirms there is a conspiracy around Yuno.
Yukiteru murders his friends and then Kamado. Aru battles Yuno, destroying her diary but discovers she has a spare. Realising the truth, Aru shows a text to Yukiteru before Yuno decapitates him. As the days to the Apocalypse approach, Yukiteru and Yuno consummate their relationship. However, Yukiteru reveals Aru's suggestion that Yuno originates from another timeline and she immediately turns on him. Muru Muru, the true mastermind behind the game's course, confirms Aru's theory. Yukiteru died and Yuno won the game in another timeline but discovered not even the power of a god could bring back the dead. In her sorrow, Yuno went back in time, creating an alternate timeline, murdering and replacing her other self.
Yuno and Muru Muru go back in time again, creating a third world, pursued by Yukiteru and Minene, kept alive by Deus as a wild card and imbued with a portion of his power. Both parties battle to protect or kill the third world's Yuno and her parents. Yuno, unable to kill Yukiteru, traps him in a dream world where she doesn't exist, and then attacks her alternate self. Yukiteru remembers Yuno, escaping his prison aided by the second world's Muru Muru, and stops Yuno. Though Yukiteru asks Yuno to kill him so she can live, she instead eliminates herself and dies in his arms. Yukiteru becomes god and is dragged to the second world by Muru Muru.
Ten-thousand years later, a mournful Yukiteru has done nothing with his godly powers. He managed to cut off all influences that the first and second worlds had with the third and prevents the third world's deus from dying. Yukiteru gazes at his diary, mourning that he will never see the first world Yuno, the only one he will ever love, ever again. However, the interdimensional walls are broken down by the third world Yuno, who possesses the first world's memories courtesy of an atoning Muru Muru. Yukiteru and Yuno reunite as gods of the second world and prepare to fulfill their promise to go stargazing with each other.
","Survival anime, one of my favorite genres, I love stories where a lot of people die just to reach the goal of the game, then we have Mirai Nikki, or Future Diary, if you like the dub, which is actually pretty bad. 
 
Our protagonist Amano Yukkiteru is put in a survival game which will choose who is the new god of time and space, you have to kill eleven players in other to win. The only tool you have to prevent you from dying, is a diary that tells the future and what's to happen to you. Yukki doesn't want to become god or get killed, he later meets a girl named Yuno Gasai, aKa the queen of yanderes, who is willing to kill anyone who touches Yuki, mostly because she's crazy for him. 
 
Now let me tell why this is on my top 20 favorite anime series. 
 
First thing to start off is the characters. My favorite character is not Yuno, it's the 9th, Uryuu Minene. She's such a badass and a character that I can relate when it comes to death situations. Another character I admire is Akisa Aru, he may not be part of the game, but he plays a huge role in the series when comes to keep Yukki alive. I like Yuno too, but I wish she was less horny for Yukki. I like Yukki too, he starts off as a wimpy crybaby but he later becomes , determined guy every since, well, the incident happened, but he's a still a crybaby. 
 
The setting is ideal for a story like this, a normal city in Japan where probably nothing bad will happen, well, you can guess what happens next, lots of psychological shit. 
 
Overall, a great psychologic survival suspence story with an amazing plot and characters. Defenently a highly recommending serie for people who love survival anime or guys with insane lovesick girlfriends. 

          
 
       Helpful Where do I begin? Before watching this, I did my usual background research over this show to see if it was worth watching. I started this show with mixed feelings, I was excited to indulge in a enticing premise involving future diaries, but at the same time I was sceptical because of all the poor reviews that the show received. BUT, I'm thankful that I managed to overlook the fact that the show was not all that well-received and still carried on with it. In return, I was rewarded with a beautiful story.  
 
I shall first start with the bad points of the show, and the reason why many dislike it. The execution of the story isn't done very well, with the plot being rushed at some points in time and becoming too slow at the next, there also isn't as much suspense as there should be for a mystery thriller genre. The story itself is also filled with too many disconnected story arcs that makes it feel as though you're watching many sub stories instead of one as a whole. As for the characters, I personally found all characters to be pretty too over the top and extreme and only took fancy to Yuno, Akise, and Minene. Character development definitely wasn't this anime's strong point, with pretty big personality inconsistency with the two mains (although personally I found them to be justifiable).  
 
HOWEVER, I was still able to enjoy myself throughout the course of watching this anime because the ending is spectacular. Without revealing too much, I just want to mention that nearing the ending episodes, things start to go a little crazy and just when you think you know what will happen next, the most unexpected of things happen. With one of the CRAZIEST plot twists, and some unexpected themes that are a personal favourite of mine, I can't help but love this anime for it. The romance in this anime, although extremely unconventional because Yuno is a yandere, was still nice to root for as it progressed and Yuki began to have a change in his feelings for Yuno.  
 
Adding on, I really enjoyed the art and music for this, with one of the most beautiful pieces of instrumental piano in touching moments, it really adds to the tenderness of the scenes, giving them more FEELS! It really depends on a personal level whether or not you will enjoy this anime. If you're someone that has an extremely keen eye for details or plot holes, then perhaps you would be too bothered by the bad parts of Mirai Nikki to enjoy it. But if you're looking for a compelling story, go ahead and watch it! 

          
 
       Helpful NO SPOILERS. I promise! :) 
 
Mirai Nikki, for most people, will be a hit or miss. It tries to combine a HELL of a lot of genres into one small package's worth of 26 episodes. There's probably a misconception that Mirai Nikki can be classified a ""psychological thriller"" the same way Death Note or Steins;Gate is commonly labeled, however, Mirai Nikki takes on a slightly different tone. At its core, Mirai Nikki was a romance. 
 
 
Story - 8 
 
It's difficult to judge Mirai Nikki's story. While it's concept is incredibly unique, it's hard to say that the presentation of it is done well. The plot twists are unexpected and wild, especially as the story reaches its climax, but gaping plot holes tarnish the experience a bit. You will NOT enjoy Mirai Nikki's story if you are expecting a bulletproof mystery story. 
 
The first few episodes were extremely interesting for me. As the story progresses, however, it becomes apparent that many questions are left unanswered, and the show starts to become dull and dragged on. Mirai Nikki is another example of an anime that was too long for the story it had to tell. However, the show pulls itself together during the final episodes and picks up the pace in time to leave a mixed final impression.  
 
 
Art - 9 
 
The art is great, but not outstanding. It's evident that a lot of work was put into the action scenes to make it, well, action, and characters are drawn well. Overall, the art scheme is simply very fitting for what Mirai Nikki is. It's dark enough to be taken seriously as an action/psychological/thriller, but comedic and lighthearted as well for the aspects that need it. Mood changes within the anime are carried out pretty well. 
 
 
Sound - 9 
 
Great openings, endings, and BGM. Nothing too memorable, though. 
 
 
Character - 10 
 
Character is where Mirai Nikki becomes something to love or hate. For one thing, there are so many characters in this anime that it could not possibly hope to develop all of them or properly introduce them. The one thing it never falters from, however, is the focus on the two main characters, Yuki and Yuno. And this is where I believe Mirai Nikki truly shines. 
 
A note on the main protagonist: Yuki is the typical Shinji archetype. He's weak, pathetic, and socially screwed, and although he goes through some incredible character development, he never becomes strong. If you are looking for that kind of Shounen anime, you should turn away now, because this kind of main character gets annoying REALLY fast.  
 
There is no doubt in my heart, though, that Yuki becomes an entirely different person at the end of the show. He goes through a beautiful cycle of love, depression, misunderstanding and regret. Although Yuno's character development seems nonexistent at first, she is a truly unique character that is slowly unraveled and developed as well as the story reaches its climax. 
 
 
Enjoyment - 8 
 
Overall, I was pleased with the feeling that Mirai Nikki gave me. The only aspect of the show that brought it down to an 8 was that the story dragged on too long in the middle and my interest waned. I was pleasantly surprised, however, as the series finished. And although I usually come to dislike most endings, the ending to Mirai Nikki wasn't too bad. 
 
 
Overall - 9 
 
Watch it for a unique experience, but it may not be what you're looking for.

The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion to whomever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named ""Koro-sensei"".

","Reviewing a special... I've always wanted to do this. XD 
 
So this episode is a little 10 minute extra to the main series which chronicles the first encounter between Karasuma and Korosensei, as told from Korosensei's point of view.  
 
This is pretty much comic relief for followers of this series since season 1 ended in a somewhat abrupt manner. It starts off on a serious note with Karasuma locking horns with Korosensei for the first time in a dank jail cell as the slimy octopus states his various demands and what not, and then the episode ends in a somewhat unexpected manner. The art and soundtrack are all consistent with that from the main series. 
 
If you are wondering whether this episode is important, then wonder no more: it does not contribute to the plot in any way, so you may choose not to watch it. There are no teasers, no foreshadowing whatsoever. However... if you have seen season 1, then I do recommend you watch this just for the sake of closure.

6,1116,54,6.810054008,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Junkers Come Here,"This heartwarming and unexpectedly mature story concerns a young girl named Hiromi Nozawa and her dog, Junkers (pronounced Yoon-kers). Hiromi walks us through her childhood troubles of love, schooling, and family bonds. Her companion Junkers accompanies her on this adventure; however, Junkers is no ordinary dog—he can talk and grant 3 wishes. ","['Slice of Life', 'Drama']",none,"Junkers, Come Here encompasses everything that is great about animation. 
 
The movie sticks close to the reality we know and avoids topical and epochal content while still using animation effectively to depict scenes that would otherwise be difficult, expensive, or uncanny in other media. While the story it tells is typical, the writing, soundwork, and pacing of the scenes demonstrate mastery of craft. While neither being a dramatic film nor a comedy, Junkers manages to constantly deliver scenes which are wholeheartedly funny, moving, and entertaining. The characters and story deliberately avoid feeling artificial, and even with the inclusion of a talking dog, the movie's universe feels completely like our own. 
 
Movie gems like this are the reason I keep watching anime. Rare is it to find a movie which can sincerely entertain me for every second of its runtime and leave me feeling good after reflecting on the experience.

          
 
       Helpful This heartwarming family film focuses on a young girl named Hiromi dealing with the complications within her family alongside her pet talking dog, Junkers. The film believably deals with the issues of divorce and parental absence that effect Hiromi in this film, issues that you wouldn't find touched upon in many family or children's films. Both of Hiromi's parents have areas of work that require them to have days to weeks at a time away from home and Hiromi is normally cared for by her tutor and family maid. While the young girl puts on the facade of not minding the work of her family, her dog and tutor can tell that the distance with her parents hurts her emotionally and the movie creates a coming-of-age theme out of Hiromi's situation with her parents. Hiromi behaves believably for a girl of her age and gets enough fleshing-out where one can connect with the problems she faces throughout the movie. 
 
At the same time though, the anime deals with the issues in enough of a light-hearted and mature way where the content won't alienate or insult the intelligence of its wide audience. The anime mixes in its fun moments and jokes involving Hiromi and Junkers' interactions with one another to lighten the mood at points and has some magical elements thanks to Junkers that contribute to the anime's heartwarming moments. The combination of fun and serious elements give Junkers Come Here its strong charm and excellent quality for a family anime film that some could mistaken for a Studio Ghibli film with the similar themes and animation style from the studio's films used for this movie. 
 
Speaking of animation, the backgrounds to Junkers Come Here used a soft pastel-like drawing style that are beautiful to look at, are well detailed and add to the film's gentle mood. Character designs are a bit on the simple side, but are drawn to make the characters look lifelike and not feature the big-eye or ridiculous hair styles and colors found within many popular and well-known anime titles. The soundtrack mostly consists of light and whimsical music pieces that do their part in enhancing both the fun and serious moments found throughout the film. 
 
Overall, Junkers Come Here made for quite the engaging and touching anime family film offering a nice balance of fun and serious moments in the exploration of Hiromi's family issues and the girl learning to be honest with her family in expressing her feelings on the dilemma. It is definitely worth adding to your collection and even a film worth showing to your children if you have any. 

          
 
       Helpful This is an anime for all the latchkey kids out there. This is an anime for everyone that has sat alone at an empty table eating microwaved dinners night after lonesome night.  This is an anime for all the people that grew up in broken families, where stony silences and frigid stares were the main means of communicating. And this, sadly, is an anime for me, someone who spent the majority of his childhood, desperately trying to reconcile two hostile parents that couldn't stand to be in the same room as one another. I too spent many late nights waiting to hear that car pull into the driveway or that key rattle in the lock. It's the reason I was drawn to reviewing this anime, because the anime resonated with me on a personal level. I'm also reviewing this anime with the hope that my words will influence a few readers to give this film a chance. It's closing in on its 20th anniversary, it's won awards for best animated film, and yet still fewer than 1000 people have completed it on MAL. 
	 
 
Story: (8/10) Now I hope I didn't discourage anyone with my introduction. Even those that can't relate to the opening will still be touched by this remarkably poignant and moving film. Both slice of life and drama, this story tells the tale of a young girl named Hiromi and her pet dog, Junkers. With her grandmother recently deceased, her mother working deep into the night, her father constantly away on business, and a lack of friends at school, Hiromi finds herself struggling with loneliness and a feeling of abandonment.  Junkers is her only constant companion, and we quickly learn that Junkers is no ordinary dog... Junkers can talk! When people hear talking dog, instantly they pigeon hole the film as a kiddy movie, but this film tackles serious and difficult issues. Divorce, abandonment, sacrifice, and being true to oneself are each explored in this surprisingly emotional story. Importantly though, the film manages to avoid falling into the trap of being melodramatic. The drama is never overblown to the point where it becomes unrealistic.  
	 
 
Characters: (9/10) Hiromi takes up the lion's-share of the screen time, and her character is more than up for the task. Her character is beautifully developed through out the film, and its very easy to empathize with her pain. Outwardly Hiromi struggles to convince the world that she's perfectly fine. She portrays a happy, confident, precocious girl to all who meet her. The truth behind the mask is that she's really breaking down inside, and the weight of wearing it day in and day out only makes her misery worse. Junkers is an interesting character as well. He plays the naive, well-meaning friend, but perhaps he's more than he seems... The parents aren't given enough screen time to really develop much, which is unfortunate, but fits into the theme of the absentee parents. I haven't mentioned the boarder that's living with them yet. His relationship with Hiromi becomes quite interesting, and he may be the second best character in the film. And last but not least is the housekeeper, who provides wonderful comic relief. 
 
Animation: (6/10) Even if we give the film some leeway due to its age, the animation can only be described as average. The frames per second seem to be slightly on the low side, and some of the movements lack smoothness. The character models are simple, yet effective. The facial expressions work well to aid the story. The backgrounds and sets are very plain, but this isn't the type of film that requires beautiful and detailed artwork to carry it. The simple artwork lets the story and the characters become the stars of the film.  
 
Sound: (8/10) The soundtrack for the film is decent, but not remarkable. I thought the voice acting was superb though. Hiromi's voice actor did a fabulous job, and was always able to convey her characters emotions to the viewer. I also really liked the maid's voice actor as well. 
 
Overall: (8/10) Again, I couldn't recommend this film enough to anyone that enjoys a good drama or coming of age movie. After I watched this movie, I was really shocked it was as unpopular as it was. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I promise you won't be disappointed!

After finishing it and reading a good portion of the manga, I can say with confidence that I am very glad I finished it - in fact, it's by far one of my favourite anime. So why only a six? I do try to be honest with my reviews so, despite how much I enjoyed the show, I am well aware of its flaws and I can understand why they might ruin the viewer's enjoyment slightly. With that being said, I'll try my best to write a spoiler-free review with as little bias as possible. 
 
STORY 
""Colourful, sparkly inmates have fun trying to escape from an equally colourful, sparkly prison. Shenanigans ensue""; - Thomas Sanders, Real or Fake Anime? 
 
Set in a prison, I went in to Nanbaka expecting to find an emotional and thought-provoking story detailing the inmates' journey to rehabilitation and redemption. I quickly realised that I was wrong, though I should probably have known better given that the genre is ""action comedy"". The story features four particular inmates in their day-to-day life in a particularly high-security prison, where their antics make for, in my own opinion, some excellent comedy. In many episodes I was laughing the whole way through, so I can safely say they succeeded in the comedy element. However, the plot switched from comedic and lighthearted to morbid and intense back to lighthearted again very quickly to the point where the self-aware narrator has to remind the audience that they're watching a comedy. While this didn't bother me too much, I can see why it would others and make the plot difficult to follow. (The manga in particular got rather confusing for me - I had to keep going back and re-reading sections.) While comedy seems to be the main focus there is a small theme of redemption running throughout the show. 
STORY - 7/10 
 
ART 
Remember the adjectives ""colourful"" and ""sparkly""? Yeah, that's about it. Each character is designed with extravagant hairstyles and colour palettes, and the backgrounds are particularly bright and somewhat eye-bleeding. While this can enhance the comedy acts, the sparkles can take away from the seriousness of certain fight scenes and the bright backgrounds and colourful characters are somewhat inappropriate for the setting of a formidable prison. However, it's certainly fun to draw if nothing else. 
ART: 6/10 
 
SOUND 
First of all, I loved the opening theme. I preferred the one in the first season to the second due to them being performed by different artists, but both where satisfyingly catchy which made it hard to skip. Another aspect of sound I noticed was the way it changed in the mid-point screen depending on how intense the episode was, which certainly had the right effect. In terms of soundtrack, while I wouldn't listen to it independently it did enhance certain fight scenes and drama, even if it wasn't particularity memorable. 
SOUND: 7/10 
 
CHARACTER 
Colourful sparkliness aside, I loved the characters. Many reviewers have commented on them being two-dimensional at times and I do get that (like I said, I'm really not biased), but I love them nonetheless. They all have prominent, unique traits that caused them to be comedic and memorable to me - the phrase ""precious cinnamon roll"" comes to mind when describing a good 90% of them, though in various different ways. Small amounts of character development is present, though the manga goes into a lot more depth with them. An important thing to note is that they are all morally grey, with convicted criminals who show kindness and friendliness and professional guards who commit questionable acts at times. (Course, it could just be me as a character development lover overthinking things but let's not go there.) Character development potential is visible, but not explored as well as it could be which mildly frustrates me. There's also diversity among the cast, with characters from various nations such as the protagonist Jyguo's British and American cellmates, though their nationalities don't come across in their voice acting. 
CHARACTER: 7/10 
 
ENJOYMENT 
This is where I'm gonna stop being non-biased. There wasn't a single bit of the anime I didn't enjoy, so this section is getting a solid ten regardless of the show's evident shortcomings and other people's opinions. 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10

       Helpful This anime, for me, is the epitome of the 'well you had us in the first half' meme.  
 
The tonal shift in the 6th episode gave me whiplash and made me feel like I had all of a sudden started watching a different anime.  
 
At its best Nanbaka is a fun show about a group of lovable morons. The group dynamic was so fun to see and made me love all of the characters. At its worst it casts aside all of that for a much darker and more serious action type anime and in doing so loses all charm from the characters and any attachment I had to them. 
 
Tl:dr, should have stayed a 'gag' anime.

          
 
       Helpful Sho Futamata's story NANBAKA tells the tale of Nanba Prison, considered the most unbreakable facility in the world. This prison is populated by a host of colorful characters, both the prisoners that have been contained there and the warders who are employed to contain them. Each of these residents have their own distinct history, 
 
The animation is beautiful to see, and the characters are pretty and interesting with enough character depth to gain interest. Also, there are some numerical jokes in the story (for instance, Nanba means ""number"") that give the story a clever touch. 
 
However, one major problem the series suffers from is too slow writing. The first season had decent pacing and was enjoyable, but the second season drags on for too long. The manga comic has already moved on beyond what the show brings up, and if a third season will ever be made it's going to need major effort to be brought up to date with the events of the manga. 
 
It'd be a fascinating tale with an equally fascinating cast, if it wasn't imprisoned by too slow writing.

One day, he discovers a hidden tunnel underneath a spa that leads him to a modern Japanese bath house. Inspired by the innovations found there, he creates his own spa, Roma Thermae, bringing the modern ideas to his time.
Each subsequent chapter follows Lucius facing some sort of a problem, just to be swept to Japan once again. He visits modern bath houses, personal baths, waterparks, fertility festivals, and even zoos. There, he always happens to find the inspiration to solve the exact problem he has been tasked with.
","I am not sure where to start my review for this one. The storyline compares and contrasts Japan and ancient Rome in regards to their bath culture. I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did. The two flaws in the story line are the fact that it is repetitive and the fact that despite the fact it makes the subject some what interesting I doubt very few people are going to remember that many historical facts from the show. 
 
I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me. 
 
Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time. 
 
I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. 

          
 
       Helpful _Thermae Romae_ is very much a one-note gimmick anime, from its basic plot style to its animation-style and Lucius's hilarious reactions to everything (I'd call the series a bit like _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ or _Yakitate! Japan_), but it suits me at the moment, and the historical accuracy is sufficient to not bother me. Really, where else are you going to get any thing like this sort of historical fantasy but anime? The diversity and weird gems like TR is one of the reasons I love anime.

but I became overly pleasantly surprised and I did learn some historical and culturally facts, WHICH I DO NOT MIND :D :D :D :D  
 
so yeah... do not expect it to be a great historical and autentic anime like ""Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin"", Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, ""grave of the fireflies"", etc etc.

The story goes off basis which is okay, the anime starts out as a rpg then a split life of school and rpg games. This anime gave me great enjoyment, some humor never got old in my opinion.  
 
 
 
Spoilers Possibly 
 
 
 
The main characters set character is dense at times and makes you feel like head desking. That is pretty much the only thing off about this anime. The ending suits how the anime should be except when he pulls away from the girl which like come on dude make a decision. Some drama is pulled into this anime but overall this anime is worth watching. Skipping 1 episode once is fine but be careful on which one you do it on.

          
 
       Helpful This anime started strong. It had great comedy (imho) and even felt as though it was going to have decent character development. So why do i have a rating of 6? Allow me to explain. 
 
Starting with the story we have, essentially, another game/life otaku anime. This is not SAO or Overlord as the characters are not trapped in the game world. They are instead highschool teens that each enjoy games. One of which enjoys it to an excessive extent and has even lost touch with the difference between the game world and reality. At first the story attempts to delve into this and they form a club specifically to help said character. Sadly, this quickly devolves into an average rom/com. Don't get me wrong, i laughed quiet hard at some of the scenes but the development for ""Romance"" was nowhere to be found and it ends on an extremely overplayed/cliche note. 
 
The art was above average but nothing particularly amazing since we have seen plenty with the same art/animation in these last few seasons. Not to much to note on it other than it was bright and colorful, for the most part. 
 
The sound was also nothing to write home about. It was above average but none of the OSTs really stuck with me or gave me any sense of attachment to the characters. This could largely be blamed on the lack of character development but we will get to that next.  
 
The character....this was both the best and worst part of the anime. There was little to NO development in this department. The only one that saw any advancement was our protagonist and i'm not even sure i want to call it progression in his character because it felt forced. I loved Aika in the beginning but that love slowly shriveled as her character seemed to slowly lose the drive she had originally. In the first few episodes she not only confessed, openly snuggles up to him and even states they are married (publicly) she also had a strong sense of attachment that, at times, even made her seem Yandere. She even had an extremely funny but courageous scene that showed just how strong her conviction was to have our protagonist accept her as his waifu (let me tell you i would not have shut that door). That was quickly turned over though and she very quickly became a character for comedic/fanservice purposes. Personally, i'm never one to pick at fanservice but when it literally takes over a major character that had plenty of good development room, it hurts. I literally wanted to cry towards the middle of this series of episodes because i knew how it would end and it ended in exactly that way....without any romantic development and without any character development. If anything it went backwards T_T 
 
Overall, i would say that this anime is decent. IF you are looking for romance go almost anywhere else. This has VERY LITTLE development in that area and quickly focuses on comedy. If you are looking for something to watch passively for a good few laughs then i would say this is pretty good.

          
 
       Helpful There's a common misconception/joke in the gaming community, which goes by the fact that ""Girl gamers do not exist.""  And while yes, the idea of girl gamers is a goddamn myth, anime brings us the unique perspective on what life would be like if there were girl gamers.  And so we are presented Netoge, a show all about one boy's shock to finding out that they indeed exist, and the dangers of crippling gaming addiction.  
 
Story: Nishimura Hideki is your average everyday gaming otaku who spends a lot of time playing the show's MMORPG known as 'Legendary Age'.  After getting his heart broken after finding out that his previous in-game love interest was actually a guy playing a female character (cause that TOTALLY doesn't happen IRL), he swears to himself that he would never again fall in love with another in-game character ever again.  Fast forward two years, and he's married to someone in-game (great dedication there, buddy).  Even more so, he finds out that his in-game wife, Ako, is actually a person from his school, and is actually a real girl!  Not only that, but he also finds out that Ako has a crippling problem of discerning reality with the in-game world, as she constantly refers to him as 'her husband' and calls him by his avatar's name despite the two of them not...really knowing each other all that well. 
 
The main plot of Netoge is mostly about trying to get Ako to reenter back into reality through various means.  Either by trying to show her how good the real world is, have her do some things without a computer, or just socialize with people her age, the main plotline follows Hideki, or Rusian (since hell, that's what everyone in the show calls him) and the rest of the members in their small guild try and condition Ako back to being a normal girl rather than being the somewhat incompetent healer that she plays in-game.  All the while we follow the actual real-life romance of a boy trying to cope with a girl that he most likely will be taking care of and marrying for the rest of his life in the future.  In addition, with its main draw on online game, most predominantly MMORPGs, Netoge also capsulizes on different tricks and situations within a game of that genre by spending a good chunk of its runtime doing things in-game, visualizing situations, and showing the characters actually playing the game that the show is wrapped around to give us a bit more than doing an intervention for a 17 year old girl. 
 
Another plus for the series comes in its usage of ecchi.  Now, not saying that fanservice is good, but the amount and the way that Netoge does it is certainly much more tasteful and enjoyable than just plastering boobs on a screen.  Most of it is done in a more comical sense and doesn't use your generic 'dude landing on the girl's boobs' or 'walk in on the girl naked' so as a result, I don't find the ecchi all the jarring or takes away from the series in any way. 
 
The show however does have one fatal flaw with it, and that comes in the way of its actual focus on plot.  Towards the middle of the series, the show shifts to focus more on other aspects on the series rather than its core focus on trying to reintroduce Ako back into society.  As such, the series loses its way a bit and diverges down the different path of focusing solely on game-related content to the point that I myself even forgot about on what the point of the series was until the very end and then I remembered 'Oh right, this show was about helping a girl with her addiction.' 
 
Overall though, Netoge showed itself to be a very peculiar show that wasn't as gritty or deep as other shows are when it comes to dealing with hikkiomori-like characters (Like NHK) and provided a light-hearted and happier example all the while showing its audience other parts of its story, such as its romance, which while it didn't particularly go anywhere special (because thanks for that troll ending, Netoge), was still rather cute to go through and watch. 
 
Overview: 
+ Lighthearted story that delved into hikkomori lifestyles 
+ Other plot aspects aside from the main story 
+/-  Some ecchi (if you're not a fan of ecchi, any ecchi, tread carefully) 
-  Other aspects invaded and took over the show in the latter half 
-  Bit of a troll ending  
 
Characters: As expected with a show involving hardcore gamers, the characters of the show are all members of an extremely small guild of four members where each of them pertain to a certain role in a battle party. 
 
First there's Nishimura Hideki, or Rusian, the main protagonist of our story.  Rusian is a boy that embraces his in-game life and his experiences online yet doesn't entirely reject the idea of real life.  Rusian as a character doesn't really stand out in the way of an interesting character.  He likes playing net games, sure, but he doesn't have any particular interesting character traits aside from masterfully being able to manage Ako and have an iron will of patience when dealing with her and her lovesick demeanor.  That being said, he does grow in the series and devotes his screentime to helping his guild as the party's tank, as well as helping his in-game wife, being not a lowly pervert or overpowered protagonist, but just your average gamer who doesn't spend money on a game who just wants to have fun.   
 
Then there's the real reason why the series exists, Tamaki Ako, Rusian's wife in-game, and potential wife IRL.  (Cause there is no reason given how the series was going that these two were not going to get together.)  As mentioned before, Ako confuses the idea of reality and game to the point that to her, the two are basically the same thing, hence why she's confused over why her friends and her 'husband' make such distinctions.  Similar to Rusian, she doesn't really have many characteristics beyond being addicted to online games and has her heart set on being a housewife.  She does grow as the series goes along as well, which does give the series a sense of progress, albeit not as big due to the changes from beginning to end not being quite severe. 
 
Finally, we have the two remaining members of the guild, Akane and Kyou, or the fighter and the mage of the group.  These two characters play the normal person trying to hide her online gaming tendencies and the whale who spends money for cash items in-game.  These two characters play more as a supporting characters in the main cast, as their role in the series is to aid our main couple more than anything else.  Like their other guild members, they don't particularly have many interesting traits about them due to the characters pretty much being one-note and the plot is largely story-based, but they do have more merit to them than the actual supporting cast. 
 
The supporting cast is largely filled with mooks and other really unimportant or one-off characters that only appear once or twice in the series.  Aside from Nekohime and Akane's friend (whose name escapes me), everyone else is pretty much nonexistent in terms of actual character importance. 
 
Overview: 
+ Character growth 
+ Focused character importance 
-  Most characters are one-note 
-  Side cast is essentially worthless and/or non-existent 
 
Art: Produced by Project No.9, the studio who created...Saikin no Imouto and...Kouya...(I think I threw up in my mouth a bit), the art for Netoge is a very light, almost shiny color scheme that radiates brightness and relates back to the happy and lightheartedness that is the series's tone.  As such, the colors of the show are almost muted with white and shine and are very high light in that regard. 
 
The character designs of the show are moe.  Not even gonna sugarcoat it, the look of all of these characters are just straight up cute girl designs.  The quality of animation for them is very consistent despite No.9 being a company that hasn't had much of a track record but due to the very common cute girl trope that the show goes for a lot of the time, this aspect of the show may drive some people away. 
 
As mentioned before, the show does have ecchi.  And very clearly due to the fact that the majority of the female cast each have quite a sizable bosom.  There is one character design that just screams 'female armor' but aside from that, the actual fanservicey scenes are few and far between, and are never just blatant boobs on the screen all the time.  Maybe a few movements here and there when the girls are doing some dramatic action, but that's about it in terms of consistent fanservice in the series. 
 
Overview: 
+ Good, consistent animation 
+/- Fanservice (Though not as much as you may think) 
+/- Moe artstyle (Dependent on your view of moe) 
 
Sound: The soundtrack for Netoge really...isn't all that special.  There's nothing that really stands out aside from them being a pair of really cutesy OP and ED combo that expresses the main romance of the series between Hideki and Ako (or Rusian and Ako to be more exact).  They're not really special, they're not unique, so they're as a result not really very memorable. 
 
Personal Enjoyment: I was following the manga before the anime's release and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Due to scans slowing down, the anime caught up and went far beyond the original source material, so there really isn't enough to make a comparison one way or the other.  What I can say is that despite its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I'm one of those suckers for a good OTP, and despite the show sorta...pasting them together, the Ako x Rusian ship was pretty cute. 
 
Did I enjoy this anime? 
 
Yes, I did.  As a gamer, I recognized/understood pretty much all of what the show was showing us and really enjoyed the different aspects overall.  Ako is such a wonderfully weird character that really breathed life into this show due to how much was actually focused onto her, and the show really didn't let go of anything that it had plot-wise throughout its whole run.  (Although it may have had a tough time balancing everything all at once though.) 
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
Really though, it's the ending that kills the show for me.  I'm not gonna spoil what happens, but many romance anime do it, and it is just not fun to watch anytime they do it. 
 
Would I recommend this series? 
 
If you're looking for a fun and not so serious game-related anime, then Netoge is worth a shot.  It's a largely story-based anime that concentrates on its aspects of romance, reconditioning, and games throughout its entire runtime, while adding some slight fanservice that doesn't really take too much away from the show, mixing it altogether with character development that is actually pretty noticeable as the episodes roll by.  The characters aren't all too deep or complex, but it has some merit to it and in my opinion, is an all-around decent show.

       Helpful OK, first of all this is my 1st review and is only because i felt like is unfair that it only contain 1 review and that leave Darkness 2nd as a fail when to me was the opposite. 
I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1). 
 
 
Happy Holidays

 Toradora!  is a romantic comedy that follows this odd duo as they embark on a quest to help each other with their respective crushes, forming an unlikely alliance in the process. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","Ryuji Takasu is frustrated at trying to look his best as he enters his second year of high school. Despite his gentle personality, his eyes give him the appearance of an intimidating delinquent. He is happy to be classmates with his best friend Yusaku Kitamura, as well as the girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. However, he unexpectedly runs into ""the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level""—Taiga Aisaka—who just happens to be Minori's best friend. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and has a habit of snapping violently at people. She takes an instant dislike to Ryuji, and it turns out she is living in an apartment facing Ryuji's house. When Ryuji discovers that Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, and Taiga finds out about Ryuji's affections towards Minori, they make an arrangement to help set each other up with their crushes.
Over the course of the series, Ryuji and Taiga try to set up romantic situations to help each other get to know their friends, but many of the situations backfire. Their classmates observe that they are spending a lot of time with each other, leading to rumors that they might be a couple. Although Ryuji and Taiga try to dispel the rumors, they find that they do enjoy each other's company, with Taiga visiting Ryuji's house to share meals, and Ryuji checking up on Taiga to get her to school, and cleaning for her. They meet Yusaku's childhood friend Ami Kawashima, a popular teen model who transfers into their school. She appears to be friendly and is a self-proclaimed ditz, but beneath her facade is a rather mean and spoiled brat, and she quickly finds herself at odds with Taiga. In spite of this, Taiga tries to put up with her antics as Yusaku wants them to all get along, and Ami begins to grow feelings for Ryuji. The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them.
","On a personal note, I loved Toradora. When a story can develop likable characters and then make me laugh and cry throughout the series, then of course Id be sold.  
 
But to be unbiased, The story was very well put together, a full 25 episodes gave it enough time for each character to be better developed, and it also took away the abrupt ending that comes with most animes that are the usual 12 episodes. But to get into specifics, the characters grow on you through the entire series. at episodes 12 and beyond, it becomes apparent where the love connection is. When Taiga cries for her Ryuuji, you might finding yourself tearing up or going ""Awww"" with the utmost sincerity. And Ryuuji is just as likable. Unfortunately, towards the end you start to disagree with alot of the character actions and will most likely end up a little irritated. The ending wasn't amazing but it was satisfying. It left you with a few questions floating around, but I haven't seen many animes with all the plot holes filled. All in all, Toradora is a great anime and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a slice-of-life, comedy, and romance preference. 

          
 
       Helpful Like all romantic comedies, Toradora is full of flaws. Yet, I still enjoyed all of it. I loved the premise of it. You know right off the bat that the two main characters will end up together, you just don't know how. I love the characters for the most part. Taiga has a more natural and unique feel compared to a typical tsundere. This can be said for the others as well. The characters feel natural and unique. 
 
Here's the problem. Like all romantic comedies, there is no real story. There's only the destination. That's not the actual problem, the problem is the journey. It's just every day problems building into a big problem, then that big problem gets solved. It's usually a problem that can be resolved with any form of communication too. We hit the reset button and start over again. It just seems like we're going around and solving each character's problem one by one until we reach the end. 
 
Now, for my one pet peeve. My one true issue with this entire series. Every time a big confession, big moment, or anything significant would take place, there was always an interruption. Phone calls during conversations, convenient arrivals (inconvenient for us, but convenient for the story), or just some form of milking the audience's attention. 
 
Despite these two flaws, I couldn't help but feel empty after it ended. There wasn't enough. Like Clannad, the ending felt rushed and packed into one or two episdoes. Like Clannad, I didn't get to see enough of what goes down after the fated couple end happily ever after. These flaws, however, are in just about every rom-com. That's the only reason you can forgive it. It's an unwelcome cliche, but it'll always be around. I still enjoyed all of it, nonetheless.

          
 
       Helpful What is it that draws one towards the most unlikely of relationships?  Is it the ""underdog"" qualities, where one desires to see the more ""unfortunate"" character have something wonderful happen to him/her?  Or would it be more along the lines that a ""perfect"" couple is just plain boring and those unlikely pairs are just fantastic to watch, making for an amazing story? 
 
Toradora introduces itself into the romantic comedy genre in a method where the two unlikely characters start off by liking the other's best friend.  However, the progress of each character with their personal love interest proves to be both entertaining and relatable.  The story begins with Ryuuji Takasu accidentally finding the confession letter of Taiga Aisaka, intended to be given to Yuusaku Kitamura (Ryuuji's best friend).  Taiga storms Ryuuji's room with a wooden sword, but Ryuuji reveals that he has a huge crush on Minori Kusheida (Taiga's best friend).  Both decide to help each other in this odd little love square, giving way to hilarity, mischief, drama and of course, romance.  Combine that with the rest of a fantastic cast of characters and the result is a romantic-comedy quite unlike any other I have seen.   
 
When I began watching Toradora (just a month or so after its initial release), I soon caught up with the airing date and was checking daily for the subbed version's release.  That in itself should give away just how much I came to enjoy this wonderful show.  Typically I like to review in a very systematic process; giving individual scores to each category and totaling them up to give an overall score out of 50.  But I feel that if I left it at that, I would be leaving a lot untold about this great show.  So I will give a follow up after my categorical review, for those of you who want a synopsis of my review, or just the ""meat"" and the bottom line. 
 
** STORY 10/10 **     
It takes several things to make a phenomenal story, such as an intriguing plot-line, a believable setting, characters and of course, conflict.  Sometimes, these components come together in such a way as to leave a tale that is worthy of being told and retold.  Toradora presents itself as one of these such tales, having all the workings of becoming one of my favorite stories.  Establishing itself as a school-slice-of-life with romantic, comedic and dramatic elements, the story progresses with quite a satisfying pace (save the last 2 episodes, 24 particularly, but that's another discussion entirely) and leaves the viewer desiring to know what happens next.  Each element of the story seems to be quite well balanced; comedic relief comes into play after a dramatic or tense moment to keep a light-hearted mood, the romance never seems too sappy or unrealistic (I'm sure you've seen those shows where the guy is surrounded by women who SOMEHOW just adore him without even knowing him) and generally speaking, each episode is truly enjoyable from start to finish.  As for the driving factors in the story's progression, the conflicts that show up are mostly internal, character-driven problems; those that you would expect in any typical classroom setting.  Ryuuji's single mom, Taiga's lack of parents even present in her life and the mere fact that their rooms are right next to each other give rise to many of the story's great problems and triumphs alike.  This has been, by far, one of my favorite, realistic story lines I've ever seen.  There were so many times that I felt like I could relate to any number of the characters that it felt as if I was watching a story based loosely on my own personal life.   
 
** ART  9/10 ** 
Now that an incredible story has been etched out and realized, what is the most efficient way to portray the events?  This is where the art comes in, as the medium in which the writers ""show"" how the story unfolds.  Ryuuji, with his ""scary, delinquent eyes"" is drawn really well.  Taiga is so cute throughout, Ami is pretty darn hot, and even the rest of the characters have their own unique appearance that lends to the believability of their personalities.  Each scene looks to be pretty well thought out and plenty of attention was paid to the details.  For the most part, art is one category that is hard to put words to, and instead must be experienced first-hand. 
 
** SOUND 9/10 ** 
Another key component to presenting the story is the sound department, including all the music, ambiance, object noises and voice cast.  Music wise, there's not much to say; the opening/ending themes are interesting, nothing to write home about, but can't really complain either.  During the show there's appropriate use of background melodies, but again, I was never floored by a scene because of some fantastic music.  Ambiance is spot on, many times a busy street sounds like one, the noise of cooking food, the sound of a street all sound pretty darn realistic and blend in smoothly.  Every object noise sounds like a live-sampled sound, in decent quality.  Doors, windows, footsteps even all sound great.  But the thing that pushes my score up to a 9/10 is the amazing voice-cast.  Each character is acted out incredibly well; emotions sound real, personalities even show up in the voices.  Again, sound is something that is hard to describe but must be heard and experienced. 
 
** CHARACTER 10/10 ** 
If there were a category in which I could weight the score heavier, this would be it.  Characters are what sell an anime to me, along with the story.  I have a hard time watching shows in which the characters are hollow or empty, boring, or otherwise lack anything worth mentioning.  That being said, each an every character blew me away.  There doesn't ever seem to be a ""filler"" character; each one lends their part to the overall story and just ""fits.""  I almost guarantee you will find a character in which you relate to in some form.  Each one is well thought out, well planned and scripted extremely well.  Towards the end of the anime, lines from each character seem to fit with the personality they represent.  Several ""Yeah, you would do that"" moments appear, as the main characters are portrayed so well that you feel like you know them personally after a few episodes.   
 
** ENJOYMENT 10/10 ** 
Of all the categories I review, this area should be taken with the biggest grain of salt.  What I find awesome, someone else may find horrible.   
So, with that, I give this category a 10, simply because I liked spending the time watching this show.  I also began waiting (often times very impatiently) for the next episode to be released and subbed, immediately downloading and watching it (even if it was 4 in the morning).  After episode 16 (where I caught up with the airing date) I began to watch each episode twice; once on the release date (usually a Thursday night for me) and again on the following Thursday before the next one aired, just to catch myself up with the story.  I don't regret it one bit, I laughed, then laughed again when I saw it again, knowing it was coming.  I will most likely be watching this again in a few months time, just because it was that good.  Also, the ending is very satisfying.  I have seen many an anime ending that was very cliche or just plain... stupid.  Not so with Toradora.  I felt good after watching it; it really resolved itself and finished off strong.  (Last episode... freaking awesome scene in it... you know which one I'm talking about, or you will know when you see it).   
 
** OVERALL 48/50 ** 
A near flawless score from me, with art and sound being the only non-10 scores.  This is definitely one of my top-10 animes now.  Sure, several things could have made it better, but may have also taken away value from other aspects of the show.   
 
***** BOTTOM LINE *****   
Toradora is a very cute and enjoyable romantic-comedy, slice-of-life anime that is definitely a must see.  With a very satisfying and smooth pacing, there aren't too many dull moments, making this show very good for either a marathon viewing, or a slow, one-episode-a-week pace.  The incredible cast of characters are truly what brings life to this anime, giving a realistic and highly relatable experience.  Don't hesitate to spend the time watching all 25 episodes; you won't be disappointed!

It is the Bakumatsu and early Meiji Period. Akizuki Keiichirou and Kusaka Touma stand of opposite sides of the political scale of the time but still, something as fragile as the shell of a cicada binds these two men together in a tragic and cruel fate. A story of friendship, love and seperation as well as reunion and sacrifice. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Samurai', 'Yaoi']","This three part yaoi story spans the war torn Meiji era when the Japanese turned from a Shogunate to Imperial rule and entered trade with the rest of the world (1862–1869).  While the story unfolds historical dates and important figures are given while the characters give even more bits and pieces of this period during dialog.
Episode One: ""Edo Love Song"" starts in 1862, second year of the Bunkyuu Era, in Shinagawa Gotenyama during the Expulsion of Foreigners movement started by the Chōshū (Choushuu) clan of which Touma Kusaka is a member.  Kusaka differs from his clan believing in peace and opening Japan up to foreigners where it can do trade and stand with equal footing on the world stage, the Open the Country movement.  While trying to stop other Chōshū clan members from setting fire to the British Embassy, Kusaka is confronted by a Bakufu (Shogunate) samurai who helps him and a comrade, Aizawa, escape from the authorities.
Years later, while trying to find a school that will teach him English despite his clan's political stance, Kusaka once again meets the samurai who had saved his life.  No longer in the employ of his Town Magistrate father, Keiichirou Akizuki goes to English school at the Nakahama Private School. Recognizing each other, Akizuki eventually offers to teach Kusaka English.  Having been raised in an upper-class home, Akizuki takes pleasure in learning more about the common class lifestyle that Kusaka has always led while they learn English in secret as their clans cannot see them together without creating conflict.  Despite their precautions, one of the Chōshū sees them and Kusaka has to stop meeting with Akizuki.
Episode Two: ""Record of Ezo War"" starts with Kusaka thinking about cutting ties with his clan when the Head Administrator, Sufu Masanosuke, offers to send him to London to learn about the West.  Before leaving, Kusaka meets with Akizuki one last time during a sunset and they declare their love for each other by kissing and having passionate sweaty sex in a meadow near a riverbank. They consummate their relationship. While Kusaka is in England, Akizuki gains the leadership of his clan and its immediate association with the Shogun.  After four years, Kusaka returns to Japan and receives a high ranking post in the Imperial army.  It is during this time that Japan is in the midst of the greatest civil war Japan has known, the Boshin War, with Kusaka on the Satsuma-Chōshū (Imperial) side and Akizuki on the Bakufu (Shogunate) side.  During one of the last battles, Kusaka finds Akizuki about to commit seppuku after having lost a leg to cannon fire.  Upon being seen by one of his comrades aiding Akizuki, Kusaka kills the man, leaving his lover in shock.
Episode Three: ""Tokyo Tragedy"" starts four years later, with Kusaka working for the new government, wearing Western-style clothes and living in a Western-style home.  In a private Japanese cottage behind the house, he keeps Akizuki in secret.  Relations between the two lovers have broken down as Akizuki cannot stand being kept in hiding in comfort while his fellow Bakufu comrades suffer in prison, and he wants to commit suicide.
Eventually Aizawa, now an officer of the new law, discovers their relationship.  He confronts Akizuki, leaving him with a tantō (short sword).  A while later, it seems things between Kusaka and Akizuki are being patched up; yet a small group of police going through Kusaka's home, led by Aizawa, interrupts one of their moments.  Kusaka runs back to the house, engages in a brief argument with his former comrade, and returns to the cottage only to find Akizuki missing and a suicide note on the futon pillow.
Akizuki pulls himself along the snow-covered ground, Aizawa's tantō in hand, stopping in front of a tree split into four trunks.  After a brief reminiscing, he kills himself; Kusaka finds him a short while later.  Opening the pouch around Akizuki's neck, he realizes that Akizuki was carrying around the shell of the cicada they had seen about eight years earlier.  Kusaka takes the tantō from Akizuki's hand and commits suicide as well.
","Fuyu no Semi is a wonderful love story.It is definetly a yaoi anime, and very touching one. After searching for good yaoi and shounen-ai animes, I finally end up in appreciating Fuyu no Semi, besides gakuen heaven.   
 
STORY: 
What is good about this anime is that it can be placed into various categories such as drama, action, historical, romance etc. 
Its story plot is dammed good for 3 OVA containing all these categories. The story is a very touching one. The emotional aspects both the main characters, Akizuki and Kusaka, can really be felt through out the anime, (The emotions experienced by both Akizuki and Kusaka especially regarding separation caused due to different clans.) This anime really shows various aspects of life, be it emotionally or practically. 
What is the most interesting part of Fuyu no Semi is the love and appreciation that is present between the main pairing, especially the last part of the anime (very touching moment). 
 
ART: 
The art is very good... except that these types of art styles goes well with male characters only. I believe that the female characters should have drawn in other style. So, this aspect did not cause any effect to the anime because the main leads were male only. 
 
SOUND: 
For a hystorical anime, with lots of saddeness, separation and war, the sound well suited to the plot. 
 
CHARACTER: 
The characters were marvellous, especially the main pairing. Both leads were great. The appreciation and love between the main characters were great...No bad comments from my part for the main characters. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
Well I end up enjoying the anime throughout... except for the ending which left me speechless. But the ending did left an impact on me, in terms that, love is extremely beautiful though it can bring trajedy, sadness, loneliness and... sacrifice. 
 
OVERALL: 
This anime is definetly a great experience. I, personally, was not a fan of shounen-ai in the past but after watching anime like gakuen heaven (for example) I realised that there is really something special with that kind of gay or lesbien love that many societies, in various parts of world still rejects. Yaoi and shounen-ai animes really makes one realised that love is beyong physical...

          
 
       Helpful Fuyu no Semi is presented as yaoi. It is not so simple. 
Fuyu no Semi is somehow like Romeo and Juliet in Japan, just before and at the beginning of Meiji period. It is a love story that succeeded to make me cry, no matter the time, no matter the people, no matter the sex. 
 
Forget yaoi. Fuyu no Semi talks about male feelings, honor, convictions, modernity... and love. 
 
Moreover, Fuyu no Semi is very interesting for his historical aspects. But history courses never succeeded in making me cry...

(Source: d-rights)","['Game', 'Adventure', 'Kids']",none,"No review for this anime yet? Of course, since this anime is so old and about unpopular game. Bi-daman is the kind of kiddy game that only played by elementary student, or may be I'm wrong for these days. Putting a marble in a robotic toy and then pushing a button to shoot it out is something fool I think. However, lets tell anything else about the anime instead of the game. 
 
No doubt that some exaggeration need to be added into the anime. So many game animes need it in order to serve better trick, no, story i mean. This anime is also like that. The protagonist named Tamago (I'm sure that means fried egg) is an ordinary kid who really loves marbles. Ancient Japan folks said that a marble contained a soul. So feel the spirit by playing it. A supranatural thing so just deal with that even though i used to play it a lot when child. And thanks to certain another anti-hero named Gunma so that he was acquainted with the game. Gunma was professional bidaman player who could shoot accurately with some awesome trick. Somehow, there was a chance that made Tamago demonstrate his skill in playing bidaman. That was his first time but somewhat he could clamp the toy between his legs and with some pressure he pressed a ring like thing in the bidaman belly and then shot it out. With kamehame-like-shot he launched the marble and hit the target tremendously. Ganwa just dropped his jaw seeing it and then assumed him as rival. Then the hero and anti-hero made a team to join various tournaments. As usual game anime, many enemies with sadistic scene appeared. Even old hag with muscles joined the game, what the heck. Of course a hottie is also needed and she joined their team. 
 
For kids, one thing that can be attractive is the model of bidaman. That mini-gundam-thing has so many various models. It was so sophisticated and fooled no attracted me to keep watching all of the episodes. Many bidaman technologies appeared later and that just made the toys more look like a shooting machine. So just gather the kids and make their eyes shine by watching these stuffs.

The  Eto Rangers  themselves are anthropomorphic animals, each representing one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals (and The Twelve Branches in Buddhism). In Japan they are known as the Eto animals. The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters. 
 
When a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (""Jarei Shouran!"") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out ""Daikourin Kirinda!"" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out ""Jouka!"" (Purification). 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy']",none,"""The 12 animal rangers"" is one of the best show for kids with a very unique story within an exotic world of fairy tales.  
 
Summary: 
The world Nobel is made of countless mini-worlds of fairy tales created by humankind. The evil who plans to destroy this world from within sends minions into each fairy world under disguise of the world's characters. Each episode, the Mouse and a select few among the rest are chosen to be sent into a different fairy tale on the Unicorn (Kirin) Ship to blow the disguise of these minions. 
 
Story: 9/10 
As summarized, the story is very creative and attractive to kids since it explores a lot of fairy tales with ""improvisation"" due to distortions by the evil minions.  
In this story, that the Cat is made the evil general utilize the fact that Cat is excluded from the 12 Lunar animals in Japan and most Eastern countries. In the Chinese legend, the Cat finished too late to win the race for any place in the calendar and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forever. 
 
Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber. 
They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable. 
 
Even as show mainly geared toward kids, the last episodes are particular dramatic when most animal rangers sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the evil force, making way for Mouse to confront the evil mastermind behind the Cat. The ending relies on a miracle when all deceased animals were revived but it was enjoyable, and acceptable to kids shows of this kind. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art is decent regarding the time this was made. The animation is repeating especially during special attacks but they are not too often. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
OP and ED are particularly memorable. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The 12 animals get relatively equal coverage but, as a show for kids, there's no deep personalities. However, they did a very good job in showing friendship and cooperating spirit. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
As a twenty-something now after 15 years I still find this very enjoyable, absolutely.

Continuing from where the original story left off, Genki and friends journey to conquer the legend cup in hopes of freeing Holly's father from the mystery disc. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","The story follows a boy named Genki Sakura, who is a key player of the Monster Rancher video games. After winning a tournament hosted by the game's creators, Genki wins a special CD that he can use to unlock a special monster in his game at home. However, upon using this disk in his game console, he finds himself transported to a world of monsters that, much like Genki's game, are given life by scanning special stone disks within temples. There, he meets a girl named Holly and her monster friend Suezo, who are seeking a stone disk containing a legendary Phoenix that will save the land from the tyranny of an evil ruler named Moo. Upon attempting to use the disk Genki had won to try and release the monster, they bring forth a different monster, which Genki names Mocchi. Wanting to free the land from Moo's rule, Genki, Holly, Mocchi, and Suezo set off to find the Phoenix, using Holly's Magic Stone to guide them in the direction of the Phoenix. The Magic Stone leads them to Golem, Tiger, and Hare, each of which have their motivations to join the group on their journey to find the Phoenix. 
It is revealed that Moo is actually Holly's missing father, who merged with an evil spirit after being banished from his village. Determined to separate Moo's evil spirit from Holly's father, the group continues their search for the Phoenix, defeating Moo's strongest minions, the Big Bad Four- Pixie, Gali, Grey Wolf, and Naga. In their travels, the gang befriends and aids many monsters as they continue searching, unlocking as many Mystery Disks as possible in the hopes of finding the Phoenix. One of these unlocked monsters, Monol, tells the group of a previous war between Moo and the Phoenix (as part of a larger war between humans and monsters, who exploited monsters as workers and companions in a futuristic society) that destroyed much of the world and weakened the two entities into their dormant states, separating their body and souls.
In the end of the first season, Moo's body is found and merges with Holly's father. Shortly after, the Phoenix's body is found, and it is revealed that the five monsters – Mocchi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger, and Hare – are pieces of the Phoenix's soul. Understanding what must be done, they say goodbye to Genki and merge with the Phoenix's body, and begin to fight Moo. As the two beings fight, Moo realizes that good and evil are inherently inseparable, and that the two are doomed to repeat a perpetually repeating fight as representatives of the two forces. The two monsters seemingly die, and Genki is knocked back into the real world in the resulting explosion, comforted by visions of his friends as he goes home. 
The second season consists of Genki returning to the Monster World to revive and reunite his friends, who were turned into disks and separated after the fight with Moo. The gang must compete in a series of tournaments against General Durahan's army in their pursuit to find Holly's father. The third season ends with Genki and the others battling the soul of Moo that has possessed Durahan; during the credits of the final episode it is revealed in the Japanese version that both Genki and Mocchi are able to travel between both the Monster Rancher world and Earth.
","This is so a rip off of Digimon! I remember when I was younger, I liked it but seriously… now that I have watched so many anime shows and found out just how badly ripped off the other shows are, I feel a little like crying. Now please don’t take this the wrong way, it is a good show to a point but it takes so long to get to where it’s getting good that most people would probably conk out of it. It’s good for what it is, a children’s show, nothing more and nothing less.  
 
We start out with the main character, Genki who is pretty much Ash Ketchum in school. He is overactive, over annoying, and most of all, over stereotypical of these types of shows. He gets sucked into the video game (like Digimon) and has to help collect monster discs (like Pokemon) to unlock the power that is inside (like Yugioh). He fights monsters (like all three) and makes friends with the monsters he meets (like Digimon and Pokemon). They end up getting lost on their travels (Like Pokemon), sometimes wondering aimlessly around the world (like Digimon) and… WHAT THE FUCK? Did the creators have no imagination for this series or is this plot so generic that we can’t make a decent show like this without ripping off another? 
 
The storyline of Alan, in the episode ‘Eternal Worm’ (Ep 4), was actually rather sweet at the end and made me feel something briefly for the show. It was one of the most intense sad scenes in this show. Another character that I actually really like and feel emotion to is the wolf-like tiger called ‘Tiger of the Wind’. I guess I’m just a sucker for anything like a wolf. He seems very spiritual and has wonderful philosophy. His story line is sad and yet seems the most logical of the group. 
 
When Genki does end up making his own character, all he seems to make is something that looks like a pink little thing and actually called itself Mochi when it first appeared, becomes called Sweet Cake by him in the first episode. Then after, they call him Mochi like they should have done in the first place!  
 
So… is the bad guy a cow or something? Because calling the bad guy Moo really doesn’t make him sound any scarier then the little pink squash ball Mochi. Seriously, are we supposed to get milk from this thing? And if so, then I want none of that milk!  
 
So, I’m sort of going to spoil something for you since this is two seasons lumped together (Because Fox kids is a dick like that), Genki does get back home (Shocker… really? *Sarcastic*) and they use the same stupid little storyline as Digimon where only a couple hours passed when he was in the Monster world for months to about years. But it comes at the end of the first season. So my question is, why did they decide to have a second season where he goes back? They could have left it wonderfully when Genki got back and gave us that heart felt ending to the whole series. Something tells me that they just used it to sell more items and that’s exactly what it feels like. And that’s not the only problem because this one ends with a big hole in the plot. It doesn’t let it end like the first season. 
 
The artwork is alright, pretty standard for the time period it came out in. Some of the monsters feel like they were stolen from other anime series. Faces don’t seem to keep their shape, sometimes showing big cheeks once in a while and then no cheeks at all. Bodies don’t stay the same sometimes as all, making it a little mediocre.  
 
The opening English song is really stupid and is like a rap mixed up of Yugioh, Digimon, and Pokemon. They also seem to have something similar to the poke-rap. Then we have the English script… now I have not been able to see the Japanese version but please tell me they do not use this stupid line ‘…then he can turn all the baddies into goodies…’ Please tell me they aren’t so stupid as to do that? Genki is one annoying boy, to the point of me shouting ‘SHUT THE FUCK UP!’ He also calls out ‘IN THE ZONE!’ which feels like they were trying to just make a saying. It sounds as annoying as Naruto’s ‘BELIEVE IT!’ saying. Alan’s voice sounds better then almost all of the characters and that says a hell of a lot. He isn’t the best but he’s the better of them.

Monster Rancher……Yes, I know the Japanese version of that is Monster Farm but today we are doing the English version that aired on the now-defunct (and fortunately) Fox Kids. Now it is based on a series of life simulation RPG videogames created by Tecmo (the company that brought you Ninja Gaiden & Dead or Alive) having over 14 games across different videogame platforms. 
  
  
In the anime adaptation, it revolves around Genki, a 12-year-old middle school boy who really loves to play videogames and one day, he discover the Monster Rancher game and as he plays it, he is zapped into their universe where he meets the rest of the team: Holly, a 14-year-old girl on the quest along with their monster team, Mochi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger and Hare (No, I’m not calling them Tiger and Bunny) to find the ancient Monster Phoenix, and it is the only powerful monster that’s able to stop the dastardly……..MOO! 
  
  
  
Yes, his name is Moo.  What happened to Mistress BAA? Overlord BARK?  Princess SQUEE? Hell, where is Grand Master MEOW? 
  
  
  
 
Now, you’re wondering that this anime reminds you of something. You know, that type of anime that involves battle monsters and traveling in unknown strange lands especially when the travelers are very young and it’s also based on card game/videogame franchise. I know what this anime reminds of……..it’s like…..DEATH NOTE!!! 
  
  
  
OK, I’m just kidding. But the difference between Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Digimon & Death Note is Death Note doesn’t have those noticeable COPYCATS and generic ones at that (unless somebody can correct me)!! WHY anyone would needed another one of this type of anime? I get that it’s something for kids to watch and even though this came out when I was a kid, I never knew about its existence but I guess that were trying to cash in on the Pokémon/Digimon/Yu-Gi-Oh craze and I don’t think it worked that well considering Monster Rancher only lasts about 72 episodes and the other ones just go on forever even if we had enough. 
  
  
  
Well, the story is generic, there’s no doubt about it. Now the characters: Genki is fucking annoying……there, I said it. Basically he is the stereotype of this type of anime where he’s very determined, optimistic, and hopeful and likes to yell something at the top of his lungs. Man, do I want to strangle this kid and tell him to SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU DAMN MORON!! Most of the dialogue is so annoying in this show and for example, the antagonists in the show? They are referred as “baddies”. Yes, They say that on this show and you know what, whether I think of that word, I’m thinking of somebody playing a drinking game to this show and you got to take a shot whenever someone say “baddies”. I guess that no one survived. Most of the monsters with the exception of Tiger are very forgettable, mainly because he bothered me the least and Holly…..yeah, she was important, too…….kinda.  The name MOO as a villain is still stupid and I mean really fucking stupid. 
  
  
  
I’m ashamed to say who did the animation of this, considering they made one of my favorite movies (not just anime movies, but overall movie of all time). The studio is TMS (Tōkyō Movie Shinsha) and what they made before this was Akira of course, Little Nemo (yeah, that movie was animated by a Japanese animation studio. Go figure. I didn’t know that at first.) Anyway, the animation level here is about average for a now-vintage kid show but speed lines do occur sometimes and it makes it seem like they are slipping in that department and character designs are a bit average. 
  
  
  
The music……me screaming at the top of my lungs would sound better than this played-out Wal-Mart style Pokémon rap they played and also that damn side song that goes “Get a disk, take a risk, spin it fast, through the past”. I could’ve ended it with, “I rather get shot in the ass.” 
  
  
  
Now, on to the English dub and surprisingly to me, this wasn’t made by 4Kids. No, really, 4Kids are not responsible for this dub, for once. It was made by a dubbing company in Canada called The Ocean Group and yet the anime & western animation they dub or just voiced before and after this were better made. Here are a few examples: Black Lagoon, The Girl Who Leap through Time, Escaflowne, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, Death Note and Inuyasha….freaking Inuyasha!! Yes, Inyuasha isn’t that great IMO but I rather watch that than this. Most of the voice work in here do sound so very kiddy-like, it hurts and it gets very irritating by the minute hearing those voices, especially since I recognize some voices that came from Ed, Edd, N Eddy. 
  
   
 
FINAL VERDICT:  I could easily say that this show makes me want to curse kid-aimed anime, such as this, Beyblade and Scan 2Go, but even as a kid, I wouldn’t be as interested in shows like that and in the present day, I still won’t have an interest in it.  But as much as I want to trash the show, I can’t but one of the reasons why is that the show can get genuinely decent for most of the time, especially in the emotional moments in the show gives it a plus in my book but still that gets shadowed by the idiocy of the writing, the marketing and the shallowness that basically carried this show. Now even though for you have any kids or younger relatives that might be interested in this and it reminds them of those other shows I mentioned before, just tell them those shows are better than this. 
  
 
As for the second season............I just gonna say what was the point of that? Because there really wasn't unless they wanted more exposure but that failed.

6,19151,64,6.576800146,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Walkure Romanze,"Taking place at Winford Academy located in an old town called Helen's Hill, the story is all about knights and the sport of jousting. At this school, students learn how to become knights, ride horses and joust properly. The main character is a young man named Takahiro Mizuno who was training to become a knight and jouster but after suffering an injury he dropped out of the knight program and joined the begleiter (assistant) program instead. Due to his animal handling skills and former experience as a jouster, this makes him a hot commodity. Multiple beautiful girls in the school want him to become their personal begleiter, though Takahiro always refuses their offers. 
 
One day a bizarre accident causes his friend, Mio Kisaski, to be challenged to a jousting duel despite her not actually being a knight. Takahiro agrees to become her temporary begleiter, but that ends up only being the beginning of their partnership as she enrolls in the annual tournament. ","['Action', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'Harem', 'School', 'Sports']","Walkure Romanze's story revolves around Takahiro Mizuno, a student studying at an academy with jousting as the main focus for sport. Takahiro acts as an advisor to the riders of the sport. Takahiro goes through each day tediously until the time of the annual competition draws near. Due to some odd circumstances, his childhood friend Mio Kisaki is challenged to a duel and she is forced to participate even though she has never even ridden a horse before. Takahiro agrees to train Mio as her Begleiter, but only until the duel is over. She later enrolls in the annual competition. She and the four other heroines all want Takahiro to become their Begleiter.
","I expected something bad and got something bad. Really, really bad. This so-called sports series only made me suffer and didn't give me any enjoyment. Well, except for the first episode, when I still had the strength to laugh at how horrible it is. 
 
STORY: 2 
You thought it was going to be about jousting? Well, it kinda sometimes is. When it isn't about the girls, pathetic romanse/harem, fanservice etc., you could say it's about jousting. But even then, it's simply TERRIBLE. The main girl shouting randomly ""I love jousting"" when she was emotional is just one example of how overly dramatic it is. 
The harem? All the girls SOMEHOW asked the main character to be their begleiter at the same moment. Even this one loli, who didn't even feel like she had anything to do with MC. Oh, what a coincidence! 
The fanservice? A girl who was into the president of the student council SOMEHOW ended sticked to her. When they were both naked. Again, what a coincidence! 
 
ART: 5 
Now, the artstyle isn't that bad. It looks like any random overly colorful romance anime of XXI century. What really sucked there was the CGI. I could even rate it 6 if it wasn't for it. Many horse scenes were made in CGI, and it looked awful. Another thing I didn't like was the moments when the girls were shown inside their armors. It gave a feel like they were inside some kind of mecha, which I found hilarious. 
 
SOUND: 5  
Maybe the strongest point of this abomination. Some of the soundtracks were quite catchy, and while I preferred to skip the opening sequence after I heard it once, it didn't burn my ears. I would give it a 6, but some seiyuu sometimes pissed me off. 
 
CHARACTER: 1 
Takahiro Mizuno - oh, so his name was Takahiro. Good to know. So, this guy tried to be badass and romantic at the same time. And he fell flat. 
Mio Kisaki - you thought Orihime was irritating? Now imagine Orihime x1000.  
Celia Aintree - a wannabe badass girl made for fanservice purposes. 
Lisa Eostre - since no harem would be complete without a pointless loli, right? 
And some other ones, but who gives a care about them. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 2 
As I said before, I only enjoyed laughing at how bad it was. But even that got tiring pretty quickly. 
 
OVERALL: 3 
There's nothing more to say about it. I could call it a joke of an anime, but I know there's plenty of just as bad ones, and it scares me. Anyway, if you want a good harem anime, watch Nisekoi or something like that. If you want a good romance or sports anime.... watch basically anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Although this series is classified as a harem, it's not really about the various girls' love for the main guy as it is about their love for jousting. So don't start this anime expecting it to be like most harems where the love part is actually the central focus. Their attraction to him originates from the fact that they want to win the jousting tournament at their school, which is the overall plot of the story. 
 
The story itself is pretty good, but it's not anything really special. There will be some moments where you'll be dying to find out the result of the conflict, but there aren't any moments where you'll experience huge emotional swings or be amazed by the action. So although the story isn't necessarily boring, it's a very ""safe"" story in that there wasn't much risk involved from the side of the storywriters, and so there is no ""wow"" factor. This means I would most recommend this anime for those who just want to watch a relaxing anime; anime that has a lot of emotional stress or action can be exhausting on the viewer, so if you're just looking to sit back and have a casual viewing, this anime is good for that. There certainly is comedy in this series too, but once again, I don't think it'll be much funnier than other comedies you've seen. 
 
The art, however, is absolutely incredible. The cast of girls are among some of the most attractive I've seen in anime, and the environment is also really well animated with careful detail to shading to create a realistic portrayal of things like armor and other objects which are normally very flat looking in anime. 
 
The sound is pretty good, although there is one piano tune that they use a lot (you'll know it when you hear it repeated enough) that I didn't find particularly suiting for some of the moments they use it, but that's really it. The rest of the music is fine, but like I mentioned before, even the music isn't super special. It's not bad, but it's not great either. 
 
I did like the characters though, but for some reason I kept getting the feeling they weren't developed enough. You'll see that most of them do have back stories, but the stories are so average and not really elaborate...and then some of them just don't have back stories which really hurts the character development. This is where I think the series could have had amazing potential if the writers had just concentrated more on the character development rather than the plot.  
 
But since I watched this anime with the purpose of just taking a break from the other series I'm currently watching, I did thoroughly enjoy this since it definitely is great for a casual, light-hearted watch without too much intensity. If your goal, however, is to look for something of real quality that will move you or shock you, you won't find it here. 

          
 
       Helpful I first started Walkure Romanze because of a longtime love of knights and horses. The hope of an anime accurately portraying girls learning to joust crashed to the ground the instant i saw the opening theme, which shows them all riding in miniskirts. While that could have been excused as an artistic choice to make the opening look nice, it’s the same in the episode itself. A few girls, such as the student council president, wear what look like tights but are hopefully sturdy leggings to protect their legs. Most don’t, however, which means it’s a miracle any of these girls can walk upright, given the horrible saddle sores they must have – especially the girl who jousts in lingerie. 
 
I kept watching because of a sick fascination of everything they get horribly wrong. For example, the main character, Mio, who’s never even touched a horse before in her life, is challenged to a joust by a more experienced girl. Mio’s friend spends the next episode teaching her how to manage a lance, but she almost never gets on a horse until the day of the match. There’s a slight problem with that. Even inanimate modes of transportation, such as bicycles, motorcycles, or cars, require a lot of practice before you can comfortably use them. Horses have a mind of their own, in addition to the rider having to learn how to signal to them where to go. The type of horses that would be used for jousting are much more strong-willed than beginner’s horses. The best case scenario, given the situation, is that the horse Mio borrows stands still and doesn’t listen to a thing she says, while everyone else in the school laughs at her. There are other scenarios equally likely. One: Mio makes the common beginner’s mistake of squeezing with her calves to stay on when the horse starts moving, which tells the horse to go faster. Sakura will run away with her, right past their opponent, and Mio won’t be able to get her to stop because everything she does tells her to go faster. She becomes the school laughingstock. Two: the weight of the lance pulls Mio off balance until she falls off and becomes the school laughingstock. Three: Mio leans too far back and to the left while trying to balance the weight of the lance, so she falls off and becomes the school laughingstock. In the worst-case scenario, she breaks her neck when she falls. Or she gets a concussion. Jousting is very dangerous even when you wear a helmet, which a good many people here don’t usually bother with. However, since these are wonderful magic~ horses who defrock anything in a skirt, things go just peachy for Mio. They only wear helmets in matches, and apparently then just for show, as evidenced when one girl is unsaddled. Her helmet goes flying, and she falls in a different direction, thus hitting her head rather badly and getting a concussion. Except she doesn’t get a concussion, because this is anime. There’s a reason riding helmets come with chin straps, people. 
 
But enough about that. It’s not as though this show is actually about jousting or horses. It’s just a framing device for the same goofy harem ecchi that shows up in a lot of shows and gives anime a bad name. Walkure Romanze is full of huge-breasted girls and one guy, who accidentally gropes pretty much every girl in each episode, because isn’t accidental groping great? Because he’s the only guy of a reasonable age at the school, all the girls either want to get into his pants or each other’s. Noel is especially rapey towards Mio, which is shown with lots of random groping and sex disguised as stretching. Or the other way around. It’s hard to tell with this show. Of course, they couldn’t leave out the hot springs episode! Lots of nekkid groping, pillow fights, and people in the wrong bath at the wrong time hijinx for your enjoyment! (Or lack thereof.) Rather than individual characters, we have a bunch of typical anime stereotypes. There’s the offensively naïve and stupid main character, the nice guy, the elegant student council president, the kuudere albino, the crippled imouto, and so on, none of them with anything resembling personality. Everything feels very rote, like they’re following a formula for bland anime. Honestly, the only reason i rated it above a one was because the jousting idea was pretty original. 
 
The predictability of the plot (as opposed to the characters) shouldn’t really be held against it. You can’t bring any interest to a sports story, anime or no, without a big tournament. Still, though, the progression of newbie falls in love with the sport –> defeats a few minor opponents –> becomes tournament underdog and does surprisingly well didn’t feel like they were trying to bring any originality or flavor to it. Again, very formulaic. It only managed to surprise me once, with the end of the very last match in the tournament. I won’t say what happened, but i will say that it followed common sense more than you’d expect from anime. The best part was the music. Not the opening and ending – those are just as dull and interchangeable as the characters. But the background music was very nice, classy instrumentals similar to medieval music. It helped build the mood that ‘these are knights in training’ much better than anything else the show tried to do. 
 
So, all in all, i don’t think it was worth it. If you like ecchi and/or the discussion of a lance as if it were a penis, then this is the anime for you. But if you have even the slightest interest in jousting, horses, or girl knights, you’re better off reading old Tamora Pierce novels.

6,432,65,6.476981125,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Iria: Zeiram The Animation,"Iria is the story of a girl and the Alien being she loves to hate. The series begins with her brother, Gren, taking a job. He is a bounty hunter, and one well known for his incredible skill. Iria, being a skilled apprentice bounty hunter herself, tags along. What is the job, one might ask. It is to find out what has happened to the crew and cargo of a Space Station. Needless to say, nothing is as it seems, and the war between Iria and Zeiram begins in earnest.  
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"" is a pretty good action oriented OVA spanning across 6 half hour episodes. It tells the story of a young bounty hunter Iria's hunting of Zeiram, the most dangerous life form in the galaxy. 
 
The weird opening theme, which sounds like some Sharon Apple song from ""Macross Plus"", feels out of place and put me off the anime initially. And not being the fastest anime off the block despite its short length, it took ""Iria"" a couple of episodes to catch my interest, but to its credit it gains more and more momentum as it goes on. 
 
The action, though slightly sluggish at times, is overall solid enough to provide a good foundation for the enjoyment of ""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"", with the appropriately climatic climax being especially good. It's backed up by a pretty good story (albeit one that doesn't explain everything) and some really likeable characters. The roles of the mischievous kids are played out perfectly, as is that rogue Fujikuro, providing comedy entertainment that often had me grinning widely. The animation may not look that great by today's standards, but there are some fantastic character designs. The heroine Iria herself has quite a unique look, while Zeiram reminds me of Yoshimitsu from the Tekken video games. 
 
On the downside, I think the anime suffers from small inconsistencies in its characterisation and plot. To name a couple of examples, part of the personality of Iria is hard to pin down since she seem to be inconsistently portrayed from one episode to the next, and I could have sworn the Zeiram's weak point that is revealed towards the end had already been peppered with bullets with little or not no effect in an earlier episode. 
 
Even though this OVA does look and sound a bit old, it's still succeeds in providing an entertaining 3 hours. Worth checking out if you come across it. 


          
 
       Helpful Iria: Zeiram the Animation is an OVA prequel to the Zeiram movie series. Between the movies and the animation, the animation is the clear better of the bunch. 
 
Starting with the good, the world in this is certainly very unique. It has its own world, with everything similar to ours, yet different. From the buildings, to the vehicles, to the weapons, it really gives an excellent sense of a planet similar enough to feel welcoming, yet different enough to feel alien and foreign. The plot is good, too. Nothing too new, but it's set up well. (Because of how much I liked these, I added an extra point to the overall score, hah.) 
 
Unfortunately, the main draws to this are also a problem. At only six episodes, it's very short. The world and premise might be top tier, but we don't see enough of it. It goes with the plot, too. It doesn't have enough time to properly develop, so each episode seems more like an individual story that shares a general idea. It's probably more of a budget problem than anything else. It had excellent ideas, but they didn't have the funds to properly realize them. Even just one 13 episode season and a minor plot arrangement could've benefited this series immensely. 
 
It's an enjoyable few episodes, I liked it, and I'd definitely recommend it. It's just a shame it's so unlikely we'll see any new Zeiram material.

          
 
       Helpful Coming from a somewhat unknown studio, Ashi Productions, and an unknown director, Tetsuro Amino, there was much to speculate how decent this could be. An action story about a rookie bounty hunter named Iria, comes into a battle conflict against an unstoppable killing lifeform called a Zeiram. 
 
With a plot straight to the point, live and get rid of the Zeiram, this anime knows what it is. Spanning as a 6 episode OVA series, each episode is different, yet a continuation on each other. Time continues between each episode until Iria must have another life and death battle between her and the Zeiram. 
 
Even though the anime is on the short side, luckily, all the characters involved are fairly interesting and the viewer slowly sees Iria become more mature with each episode. There is plenty of action ranging from the transportation machines to the numerous gadgets used to fight. Needless to say, the action is the strong point, and while not being smooth all of the time, the fighting sequences and explosions are done well enough. 
 
However, the anime does have its flaws. The ending, for example, is pretty controversial, and why some weapons work in places while others do not are just a couple to pay attention to. Although, if given more time (episodes), maybe things could have been explained better. Instead most is left up to the viewer’s imagination. 
 
As Iria Zeiram the Animation could come off as a bit old and average, the action is worth the ride. Iria is lovable and so is the supporting cast around her.

When she reunites with her childhood friend Hinata Kuraue, who is outgoing and loves mountaineering. They decide to climb a mountain together, in order to see sunrise, they saw together when they were younger. Along the way, they meet several other girls who are also interested in the outdoors, and begin a series of adventures on various mountains across Japan.
","We had to wait 4 years for a third season of Yama no Susume and the big question is of course if the series is still as good as the previous seasons and if it still has the same charm?  
 
Story 
The story in the third season focuses mostly on the relationship between Hinata and Aoi which was already the case in the previous seasons too and one of my favorite aspects of the anime. Something that has less presence in this season is actual mountain climbing because they focus more on the slice of life elements and they even dedicate whole episodes to it which isn't directly bad because we get nice character developments through it in this season especially between Aoi and Hinata. 
 
Art 
One of the things I always liked in Yama no Susume were the background arts and I have to say that the third season sadly doesn't look as good as the previous seasons and especially the characters look in some episodes really minimalistic drawn and even kinda low quality at some points. 
The Art in S3 is the weakest part of the anime, but even if I say that the anime still looks better than most other Anime this season so it's not such a big thing it's just sad that it isn't as good as in the other seasons. 
 
Sound 
There are some openings that always give me a smile and which I just don't want to skip and the opening of Yama no Susume S3 is one of them it's a perfect way to get into the episode. The episode themselves have the same OST as we already got in previous season and it's of course still fitting. The ending is pretty nice, but I like the opening more. 
 
Character 
Like I already mentioned earlier this season focuses mostly on Aoi and Hinata and gives them trough multiple episodes really good character development, but what about the other characters? We get to see the other characters and they all get their moments to shine which I really liked because one thing I was scared of at the start of the season was that they won't give the other characters their moments because it first seemed like they will only give Aoi and Hinata moments and forget about the others. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall 
I really enjoyed this season of Yama no Susume and even though the anime has a loss in quality compared with the previous seasons it gives me still the same feeling I got from the previous seasons and it's a comfortable watch, but one can clearly tell that this season is mostly fanservice for people that wanted to see the characters one more time animated. 
Overall the Anime is a 9/10 for me and I can recommend it to everyone who likes the previous seasons. 


          
 
       Helpful Yama no Susume's 3rd Season is here and LA can't be any more satisfied with this series getting another season. 
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season picks off right where the 2nd Season left off, with it being Winter for Aoi and the gang, any chance for them to try and climb becomes out of the question, thus Aoi and the gang continues to climb by climbing other mountains with their friends with some growing conflict between Aoi and Hinata along the way. 
 
See in this season, Aoi and Hinata are separated the most, be it through schedule conflicts, misunderstandings as well as Aoi opening up and gaining new friends while Hinata gets more isolated due to her conflicting schedules with Aoi, now this is something of a focal point that comes into play but it gets dealt with and resolved rather well and both Aoi and Hinata reconcile, but the entire drama between Aoi and Hinata isn't spiteful in anyways more like misunderstandings and assumptions that lead to what it became, as both Aoi and Hinata are developing their relationship but apart and this tribulation grows their relationship even more. 
 
Nevertheless, Yama no Susume's 3rd Season still looks at mountaineering in the typical Yama no Susume flavours of giving us tidbits about mountaineering and the such from equipment to finding new Japanese mountains to climb but really the ""drama"" concerning Aoi and Hinata helped with this season as both first and second season was essentially a slice of life comedy with mountain climbing, the 3rd Season brought something new to the table and dealt with it rather well. 
 
Now since Aoi and Hinata are the focal point of this season, what about the rest of the cast?, well Kokona tags along with Aoi as she's probably the most freely open character this season and she probably has the most screentime outside of Aoi and Hinata. Honoka Kurosaki voiced by Nao Touyama also gets this, at first being a character introduced in the second season and befriends Aoi, she goes along with Aoi in several trips to mountains in the process. The only character within the main cast who got shafted in this season was Kaede Saitou voiced by Yoko Hikasa as Kaede has exams thus is trapped in an endless cycle of studying and little mountain climbing thus her lessen screentime though she appears with Hinata more often than not, which is shame as LA wanted to see more of Kaede. With this you can kinda see the entire ""Aoi and Hinata separation"" through the rest of the cast and the major conflict of the entire third season's buildup. 
 
8Bit, once again helms the animation and really it's what you expect from them with gorgeous backgrounding with moe character designs, really LA doesn't need to go too deep into animation, if you've seen the past 2 seasons then this is a given. Praise easily going to the beautiful backgrounding... 
 
Voice work, well the entire cast is back and with Honoka getting more screentime, means Nao Touyama gets more too, BUT LA won't get LA's bias come into play...MVP's goes to Yuka Iguchi as Aoi and Kana Asumi as Hinata, it's a no brainer here. 
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season gives us something new in terms of character development from Aoi and HInata, Aoi as she becomes much more open through mountain climbing, Hinata as becomes more isolated and away from Aoi giving Hinata internal problems concerning their relationship and by all means, as a result they grows their relaitonship even more oddly enough.  
 
Yama no Susume's 3rd Season is about mountain climbing, but this season shows that it's much more than that and as cheesy as LA will say it but this fits into Aoi and Hinata's relationship this season and Yama no Susume as a whole and that is of the tried and true ""the power of friendship"" and Yama no Susume's 3rd Season encapsulates it in variety of spectrum all under the hobby of mountain climbing. 
 
This was the little anime short that could and it STILL good even after 3 seasons...

          
 
       Helpful The claim that sequels are always better than prequels is true, because YNS S3 is better than S2. It's more relatable for me as each and every episode reminds me of the friendship I have with my best friend, the fun we have together, the jealousy and frustration that we have sometimes when we can't seem to find time to hang out with each other, and the problems we face which we share to each other. And YNS S3, it's just that. Less hiking on Yamas and more emphasis on personal relationships. Between Aoi and Hinata(of course cos they're the MCs) and between their friends. So w/o further ado, leggo start the ofc review!  
 
P.S. This is gonna be quite a personal review so yea. 
 
Story: Well I already gave a short summary of what YNS S3 is about. Sure there's episodes where they go hiking together, but 80% of the anime focuses on the deep friendship which Aoi and Hinata have with each other. What really attached me to this season of YNS is what I said earlier, the fun times and problems which Aoi and Hinata faced. It was extremely relatable towards the ending when both Aoi and Hinata seemed to just missed each other every time they wanna hang out with each other. Quite a mirror to my real life right now, with my friends in NS or are too busy, especially my best friend. Now that I look back at time, I do miss the times when me and my best friend could hang out with each other everyday after school, 4 years ago. So I can totally understand Hinata's feelings. That feeling of not being able to hang out with your best friend. I also like the fact that the anime tries to involve Honoka more in this season. And we could definitively see Honoka hanging out with ze gang(Aoi, Hinata, Kokona and Kaede) more this season. Granted, this season may not have been the most relaxing one due to the fact that it focuses on relationships more, but it was a very relatable season, at least for me. 
Rating: 9.5/10 
 
Animation: Kindof a hit and miss for this category. I like the fact that the producers try to make the scenery as realistic as possible, but when it comes to the faces, wow, I didn't like the way the animated some of the scenes. Felt cheap. At the same time of course the facial expressions were priceless most of the time.  
Rating: 7.8/10 
 
Music/Sound: As usual using the VAs to sing both the opening and endings song, me like. The soundtrack just makes me relax whenever it plays(and makes me think of going to Japan :v). 
Rating: 8.3/10 
 
Characters: For this review I don't have much to say about the characters, because we already know their personalities and character from past season. So for this section I just want to focus on Aoi and mostly Hinata. So as we know in past seasons, Aoi is kind and friendly, but she's also.... kinda.... idk she worries too much. During the last episode when she wanted to get a present for Hinata she just overthought what she was gonna get. Oh and add to that her constant thoughts of Hinata making fun of her..., yes that's very funny xD.  
As for Hinata, this is the first time we see her being a little bit insecure about her friendship with Aoi which i can't blame her for that since she and Aoi seemed to be always missing out on each other for a few episodes. Ah yes her stubbornness is also a trait of her that is funny but also can be rather annoying. So.... I guess that's it for characters?  
Rating: 8.7/10 
 
Overall, this has gotta be my most relatable anime this season, because it reminds me so much of the relationship I have with my best friend and it is these kindof animes which I really love. I really do hope that they'll make an S4 because we havent seen Aoi conquer Mount Fuji yet.  
 
Overall rating: 8.8/10

Yorito helps her with forcing the machine while attempting to strike up conversation with her, despite it being four in the morning. Yorito tells her why he is here, but by the time he has forced the can out of the machine, the girl has mysteriously vanished.
The next day, Yorito goes to visit his older sister Aono in the hospital with his friend Mana Ishizuki and Mana's little sister Koyori Ishizuki. Despite it being Aono's birthday, Yorito leaves soon after to take a photograph of the setting sun near an old church on the roof of the hospital. That night, Yorito leaves to buy groceries when it begins to rain and stops on the way home to wait for the rain to stop; while waiting, he runs into the strange girl he met from yesterday again. They talk longer this time and Yorito finally learns her name—Matsuri Shihou. A few days later, Yorito goes looking for the girl in the old church and finds a man wielding a sword before Matsuri.
After a display of Matsuri's astounding powers, Yorito discovers that she is in fact a creature known as a ""Calamity of the Night"" (夜の禍, Yoru no Wazawai), who has lived for centuries. She is being chased by Takeshi Tsujidou who intends to kill her, but Yorito tries to protect her by bringing her back to his home which is when Yorito asks her to stay with him for the time being.
A ""Calamity of the Night"", otherwise known as a Yaka (夜禍), is a supernatural being in the Sola universe. Yaka have many supernatural powers, such as: strong physical ability, fast regeneration, and never aging body, among other powers. A Yaka is hurt by direct exposure to sunlight, but the wound can be healed in time if the exposure is not excessive; a Yaka is immortal unless exposed to too much sunlight or has received fatal wounds. Matsuri explains that a Yaka is the embodiment of human agony and pain and that such creatures are meant to always be alone. Despite this, the two fall in love. As their relationship deepens, Matsuri reveals her long tragic past and her knowledge of Yorito's past.
","So I just finished Sola. And I feel that my day is still incomplete. Most awesome possum anime leave you feeling sad, depressed, happy, you know the typical emotions that you feel after watching something that left a huge impact on you. And Sola, failed to leave that impact. What it left for me, was more of a ""WTF? That's it?"" 
 
STORY: 6 
OK I'll be sincere here. It wasn't so much as a boring uninteresting story, it was a story that felt like it left out important details. Like: 
 
How did Matsuri become a Yaka in the first place?  
What are the origins or Yaka?  
What the crap is her power? Rusting objects? Why? 
And if Yaka's cannot go outside in the daytime because they will burn from UV exposure (much like vampires) why not just use Google and buy yourself a UV suit? I just Googled how much they cost and they are like $5 for kid sizes! I'm sure you can find an adult size. There, problem solved. Now you can go outside all you like without the worry of turning into a walking ball of fire. 
 
OK so enough with the obvious solutions to problems the idiots faced. The story had a nice end, but felt incomplete. You know when you have a delicious cake before you, with its beautiful taste of whatever your favorite kind of cake is but it's missing something? Yeah, it is missing those (insert your choice of topping). Or you're eating your favorite type of cookie but without any milk? (Idgaf if you are lactose intolerant. Milk is amazing with cookies) Yeah, that's pretty much what Sola did to me. It gave me an Oreo, but without any damn milk!  
 
ART: 7 
The art was decently and nicely well done. But sometimes, I look at Yorito's chin and I say ""Man what the fuck is wrong with his chin? It looks so pointy. Well at least everyone else seems somewhat nor... HOLY SHIT Matsuri not your chin too! I don't want to feel like I'm watching Cyberchase!  
 
SOUND: 7 
The typical sounds of anime. As in the sounds from the early 2000 anime. I'll reserve this section for the actors/actresses: 
 
Mana Ishizuki - VA - Honda, Youko:  
Besides her name being that of a brand for cars she perfectly fit this character. Not squeaky or annoying, she sounded exactly like a normal high schooler. Just the way it was meant to be. 
 
Yorito Morimiya - VA - Okamoto, Nobuhiko:  
Oh thank you Jesus! He doesn't sound like a faggot! He sounds like any other real good protagonist that has no powers but has the gumption to take in the truth and say ""Fuck it man, I've lived the way I wanted to of my own free will. And when I'm gone, I'll know I didn't regret smoking that weed!"" Because I know I don't. ;)  
 
Aono Morimiya - VA - Nakahara, Mai: 
Oh hey it's Nagisa! Back from the dead I see? Oh wait, you're not Nagisa. You sound nothing like her. You sound like...Kanade? Except a bit more with a chilly feeling rather than a cute huggable, squeezable feeling.    
 
Matsuri Shihou - VA - Noto, Mamiko: 
Yes. Just yes. Hecate all the way! With a little of Tifania sprinkled on top. Maybe some Kotomi in there as well. Then again don't they all sound exactly the same? Anyways if you aren't familiar with this VA you will be now. Famous for her Hecate roll in Shakugan no Shana, Kotomi in Clannad, and Tifania in The Familiar of Zero, she fits so wonderfully with Matsuri and other somewhat soft spoken characters that she practically brings them to life. Although to me she is very infamous at the same time with her roles with vertically challenged little shits. Oh don't remind me of Kouta! Please don't!  
 
CHARACTER: 7 
Damn there was a lot of character development! I jizzed myself when a twist happened with Yorito! The sister's twist was obvious but even then still. WHAT A TWIST! Actually to be honest I'm dating this review as my most apathetic review ever! Every reviewer has to have an apathetic review to be known as a true critic. So this will be my first. Which means I can't be assed to write any further. So... 
 
ENJOYMENT: 7 
I enjoyed it yet wished it was done better. 
 
OVERALL: 7  
Watch it if you are bored and want a neat little anime to watch but get an ending that makes you wish you were watching Clannad instead. Or skip it and watch something funny instead like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? to make you hurt with laughter. That upcoming review will actually be my most put in effort review ever. So it will be like 4-6hours of thought put into it. As for this one this only took me an hour and a half to write so feel free to put it down. 
As for the feedback IDGAF. I'm too lazy to continue on with the review as most people are going to say I didn't even help them anyways. So that discourages me to even make this review any better. Feel free to also leave a comment on my profile insulting me on how I wasted your time also. KTHXBAI!  
 


          
 
       Helpful I was very impressed with this show! I wasn't really into anime when it came out, so i've been catching up on alot of good shows that came out in 2007, and i was very impressed with the animation of this one! The character models are all very attractive with slender bodies/faces. I also think the characters had a lot of life and connections. This stories more or less about tragic relationships, and people that strive too be together but ultimately can't have what they want out of a relationship. My only complaint was that i wish it was longer! I recommend this to anyone this has a little bit of everything in it

          
 
       Helpful Sola is an anime that will have you wondering until the end. 
 
Watching Sola is retty relaxing for the most part but don't get fooled by the first 20 minutes, this is not a slice of life but rather a supernatural with the pacing of a romance. By pacing of a romance I mean it's kinda slow but in the end it all comes together.. or does it? This anime will sometimes tell the plot through flashbacks and have it explained later through dialogue between certain characters. 
 
Sola has some confusing story bits scattered throughout all the episode which I can't mention a single bit of the story without spoilers other than the main character likes to take pictures of the sky and visits his sister in the hospital frequently.  
 
There isn't a whole lot of characters in Sola, but because of this, the characters are easier to remember. The side characters take larger roles than expected. The side characters actually help the story move forward without even knowing what's going on. 
 
There is action in Sola but not enough to fit under the ""action"" genre. 
 
The soundtrack is really relaxing. The art is good and it has an older look but the environment looks really nice. 
 
Sola has 13 episodes and 2 specials. The 2 specials don't really add to the ending but more like extra episodes. The 1st special is somewhere in the middle of the story and the 2nd special is right before the first episode. 
 
I don't have much else to say other than ""I like it.""

6,8426,68,6.466912149,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Hourou Musuko,"Effeminate fifth grader Shuuichi Nitori is considered by most to be one of the prettiest girls in school, but much to her dismay, she is actually biologically male. Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, transexuality, relationships, and acceptance. 
 
Lauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's  Hourou Musuko  is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","At the start of Wandering Son, Shuichi Nitori is a student in the fifth grade who transfers into a new school. She quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, he confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages her to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who is also a closeted transgender girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult named Yuki, who is a trans woman living with a cis man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Satō and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.
In junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased her about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as she begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing which causes her dysphoria to worsen. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.
Shuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that he no longer wishes to be seen as male and has decided to continue living as a girl. He also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi who rejects him, causing him to lament that his lack of gender affirmation hurts more than a rejection from someone he loves. The pair briefly hold hands before saying goodbye. Shuichi informs Anna of her true gender identity, and much to her surprise Anna decides to stay in a relationship with her. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title The Boy Who's a Girl (ぼくは、おんなのこ, Boku wa, Onna no Ko).
","Okay, first things first: I am a straight man, reviewing Hourou Musuko. 
I'm quite open to these topics because they are interesting to talk about sometimes. Anyways: 
 
This show boggled my mind;  
We have a boy who likes to dress as a girl (and be one),  
and a girl who likes to dress as a boy (and be one). 
Then, we have a friend of the boy who is gay, and a girl who has a big crush on the boy (and she also knows he crossdresses). 
Also how dafaq did he get these friends in the first place?? 
 
What got me confused was the questions I was asking myself while watching, that kept me entertained: 
if he has a crush on a girl who wants to be a boy and dresses like one, does that make him gay? Which version does he like more, the fact that it is a GIRL dressing up as a boy or JUST as a boy? 
 
If the boy who dresses like a girl, has a crush on a girl, that makes him straight right? Not lesbian? Even though he wants to be a girl? 
The characters in the show don't ignore these questions, they answer them later, which I'm quite glad about because it would drive me nuts if they didn't bring it up. 
 
Gender can't really be put into categories such as gay and lesbian or bi, and this is what the show was trying to get across.  
Equality? Yeah sure, the fact that girls can wear boy clothe and get away with it, but if a boy even THINKS about wearing a skirt, he is dead to society. Girls can stream cleavage and get $1000 worth of donations, pretty cool huh. 
 
Now, I'll have you know that the boy is a swag master, he has like 3 chicks or whatever that likes him, and he is only in middle school (one including a model). Like WTF? And they all know he cross-dresses! This boy is swag on another level, like if I knew I could get these kinda chicks like this, i'd cross dress in a heart beat! Just kidding, or am I..  
 
Anyways, the show is slow-paced, but actually I didn't mind it because it just makes all those cringe-worthy awkward moments so much better. There weren't so many cringe scenes, but the awkwardness was so real. It was fun watching some character's reactions, and there is a bit of suspense when you try to figure out how they would act like if they ever found out. This boy is brave, and as a character who likes girly things, this boy is a trooper. Always speaks his mind, and is chill about anything that might have ruined his life.  
 
The bullying in this show wasn't accurate enough, this was child's play compared to reality. Just wanted to point that out there. 
 
The boy's friends are really interesting. If anyone is being open to everything, his friends definitely are. He picked the right friends! 
 
For the art, it is all water-colory, reminds me exactly of Usagi Drop. 
 
The sound was pretty generic, it has that generic chime and what not. I don't remember the music ever standing out. Just average joe to me.  
 
If you were to watch this show, you'd watch it for the character interactions and the real awkward moments. Also relationship/love interest are relevant too. 
 
I rate it 8 out of 10 genderly confused people. 
 
---Tiny spoliers-- 
 
I wish the ending didn't stop there, I wanted to see the struggles of his teenager years, such as voice changing and growing beards, does he get surgery, etc. Also my best girl that I was rooting for technically won, I think.. 
I found out the anime show stops half way through the manga so I will start reading!  
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Hourou Musuko starts with questioning what little girls and boys are made of. It illuminates the role of sex in the construction of “natural” or coherent sexuality and gender, and the disheartening repercussions that the individuals, who fail to conform to what is socially accepted, experience. Further, the plotline sensibly uses the onset of puberty to intricately and realistically show that in this socially constructed world, we are bounded by to what has been “normalized”—boys must wear pants and girls must wear skirts. Together with the simple clean art and easy melodies, this series is crafted in a remarkably sensitive and moving way. 
 
Nitori and Takatsuki are the two main characters, who both struggle with gender crisis. Nitori is feminine by nature but trapped in a male body, same with Takatsuki who is masculine by nature however ensnared in a female body. Both clearly demonstrate the challenges of having binary sex system or the society's practice of heterosexuality. The plot visibly shows that the supposed blatancy of sex as a natural biological fact indicates to how intensely its production in discourse is concealed. For instance, Takatsuki agonizes girlhood because no matter how hard she flattens her chest, she cannot avoid wearing a bra for she can never stop her breast from growing. Likewise with Nitori, he vacillates boyhood because as soon as his body hairs grow, it’ll be harder for him to wear skirts and dresses. Moreover, the predicament of the storyline exists not just because of characters’ inner conflicts, they are also suffering overtly from being alienated and discriminated because their desired sexed bodies and gender roles are beyond what is “naturalized” by the society. In these scenarios, I like how these dilemmas are beautifully illustrated by the characters’ portrayal of genuine human emotions. 
 
I recommend Hourou Musuko for those who want to see a simple storyline but yet complex depiction of transexualism, and question humanity. If you find this subject offending, then this is not for you. Also, when watching this anime, try to perceive as if you’re sexless and genderless to fully discern how society materializes bodies to create boundaries and differentiate what is accepted from not. 

          
 
       Helpful I was really interested in this series' premise, because it doesn't happen often that an anime decides to deal with gender identity disorders, but I was disappointed with the way the topic was developed. 
 
Sometimes I have the feeling that, both in anime and manga, authors decide to discuss challenging topics but then don't have the courage to do it thoroughly. This is what I felt watching Hourou Musuko as well. Actually, I don't know if it's because they lack the courage, because they fear the fans' reaction or because they just don't know enough, I guess it depends on the case. In this story it feels like they just wanted to use the idea because of its originality and not actually to discuss the topic realistically, though up to a certain point I used to think they were trying to be serious about it. 
 
The protagonist, Nitori, is a middle school boy who likes to dress like a girl. Takatsuki is a girl who likes to dress like a boy. Nitori is presented as being in love with Takatsuki, though she doesn't seem to feel the same. The fact that the two might be in love could be seen as excessively coincidental, but I guess it makes sense that two people with the same ""issue"" are attracted to each other. 
 
With such a topic, you cannot but wonder about one thing: do Nitori and Takatsuki really feel that they were born the wrong gender? In other words, are we talking about an actual gender identity disorder? At the beginning it looks like it is, since Nitori really seems to feel like a girl, and the topic of sex change surgery is also brought up once. However, as the story progresses, his feelings start to become ambiguous, to the point that he actually starts to date a girl, likes her, and is even portrayed as manly. This didn't sit right with me. What is the point of having him crossdress and behave like a girl, with all the social problems this involves (people thinking you are a weirdo, your parents having to come to terms with it, your own feelings about yourself), if then all this is completely reset? Was he just crossdressing randomly, without any deeper reason? I was quite disappointed with this. 
 
I like the characters of Takatsuki and Chiba more. Takatsuki is more coherent. She really seems to have an issue with her being a girl, and is also more determined when it comes to dressing like a boy. Like Nitori, she doesn't really seem to develop an interest in other people of her own gender, but we don't see her as much so we don't really delve deep into her head. 
The reason I like Chiba is that I find her very human. Her behavior seems excessively cold at first, but the way she feels about other characters and her reasoning are believable. 
The other characters were OK, though most of them we didn't see enough and we only knew them superficially. 
 
The art is simple but fitting for the story. The music is also simple and doesn't stand out, but I guess it's fine in this kind of anime. The seiyuu were good. They chose a real boy to voice Nitori, and I think it makes sense. I don't really like it when crossdressing characters have a voice actor of the same gender they're crossdressing as (as in, crossdressing guys being voiced by women etc). It makes it ""too easy"", in a way. 
 
All in all it's a lighthearted, enjoyable anime, but I wish they didn't just discard what seemed to be the main point of the story.

       Helpful This is my first review, so I hope it's good enough. 
 
Before you watch this series, I suggest to watch Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded, the remake of the original series' 27th episode. You can also watch Inazuma Eleven: Outer Code before or along with this series to learn the perspective of other teams in the series. With that said, I'll start my review. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The plot is set on a parallel timeline one year after the altered 27th episode. The story is somewhat boring, as there is basically no emphasis on the actual title, ""Ares no Tenbin"". 
Simply put, this series just introduced a set of new characters and remake of some the original characters, to play in Football Frontier. This could be good but the execution is quite bland. 
However, the series tried to make three perspectives along the Football Frontier, through the main characters Asuto, Haizaki, and Nosaka. I believe Haizaki and Nosaka were developed nicely, but Asuto was very underdeveloped. Unlike the original series' core main Endou Mamoru, this series' core main Inamori Asuto is not attachable. I decide to give the story 7/10. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art of the series is different from the original series and the GO series, but still quite nice. I enjoyed the original art the best. I decide to give the art 8/10. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The sound effects were nice and the both opening and the ending songs wasn't bad. The animation of the songs follow the usual stream of openings and endings of Inazuma Eleven series. I decide to give the sound 8/10. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The characters... is what I want to discuss most. The Inakuni Raimon team character development is horrible. You don't feel attached like the original series to just Asuto, but the entire team. Everyone in the main team was underdeveloped until later episodes. The captain never stood out until later in the series, ironically being the captain. Very few characters has slight development and the rest have almost none. The only character in Inakuni Raimon that was good was their coach, that isn't even in the team. 
However, most of teams outside Inakuni Raimon were wonderfully developed despite their brief appearances. I decide to give the character 7/10. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
With all the above said, I enjoyed the matches almost as much as the original series. Even though this series involved quite a lot of normal shots which is a new thing in the line of the entire series, it is very enjoyable. I decide to give the enjoyment 9/10. 
 
Overall: 8/10

It was an amazing experience might I add even though it was the second screening and there were no posters... So let me say that this was an insanely great movie and really showed what I love most about Love Live... The music.  
 
The story was good don't get me wrong but overall I really enjoy the music even though I can't understand what they are saying. The songs have a catchy beat to them that just get's stuck in your head. It's been over 12 hours since I watched it and I still have Sunny Day Song stuck in my head and have already listened to it over 15 times! 
 
The story this time was a little different in the sense that it's the buildup to the end of Muse. They plan to break up after a concert to show the appeal of school idols to the world. Before this happens though they end up going to America to meet up and do an interview about School Idols and also play a Live. They sing the song Angelic Angel which let me say I have played a bunch on the game. 
 
They return to America and... BOOM all of a sudden they are extremely popular with everyone and there are posters and there Live of Angelic Angel playing all over the place. They are shocked but more importantly they are surrounded by their fans in the airport! 
 
After running away from their fans the problem arises *HAHA The puns* where they must decide... will Muse break up or will they continue to sing as Idols! If you didn't figure it out yet they broke up there band and finished off the movie with Sunny Day Song! 
 
The movie overall was abesolutely amazing and brings back the feels of the anime when you watched it for the first time. There were many funny moments throughout the movie and it was much more enjoyable then I had expected! Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Love Live Franchise and also anyone who hasn't seen Love Live should defianetely watch the series then the movie.

          
 
       Helpful A Review on Love Live: The Movie 
Story –  
The story at best is simply: “Ok”. There isn’t anything exciting or interesting about it. It’s just mediocre. This was already an apparent trend in the actual series, but having it condensed in a 1 hour 39 minute movie, really makes it obvious how bad it is. The pacing is god-awful and it just throws you from scene to scene will barely any suitable transition. At one moment, it’s like: “HAH, HAPPY FUN TIME WITH MY FRIENDS” then it’s a supposedly seriously moment with a (kinda) heavy atmosphere. Then it swaps right back to the “happy, energetic moments” with again, little to no transition. It makes you question, “what was the point of that whole scene?” It feels like a waste of time and adds nothing to the overall story. It was there for simply the moe appeal. That brings up another issue I found while watching this. Because of this over usage of dramatic moments with no substance, it made me care less and less about those moments. Why is this bad? Because when there are scenes with actual substance, such as the whole tension about continuing the Muse after the third-years graduate, I couldn’t care less about it because the viewers have already been diluted to the point where their perception is just “another pointless dramatic scene.” If I were to give this Movie anything, it creates a decent conflict for once. A battle against “ the audience they  wish to continuing performing for and their relationship as a group” vs. the “philosophy of what school idol means to them”. It’s a shame the execution was just terrible, it had no proper built up, and once we got to the climax, it felt underwhelming. I also need to point out the transition to the music videos, or song section if you will. Based off what I’ve seen, it feels as if they made those segments first, and were like: 
A:“Hey, check out this cool music video we made!”  
B:“Great! Where is that going in the movie?” 
A:“Oh” 
 
 Out of the six song segments, I’ve seen, four of them were just awkwardly placed there for the sake of “We need to put this somewhere”. What annoys me about this is that seeing how they could fit in two other songs in the movie well, they failed to do it with the other four songs. It was lazily incorporated into the movie, and honestly felt like I was watching a kids show where they suddenly break out into song just out of nowhere. My best example of this is the first song segment. Where it’s just “suddenly, it’s raining... ooooh that’s bad… we can’t have fun… (or something). Then BAM, SONG. Like what? It goes from one side of the spectrum to the other within a split second, and the initiation to that segment was just, Rin jumping…. It’s a mess. 
Art –  
The animation has been half-and-half for me. Overall the drawn animation looks pretty good, especially during the dance segments. There are parts where it looks a bit stiff, but otherwise it was well made. My only complaint would be the CGI. It just awkward to look at and contrasts heavily with the background. You may argue that “dancing is hard to animate”, which it is, so using CGI is justified. But they keep on switching from CGI to Drawn, and sometimes the dancing is done in 2D animation, AND IT LOOKS BETTER. And sometimes they have CGI AND Drawn in the SAME SHOT. IT’S LIKE THEY COULDN’T DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY, otherwise, its awkward and a pain to look at.  
Sound –  
The music is good, this is the only good part of the movie. They’re idols after all, this is probably the reason why you’d watch this in the first place. If the music was bad, I don’t know why this movie would exist then, let alone the series. 
Characters –  
My main issue with Love Live would be its overall premise. They tried to make an anime based solely on an Idol group. That’s it. In an Idol group, you only need a few things to be successful. Good songs, Moe Characters, and quirky and cute personalities. In an anime, you can’t do that, you can try, but the quality will surely drop. The Love Live gang is just generic. They’re not interesting, they don’t have any character development, they’re just one-tricks. Quirky and baseless. It works for the first ten minutes at most, but in a movie? It gets fucking annoying. Allow me to run down the list: 
Honoka – Clutsy leader 
Rin – Makes meow noises at the end of her sentences, this isn’t cute. It’s annoying. 
Hanayo – WHITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Other than that, nothing is memorable. 
Umi – Overreacts to literally everything 
Maki – Generic Tsundere attitude 
Niko – NICO NICO NIIII. That’s her contribution to the story 
Kotori -  Her contribution in this movie specifically was minimal, mainly just restates the lines. 
Nozumi – Has tarot cards and just is there.  
Eri – Serious, and gets the plot rolling.  
Of course this a general description of the characters, but it's to get my point across.  
The issue here is that you can’t make a show just on very shallow personalities. From start to finish, they’re the same. Boring.  
 
Enjoyment –  
Can’t say I enjoyed it. I had literal headaches watching this. It was a waste of my time, and I’d rather would just want to see the music videos.  
 
Overall –  
The Love Live Movie is bad…. Not terrible to the point where it’s unwatchable, nor a “masterpiece” as some may describe it. It suffers from being just extremely bland, average, and mediocre. Despite the movie having great music/dance segments, that only constitutes maybe 10% of the movie. Making the other 90% of the movie just unbearably annoying.  
 
To clarify, I don't think Love Live as an Idol group is bad, I just think that the transition from an idol group to an anime and full-on movie was very very poor and deserves another look at the drawing board for we cannot continue with the perception that this series is ""well-made"" when it clearly lacks in the most important areas in what makes a good anime.

       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, albeit minor ones 
The Love Live movie was kinda good 
 
It had a lot fan service but not in the definition that most people would use. Quite a number of scenes, jokes, lines and details are throwbacks to the previous two seasons, meant to give fans enjoyment when they recognise them. Also, that one snippet very near the beginning with Maki, wow. 
The plot was... ...it didn't give a clear direction in where it was going until past the halfway mark. They were working hard but I was wondering why. Actually, we weren't even shown their hard work and jump into the group song when they say so. I think that might have contributed to my inability to root for them in the movie. 
 
Most of the songs were seemingly randomly inserted with dances that make no sense in the moment. I even started thinking, after the second random insert, that the creators put those songs in to match the number of songs that there would be in a full season. 
 
Admittedly, the throwbacks were really enjoyable, among other things. 
 
The mysterious person was quite an interesting addition too. 
 
The art was also a great improvement. 
 
Overall, it's good for fans and a pretty bad place to start for the uninitiated. 
...I'm kind of torn between rating it 6/10, 7/10. 6/10 for the reasons above, 7/10 because it was enjoyable nonetheless. 
 
I guess I'll settle for 7/10

After a series of embarrassing accidents, both she and the mysterious boy she had a crush on, Akira Sudo, were elected as members of the student council. Being the first student council of this newly established high school, they are about to create ""new traditions"" for their school and a bittersweet love story for themselves...

Midori and Akira rekindle their relationship after Akira comes back. The story ends with their graduation from high school.
","I remember loving the manga, which, as everything written by Ai Yazawa, shows lively characters with real, deep emotions and issues. 
The problem with this OVA is obvious even before watching it: it's a 30-minute video out of an 8-volume series. It doesn't expect to represent the entire plot, but even the slice taken in consideration by the OVA is really shrunk, and everything happens so fast that there's no time for the characters to develop their feelings or to show their complex personalities, which is a big part of what makes Yazawa's stories wonderful, nor it's possible for the viewer to really get attached to the characters, especially without having the manga in mind. The plot of the OVA is a bit meaningless, by itself, it feels like some things are happening, without real reason or a final resolution. 
 
That said, it's a surprisingly good effort, considering all the issues I've mentioned. The art and animation is as good as one can expect from such an old anime, but not really worth watching, especially if you haven't read the manga. 
If you're a die-hard fan with 30 minutes of spare time, and have nothing better to do, watch this, but don't expect too much.

There is no real plot to it; Girl likes boy since childhood, but he forgot about her, and basically she's waiting all the time for him to remember without any courage to do something about it. 
 
The thing that really irritated me was that even though it only has 3 episodes, it tries to throw a whole bunch of side characters in your face.

This also makes the romance itself look pretty shallow, even for such a short series, as there is neither development nor much backstory for the main characters.

          
 
       Helpful I'll just start by saying this anime really isn't worth your time. It's only 3 episodes though, so you might sit through it just for the sake of seeing what a truly mediocre anime looks like. Or maybe just to add another number to your list. 
 
The plot was pretty weak. Actually, I don't even know what the plot was. This was basically just a short scenario with the typical boy meets girl setup, boy and girl have feelings for each other, followed by boy remembering that he promised to marry girl when they were 5 (or thereabout. and for some reason it's always the guy that forgets, whereas the girl always remembers). I understand that promises are important and all in Japanese culture (actually, where aren't they? ), but there are some promises you just don't bother keeping because they're so frivolous (and we all know that children aren't half as psychologically developed as many anime make them out to be). And at that, such minor things that happened at that young of an age would probably be soon forgotten anyways, rather than used years later to try and get a girl who is out of your league (in this case, the characters were all average enough that it doesn't actually apply here, where it often does in typical harems with better visuals. +1 point for being somewhat realistic by using some of the most average characters I've ever seen). 
 
I used to think of Happiness! as a stereotypical generic anime, but I enjoyed it a little. This, however, is much more generic. Nothing about this anime was really done right, or particularly wrong for that matter, it just didn't do much of anything. There wasn't really a point. It's a love story that's not really heartwarming or dramatic. It's boring. 
 
Visually, it's also generic. At first I attributed this to age, since I assumed it was pretty old (like early 90s or before). You know what they say about assumptions though. But anyways, I was wrong. There's no excuse for the bland visuals, given that this was actually produced in 2003. You're sure to find countless others produced around that time that actually have respectable visuals and animation. Which brings me to the next point: this anime had mediocre animation too. Generally, it wasn't really an issue (it's not like there was much animation going on anyways), but there were parts where the animators were just plain lazy. From the looks of this anime, the production budget was probably so low that they weren't getting paid enough to motivate them to work in the first place. So I'll excuse the bad animation out of pity for the overworked and underpaid animators that had to waste their time on this one. 
 
Now for the characters, the part I pay the most attention to by far in an anime. Short story shorter: they were flat. In fact, I've probably drawn on paper with more dimension. The emotions were also poorly done and didn't feel natural. This was probably mostly due to the voice acting, which wasn't particularly bad, but wasn't particularly good either. Just bland. There was the girl from the library though. She was hitting on him like it was nobody's business (I don't even know why she was there. It was totally random). Who does that? But that automatically made her the most dynamic character (not that that's saying much. it's pretty sad when a random insert character has more personality than the important ones).  
 
Because of my previously mentioned assumption that the show was kind of old (I don't generally bother to look at the date before watching something), I had given the sound some undeserved leeway. It's poor. None of the music was even slightly memorable. Have you ever watched an old VHS and noticed the sound is a little distorted? That's exactly what this sounds like. 
 
Enjoyment wasn't present. They could have at least attempted some cheap humor (there were a couple chances where it could have been easily done. This anime still wouldn't have earned more than a 5 from me that way, but it still would have been an improvement). Needless to say, I'm glad it was only 3 episodes. 
 
I don't think I used the word generic enough times in this review to qualify my opinion of this anime.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The film is based on the tradition of ""four basic necessities of life"", like each other and is divided into three storylines: 

The Rice Noodles (Japanese: 陽だまりの朝食, romanized: hidamari no chōshoku, simplified Chinese: 一碗乡愁; traditional Chinese: 一碗鄉愁; pinyin: yì wǎn xiāng chóu), focusing on food

","I watched the netflix version of this, which just sort of mushes the three stories together to make a feature length film. The story is as the MAL description says. It has three parts that do not really have much to do with each other. Each story is sweet and features about 80% voice over to tell it. Your enjoyment of the three may vary. I personally feel that the middle story is the weakest and kind of played out. However, the characters are solid. The first is my favorite for the visuals and the voice acting (which we'll get into later) but lacks any kind of story. The third is the only one with a real story line. However, the characters are bland and the voice acting is terrible. No one part has everything.  
 
The art is absolutely spectacular. While the character design is lacking, the background and and settings are very deep and dazzling. There was a shot of a puddle in the opening minutes that made me mark out hard. The art is pretty consistent throughout the three stories, but the first is where the most animation time went into.  
 
The sound and music are not very noticeable. Aside from a few good tape recording and cooking effects there is not much to talk about. The dubbing is a bit rough. It is a little noticeable in the second story with not awkwardly read, but awkwardly translated lines. Then, in the third story we get to listen to captain no charisma do the main character.  
 
The characters are where this movie takes a hit. Outside of the second story there are not any noteworthy characters. Some kids, some grandparents etc.  
 
Overall, it is a very easy and fast watch. The movie likes to try to trigger nostalgia and in some cases may do so effectively. I would recommend watching it with the dub if only to be able to focus on the beautiful artwork as it is one of the few saving graces of the work.

          
 
       Helpful • SLIGHT SPOILER REVIEW • 
 
Shikioriori, English name: Flavors of Youth, is divided into 3 Chapters: First (Sunny Breakfast), Second (Small Fashion Show), Third (Shanghai Love). Similar on what Shinkai did on 5 Centimeters per Second. The movie is placed in China and even the main character’s name is all in Chinese. But the studio and voice actors are Japanese. Here’s my quick review of the film: 
 
Story: 
As the film begins, you're greeted with an aesthetically beautiful art and animation followed by a few words and the first chapter’s title. The MC of the first chapter then is introduced. As the first chapter ends, the second chapter begins. The transition is the same as the first one. As the story flows, the movie gives a very heartwarming slice of life, with a slight touch of love, heartbreak, and a mediocre drama. The story travels from the perspective of a young man experiencing youth, first love, and being unknowledgeable about adults. Being able to wonder why do people leave? The story then jumps from a young man to a 20-ish women. The movie shows how life has plenty of trials to overcome, and how people be able to overcome those difficult trials. In this chapter, the movie also questions you, ”The job you choose, are you really enjoying it?” ”Have you really live life to the fullest?”. Then from 20-ish women to a young boy, in this chapter, you are able to realize how communication is really important at any times. This chapter is so far the best among them. A really strong friendship of a group of best friends followed by a trial they should, with the emotion of love, anxiety, and fear at their backs. This chapter shows how this group of friends reacts to their current situation and how time could never be rewind even you wish to. Overall, the plot is filled with tons of great slice of life, paced on a slow start and an explosive ending. There are no big expectations, to begin with. The story might be boring to some non slice of anime fans. 7/10 
 
Art: As the Studio who created Your Name, 5 Centimeter Per Seconds and Garden of Words, it was amazing. Tho there are times where you can able to see some lousy animation, but overall its good. The budget might not be too big as compared to Shinkai’s work, but CoMix Wave really give a shot especially to those beautiful backgrounds! The CGI of the cars are actually good too. Nevertheless, the animation is amazing, tho they have flaws, but the positives overpowered all the negatives. 8/10 
 
Sound: Sound effects are great. The food preparation during the first few minutes of the film is amazing. The chopping of ingredients, up to the sound of rain. It's actually pretty decent. The credits song is actually good too. 8/10 
 
Character: The character designs are mediocre for me. I mean, CoMix Wave actually has pretty decent animation and art skills. But their character design is just .... meh. Its nothing to be amazing and shock about. VAs are good. They did choose a very warm tone for the VAs of the MCs. There is really no character development that can be seen in the movie. But on how the MCs end their chapter is really a big thumbs up for me. It also relays a message to the viewers and few life lessons. Overall, 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: I’m a fan of slice of life anime, so I’m pretty used to a slow-paced plot. A slow pace movie also gives the audience time to enjoy the great art drawn by the studio. Afterall, it is a great animation that leads the viewers to finish the movie at the end. I somewhat enjoy the movie. There are no explosives and huge plot twist like Your Name, nor a heavy drama and heart pounding ending like 5 centimeters. Just pure slice of life with a glimpse of love and a tiny drama. Overall, 8/10 
 
Conclusion: As I said a moment ago, this movie is pace differently to other famous one. So you should not compare it to them as they are way different from each other. I would definitely recommend this anime to SOME, as non slice of life and drama fan might get really bored to this film. Overall, a great film if you are looking for something to cry one. Overall, films score is 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful This film comprises three shorter, independent stories, with the common premise of the inevitable loss of the things, people and places that used to make us happy. I think it is targeted at a certain demographic starting at late 20s to early 30s, when one begins to realize the extent of this loss. It is an emotional experience for those of us who can relate to it, but to those who not it may be boring, since all three stories are built on a feeling more than a plot: In that aspect, it reminds me of Jiro Taniguchi's works. Let's say as well that I don't agree with other reviewers in the point that it is a product for an Asian audience specifically: I am Spanish and I can fully relate to the themes presented. 
 
When giving a score to it, the problem is that I'd give a different score to the three shorts: 7 to the first one, 6 to the second and 8 to the third; therefore, by average I give it a 7 (plus an extra point because overall I enjoyed it quite a lot and felt touched). I feel though that the themes could have been better executed, specially in the first and second stories. 
 
Keep in mind that this is not something you watch for the story, but for the shared feeling of nostalgia between the film and your own experience. If you haven't felt that experience of seeing the things that mean your younger days disappear, you'll probably find this boring.

Adaptations never get the anticipation fans are expecting. For one, that is actually our fault. The game and the anime have different ways of delivering the message to the audience, (Check out MatPat's vid about adaptations for detailed explanation) but this adaptation took me into a whole new world. A Darker one to boot.  
 
*Contains some spoilers from the game* 
 
The end of Chapter 1 for the Mobile game has you, the hero, defeating Black King. The twist and turns of the whole book one unfolds into the last chapter, Black King being revealed as Phoena's father, and Black Knight being Yuri from a different Chain Chronicle world. The anime tackled a different route, where Yuri didn't defeat the Black King right then and there. Yes, the story may have turned into a darker path but I enjoyed it as to how it shows that the franchise itself had grown and matured to tackle on a darker light.  
 
While it's a shameless attempt into pulling anime fans into the game, it is indeed actually recommended that you finish Book 1 and as many character story possible. You will appreciate all the anime has to offer. For one, Julianna's story line in the game was actually one of the driving force for her to take on the Throne. Shuza's Nine Territories' storyline shows when and how the two joined forces to fight the Black King. 
 
Seeing all that connections, all that immersions, being twisted in a different, dark light gives a whole new rejuvenating enjoyable new experience the anime adaptation has to offer.  
 
*Update* 
 
I have to admit. Aram is really a big ass pull character. I wished his backstory and how his powers came to be was explained more clearly. 
 
I hope this somehow helped you into reconsidering to rewatch the series with all the points in mind. It saddens me that the score is dwindling down. Though I must admit, I will rate this 6/10 if I don't have any background in the game. I've seen it firsthand while watching some of the episodes with others that don't have the game background simply bored out and start spacing out mid episode. But as to how each episodes tug into my heart and my emotion, I just won't take it to look at this series going down without a fight (or atleast an explanation). 

          
 
       Helpful ENG-The story is pretty classic and boring. The hero who believes in the hope that must beat the great villain of despair with the power of friendship. It's seen and already seen. 
From an artistic point of view, this anime is rather good. The animations are fluid. However, there are some errors in some passages. 
The sounds and voices are also good. Despite the fact that in my opinion Ishida Akira (whom I admire) is not meant to be Yuri's voice. 
The characters are very numerous and detailed: congratulations to the character-design team who had to work very hard. 
I enjoyed this anime because even if it is a basic story, it remains good and pleasant to follow. 
 
FR-L'histoire est plûtot classique et ennuyante. Le héros qui croit en l'espoir qui doit battre le grand méchant du désespoir à l'aide du pouvoir de l'amitié. C'est du vu et déjà vu. 
D'un point de vu artistique, l'animé est plutôt bon. Les animations sont fluides. Cependant, il y quelques erreurs dans certains passages.  
Les sons et voix sont aussi bons. Malgré le fait que selon moi Ishida Akira (que j'admire) n'est pas fait pour être la voix de Yuri. 
Les personnages quand à eux sont très nombreux et détaillés : félicitation à l'équipe de character-design qui a du travailler très dure. 
J'ai apprécié cet animé car même si c'est une histoire basique, elle en reste bonne et agréable à suivre.

          
 
       Helpful Chain Chronicles looked beyond the characters roles and into their hears. An impressive and beautifully animated story. 
 
When I first looked up this anime I saw some seriously negative reviews and I was almost swayed by them. I am so glad that I didn't listen. This anime is such a gem. I think the characters and the plot are all quite unique and well thought out. There is also sufficient character development throughout the series for all the main characters. I mean generically you always have a plot where the Hero gathers their team to defeat the Demon king and you don't often see an anime which looks at the consequences of the hero failing. Personally I think this anime was not only well written, but a very decent exploration into the adventure/fantasy genre. 
 
The animation, now Telecom Animation Film did a splendid job with this. All the characters all looked beautiful, you can tell the budget was big  on this one. Although I'm not very fond of the whole 3D animation theme, they used it sparingly and at beautiful moments. It transformed some of their action scenes into complete masterpieces. 
 
Which brings us on to the fight scenes. It's not often that I get so excited by fight scenes that I am practically rocking in my chair. Trust me I love me some fight scenes and If you want to see some serious fighting then I am telling you, you gotta watch this because their swordplay is not only beautiful but intense. All the various characters have their own styles, the Sakuga is great. Trust me it will keep you on your toes. 
 
The soundtrack was also impressive. It felt like your favourite generic adventure themes with this added hype that got me so hyped for every scene, I tell you the soundtrack made the most menial scenes really awesome. 
 
Please don't listen to negative reviews and give it your own chance please, you really don't know what your missing.  I personally think no matter what your ending opinion of it is, it is definitely worth your time.

6,10347,76,6.373080804,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Happy Kappy,"The story revolves around Kinoshita Suguri, a nine-year-old third-grade girl who loves animals and making fashion accessories. One day, while Suguri is out buying materials for accessories, she comes across an unusual rock. Thinking it would look cute on a bracelet, she goes to pick up the rock and discovers a creature named Kappy. Kappy happens to be the three-year-old prince of Kapimeshia. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']",none,"The anime is about the everyday lives of this little girl named Suguri Kinoshita. Her life is not so normal though because she lives with a magical pet named Kappy that has magical powers. The anime mostly revolve around normal everyday stuff like baking, cleaning or playing in the park and it has normal everyday problems like a balloon stuck in a tree, doing your chores or having fights with your friends. These problems are resolved though by having Kappy use his magic powers. The anime usually ends with a happy note after Kappi saves the day but other times, some trouble brews because of his interference. There is nothing groundbreaking in the anime though. The story is simple, there is no strong conflict and the flow of the events is predictable. It’s just a very bright colored five minute anime about fluff episodes. 
 
As the anime progresses, it introduces new characters with magical powers. The episodes usually involve the new characters, magical as well and related to Kappi, stirring up trouble and having Kappi use his powers to save the day. Once again, there is nothing really huge. It’s light hearted and cute. I can’t really expect much from a kiddie show that runs for five minutes. 
 
The characters in the anime are all fluff as well. They’re friendly and nice and caring like what you’d expect from a kiddie anime. Some characters are a bit unruly but the cuteness still dominates. The two main characters are pretty bland. Suguri is the typical girl that happens to have a magical pet. There is just enough of her personality to fill in the gaps of the five minutes. The same goes for Kappy. He’s laidback, cute, funny, and loves to eat donuts. That’s basically it and they remain the same from start to finish. 
 
I do admire how much the anime has achieved in the span of five minutes. Including the OP and ED, there is actually a decent amount of story in the episodes. There’s a conflict and a decent resolution to them. Don’t expect much though because the anime caters for kids. Everyone in the anime is friendly and the anime is predominantly made of cakes and butterflies.

(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'School']",none,"Okay so when I was watching this series I found it hard to take it seriously as a romance or comedy but I finished it anways and here what I thought. 
Story- Okay let's just suffice to say generic harem scheme comes to mind here and to call it anything else is a lie beyond all reason. It lacks major aspects to make it funny and it lacks major aspects to make it a serious romance so yeah watching it for those aspects is setting yourself up for disappointment. 
Art- This is not a well drawn or even well animated series in my opinion and that's sad considering this is what I consider to be one of the better aspects of the series itself. 
Sound- Voice acting and sound effects fair and background music poor. 
Character- This series fails majorly at this part where the only thing you really know about a character is what is said there is no real work put into character description, truth be told in one episode the characters themselves sum up what they are and what they're purpose is which says a lot about how much the creators actually cared about their characters and character development. 
Enjoyment- Well let's just say I won't be watching this again unless I'm tied down and gagged or something similar to that situation. 
Overall- I'm sure there is somebody who will enjoy watching this series out there that person just is not me. I believe this series had some potential at the beginning but in the end just could not make up its mind and therefore failed to deliver anything that could suffice as entertainment in the end.

          
 
       Helpful I was in the mood for some light comedy so I picked up this anime Guardian Hearts.  Some words of warning for you if you’re considering watching this as well, if you’re expecting something that makes sense or don’t like over the top echiiness and unrealistically huge breasts then stay away.  If none of these things bother you at all, by all means read on! 
 
The story is incredibly confusing and nonsensical.  The first five minutes are likely to have you staring at the screen trying to keep up while scratching your head saying ""Huh?"".  I haven’t read any of the manga so I don’t have any point of reference beyond what is presented in the anime.  But basically they try to cram in all the back story and character introductions that might normally take a couple episodes in the space of a couple minutes.  Thus you are left wondering what is really going on.  Eventually you start to catch up and things begin to make at least a little sense, sometimes.  The plot is standard harem echii fare, a guy suddenly finds himself living a bunch of really cute girls with various magical powers and who are all madly in love with him, and constantly fighting each other over him.  The humor is completely random and silly and quite funny at times and really not at others.  This is mostly due to the state of confusion you are in during most of the show.  The anime also tends to try to do too many things as well.  Its parody, romance, action, slice of life kind of all rolled up into one.  The romance is really shallow but there are a few touching moments. 
 
Characters are about as stereotypical as you will find.  This is not to say a lot of them don’t have some charm still but none of them are particularly deep or memorable and I can’t say you haven’t already seen these characters in other anime before.  The biggest problem with Guardian Hearts is there are just way too many of them.  The episodes are about 12 minutes in length and while they all basically just run together as one larger story, the total series is not long enough to be fair with the dozen or so characters it has. 
 
The animation and art is pretty much a mixed bag.  Mostly it is just really inconsistent.  The characters are all cute clothed, but when we start talking about all the echii shots, boobs, and other nudity they look silly.  Apparently nobody wears bras that supports anything but boobs don’t move like that.  They also don’t look like that either, trust me guys I have them and even if I strip naked and jump up and down on a trampoline they won’t move like that.  I’ve got no problem with nudity but at least try to make it realistically possible.  The action and magical battles on the other hand are nicely drawn though.  The voice acting and music is solid though not spectacular. 
 
In the end I can’t really say I enjoyed Guardian Hearts that much.  While it did make me laugh a number of times and it had a few romantic touches it was overall a below average anime.  If you simply must watch every echii comedy out there or you’re a fan of the manga then there is likely to be something for you to enjoy here.

On his first night back in the dormitory, he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name of ""Yoru"". The stranger identifies himself as ""Ran"" and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or ""Nao-kun"", is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.
Sora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as ""Ran"" that first night: he and Sora have alternate personalities. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.
Other comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group ""The School Do-It-Alls"" and from such minor characters as a bishōnen ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin'ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans.

","Entirely too cutesy wutesy woo. Entirely too predictable. Entirely too annoying. Just what age-group had that been directed to?  
 
When I started watching, I immediately thought that the overly cute and constant chibi-scenes were more awkward than funny. It was like the story was grabbing me from the neck and yelling ""it's chibis and they are being cute and funny. NOW LAUGH!"". Honestly,  
 
In 12 episodes, there were entirely too many characters and trying to deal with them all just made the anime confusing. Specially when the story-telling jumped back and forth from cutesy wutesy woo chibis to seriousness like... every few minutes. Like the review I read about the series before watching it ""once you think the chibis are just a bit too much, it changes into more serious story-telling, and when the angst is starting to become overwhelming, it goes back into the humour-mode"" ( or so ). That is really hard to pull off without being annoying. Fruits Basket managed this marvelously, Sukisyo didn't. It was just restless and hard to follow. Not to mention that more than once I was stunned by the sheer stupidity of the characters ( someone might call them plotholes... ). In the end, I felt like whole of that second personality stuff was pretty pointless, among many other things. They hardly supported or had anything to with the main plot.  
 
It did jerk some laughter out of me ( but sometimes it wasn't because of the humor ) but most of the time I felt like banging my head to desk. 
 
The style of the animation... ugh... not only was it overly cute, it was pretty generic, anime gone overly-cute. Almost all the most important characters had weird colored hair and eyes while the background characters were almost always that basic brown-haired and brown-eyed types. I really hate it when for no apparent reason characters have cute blue or pink or what not eyes or hair, specially if they totally stand out from the rest of the group yet no one minds.  
Animation itself was basic good. Nothing too incredible but not bad either. At least all the eps looked pretty much the same ( at least I didn't notice any big difference anywhere ). 
 
Sora was fun, but his constant chibi-transformations made him a bit annoying. Also, his stupidity from time to time was nothing out of annoying, rather than cute ( and make no mistake, I often like dumb characters ). His alter-ego Yoru, seemed much more interesting. 
 
Sunao was cute. If you like that kind of cute. I don't. His light-red hair accompanied with such basic ""difficult uke"" behavior was irritating, and his reasons of angsting and eventually putting up most of the story was ridiculous. I can't find such childishness believable, let alone likable. 
 
I was mostly interested in Nanami's and Shinichirou's relationship in the end. Mostly because I like their voice actors alot, which is probaply pretty shallow but that's really all there was to it. 
 
I liked Matsuri a lot, because... can anyone say Ayame ( Fruits Basket )? Sure you can. He was totally, absolutely like Ayame. Then again, that's also why I didn't like him as much as I could have - originality is nice. 
 
While I'm a complete shounen-ai/yaoi fan, I did find the lack of girls a bit silly. I don't think in whole 12 eps there was a single female character around, not even in the background. It was a total Homotopia and while I sometimes amuse myself with such thoughts, it's really kinda unrealistic. That Valentine's Day ep was a sad... sad thing to see. 
 
Anyway, this was definitely a very disappointing anime and I really can't recommend it for anyone.

          
 
       Helpful I've noticed, that as I read the reviews, that a lot of people seemed to dis and look for the faults in this anime. I am still new to the yaoi anime department, but seeing that I am, I thought I should at least give my opinion on this. 
 
As I said, I'm new to Yaoi, and this was a great way to ease me into the themes. It's not overly detailed and somewhat cute in a way. Though, this may not be a good anime for hard-core and people who like yaoi to a major, this is great for those who have just been introduced to the anime. 
 
Though, I did question why there were only GUYS in this anime. I never saw one girl and obviously, in this an all boy school, everyone has strange interests (though that doesn't bug me entirely). But I did think, since it is an all boy school, strange interests are bound to happen. 
 
The humor in the anime always had me laughing and I chuckled through-out the anime (I owuld have just laughed...but my parents would have then looked at me funny). When I first started watching, I was a tad confused in the beginning but then everyone became Chibis...I have a sorta weakness to chibis so I kinda just squealed upon seeing them. 
 
Again, I state that to yaoi otakus, I agree that this anime may be bad to all of you, but to those girls (or boys) who are just introduced to yaoi and are just easing into likin it, it's a great anime to start.

          
 
       Helpful Sukisho, where to start... This would have to be my all time favourite anime. The story is fairly original I felt, with a good dose of humour that sort of masks the dark undertones so it's not a depressing anime. It's a story of friendship and love, but also cruelty and revenge. I recommend this to everyone, even if boy x boy isn't your thing, it's only light shounen ai and is still a great watch.

My wonderful sister got married near the end of last year. 
 
Her husband (now my brother-in-law) are perfect for one another. They have each other’s backs, putting up with the other’s “baggage” despite their differences. And with him being one of the nicest guys that I know, and her being overly supportive, they are as compatible as can be. 
 
I know they’ll have a successful, happy marriage moving forward. At the minimum, they’ll be a lot better off than whatever Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! presented. 
 
STORY 
 
As expected, Okusama contains similar content to that of the first season. Izumi and Ui are shacked up, leading to the pair’s multitude of sexual romps. Unfortunately, Okusama also includes a ton of unnecessary elements that ultimately ruin the entire experience. 
 
Chief among its problems is a refusal to let any of its sexual content play out. Not only in first-second-third base terms but also in emotional terms too. Izumi and Ui are about to passionately kiss? In barges Rin to stop it before it even happens. They’re about to get frisky in bed? Sorry, Izumi, but premature ejaculation would like a word. A Rin-and-Ui double feature ready and waiting? Whoops, Rin’s sister conveniently shows up to say a few words and derail the fornication. 
 
Even when the anime finally has the guts to show off its sexual content, much of it simply lacks spice or at least variety. One too many almost-touched-lips kisses with Izumi and groping without any flair lead from one boring sexual encounter to another. Izumi helping Ui take a suppository is as adventurous as the anime gets. 
 
These events and the ones outside the realm of debauchery also go against Okusama’s previous season’s theme on marriage even more so than ever before. The anime constantly places Izumi in situations that don’t involve Ui whatsoever or simply don’t mesh with the marriage aspect of their relationship. 
 
For instance, they raid the photography club’s clubroom, but it’s an event that has little (if anything) to do with how Ui and Izumi get along. What occurs, then, is a slew of scenes that should have never been allowed to happen in the first place since they continue to reinforce why the anime does not deserve to be titled My Wife Is the Student Council President. 
 
The anime does keep its motif in mind on occasion, like when Ui complains about Izumi not giving her enough attention (and touching) or when Izumi eats the food Ui concocted despite its nefarious aura (because that’s what a man should do). Sadly, Okusama would much rather give Rin yet another unnecessary shot with the male lead, bringing the anime back towards polygamy. 
 
Okusama does have its small moments. The condom that Rin’s older sister gave to Izumi returns as a joke later in the season when Rin discovers it in his desk drawer, and the final episode proves that the anime didn’t forget about Ui’s parents from last season, giving them a miniscule cameo to cap off this this season. Plus, it does have the usual cute pouts and comedic jokes to fill the gaps between the promiscuous asides. 
 
Unfortunately, so much of the content is boring, aggravating, or otherwise lacking that whatever else Okusama attempts to do cannot heal its self-inflicted wounds. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
In this second season of Okusama, the amount of actual animation seems to have decreased. Characters will sometimes shift forward without moving their limbs, and the events themselves usually end up as just the characters speaking to one another while standing. Rin’s breasts do jiggle at every opportunity, but that’s not enough to justify how static a lot of the scenes feel. Especially when the sexual content refuses to give much more than Ui sucking Izumi’s finger or showcasing yet another still-framed picture of the girls as naked as possible. 
 
Speaking of the sexual content, the anime at least (and once again) provides a censored and uncensored version. 
 
Naturally (and once again once again), the uncensored material is the biggest draw of the show and wins out over the censored material. Granted, all that’s really shown are nipples, and the explicit material that’s too tough to cover up with baby chicks is replaced with theatrics that aim for cute, comedic relief. But the crotch shots, despite their perversion, are why the audience are there in the first place, so uncensored is really the only way to go. 
 
The artistry in general still doesn’t impress, but it gets the job done. While the fast-moving backgrounds and the talking-head bubbles are relied on more than usual, Rin and Ui still have their attractive designs, and the silly reactions with the squatter, comedic depictions of the characters invites the cuteness and the funniness with ease. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
As an ecchi, comedic short, Okusama doesn’t have the character depth that regular dramas tend to include. However, that doesn’t excuse the anime from a lot of choices it makes regarding its cast. 
 
For example, Rin receives a lot more attention this season. Said attention is mostly going towards her chest, but Okusama also highlights her naivety when it comes to love and the difficulty she has in accepting Ui’s working theories on letting lust live. Thus, Rin starts to take part in the lasciviousness, letting Izumi release his pent-up hormones with her breasts or thinking about buying a black bra to satiate Izumi’s own desires. 
 
Yet, during most of Rin’s sexual interactions with Izumi, the outcome is the same: punching him in the face. Despite initiating the situation herself, she’s the one who ends it (often in a violent manner). 
 
To be fair, her even putting herself in those situations is arguably a big step forward for her, considering her role as the head of the disciplinary committee and her previously discussed naivety. But she never truly leaves this quasi state of liking-Izumi-but-not-really. Plus, it gets quite old quite fast to see her stop her progression for the umpteenth time when she was the one to start it in the first place. 
 
Ui and Izumi are no better. Arguably, they are worse. 
 
As a (supposed) couple, they don’t have very many scenes together. With Rin refusing to go away, the introduction of Honoka, and the comedy involving the side characters, Ui and Izumi rarely have any alone time. When they finally are alone, they almost never exchange words of love or commitment, and the relationship they do share does not rise above friends with benefits. 
 
It gets worse. Looking at Ui and Izumi individually, they don’t help themselves or each other. 
 
Ui constantly lets Izumi take part in situations with the other characters that will inevitably become sexually charged. She either has no idea, is oblivious, or, worst of all, simply doesn’t care. 
 
Izumi is similar. His instincts will eventually control him if pushed to his absolute limit, but these moments are rather uncommon. Sometimes, he himself won’t let their relationship move forward, like when he “has to go to the bathroom” when Ui says right to his face how she won’t run away from him, readying herself to kiss him outright. 
 
As for everyone else, Okusama should get some credit for providing its side characters with a moment or two to shine. Ayane gets to see what it is like to have a boyfriend, Karen learns to not hate Izumi’s guts as much, and Honoka creates some scenarios for Izumi, Ui, and Rin to comingle within. 
 
But even this credit is difficult to see as a positive when one realizes that they are also getting in the way of what is supposed to be a “marriage” between Ui and Izumi. Ayane gets somewhat tacked on as last-ditch option for Izumi, Karen’s episode doesn’t incorporate Ui to any large extent, and Honoka comes off as an unnecessary addition to the cast when she barely contributes to the plot besides snapping a few phots here and there. 
 
Again, Okusama isn’t a “deep” anime, and the sole reason for watching it is to see some occasional boobies, so a lot of these gripes are “pointless.” Still, when the anime is arguably an anime about Ui and Izumi, and what’s presented is anything but, the show does not do itself any favors. 
 
SOUND 
 
The opening track and the ending track are (understandably) small pieces that help to set the tone for Okusama. 
 
The OP uses piano and drums to create a fast beat with a sense of nostalgia, but the grating instrumental in the background is way too distracting no matter how many bells go off. The ED is even shorter than the OP (twenty seconds versus thirty seconds), but it stands as the better of the two thanks to its happier feeling through blaring trumpets. Also, letting the voice actresses for Ui, Rin, and Honoka sing their own versions of the ED gives it more variety than its OP counterpart. 
 
These voice actresses are Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Sora Tokui (respectively). While Ms. Tokui does not have any notable scenes, Ms. Taketatsu knows how to pout, Ms. Tsuda has the authoritative drive, and the two can moan when needed. 
 
(And a small shout-out to the talking hormones, condoms, and erections that supported the show in comedic fashion.) 
 
The rest of the original soundtrack remains the same as the first season. A light piano backs the romantic scenes and steps along for the sillier ones. And a nice acoustic guitar accompanies the quieter, simpler times. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Once again, I find myself conflicted over an anime. 
 
On the one hand, it’s frustrating to watch many of the scenes play out when they almost always conclude with some interruption or unnatural shove in the opposite direction. A lot of this interrupting and shoving derives from Rin, but Ui is no better when she fails to make any significant strides due to her odd choices. To be fair, Izumi is just as much at fault with everything as these two, but he at least has the excuse that he’s at their mercy most of the time. 
 
On the other hand, I like both girls. Ui has the caring personality that I find very attractive, and Rin has the bombshell looks that get my head turning. Ui made me laugh with her huge pouts, Rin had me smiling at her blushes, and the two together were no doubt arousing when it came to their ecchi escapades (even if they weren’t exactly novel). 
 
I want to like this one more than I do, but the anime makes it hard to do so. The show should just go all the way in one direction with either Rin or Ui. Enough of the back-and-forth, maybe-maybe-not wishy-washiness. Because the anime is cute and funny and arousing – but it just doesn’t know what it ultimately wants to be. 
 
Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! ends up worse off than its previous season. Further deviation from its marriage motif, less animation, and not enough focus on Ui and Izumi are its biggest mistakes. Its art and music remain consistent, but it’s a show that one will part with long before death. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, constant refusal to let events play out and even more unnecessary “polygamy” entirely defeat the purpose of the narrative 
 
Animation: Fine, while less movement occurs, the uncensored material and the comedic portrayals keep the visuals both alluring and fun 
 
Characters: Terrible, Ui and Izumi’s relationship goes nowhere as they and those around them impede their progress without fail 
 
Sound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Fine, Rin and Ui are likable, but having both together only makes things unlikable 
 
Final Score: 3/10

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to tits the anime! Are you a filthy cave dwelling otaku who wants to watch a bunch of high school girls with large breasts swarm over one guy like moths to a flame without having any personality while at the same time remaining stagnant throughout the show? Then this is the anime for you! 
 
To be perfectly honest this show lacks substance of any kind. It's a very basic ecchi show about a couple of high school students who are 'married' and live under the same roof together and hang out with their friends. Scenarios ensue in which the girls are either forced to remove as much clothing as possible or they find themselves in a situation in which they're groped by our main protagonist. That's it! It feels like a heavily condensed To-Love Ru. The characters don't really go through any development arcs and the story remains incredibly linear and dull. None of the characters feel as if they've grown all too much throughout the series either and it remains a very forgettable throughout. 
 
""But LIQ, you cynical ass-hole, you hate everything anyway. Besides the seven minute length time doesn't allow for character development!!!1"" 
To that, I say you're half right (the ass-hole part anyway). However in regards to the second half, Space Patrol Luluco was also a seven minute anime but that show managed to do a whole of a lot more than this one while having fun and interesting characters with an actual over-arching story line so there is no excuse. This anime has no development of characters or narrative and is instead just a show in which borders on hentai without having any hentai at all. It's just an excuse to showcase a bunch of tits with nothing else and if that's the shows main purpose than I guess it achieved. The characters themselves could invoke a laugh or a smile out of me and I acknowledge that but you have to bust out the scale of justice to determine the shows worth and I can't help but rate this any higher since there are other shows of the same nature doing it much better. This show is vapid and has no substance nor did I have any fun while watching it. I found many of the characters to be either beyond annoying and every single one of these characters are the exact same in other shows done to a better effect. 
 
To be fair they do attempt some character growth and development but it's not really much and is not given nearly enough time to develop or to flesh out characters since the show seems to need to fill a quota of stuffing about three hundred shots of tits and asses in our faces in the span of seven minutes. 
 
The animation was pretty consistent and the character designs themselves were pretty good too so I can at least recommend this to people on a superficial level if they want to waste a little bit of time watching some guy grope some tits and the such but, to me, this always came across as a cock tease. If you really like ecchi shows then I'd say give it a shot but for everyone else I wouldn't waste your time on it. If you really want some tits go watch Kill la Kill or even better, a hentai!

       Helpful This is the BEST ecchi anime I have ever seen, and trust me I have seen many. Good opening, wide variety of characters and superb ecchi scenes make it a must watch. The main advantage of this anime is that each episode is only 8 minutes long.  
 
One of the rare anime which delivers what it promises. 
ALL types of girls including tsundere , deredere , loli etc are included! 
 
It also has a decent story and some scenes will make you unable to contain your laughter. 
 
The ending episode is extremely good and will leave a warm feeling in your heart. 
 
I recommend you to not think much and just ignore the rating and watch it, cause such anime are very hard to find!

       Helpful i really enjoyed the series i just wish that they would confess or something. i feel like both the boys have a thing for kirarin so it just really annoying when they keep ignoring it   
 
i really loved the art and the looks but after about 100 episodes it suddenly looked all different i is just terrible they don't move properly and they aren't clear it hurts to watch, it's overall an okay series but not worth getting all exited over 
 
ithis series is just like any idol series: clumsy girl very different but in some weird way manages to get everyone on her side no matter what 


          
 
       Helpful Ah, how nostalgic. I was just looking through my anime list one fine day, and a wave of nostalgia hit me as I saw the title of this series.  
 
Storywise, Kirarin Revolution isn't really that spectacular. The series itself was cliche and you could just about guess what was going to happen next. [ Though I admit I had fun guessing what they would say next, it kept me amused ] It has a very simple and easy-to-understand plot as well. If you are planning to sit back and enjoy a story full of complex twist and turns, you're in for a letdown. That isn't to say that the series wasn't interesting,  
 
The art was.. better than an average anime, but not excellent either. It was good enough to enjoy, and not have your eyes burn out in horror whenever you see the characters.  
 
The sound.. well, it was fairly enjoyable. I don't know why, but I kind of enjoyed the first opening. I skipped all of the openings after that however - they hurt my ears. The sounds during the show were fairly repetitive.. 
 
The characters were one of the good points of the show. I'm not talking about the main character, Kirari - she remains painfully cute and annoying throughout - well, but since I don't want to spoil you, you'll just have to trust me in saying that the characters were one of the better aspects. 
 
Why did i enjoy this show so much? The comedy, and the plain idiocy of Kirari and Seiji were just too painful to watch; I nearly cracked my ribs laughing. Don't get be wrong, I meant it in a good way. Naa-san, the cat -and also the most intelligent creature in the series- amused me to no end as well. 
 
Overall, if you're looking for a playful and enjoyable series, this is for you. But if you're looking for one with a serious plot and so on, you're best avoiding Kirarin Revolution at all costs.  
 
Also : I dropped the series because at a certain episode (103 or 104 maybe?) the animation changed to 3D and I just couldn't stand watching it any longer.Which is a shame, because I wanted to stay to see how it turned out.

He does battle with it in a prideful battle of revenge. This Special is actually a flashback of previous episodes in Bleach. After the ending credits, a short plays showing Shinigami and their Zanpakutos to ""Number One"" from the Bleach Soundtrack.  
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","The series adapts Kubo's manga with the main story arcs and introduces anime exclusive ones. In Karakura Town, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki becomes a substitute Soul Reaper (死神, Shinigami, literally, ""Death God""), when Rukia Kuchiki risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although initially reluctant to accept their responsibility, he takes her place, and during this time they discover that a few classmates are spiritually aware and have their own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses spiritual particles, Orihime Inoue has a group of protective spirits called Shun Shun Rikka and Yasutora Sado (""Chad"") has strength equal to the Hollows encased in his arm.
When Rukia is sentenced to death for transgressions in the human world and sent to the Soul Society, Ichigo meets Kisuke Urahara and Yoruichi Shihōin, who unbeknownst to him are two exiled Soul Reapers, to allow himself and his friends to save Rukia. After this, it is revealed that ex-squad captain Sōsuke Aizen framed Rukia for the crime and has been illegally experimenting on Soul Reapers and Hollows. Aizen plans to conquer the Soul Society by using the Hōgyoku, a legendary powerful substance turning Hollows into half Soul Reapers. After faking his death and his reappearance caused a fight with some people, Aizen escapes into Hueco Mundo, the realm of Hollows, and later kidnaps Orihime as she is instrumental in creating the Oken, a power that will allow him to kill the Soul King, the ruler of the Soul Society.
After being trained by the Vizards, other exiled Soul Reapers and the victims of Aizen's experiment, Ichigo and his friends travel into Hueco Mundo. Facing a group of Arrancars, who are Hollows given Soul Reaper abilities, led by an elite group known as the Espadas, which are composed of ten Arrancars with exemplary strength. Espadas serve as commanders in Aizen's army and each has the factions of weaker Arrancars. Along with Aizen, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, the Espada as a group possess comparable strength to Soul Reaper captains. After rescuing Orihime, Aizen reveals her kidnapping was a distraction to allow him to take Karakura Town, as its spiritual energy is what is needed for the Oken. After being trained by his father Isshin, another exiled Soul Reaper, Ichigo sacrifices his power to seal Aizen away when the Hōgyoku rejects its master, and the Soul Reapers defeat the Espadas. Months later, Chad and the members reveal themselves as Fullbringers in a group called Xcution. They can give up their powers to restore other ones and they plan on doing so for Ichigo, who uses the power of Fullbringer. However, it is all a ruse by their leader Kugo Ginjo, a Fullbringer and former Substitute Soul Reaper, to extract his powers and empower all of them. Ichigo has his Soul Reaper powers restored, when he gains his trust from the Soul Society. After helping other Soul Reapers defeat Ginjo's team, Ichigo resumes his duty as a Substitute Soul Reaper.
Several anime exclusive story arcs are introduced during the series. The first arc focuses on the Bount, a group of spiritual humans who are immortal longer by stealing souls. Their leader, Jin Kariya, seeks to destroy the Soul Society in revenge. However, Ichigo and his allies defeat them. The second arc focuses on Shūsuke Amagai, a Soul Reaper captain replacing Ichimaru. Amagai seeks revenge against Captain Yamamoto for the death of his father and uses the clan's forbidden experiment. However, Amagai realizes his mistake and kills himself. The third arc features the evil Zanpakutō spirit Muramasa, who turns itself and other ones into spiritual beings to take revenge on the Soul Society for imprisoning its master Kōga Kuchiki. After succeeding, he is double-crossed and transforms into a monstrous creature that Ichigo defeats, but after Muramasa reveals the intention was to have Soul Reapers and Zanpakutō communicate on equal terms. The fourth and final arc features an event in which Kagerōza Inaba creates modified copies of all Soul Reapers in Reigai bodies. He attempts to fuse with Nozomi Kujō into an original being Ōko Yushima. However, Nozomi sacrifices herself to defeat Inaba and Ichigo loses his power.
","I voted everything a 4. 
 
I gave it a 4 because this was pointless and don't eve waste your time watching it. This part is just in the anime and it beats me why I wasted 20 minutes watching something i've already seen in the anime. Some OVA. 
 
In the anime and manga though this part gets a 10. 
 
Bleach rocks, so i'll give it a 6.

          
 
       Helpful This review is going to be a little different then my other ones. If one is looking for a completle remake of the original, this isn't it. This has only a few minor changes and a few minor additions. There was a little more character development and it focused more on a small plot line. One HAS to watch it to figure out if they like it or not really, but hopefully what I've said above will help make up ones mind to watch it or not.

          
 
       Helpful Well First off i'm gonna say that this OVA: Memories in the Rain was made as a pilot before bleach was ever aired. It comprises of parts from episodes 7, 8 and 9 with alterations of course, it's more true to the manga which is a plus. 
 
So don't get it into your head like some of the other reviewers that this is an addition to the main series of Bleach. 
 
The art and sound are a step up from the series which is good to note; nice background music and clearer and more defined animation. 
 
Also the seiyuu of Kon is Tite Kubo the creator of Bleach and the ending theme 'Memories in the Rain' is sung by the seiyuu's of Ichigo and Rukia. 
 
Their is more emphasis on the story line and character development than usual which is probably due to the 3 episodes condensed into one slightly longer episode which in my opinion was a good idea. 
 
I enjoyed this OVA and prefer it to eps 7, 8 and 9 as quality over quantity is what i like in anime.

However, Tsutomu has been gaining popularity, especially with the girls, because he seems to resemble a popular vocalist from a band and somehow, Mikako begins to see him in a different light.

I will edit it eventuality when start watching it again. And to be honest despite how much the characters may annoy me the show itself is actually pretty good. I suggest giving it a go 
 
 
Story 
  
Mikako has a crush on her childhood friend Yamaguchi Tsutom. She ends up heartbroken because her love ended when it just started. She found out he got a girlfriend. Trying to forget about all of this she decided to from a circle who participates in flea markets.   
 
First episode is boring but this anime is actually slowly growing on me. I did like it a bit until the characters started to annoy me which I will explain later.  
 
Art  
 
That art is kind of weird at the start but you will just get use to it. It not so bad that it takes away from the experience. I had no problems at all wth the art.  
 
Sound 
 
Like everyone says this is a great aspect of this show. They chose the prefect songs to play at the perfect times. No of the songs feel out of place and it just brings you into the moment also ageing sure to have variety. (some would argue they use it quite a bit though)  
 
Character  
 
I really hate Mikako. Her jealously is ridiculous. oh no somebody is dating the one I like so of course she's a bitch. when in actuality she is a pretty nice girl. So many times she has said nasty things about her. She even throws a slap at the boy because she saw them kissing. She doesn't even have a right to slap him like that since she isn't his girlfriend. I admit she does try her best to get over him and get rid of all this jealously but it doesn't really work.  
 
Although I do love her red hair friend and thank her for being the voice of reason. I can't stand it when occasionally she acts like the two are going to get together like it's already guarnteered.  
 
In fact I don't know whats the point in even making the boy look like a celebrity. It's not like he enters show business or anything. They could have just added good looks and be done with it if they wanted a reason why girls would like him so much.  
 
Good things about the character is that they all have their own dreams and ambitions in life.  
 
Enjoyment  
 
if it wasn't for the characters and things I mentioned up above I would have actually enjoyed it way more  
 
I do not hate this show but there were just some things that were to hard to ignore  
 
Girlfriend does have a personality but ever since she started dating it's just ''hey let's hang out and shop'' they don't even brother letting her say anything else when she had the potential to be interesting 

          
 
       Helpful I might as well write a review of this anime since I was the one who provided (most of) the raws, translated it and reviewed each episode at least three times before it was released, which in my opinion counts for at least something.   
 
Well, as much as I am loathed to put labels on what are clearly three-dimensional characters, here we have a show where Ai Yazawa pretty much presented us with what could be a psychological profile of a tsundere before such a term even came to existence. She's brassy, full of herself and can sometimes be unfairly cruel, but that is just a front she she feels she has to put up in order to shield her vulnerable side. 
 
Yes, it would be convenient to say Mikako is the way she is because of the childhood trauma of a divorce (and what her Mom did afterwards). But alas, the reason behind her disagreeable personality is artistically anticlimatic.  That is simply the way she is, as is evident from the flashbacks from her childhood and later when she becomes ""honest with herself."" This is the place where I feel the anime succeeds because we  become too used to seeing the lead female character who is cutesy, klutsy, timid, moe or whatever stereotype that is supposed to appeal to the regular anime audience. She is truly one of the more variated full-rounded characters you'd find in any narrative. 
 
The main drawback from this show, like a lot of the shoujo anime that aired around that time (Marmalade Boy, Kodocha) is the number of episodes.  I really believe they could have more effectively told the story that they presented if they instead aired around half the episodes.  Of course I am talking about filler episodes that sometimes introduced inconsistencies (***spoiler****e.g. why would Mikako be unable to sell her wrong-sized clothes at the second flea market if she was able to sell out all those exact same clothes at the first flea market?***spoiler***), but that is a minor quibble compared to the parade of episodes that occupied the middle featuring a love triangle between three supporting characters. They could have easily settled that matter in a handful of episodes, but they stretched it out over at least ten episodes, padding those with situations based on uselessly masochistic self-abnegations so contrived that my suspension of disbelief almost never recovered. 
 
But thankfully, it didn't overtake the main story of the show, which was the real draw in the first place.  It's clear the creator had a lot of fun with her inaugural anime adaptation and it shows through her somewhat unconventional artwork and character designs. The whole thing sort of reminds me of ""Doug"". The animation certainly shows its age, although it's pretty solid for what was shown at the time.  For those who are expecting the quality put into Yazawa's other two animes by Madhouse Studio, be warned that you've been spoiled. 
 
The music, mostly provided by Mikako's seiyuu Rumi Shishido might be an acquired taste for some (for those who don't like unsteady singing voices),  but it grows on you, at least it did for me. The story, as long as it focuses on the two main characters, is pretty solid-grade work as it navigates you through the ups and downs of a teenage girl trying to cope with her contrary personality.  As for enjoyment - well I wouldn't have spent at least 62 total hours going over the series if I didn't enjoy it. So in the end it would have received a higher grade for the story and characterization if it weren't for the mostly repetitive fillers.

          
 
       Helpful I started watching this because I am a fan of Yazawa Ai. I was so happy to know that she has done a number of manga's and anime's other than NANA or Paradise Kiss. I loved Paradise Kiss so much but did not know that it is a sequel of Neighborhood Story or Gokinjo Monogatari. I had to rewatch it because Mikako, Tsutomu, Rika and Norijii were all in Paradise Kiss. I love how the character's Yazawa creates are all in the same dimension because you really feel like your favorite characters are getting older but still living their lives as if they are real people. Such uniqueness from Yazawa.  
 
Now I wasn't too thrilled with seeing the opening of this anime because it looks so old, the characters are drawn in a funny way, none of the female characters have boobs and the music was kind of blah. But, somehow, you get hooked on the show and start to enjoy it without realizing. 
 
Story (9) 
Story is great. I love that everyone is in a Art school. Each character has goals and aspirations that are different from typical anime out here so I enjoyed that. Also because I can relate to most of the characters as well. Mikako wants to have her own brand and sell her handmade clothes. Her friends study, work hard and make everything that they by hand to sell at the flee market. It just goes to show that hard work really pays off! There's a lot of love triangles that takes place in this anime. It might become too much at times but just follow along. Great story. You see the characters unfold when the time is right and you get to learn a lot from this anime too. 
 
Art (7) 
Of course the art isn't all that great but it doesn't matter because the story and plot is what keeps you watching. Also, I realized that even though the females are drawn a certain way and don't seem to have womanly features such as breasts, hips and thighs, they are still beautiful in their own way. Especially with the several fashion ideas and clothes they wear. I kind of liked that because you don't have to draw a busty woman just to make her look sexy. It's all about the personality of the person, or in this case, the characters.  
 
Sound (7) 
Many of you aren't going to like the music. it took me awhile to get used to it but I grew to like it. 
 
Character (9) 
I love the characters mainly because it's a creation of Yazawa Ai. But also since I am a big NANA lover, i like to think that Mikako is Hachi and Risa is Nana, Risa's boyfriend is Ren and Yuusuke is Takumi.. But that's just me and my fantasies lol I grew to love all the characters even though some of them annoyed me. Mikako annoyed me through half of the show because she is actually a tsundere character to the fullest. But I learned to appreciate and love her and her personality because most girls go through the same feelings and thoughts. Everyone has thought of something that isn't true or loved a person so much but couldn't tell him so you be mean to them for no reason. Or when you see your lover talking to someone else you get jealous. Mikako goes through so many emotions that you learn to love because she is like most people, even yourself. There's a lot of ups and downs in this anime and in the end, it will be all worth it. 
 
Enjoyment (9) 
I enjoyed this very much. I liked the story, I liked the characters, I like how creative everything is and the journey of a young girl trying to sell her fashion brand clothes, with the conflicts of relationships and family. Yet she still tries her best to become successful. Her and everyone else in her group. It's a bitter sweet kind of anime. The one thing I hate about this anime is the filler episodes and the constant flashbacks. Sometimes it would be so long and so repetitive that it can take up half of an episode! So, its ok when you know when to skip a few minutes but all in all its a pretty good watch. 
 
Overall (9) 
I was going to rate it a 7 at first but after finishing the show and looking back on it, the story was really great. Especially for an anime back in the 90s with a story like this. I really enjoyed it and to everyone that has seen Paradise Kiss, please watch this anime and watch Paradise Kiss again. You will enjoy it 10xs more because now you fully understand each character and the message being sent about women, aspirations and goals, and conflict with love and family. Thank You.

I really liked the characters. Their pretty basic, and not alot of character development is done, since this was only one episode. 
 
For enjoyment purposes, I think it great. A bit fanservicey at times, but thats not really much of problem. If one can throw away their seriousness and let loose that part of them that longs to be a true hero of justice then you can join be for a ride! 
 
Thats my two cents and I sticking with it.

6,9254,85,6.168649944,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Mianhada Saranghanda,"When hit KBS drama I'm Sorry, I Love You aired in 2004, it recorded high TV ratings, won the acclaim of critics, and quickly became one of the flagbearers of the Korean Wave. The tragic love story of Mu Hyeok (So Ji Sub of What Happened in Bali) and Eun Chae (Yim Soo Jung of Lump Sugar and I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK) made stars out of its leads and attracted an enormous fanbase throughout Asia. Two years later, G&G Entertainment released a 35-minute animated version of the drama, Between of One Year, consisting of highlights from the drama and new scenes dealing with the final moments of Eun Chae and Mu Hyeok's relationship. The script was supervised by the writer of the original live-action drama, Lee Kyung Hee.",['Drama'],"Cha Moo-hyuk is a part-time scam artist working the streets of Australia. He was abandoned by his parents as a child and adopted by a couple in Australia. However, he was mistreated by his foster parents and thus roams the streets, cheating tourists out of their money. It is through one of these scams that he bumps into Song Eun-chae.
Eun-chae is the fashion coordinator and childhood friend of famous Korean singer, Choi Yoon. She sees Yoon as her life's focal point and does everything she can to please him. Yoon visits Melbourne, Australia to do a photoshoot with another famous Korean actress, Kang Min-joo. Yoon asks Eun-chae to get him close to Min-joo. It breaks Eun-chae's heart but she does so. One day, Eun-chae's luggage and money are stolen by the same band of criminals as Moo-hyuk.
Tired, hungry and helpless, she wanders the streets until she bumps into Moo-hyuk who, moved by her plight, manages to find the stuff stolen by his gang and return it to her. She returns to Korea and bumps into Min-joo and Yoon, who are now a couple.
Several weeks later, Moo-hyuk receives an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. At the wedding, he is accidentally shot twice in the head when someone attempts an assassination on his ex-girlfriend's husband. The doctor saves him but can only remove one bullet. The remaining bullet is lodged too deeply and cannot be surgically removed. It's killing him, and he has no longer than a year to live. Guilt-stricken, his ex-girlfriend gives him a stash of cash and tells him to go back to his native Korea to find his birth parents. He does so, and finds out that his mother is famous Korean actress, Audrey. Her son is Choi Yoon and both mother and son are adored by the public.
Moo-hyuk can't help but feel betrayed because his mother is doing so well in life, whilst he was suffering and has little time left. He vows revenge and starts by getting close to Yoon, becoming his road manager. He plots to bring Yoon and his mother down, but also falls in love with Eun-chae. Yoon becomes injured in a car accident; he will die without a heart transplant. Moo-hyuk is suddenly faced with the decision of saving his brother or letting him die as revenge.
Moo-hyuk finds out that his mother did not abandon him. His mother had an affair with a married man, and Audrey's parents instructed Eun-chae's father (then Audrey's chauffeur) to give away Moo-hyuk and his twin sister as soon as they were born. Audrey was not cognizant of the fact that she had given birth to twins, and was simply told that her child had died. Eun-chae's father thought he was ""saving"" Audrey's reputation. Audrey had adopted Yoon in memory of her son.
Eun-chae's father admits to the truth and tells him he is willing to accept any punishment. Moo-hyuk tells Eun-chae's father that one day he will receive a punishment.
Moo-hyuk kills himself in a motorcycle accident so that his heart can be transplanted into Yoon. Before his death, he calls Eun-chae and tells her, ""I'm sorry. I love you."" His heart is given to Yoon, who makes a full recovery. One year later, a heartbroken Eun-chae goes to Melbourne and to his grave, and dies next to it with a small red bottle, leading the viewer to believe she committed suicide by drinking poison. This is the punishment that Eun-chae's father receives - the death of his own daughter.
","I liked this anime, but I recommend everyone to watch the Korean Drama before watching.  
 
This anime summarized the plot using overall 30 mins when the Korean Drama is 16 episodes so it might be hard to see/understand what is going on.  
 
It indeed skipped a lot of scenes from the original. 
 
It has a lot of sadness and overall great music in the story and in the credits. The art is nice so are the characters (if you understand the plot).  
 
If you like short anime like this or a shorter story instead of the Korean Drama I do recommend you watching it.  Especially since Korean anime are so rare.

","Second Review. (I think I might make this a hobby) 
 
To be honest I thought the anime of Gravitation, was just poor. It was obnoxious, and way too irritating. I barely got through it. Thirteen episodes was more than enough for me. And although most of my friends tell me to watch the OVA’s.. I have no motivation to do so, that is how bad the anime was. 
 
The characters had very little development, they stayed the same throughout. For example the main one remained obnoxious and kind of naïve. It’s a very typical shounen-ai. Cheesy, with no twists, and absolutely no real plot development. Most fans of this anime are indeed female, but only because it is classified as cute.  
 
Guess when I’m looking for shounen-ai, or more so yaoi. I should look for more serious things, and less cute. A tease and a waste of time. As harsh as that sounds. :(  
 
The only thing I can really commend it for, is the music. It has decent music, and voice overs. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful okay~ gravitation. 
 
i was buying DVDs one day and stumbled upon this one. seriously, i did NOT know it was shounen ai. it must have been fate that brought us together :) 
better that i said it earlier, it was shounen ai, not yaoi. (aww, makes me sad) 
 
plot: 8/10 
i found the story cool actually. i mean a writer falls in love with a singer? that isn't one thing you'd see in everyday life. but when the story gets a move i found myself bored because of the love-hate relationship. sort of like taming a dog using the candy and whip. but the latter part was a surprise :) 
 
art: 8/10 
the art is good enough for what it's worth, which pretty much means... uhm. if you've seen sukisho, it's kind of like of the same level, only with darker shades and cruder details. but if you haven't, i think it is safe to say that the art is ""cute"". haha. ugh. words fail me. 
 
sound: 9/10 
since the main character is a singer, then expect songs! but not too much amount of songs. haha. yeah. just right. i didn't placed much attention to the seiyuus so, sorry about that. but the bg music doesn't affect much. 
 
characters: 9/10 
i don't have anything much to say about the characters. i didn't like yuki's (seme) temper =__= i found myself shocked whenever he turns cold towards shuuichi. but i couldn't bring myself to hate him because he says too much pick up lines. haha. shuuichi is your average clingy uke. 
 
enjoyment: 8/10 
well, it kept me pretty well entertained for the time being. i wanted more action actually. =__= but it provided more fluff. haha. i think it's good for those who cannot handle yaoi but likes shounen ai. 
 
overall: 8/10 
compared to other shounen ai anime i've seen, this is probably one of the best. there are only a handful of such anime, so i'd recommend it to those who likes shounen ai. i'm influenced heavily by the art and story so no surprise about that :) 
 
owari :) 


          
 
       Helpful Is Gravitation one of my favourite animes of all time? Yes 
Is it good? No. 
Honestly if you're looking for some good ol' shonen-ai, look no further. The relationship between Yuki and Shuichi is pretty cookie cutter stuff- but the fact that this was written in the nineties makes it a bit more special. It actually does tackle some tough subjects like homophobia and sexual harassment but not well enough for it to be actually commendable. At least it isn't glorifying rape (*cough cough* koisuru boukun) And I have to admit... They're pretty cute. 
Like sure, Shuichi Shindou is really, REALLY annoying but he's also like, my dumbass son that I have to watch mess up ALL THE TIME.  
Yuki Eiri is the usual emotionally stunted seme that smokes cigarettes yada yada yada 
This series shines through on it's darker parts and it had me at the edge of my seat at times. Yuki's character development was really interesting and seeing him being vulnerable in front of Shuichi made me go AAAAAAAAAAAAA 
Likes; It's very enjoyable, the nineties nostalgia is kind of nice, the opening is pretty catchy, I liked the whole fame edge it had to it 
Dislikes; I can't blame the bad animation on time, it's not great even for 2000- I also think that some of the serious moments were ruined by dumb stuff that was supposed to lighten the mood JUST GIVE ME GAY ANGST DAMMIT 
 
Anyway watch Gravitation- it isn't good but hoo boy is it fun to watch

6,743,87,6.127351439,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Umi ga Kikoeru,"Ocean Waves is a high school love story set in Kochi, Japan. Morisaki Taku and Matsuno Yutaka are best friends when a girl from Tokyo named Muto Rikako transfers to their school. Excluding herself from group activities, she's eventually labeled a snob. Matsuno has a crush on Rikako, so it's no surprise that he gets a little jealous when Morisaki and Rikako start spending more time together. The rumors around school get worse, but Morisaki still insists there is nothing between him and Rikako. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","In Kōchi, Taku Morisaki receives a call from his friend, Yutaka Matsuno, asking to meet at their high school. He finds Yutaka with an attractive female transfer student, Rikako Muto, whom Yutaka was asked to show around. Rikako is academically gifted and good at sports, but also arrogant. Taku believes she is unhappy about leaving Tokyo.
On a school trip to Hawaii, Rikako asks Taku to lend her money, as she has lost her own. As Taku has a part-time job, he lends her ¥60,000. Promising to repay him, she warns him not to tell anyone.
Back in Kōchi, the third year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako has not returned Taku's money and he wonders if she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretense of a concert trip, only to discover that their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money. He races to the airport.
Rikako's father thanks Taku, repays the loan and arranges a room at the Hyatt Regency. Rikako explains that when her parents were fighting, she had always sided with her father, but had now discovered he was not on her side. Taku offers his bed and attempts to sleep in the bathtub. The next morning, Rikako kicks Taku out so that she can change clothes to meet a friend for lunch. Taku wanders around the city. After catching up on sleep at the hotel, Taku receives a call from Rikako asking to be rescued from her former boyfriend, Okada.
Back home, Rikako ignores Taku, but tells her friends that they spent a night together. Taku confronts Rikako in class for hurting his best friend. She responds by slapping him and he slaps her in return.
The autumn school cultural festival arrives and Rikako becomes more distant from the other girls, many of whom openly dislike her. Taku sees Rikako defend herself from another student who tries to assault her. Taku comments that he is impressed with the way she handled herself. She slaps him but runs away with regret. Yutaka punches Taku to the ground, calls him an idiot, and walks away. None of the three talks to each other for the rest of the year.
Taku, Yutaka, and Yumi reconnect at a class reunion several years later. Rikako does not attend. While reminiscing about school, Yutaka comments that that the reason he punched Taku was because he was angry that Taku had held off on pursuing Rikako because of Rikako's mistreatment of Yutaka (and Yutaka's unrequited love for her). He was angry his friend had foregone a beautiful possibility on his account. The two watch the sun set and the ocean waves. Later, however, when Taku glimpses Rikako from across a platform, he realizes that he had always been in love with her. Rikako sees him and he smiles.
","This is a very slow uneventful movie, it shows their high school lives in great detail really well. Like how the students reacted when a school trip was cancelled, or the everyday intereractions and bullying at school. There were certainly interesting events like a sudden trip to Tokyo, and lots of slapping. The start of the movie very little happens. Although the movie picks up the pace when Rikako asks Taku for money, which leads to a series of events.  
 
However the characters are not very likeable. The main character Taku, he does some incredibly stupid things that make him unlikeable, Rikako is a more interesting character especially when we learn more about her parents and what life was like for her before going to her current school. Excluding Rikako all the characters seem rather one dimensional, like Taku’s friend who seems to be a nice guy and that’s it, while Taku is both nice and stupid at times.  
 
The film also lacks a clear sense of direction, a purpose. The film shows the scenes about Taku and Rikako, and their high school lives, and that's it. Although it does reflect their high school experience reasonably well. It also results in a film that can feel rather too slow at times. 
 
The music choice, especially the main theme is odd and doesn't suit the moment. It uses a ringtone like theme which sounds out of place. The animation is very simple and suits the film well. 
 
This film reflects the characters’ high school life well, although it's unlikeable characters and barely existent plot makes this a disappointing viewing for a Studio Ghibli film. 
 
Constructive feedback is appreciated :) 


          
 
       Helpful Jesus. I thought the general consensus that this was one of Ghibli's worst features would be an exaggeration, but that description is spot on. Usually I only do reviews of anime when I care enough to do a full analysis, but that isn't the case here. I'm just disappointed enough to write a quick summary, especially after seeing a flurry of reviews claiming that this movie isn't as bad as other people seem to think. 
 
Even though I respect your opinion if you think that this movie is ""good"" or maybe even ""great"", having that thought after watching this movie is something that I find unfathomable. I think that Ocean Waves rightfully deserves the reputation it has and is one of the most aggravating film experiences that I've had to sit through in a while. 
 
ART: 
 
Nothing to critique here; typical early Ghibli style and charm. 
 
SOUND: 
 
The score is forgettable at best and off-putting at worst. Some scenes were coupled with undeserved orchestral swells that made moments feel even more artificial or exasperating than they already were. Voice acting was good for main characters but occasionally spotty for the supporting cast. 
 
CHARACTER and STORY: 
 
Here we go. If you don't already know this movie's reputation, viewers tend to hate the female lead, Rikako. I had seen this trend before watching the movie and was fully prepared to disagree with or at least criticize that line of thinking. ""She can't be that bad,"" I thought. ""Surely some people just don't understand her motivations or are blowing her personality out of proportion. Right?"" 
 
Boy was I wrong. Not only do I completely agree with this sentiment, but as of now, she is one of the most unlikable characters I have ever been forced to watch. I've seen non-villains and villains alike in movies, people who are antagonistic scumbags that have committed atrocities and all kinds of abominable actions, yet they all seem more human than the self-centered, deceitful, underdeveloped Rikako. As the movie goes on, she only continues to grow more inhuman, irritating and repugnant. 
 
""But that's the point. This is a story of a girl tearing two best friends apart and the struggles of youth. That's why it's a drama."" 
 
Is that really the point though? Cause I don't think so, and it doesn't seem like the writers thought that either.  
 
Romance is also listed in the tags, and that seems to be what the story is shooting for, especially with how the movie ends...except that no one in their right mind would find this movie romantic, nor is the romance given proper development or a conclusion. In fact, the romance doesn't even really begin, it's just implied within the last minutes of the film. If you tried to tell me that this was a romance movie before I looked at its Wikipedia and MAL pages, I would've laughed in your face. 
 
The story and ""romance"" in this movie consists of Rikako being a selfish, manipulative, uncaring asshole and two guys falling in love with her anyway. Her motivations for being an asshole are cliche (you could probably guess them without watching the movie) and never justified. We are given some superficial dialogue about why she turned out this way and then the movie expects us to somehow forgive her for being such a terrible character, even when none of the reasons for her actions are resolved or acknowledged in a meaningful manner. 
 
The two male leads are flat and one-dimensional. Not only do they have seemingly no reason to love her (besides the fact that she is attractive) but the movie doesn't even attempt for either of them to get close to her in any significant way. She uses Taku and then abandons him just as quickly. Yutaka tries to befriend her and fails miserably. This is somehow enough to make the friendship between Taku and Yutaka fall apart.  
 
The movie's third act is short and pointless. Taking a walk together is enough to fix Taku and Yutaka's friendship. A reunion at a bar suddenly makes all the character's reveal how they've ""grown"" over their time in college, when really the only character that has developed in any way is an irrelevant girl that was barely in the movie. The rest of the them haven't changed at all. What's even more laughable is that after all the pain she's caused them, Taku realizes at the reunion that he still loves Rikako...for some reason (this is especially hilarious when the only memories that he can recall are of her being an asshole to him). What you're looking at is a movie where almost nothing happens, and what does happen is not justified or impactful in any stretch of the imagination. The melodrama is neither entertaining nor well-executed, and you will leave the movie wondering what the hell you're supposed to take away from this experience. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
A movie hasn't made me this upset in a long time. This is not a feel-good slice of life and it's also not a romance. It's a drama, and it handles that label with extreme laziness and ineptitude. Unlikable characters with nonexistent development. Meandering dialogue. No sense of direction. A rushed ending. I'm not sure if this movie has any positive aspects. What I am sure of is that this movie barely scrapes over the hour mark and it almost feels like two.  
 
The premise is not inherently terrible. Watching a friendship deteriorate due to a manipulative person is a classic plot that could've been handled well, but it doesn't even feel like the focus of this movie; it's just something that happens out of the blue toward the end of the second act. But the romance doesn't feel like the focus of this movie either. So what the hell is the focus of this movie anyway? Rikako being an asshole? Yeah, pretty much. 

          
 
       Helpful Ocean Waves gives the feeling of typical teenagers. Realistic, calming, and understandable. The characters are simple but likable, with each character's point of view touched upon at one point or another during the movie. The story had no particular twists or turns, just a matter of fact- ""this can happen to you"" type feel. I'm personally not a huge fan of the soft, 90's animation style. The characters always seem fuzzy and not as expressive as I'd like, which is why I gave it a 6/10. The OST was fitting for the storyline and allowed for nice visualization. Overall, it was good.

Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don't believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new ""Disco Queen"" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she's too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho's dreams just might come true!",['Shoujo'],none,"I would like to write to you about how Harbor Light is a touching Cinderella-like story where a young girls dreams come true due to her determination and hard work.  I would like to say that Harbor Light is a nostalgic piece that will remind you of the glorious decade of the 80s, where leotards, legwarmers, disco, and the moonwalk reigned supreme.  I can’t say any of those things because this anime sucks. 
 
Whatever you read on MAL regarding this anime plot summery is not accurate.  Yes it’s about a young girl named Miho, you won’t ever forget her name because it’s written on her shirt.  Miho dreams of being a fashion designer but doesn’t get along with her designer Aunt or cousins, well because they are bitches.  Apparently they are resentful because her father left her in their care while he was deployed in the Navy.  I thought it was a great reason too.  The big event in town is a disco dance in which all the lovely ladies will dance the night away in fabulous dresses.  Miho has one cousin who isn’t a complete scumbag and wants her to design a dress for her.  Sounds like a mildly interesting starting point for a story right?  Nope because this is where the story takes a turn for the nonsensical.  The town mayor’s son has returned to town.. from prison I suppose we are lead to believe.  Apparently everything his father does pisses him off but not more than the Disco Queen competition.  He gathers his gang and proceeds to terrorize the town.  Never are we ever given any real explanation for his actions or any resolution to that part of the storyline. 
 
To say that Harbor Lights characters are dull and lethargic would be an understatement.  Miho is boring and uninteresting as a character.  In a lot of ways the way she lives and is treated reminded me of the movie ""The Little Princess"".   She lives in a drab room and his constantly talked down to by her aunt and cousins and forced to do menial tasks and chores.  Her family does some very cruel things to her that seemingly is completely forgotten by the time the anime ends.  She even finds herself treated nicely and living in a beautiful room just in time for her father to return.  It just made me disgusted but seems to be a theme in some anime from this era.  A character will be treated horribly but another and end up being friends with them.  Now while this isn’t a terrible thing, often the things done to them were so horrible that no one with any self respect or esteem would forgive it. The rest of the cast is what truly earns this show the pathetic rating I gave it.  They are all so unlikeable and dull as a group.  None of them stand out at all besides the fact that I hated them. 
 
About the only thing you can say remotely positive (I guess) is if you really want to feel some old nostalgia from the 80s.  I cringed when I looked at the fashions and heard the music.  It brought back memories and stirred old feelings, mostly.. what the hell were we thinking?  If you’re a child of the 80s too and remember any of it then you will probably get some laughs out of it as well.  The art style is as one would expect from this era.  I don’t care for it but this is how anime was drawn so I can’t say it’s really bad. 
 
If you’re thinking about seeing this... don’t.  There is nothing to recommend at all.  I warned you. 


          
 
       Helpful Harbor Light Monogatari - Fashion Lala Yori is a slap in the face to pretty much all common sense in story telling.  From the opening you can tell this anime is having a serious identity crises.  The opening consists of assorted jumble of scenes from 1980’s jazzercise to some really fairly odd science fiction space shots.  This mishmash pretty much sums up a lot of this anime as it tries to mesh together a whole lot of things that just don’t work.  It also features more conflicting moods then a temperamental two year old. 
 
On one hand you have a pseudo Cinderella story about the main character Miho who is living with her ill-tempered Aunt and her three snide cousins while her father is away.  This part of the story seems the most fairly tale like, and with Miho wondering around a seaside town with her dog delivering packages for her Aunt’s business and hoping to make a dress for her one cousin to wear in the upcoming Disco Queen contest.  This part of the anime has an almost dreamy like quality to it and has the most potential to be something cute to bad it's all lost in a giant flushing toilet of bewilderment. 
 
Then there is other plot of the town Mayor’s son coming back into town.  At first he seems the typical bad boy who is just a little rough around the edges and with a soft spot in his heart but then he transforms in to heartless terrorist.  Seriously, I am not kidding!  They bring him in to a place in the story where you think it a might creepy but not insanely out of place (for an anime) love interest for our little Miho, but it just turns out he is a cold hearted bastard and gang leader.  Who was so scared by his father and sister, he now must blow up the town’s Disco Queen Contest.  Really, still not kidding!  His character is never really fleshed out more then that, and what starts out fitting in the dream like quality of the anime ends up being so over the top and out of place it’s just amusing. 
 
There are several other mash ups fitted into this short OVA that never seem to get there fill of screen time.  Several places early on in the story seem like it’s going to take it some where else then it ends up going to, they would have been far nicer places really.  It almost seems like the creators wanted to do a longer story but got stuck with forty-five minutes and decided to fit all the bits and pieces they liked best into it. 
 
The art used in this story is also a jumble of 1980's anime style.  Most of the characters are pretty normal looking with natural hair colors except for Miho's which is purple, uh ok, sure she has the rare purple hair gene.  Style wise though up to a point everyone looks like a normal person from a small town, from the 80's, but still they still conform.  It isn't until the mayor's son picks up his fellow town misfits/terrorists who look like bad rejects from a discarded Streets of Rage game.  Sure they still look 80's but they look more like Fist of the North Star or Mad Max then fitting in a cute story about a young girl who wants to do fashion.  I also have to mention something I really did like was the background art, it was very charming and pleasant feel to it, with lots of nice detail showing the town off.  Sadly it wasn't used in a better anime.  
 
All that being said, I still really enjoyed this anime.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s terrible, it really is, but I couldn’t look away and while I was watching it. It starts out with a kind of cute 1980’s charm but then turns into a insane schizophrenic mess at the end it’s hard to look away.  I can’t recommend this for everyone, but for anyone who likes something that is so bad it’s good, I think they will get great enjoyment out of this.

Except, well, no, not really.  Knowing very little about this OVA from 1988, I suppose it was to kick-start a new 'magical girl' franchise.  But if that was the case, it really didn't take off -- at least not for a FULL decade later, when a short-lived not-really-the-same anime series and manga series came and went without much of a splash in 1998.   
   
Maybe it was because this OVA was pretty bad.  A mayor and his rebellious son clash over a fashion show.  Young little Cinderella...er, I mean Miho...gets caught up in the middle.  Scorned by her older sisters and dreaming of being a fashion designer and model, can this clumsy but strong-headed nine year old suddenly transform into a magical girl, win over the town and save the fashion idol contest?  I think we all know the answer.   
   
Formulaic plot, but the actual story that fills out that plot is nothing to write home about.  The artwork is kinda meh, the dancing scenes are laughably poorly done, the music I don't even remember.  This is a totally forgettable, throwaway OVA.  I mean, if you want magical girls, there's plenty of other better shows to choose from.

(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Romance', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"I dislike being mean when i give a review, but i promised to myself to be sincere every time i give one. 
 
Marginal Prince falls under the category of ""it was so BAD it made me LAUGH"". People who reviewed about this being terrible weren't joking to you, truly... the only reason i didn't drop it off from the start was because it gave me a sheer amount of laughter in every episode. 
 
Welcome to the world of Marginal Prince! The worst Anime based of a dating game yet to be made.  
Main character (who is a dude instead of the main girl in the game) is the new guy in this amazing all-boy academy. At the beginning it seems that this will fall in the category of ""new guy in school who gets fawn over by everyone"", but in reality Marginal Prince is wrongly labeled, it is NOT a shounen ai... and that makes the story even more pointless.  
The thing is that THERE IS NO STORY. We have random pieces of plot scattered everywhere dealing with the character's back stories that we don't really care about.  
 
The worst yet most hilarious part is that the characters sing. Yes. They sing. Out of nowhere. IN THE RAIN.  
I love my good musicals, but... this wasn't suppose to be a musical, or is it? 
 
Everything is random and pointless.  
 
I don't suggest you to watch it but if you really want to i bet you at least will get a few laughs on how WTF everything is.  
 
 

          
 
       Helpful There wasn't any review written for this anime, so I thought I would help out and write down a little. 
 
Story: 
A boy transfers to a school on a small island. A lot of bi-shounen guys walk around. At first he isn't really accepted, but because he never gives up everything turns out right.  
I was really disappointed, because they could have done so much more with the story. But somehow they decided to keep it really predictable. 
 
Art: 
The art was pretty okay really. It had good details, nice colours. 
 
Sound: 
I give a 7, because of the singing. Every episode one of the characters starts to sing a song. That was just... really amusing. Well, go hear it for yourself ;). 
Voices where done well also :). 
 
Character: 
Biggest disappointment ever. They have this basic bi-shounen cast. Cool guy, nice guy, lolita guy..... and of course the main character is a dumb, but cheerful boy who eventually keeps everyone together and makes everyone happy.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I watched all episodes because of that strange singing every time. It really made me laugh.  
 
Overall: 
Oh well, a 5, because I'm not that strict.   

          
 
       Helpful Okay, This is under Shounen-ai and I believed it was so, until the ending. Around episode 10 I was just plain confused, suddenly there were a whole bunch of secrets, They had back stories and everything. It was just plain confusing, plus the sub-titles sucked badly.  
 
This show may seem like Shounen-ai at first but it is NOT it seems as though they are all just friends and they all fall for the main-character, Yuuta's sister. Which was in my opinion HORRIBLE, it was not Shounen-ai, the more I watched the show, It made me hate it.  
 
They sung in every episode, which was... Okay, it felt more like a musical at those moments. I remember when Joshua first sung he suddenly ended up in the rain and his jacket came off. It was confusing because.. it just was.  
 
The Genre on this show is set up wrong, I saw ZERO actions that related to Shounen-ai, No hugging and kissing at all. The last scene angered me at the most, where Joshua came up on a horse and pulled Yuuta's sister with him.  
 
At first I thought it'd be like Gakuen heaven, I was dead wrong.  
 
Disgrace to Shounen-ai.

","Initially I was reluctant to watch this series because I thought it'd be depressing, but glad I didn't linger on that assumption.  
 
They did a very nice job balancing Benio's fresh personality from the first movie imo, while occasionally revealing her struggles and gradual changes in adapting to a new reality. It's done in a non-depressing manner and fits Benio's character really well; another thing I'm glad about, how they didn't just hop on the typical shoujo depression trend. There's some tropes that would've been annoying, but it's directed very straightforwardly so to speak so it's not dwelled on to the point that brings frustration.  
 
Just a heads up because I've been fooled way too many times by shows not having tragedy tags when it really should've been-- this isn't a tragedy.  
 
I wish they adapted more from the manga on Benio's interactions with other characters (minor or not) so we see a more wholesome image of her as an individual, but it's understandable they couldn't from the limitations of movies. Overall, it's very relaxing to watch, puts one in a good mood too (at least for me).

","I watched this movie at the Akibapass Festival in Frankfurt, Germany. First of all, I have to say that I'm not familiar with the original source (published from 1975 to 1979) or the older anime series, which aired from 1978 to 1979. As it is I cannot compare it to these works and watched it completely unaffected and without any previous knowledge, besides the information which has been included in the trailer. Though as it is written on the manga source page, Haikara-san ga Tooru won the first Kodansha Manga Award for shoujo in 1977, so likely it has been very good as well.  
 
The story is put-together enjoyable and the art of storytelling has been made in a very lovely way. The transition between different scenes was often in such a smooth way that you just had to smile at how it was done. As the genre allocation of this anime says Comedy, Historical, Romance, and Shoujo, you get exactly that. I laughed or smiled a lot, while I was watching this movie and as I experienced it at the cinema I was surely not the only one with this expression aka impression of this movie. The historical aspects are also depicted quite well and one or the other scene reminded me of pictures I've seen before (in preparation for a presentation I made) about this era. Also, I haven't seen such a pure romance shoujo for a while, which means some scenes have been worked out almost unrealistically perfect or smooth. But still very enjoyable and sweet. For sure something recommendable for romanticists. 
 
The art was clean, consistent and very lovely. I wouldn't describe it as the most artistic outstanding work ever, but it really was enjoyable. As I've seen this movie only once yet, I cannot further go into detail with this point.  
 
The creators have taken great care of this production. The character design and composition also make it very enjoyable.  
 
As it is Part 1 out of two movies, the story is not yet concluded but the first movie is in its own a great work and is not only the introduction to a bigger following story. 
 (Like some other multi-part movies have been created.) 

          
 
       Helpful Let me ask you: Have you ever heard of an old manga called Haikara-san ga Tooru? Yeah, me either. Not until this, at least. Anyway, the original manga by Waki Yamato, which ran from 1975 to 1977, actually had a bit of a rough history with animation. It was adapted into a TV series from 1978 to 1979 and received 42 episodes. It was apparently supposed to be longer, but from what I've heard, it got cancelled due to low ratings, and as a result, the anime had to end in a different way than the manga. Ever since then, it just sort of faded into obscurity, as nobody ever really talked about it. The manga and the anime series were never licensed in the US, likely due to their old age and old school artstyle. Considering all of these things going against it, it seemed that Haikara-san ga Tooru would be left into the darkness forever, never to be seen again. 
 
OR WAS IT?! 
 
Apparently, someone decided this story deserved a second chance, rightfully so, and decided to make a bold move: Revive the series! But instead of making it into another TV series, they decided to adapt it into two movies. Not only that, they completely changed the art style to make it appeal to modern anime audiences, with a new look and coat of paint. Having seen the first movie myself now that I have the first Blu-Ray, I can wholeheartedly say that whoever decided this anime deserved a second chance did an awesome job of bringing it back to life, even with its flaws. Because this movie is awesome and I absolutely can't wait for the second movie to come out! 
 
The story takes place in the 1910s-1920s, during the Taisho era, focusing on Benio Hanamura, a happy-go-lucky, ambitious young woman and the daughter of a high ranking military officer in the Japanese Army. She lost her mother when she was young, and as a result, has become quite the stubborn, individualistic tomboy, in stark contrast to the strict idea of the ""good wife, wise mother"" ideal of womanhood. She studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in Western clothes, and ardently believes that a woman should be free to choose who they themselves want to marry instead of being forced to accept arranged marriages. When she finds she's been betrothed to a man she knows nothing about, a handsome, sweet natured man named Shinobu Ijuuin, Benio tries everything she can to get out of it, from deliberately messing up her chores and housework (Which isn't hard, since she sucks at housework anyway) to trying to set him up with her best friend, who actually likes him. But things don't always go the way she wants them to, and circumstances might just make her realize that things might be better than she thinks. 
 
Now, the original manga is eight volumes long, so it can be hard to try and cram so much material into two movies, much less one. Many movies have tried this and failed miserably. As of this writing, I haven't seen the second movie yet (Though I do want to, and I'm definitely getting the Blu-Ray once it comes out!), so the review will focus solely on the first one for now. But even with the movie's overly condensed, compressed nature, there's a lot of things that it manages to do really well. One of those things is the animation and the character designs. As you can see, both the original manga and the anime from the 70s have VERY dated designs, with washed out colors, exaggerated sparkly eyes, huge lips, and some weird-looking, gonky faces sometimes. The producers for the new movies radically updated the character designs, making them sharper, cleaner, and more modern but still keeping it true to the shoujo aesthestic, with huge doe eyes, large eyelashes, and the men having some feminized features. The animation is beautiful, with smooth movement, lovely backgrounds and backdrops that really enhance the mood of various scenes, and it even has the characters make comedic, goofy faces like in the original Sailor Moon anime, and it works really well here. 
 
I'm kind of biased when it comes to the soundtrack, as it's done by one of my favorite anime composers, Michiru Oshima, who's worked on a lot of my favorite anime such as Nabari no Ou, My Sister Momoko, Fancy Lala, Snow White with the Red Hair, the live-action Sailor Moon series, and many others. But you probably know her for her work on the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia, Tatami Galaxy, and more recently, Bloom Into You. Yet again, she hits a home run with the soundtrack here, with oboes and violins that perfectly fit the quaint, romantic feel of the movie, but never to the point of getting obnoxious or overbearing, something that few soundtracks can boast. 
 
I do have some mixed feelings about the characters, which is inevitable considering this manga tries to cram several volumes of manga into one/two movies. I will say that Benio is a relatively good lead character: She has a lot of character flaws, such as being a little too stubborn and argumentative, which can make her come across as bratty at first, but the movie never takes these traits too far to the point of making her come off as obnoxious or a bitch. Plus, while she does eventually fall in love with Shinobu, she still keeps her self-sufficient, independent personality, taking charge of her own fate. She's an intriguing, three-dimensional character with plenty of strengths, weaknesses, and perfectly carries the movie, something which is sorely needed in the anime industry as of right now. The other characters, on the other hand, aren't as lucky in this department. They're all decent enough, and I love the whole ensemble, but because the movie rushes through everything, they don't get fleshed out like Benio does, so every scene they're in lacks emotional impact. Shinobu in particular comes off as way too perfect. His patience for Benio is saintly, he's always nice and kind, never pressures Benio into doing anything she doesn't want to, supports her in everything, and there isn't a bad bone in his body. Now, don't get me wrong, normally I love these kinds of characters, and considering that most shoujo manga/anime tend to give those kinds of characters the shaft in favor of portraying people who IRL would be considered domestic abusers in a romantic, sympathetic light, we need more characters like Shinobu. But the problem with him here is that he doesn't have any flaws. You can't make a character that audiences will like if you don't give him any flaws or traits that he needs to deal with or overcome, and the only time we see him have to deal with a character flaw is at the very end, so it winds up coming way too late. Eh, maybe the next movie will rectify this. I hope it does, because as much as I like Shinobu, you can't deny that he's rather vanilla and too perfect for his own good. 
 
But none of these things detract from my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. Many scenes had me on the floor laughing a lot of the time, and in a really good way. The animation is luscious, the music is great, I love all the characters despite the movie being unable to develop them and flesh them out, and I'm really excited to see the next movie. I guess all of the movie's problems can be attributed to its format: Movies are typically better suited for standalone stories, and trying to cram 10 volumes of manga into two movies won't yield very good results if you want to tell a whole story. Scenes have to be cut out and you have to compress other parts in order to tell the story you want to tell. As far as Haikara-san is concerned, despite its initial missteps, I think the producers did extremely well with what they had and did the best they could to do what they needed to do here. It's a sweet, heartwarming romantic comedy that's sure to get a laugh out of you and take you to a time long past. 
 
All in all, while made missteps in its presentation, Haikara-san part one is definitely one of the better romances I've seen this year, and I normally tend to dislike romance. Now to (impatiently)eagerly wait for the next movie to come out on Blu-Ray!

(Source: Himeya Shop)","['Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Hentai', 'School', 'Supernatural']","At the beginning of summer break, A young man named Naoto Jinno asked Rika Manabe, his girlfriend, to go out with him, planning to propose to her, only for his attempt to do so be interrupted by Asmodeus and Luvriel, commanders of a holy conflict, with Naoto and Rika helping Luvriel recover after she is defeated. As a result, Rika becomes a Devil Angel, an angelic warrior who fights using Amore, gathered through the act of making love, something Naoto is fairly happy to do.
In the second game, and its related anime, Hikari Jinno, his sister who was studying overseas, comes to visit, at the same time as Rococo, Asmodeus's sister, decides to attack Rika in revenge for Asmodeus's defeat, turning her into a demonic version of a Devil Angel, causing Hikari to end up a Devil Angel, with Naoto slightly more reluctantly, at first, generating Amore within her, and they manage to purify Rika and defeat Rococo.
In the third game, Naoto finds himself helping test out the New Angelic Gaia Interface, in the form of a blue haired girl, when a new antagonist, pretending to be a photography student, lures Rika and Hikari into a trap that sees Hikari corrupted and Rika unable to help. Due to NAGI's digital nature, she is able to regenerate from damage and take greater risks, which is needed when the demons deploy the first completely robotic devil...
The fourth game has a different concept, with Luvriel having established a school for potential Devil Angels, recruits Momo Sakura, Aoi Ayonokouji and Yuzuha Hoshikawa, also known as Spica, Althaea and Junos, to defend it from a pair of non-identical twin devils, Meimei and Maimai.
The fifth game was an anniversary title, featuring the casts of Makai Tenshi DJibril 3 and DJibril 4 meeting when Luvriel goes to see the Jinnos, only for them to be thrown into a parallel version of Sengoku Japan, with the various Devil Angels taking on personalities that were based on famous Japanese heroes as they try to figure out how to get back to the present.
The sixth, and currently final, game has Luvriel having re-established her school, this time placing the campus within cyberspace, with the assistance of Rika Manabe. However, where there are angels, there will always be demons...

Well, this anime isn't exactly complete yet. So the scores given aren't official, as of yet.  
 
Story~ (8) 
Basically, the story follows the peaceful life of Rika, Naoto, Hikari, and Lovriel after rescuing Rika. (If you've seen season 2, also known as Second Coming, then you know what I'm talking about). Let's just say that their peace is not lived for very long. There's a photography student taking pornographic photos of the students, which all somehow connect to Misty May's return. When faced with a very strong tentacle monster, Hikari gets kidnapped. They become depressed, until an android of sorts named Nagi is introduced. Her mission? To rescue Hikari and make sure Rika is safe. But can they rescue Hikari in time...? 
I rated the story with an eight because honestly, it is enjoyable, but I feel like there could be more. Not to mention...it's a little predictable.  
 
Art~(9) 
I found the art to be very good. The characters are drawn very well, and look like their game counterparts. There's only one flaw though; the coloring. I feel that the colors look a little strange at times. 
 
Sound~(9) 
The sound overall is excellent. The voice actors clearly put lots of effort into their voices. Aoyama Yukari, who plays Rika, captured Rika's character just right, in my honest opinion. Hokuto Minami, who voiced Hikari, captured the albeit annoying (or cute, depending on your feelings) emotions of an imouto type character. The rest of the voice cast did just as well. The music really fits the tone of each scene, although I find the battle music a tad unfitting with certain ones. 
 
Characters~(8) 
I think the characters are pretty unique, if not more original than many hentai anime characters. While not extremely original, they certainly stand out in their own rights. Their designs are one of those things, but their personalities count, too.  Rika is the sweet childhood friend of Naoto, Hikari is Naoto's stepsister, Lovriel is their angelic companion, Misty May is...well, the villain with a mean, mean streak, and Nagi is the mysterious silent one. They all are more interesting than stated, and are very lovable. (Rika-chama~!!!) 
 
Enjoyment~(9) 
I personally enjoyed this particular anime quite a lot. The overall tone is a very lighthearted one, even if it is tentacle and has some...hardcore things in the mix. It's not NSN level, though. The characters were fun to watch, and the story continues to unfold as each episode comes out. With two more episodes left, will Hikari be saved? And will we, the viewers, be spared of another cliffhanger thanks to Milky? 
 
Until next time, this has been Kitty.

When Yūna is in trouble, Mamoru quickly puts on his ninja suit and transforms into a competent ninja; able to protect her from harm. Unfortunately, this poses quite a challenge as Yūna, being both clumsy and absent-minded, often stumbles into situations where Mamoru must once again come to her rescue.
On the first day of their new school term, a model airplane accidentally makes a dive towards Yuna, but it is quickly stopped by a thrown kunai. At school, Airi Sawagashi invites Yūna to go bowling, but is unhappy when Mamoru also comes.
At the bowling alley, Yūna wanders into the men's restroom and interrupts a yakuza deal involving fake dolls. As a result, they kidnap her and take her to their boss. Mamoru follows them, takes out the gang, and rescues Yūna.
The story continues as new characters enter Yūna and Mamoru's lives with both good and evil intentions, wacky adventures, hints of romance, and confrontations with the strangest of adversaries.
","Kage kara Mamoru! is a ninja theme with a lot of comedy anime, this anime tell about a ninja clan named Kagemori who sworn to protect Konyaku Family and their descendant started 400year before. 
 
Main Character Hero called Kagemori Mamoru has a duty to protect Yuna Konyaku. They even become a friend since chillhood. Mamoru don't have a clue about women feeling, yet he's skilled enough as Ninja. Yuna are a clumsy type heroine that will makes you hoots of laughter while watching this anime. 
 
During his duty to protect her, he meet other female characters that later will become his friends (and all of them falling in love with him, so it's kinda makes soft harem anime). 
 
I recommended this anime to all of you whos seek for a light harem and lot of comedy. 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is a pretty decent anime. You have this boy ninja who has to protect his neighbor (a clumsy, childish, loving girl who he grew up with) because of this promise made by his family a long time ago. He first appears nerdy but when he has to fulfill his duty he turns into this nice looking serious ninja. The story pretty much revolves around his duty to protect his childhood friend/neighbor. Throughout this process, they (main character and other characters) face new challenges, meet new friends, and feelings grow. So all in all it was good filled with some comedy, a touch of romance, and ninja action. Quite enjoyable and not over the top. You can pretty much telll how the story will evolve as you watch each episode so its kinda predictable. This anime gets a 9.

          
 
       Helpful NOTE: I wrote this review quite some time ago, and it doesn't meet my current standards, however since there are no other reviews here, it may be somewhat informative. 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
Story: Nerd-glasses wearing student one second, handsome &amp; mysterious ninja the next, Mamoru comes from a family of ninjas. Their purpose is to secretly protect the Konnyaku family, whom they have always lived next door to. Mamoru's particular mission is to protect the daughter, Yuna, and he has done so since he was small. This is made more difficult thanks to Yuna being a clumsy airhead who always manages to land herself into far-more-than-your-average amount of trouble. They are good friends (She has not yet mentioned that she loves him), and always go places together, which helps greatly with being nearby to protect her. 
 
Also, a number of female warriors appear, all of whom become enamoured with Mamoru(the ninja), and they begin fighting each other for him. 
 
Summary: A moderately paced series that follows Mamoru as he tries to protect Yuna without her knowledge, and defend himself from assassins, not to mention his parent's training, while the female warriors fight over Mamoru in the background. 
 
My Thoughts: Now, I've seen a few clumsy, idiotic anime characters in my time, but I think that Yuna takes the cake, then trips and falls into it, and promptly falls asleep, leaving mamoru to drag her away so she doesn't suffocate. I can't remember ever seeing a character so consistantly air-headed and clumsy, and there is a fair bit of variety to the situations she gets herself into. It's probably worth a look just for that fact. 
 
Apart from Yuna herself, there is a lot of funny stuff going on, such as ninja dogs and ninja rabbits. 
 
There's not a lot of combat, but what's there is stylish, and often humerous. 
 
Music: The opening/closing themes(Japanese) are nice, upbeat, and might get stuck in your head for a bit, but probably not worth putting in the collection. 
 
In closing: A good, but short, series, worth watching more for the comedy than the combat. I give it a thumbs up. I recommend it to anyone that likes idiotic anime characters or funny ninjas.

6,2454,95,5.944003237,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Kimagure Orange☆Road: Ano Hi ni Kaeritai,"After the TV-series of Kimagure Orange Road, Kyosuke and Madoka have finally arrived at the point where they are close to graduation and have to decide where they want to go to college. Naturally, they want to go together, so beside all the studying they also have to look for a proper college where they can enter both. 
 
Hikaru, still a year from graduating, wants to support Kyosuke as well and does that in her own way. But while she does that, Madoka feels jealous and tells her feelings to Kyosuke. 
 
And then Kyosuke has to take action to finally decide on the girl he loves... thus concluding the story of the Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']","Kyōsuke Kasuga and his family had to move several times after being seen using their esper powers. Upon settling for the seventh time, Kyōsuke briefly meets a pretty girl who gives him her straw-hat and falls in love with her on sight. On the first day of school he learns this girl is his junior high classmate Madoka Ayukawa, who, contrary to his initial impression, is feared as a tough and no-nonsense delinquent. Their underclassman (and Madoka's best friend), Hikaru Hiyama, sees Kyōsuke use his powers to sink an impressive basketball shot and falls in love with him. Kyōsuke ends up dating Hikaru while constantly struggling with his feelings for Madoka due to his indecisiveness. Likewise, Madoka has feelings for Kyōsuke which she masks with her capricious nature for fear of hurting her friend Hikaru.
","This is the first movie which could be called a spin-off because it's an original piece of work written by Kenji Tereda, the main scenario writer for the TV series rather than based off the original Manga. 
 
It takes on a more serious tone during the summer when Kyousuke is preparing for university entrance exams. There's no mention of supernatural powers nor are any used, just your slice-of-life romance. Kyousuke's originally kind indecisive character is changed to be more cold and decisive so it's no longer a romcom and can be quite bitter which is probably why it was ill-received. Even Izumi Matsumoto criticised the work, suggesting viewers took it as a parallel world story instead because of how harsh it was. 
 
The supernatural powers were partly what made the original TV series fun so with the sudden change in mood and powers left out, it just feels like your bland romance movie.

          
 
       Helpful It's not often I see an anime movie based on a series that's really worthwhile. Most of the time the movie just feels very generic and dull compared to the series, like it's something they created for the sole purpose of making money. I've been disappointed by the One Piece movies, Bleach movies, Ranma movies... They had their cool points, but were overall pretty bland. This movie is not like those movies. 
 
The animation wasn't really anything special; it was about the same quality as the series. 
 
I really wasn't expecting an Ushiko-Umao reference in the movie. It's been a while since I watched the series, so it was just a nice surprise and probably the only really funny part in the movie.  
 
Spoilers below, it's hard to talk about the movie without spoiling it since he makes his decision sorta early in the movie. It's based more on their feelings and how things go after that, not indecisiveness. 
 
Kyosuke finally tells Hikaru how he feels in this movie. It's pretty tough, but... well, it was always very one-sided from the start. She was always just pressuring and forcing him into stuff simply because she thought he looked cool the day he used his power to shoot a basketball through a hoop? I always thought Hikaru just seemed really shallow and stupid, so it's pretty easy to accept her defeat.  
The movie starts off in black and white as if to set a more serious tone... it also ends in black and white after the story is explained and it returns to the point where the intro ended. Something about this feels just feels kinda incomplete... It didn't just set a serious tone, it set a kinda depressing one, like all the fun's been sucked out since Hikaru's been turned down. Are Kyosuke and Madoka happy together? They sure didn't make it look like it. Did Hikaru accept reality? I dunno what the point of her ""bang"" at the end was. The black and white thing makes me feel like the two aren't happy and like Hikaru didn't move on... 
 
The movie gave the conclusion we were all waiting for, but it could've tied things up a little better, I think. It doesn't handle that very well by itself, but the second movie gives a more concrete ending.

          
 
       Helpful There comes a time in your life when you have to decide over something so painful. 
 
The goofing days are finally over. Kasuga and Ayukawa are finally graduating from high school and they're moving on. This is Kimagure Orange Road without the out-of-this-world Power, over-acting Hatta and Komatsu, and crazy time-travels. What's left in this movie is raw human emotion. This is the ultimate conclusion to the Kasuga-Ayukawa-Hikaru love triangle. 
 
Kasuga Kyosuke has to choose. I won't say who he chooses. But it's what the movie is all about. 
 
Before you watch this, think first. If you want to remain happy with Kimagure Orange Road's TV series conclusion, then don't ever watch this. The indecisive yet sensitive-to-others Kasuga is gone. The understanding Ayukawa is gone. The jolly and heartwarming Hikaru is gone. The Kasuga twins just make some brief appearances. Jingoro is turned into a passive cat. Hatta and Komatsu are still as horny as ever, but they're toned down, and perhaps are the only sources of humor in the movie (and they didn't do well). And for the first time since I started watching the franchise, I kind of missed the bozo Yuusaku. 
 
The falling leaves. The telephone talks. Secrets were finally revealed. Each scene was made with subtlety and utmost care so as to deliver to us what each character really feels. They were made more human. They run after who they love. All defenses put aside, they show their hidden sides and deepest doubts and fears. 
 
There are some parts that were totally silent except for the voices of the main characters, which was good, since it emphasized the movie's meanings more. The art, well, is still what it is: outdated. I can't really say I enjoyed the movie; it was too emotional. I was a bit shocked with its content; it was really a departure from the feel of the TV series. This is no romantic comedy, this is drama. You could feel the uneasiness, the uncertainty, the bitter parts of adolescence, embodied by Kasuga, Ayukawa and Hikaru. 
 
Even though it doesn't contain the same warmth of its prequel, the story could be looked at as something that is more reality-based. We have to grow up. We have to take separate roads. Still, with all the emotions surrounding it, this is a worthwhile work to watch and is as gripping as any movie, only it will leave you will a feeling of nostalgia and loss, and a bit of relief and bittersweet happiness, too. 
 
My suggestion: watch something jolly after this.

The story follows the titular character who is a genetically engineered super-soldier; one of the creations of Dr. Von Reichter's diabolic experiments. (The fictional) Von Reichter is actually a former Nazi who conducted horrendous experiments during the second world war. He flees to South America where he continues his experiments which culminate in the creation of the ""Cybers,"" one of which happens to be Cybersix. However, since the Cybers exhibit free will at an young age (an undesired trait), Von Reichter destroys all the Cybers to prevent a rebellion. 
 
In the present day, Cybersix is one of the Cybers who managed to escape and is living a quiet life under the alias of ""Adrian Seidelman""; however, she finds out that her survival is dependent on a special substance that Von Reichter created and thus she is forced to hunt down the ""Technos,"" a newer generation of super-soldiers created by him, in order to survive. Unintentionally, in the process, Cybersix becomes a superhero protecting the world from Dr. Von Reichter's creations and his evil plans.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Von Reichter is a surviving member of Schutzstaffel in World War II. He works on experiments in South America, creating the Cyber series of artificial humanoids with super strength and agility. The 5000 original Cybers became servants, mimicked human emotions and making their will. When they disobey orders, Reichter orders them all to be destroyed. After the death of Cyber-29, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther, Data-7. Cyber-6 (Cybersix) is one of the survivors, who escapes and arrives in the city of Meridiana. She disguises herself as school teacher Adrian Seidelman, after the real one is killed in a car wreck. Cybersix defeats monsters called ""Fixed Ideas"" – humanoids of the Techno series – in order to drink the green sustenance liquid contained within them. Along the way, she meets an orphaned boy Julian, Reichter's cloned son José, and high school teacher Lucas Amato.
","Growing up in Canada in the late 90's, almost every kid I knew watched Cybersix. After just rewatching it, I can see why. It's got this unique Halloween feel mingled with a French/European setting that just sets it apart from most other animated shows. It's beautiful to look at, and it's painful to know how little attention it's gotten since its completion. 
 
Cybersix is about a Genetically engineered woman named Cybersix, and her battle against the many monsters sent by her creator to cause trouble. By day she poses as a male literature teacher, hangs out with her BFF Lucas, and acts like a geek. By night, she's an ass kicking sex-symbol that frequently visits her love interest, Lucas. It's also episodic, so you'll never have to worry about a boring arc lasting more than one episode. Personally, I was never bored.  
 
The characters are cool, spunky, unique and likable. While the majority of the characters outside of the main four or five rarely get any screen time, they only add to the already action-packed story. Cybersix herself is one outstanding individual, being both tough and gentle at the same time. Awesome. 
 
The music isn't orchestrated, but man that main theme is catchy. 
 
I highly highly recommend this one! Since it's only 13 episodes, you have very little to lose. Be warned the ending is slightly unsatisfying.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Although surprised to find this series on MAL I'm really glad it's here as getting more people into this criminally under appreciated show is always a good thing. 
 
This series is an adaptation of an Argentinian graphic novel, that a Canadian company picked up the rights to, and contracted a Japanese studio to animate. The original graphic novel is much more adult orientated and while this adaptation isn't exactly for kids it's certainly been toned down a bit. Fortunately enough this doesn't hamper the story. 
 
This is one of those shows that's best to go into with little to no idea what it's about, so I'm not going to talk extensively about the characters or story but give a few reasons why you should check it out. First of all, it has one of the most realistic female leads I've ever encountered. While this isn't so much of an issue in anime as it is in western animation, authentic female protagonists are still rather rare outside of the romance genre. In an action or superhero series authentic female characters are almost unheard of and yet that's exactly what Cybersix delivers. A female protagonist that's distinctly female, simultaneously realistic and flawed, Cybersix deals with a variety of issues through a chiefly female perspective. 
 
Beyond the expertly crafted lead, Cybersix hosts a number of other strikingly realistic characters and a well executed story about love and loss set to the backdrop of a sleepy south american city. Stylistically and thematically Cybersix is an incredibly unique mix, there really hasn't been anything like it since, especially as far as international collaborations go. 
 
With all that said, if you're looking for a well done and unique series with engaging and realistic characters then I can't recommend Cybersix enough.

          
 
       Helpful Okey This is My first review and i'm sorry if I might spell something wrong.  
 
I really like This show for many reasons. I love the that the main charakter is crossdressing and still looks good in any form male or female (but i like the male version ""Adrian"" more...)  exept that she has to wear those ugly clothes as cybersix. But i like her And the other charkters, but the villan sucks!!!! Its an eight year old boy who just run Around like a chicken! And his father is also just another coward. So the story was kind of lame to a certan extent but the charakters made up for it.  
 
I give the story a 7. Like i said its loads of fun and cute moments. But When there is drama it sucks. 
 
I give the art a 8. Becuse i like it XD. 
 
Well i dont Care about the sound but the dub was great. So no worries. 
 
I give the charakters a 9. I like em. But a little childish 
 
I give the enjoyment a 9. Hey if you didnt like it then sorry but The serie just ended and i want to see more!! And the comic suck so i dont know if i should recomend or not. 
 
But overall i give it à 10. I like the combined artwork With the charakters and surrounding. And that the heroine is just awesome in all the ways she is. And that there is werewolfs in episode 10 ... And Adrian is the best drawn charakter ever.

","Anime was pretty good at the start, it had a dark feel and there was a fair bit of action. After that it wasn't as good, the dark feel at the start of the series wasn't there anymore and there was less action as well.  Honestly, the action isn't too important to me, but it was pretty good at the start. Although the fact that there was less of a dark atmosphere later on in the series kinda made it less enjoyable, as that was what I came for.

       Helpful CUBED X CURSED X CURIOUS REVIEW: 
 
MINDSET: 
You should already know what's coming Your way once You see, “Light Novel Adaptation” popping up the back of Your hand, its either from the Cows Buttocks, or average stones. 
 
SYNOPSIS: 
C3 starts out in regular modern day Japan with our generic protagonist Haruaki, at one day he soon finds a  mythically giant black cube posted by Your local mail man, soon he notices that the giant cube can transform into female loli known as “Fear”. It was then found out that her cube can not only resize into the palm of her hand for plot convenience, but it can also be used as a tool of 100 torture devices. (BDSM style! Yay, kids!) 
 
 
REVIEW: 
We all know that light novel adaptations are always aiming for “Mass Appeal” since that is the one thing that always tend to sell! (AKA: The casual audience) Consequently, C3   slightly “Differs” from this case as it is surprisingly good on paper. However, for me to summarise such issues, the show is also trying to also be ecchi, which has the tendency to break a show if it has a more mature, interesting and serious nature. This is no exception. 
 
Don't expect deep and complex villains. They are all completely lacking in depth, and are often just one liner character. Like is it ever in any way, shape or form that the first villain is just this random axe wielding  psychopath who keeps crying out “Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” Every 5 seconds when she's fighting a woman will equal character depth and complexity? No! 
 
Tropes are a thousand times more overused, and replicated. So (obvious fact) the light novel adaptation tends to carry: One dimensional villains? Check! Character Archetypes? Check! Tsunderes? Check! Fan Service? Check! Endings that leave one or more plot holes? Damn hell & Check! And  this is the biggest issue to be summarised with this show here, it feels far too much like a light novel adaptation, yet it has an interesting premise and a fairly good amount of potential to be a “Good Light Novel, with the Adaptation” Buuuut Your run of the mil light novel is bound to fail. 
 
Speaking of fanservice, there is a bit too much fanservice to take this show onto more serious and mature levels. The fact that Kirka wears permanent bondage under her clothes will not mean as a symbolic reference of her sexual suffering and how she is trapped in pain unless if the show shuts up the fanservice, takes a serious look on the audience, and respects it like an actual man! 
 
These kinds of concepts may look very nice on both paper, and in action if done in properly mature manner. However, its is simply lazy to take the risk, and create a potentially good and interesting show! For goodness sakes! The show is not even trying to make these concepts as interesting and thought provoking as it is meant to be, leaving it into Ecchi abyss... 
 
Silver Link doesn’t have many renowned or popular works, but its safe to say that the budget will remain very consistent for these 12 episode series, and C3 tends to have pretty above average Animation, the action scenes and cool powers they use create some pretty energetic looking battles. The colours they use all have a nice shiny finish to them so everything is all nice and colourful. The character designs aren’t anything to be especially proud of, since there quite generic and only the female designs only stand out. 
 
Though I think Silver Link is trying to copy SHAFT STYLE at certain points, but I don't really think its ever overused as much as Shafts own work. Though I don't think it really ever gives out extra points for that since those moments are kind of sparse, but not elusive.  
 
OST is again is just as above average as the Animation, with only one note worthy song that seems to stick around Your mind, and the rest fitting in with the mood, with Your usual pianos, trumpets, drums etc. Though it seems to be quite a large OST for 12 good songs that seem fairly on par with the Animation. OP is above average and fairly catchy, while its rather advisable to skip the ED. 
 
LEGACY: 
Such an Underrated show that never really managed to be seen upon masses. Season two is bound to never be released because Silver Link can't profit enough milk from it, but I suppose I'll remember this Light Novel Adaptation though failing and hitting its face on a wall, for having a bit more ambition than something like Mahouka which aims too much for MASS APPEAL. 
 
SCORES: 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL CHARACTERS SUCK. (cool ideas though) 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL PLOTS SUCK. (though some decent foreshadowing at times BTW) 
6.5/10- Well made and brightly coloured pieces of imagery but note bing too Shafty, but good Animation is good Animation. 
7/10- Mainly for 12 good songs on par with the Animation. 
3/10- Lacking enjoyability because it does'nt take good advantage of its potential, and fanservice. 
 
FINALE: 4.5/10 it has cool ideas and the budget to go with it, but fails in the long run. Because of fan service and the attempt of MASS APPEAL.

          
 
       Helpful I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character's hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. ** 
 
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the 'cube'. Kubrick being 'Cube' and 'Brick'.. get it? Get it?! :D 
 
'Yachi Haruaki', the main male protagonist in the story. ""Yachi"" in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I'd have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever. 
 
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing 'torture' machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical 'Swordfight' anime or 'Trigger-happy' anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations. 
 
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, 'Muramasa' until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) 'big-breasted' friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from 'Shakugan no Shana', and Siesta from 'Zero no Tsukaima'). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is 'Muramasa'. 
 
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear's dance really cute and charming. 
 
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10 
 
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear's hair shines rainbow. It's very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion. 
 
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier. 
 
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

Ban and Ginji continue their retrieval job, ending the series when requested to go on a mission that will lead them to meet Ban's mother.
The plot of the anime adaptation of GetBackers follows the manga's closely until the first season's ending. The second season features various stand alone episodes focused in the GetBackers' missions, while also two story arcs, the second ending the anime series with an open ending.
","If you've seen a couple different Shounen, Action, Anime then this one does very little to offer anything exciting and original, except some really lame fighting methods (Lady Poison). 
 
Getbackers is a typical shounen anime about two guys who are said to be able to get anything back, which has been taken. What helps them are their interesting special abilities Amano Ginji with the power to generate electricity and Midou Ban with a 200Kg hand grip and also possessing the evil eye. 
 
The show pretty much starts of like a typical anime, by introducing the main characters and giving them an opportunity to wow the viewers with some action. Getbackers is able to capture anyone's attention but as the show goes on, this cheesy anime can easily become tiresome to watch. The fights don't help it at all, with the same fighting methods repeated over and over, without any variety, to the point when even the action sequences get boring. In between all the action are numerous comedy moments, to lighten the mood however this is poorly executed and doesn't add much to the show. Also another issue is the characters and apart from the two main characters (Ginji and Midou) the rest are poorly developed and it doesn't help that the have some pretty lame personalities and special abilities/traits. Another annoyance is when the enemies become allies and the allies become enemies so easily that it just makes it all seem pointless. 
 
There's also the animation that can be described in one word ""mediocre"". It's obvious that very little effort was put into animating this show, as not even the fights seem fluid and all the chibi didn't help the comedy. Another thing that can put anyone of from watching this show is the horrendous opening and ending theme music, but at least the exciting music during the action can make up for it. 
 
Overall this is a pretty decent anime for the simple-minded anime fan but a somewhat intelligent anime fan would be able to see Getbackers for its many faults. It does manage to incorporate all the standard shounen elements but without adding anything original to make it stand out from the rest. Even though this anime is aimed at teenagers it seems more like a kid's show, with moderate violence, no blood and sharp objects replaced by bright shining lights. So if you're over 12 years old then I don't recommend this. 
 


          
 
       Helpful This will simply be an explanation for why you should read the manga instead of watching the anime. The anime covers part of the manga although some arcs are changed and some is anime only, but most importantly the anime ends with a anime only arc and doesn't really bring you the full story of Get Backers.  
 
The arcs that truly would be worth watching is not adapted in the anime and thus you miss vital character development and story. The ending of the manga will solve most of the questions about the story and characters which is something you cannot get out of the anime version. 
 
HOWEVER, if you're not keen on reading and would rather watch I would recommend watching the anime up until the last arc in which you can decided whether you wish to read the manga or not as the anime in itself is pretty good.  
 
Since the story of the anime is incomplete at best you'll merely get an introduction to the show in the anime. 
 
The characters and their development are good, but due to character development taking place after the anime you cannot witness that in the anime which means it will be lacking. Not only this, but the power of the characters and battles won't be at its peak either, but the battles in the anime are still very enjoyable 
 
It's a great show, but it lacks vital parts of the manga. However I would definitely recommend it if you're not into reading manga

          
 
       Helpful Just like most animes. You will find yourself lost at the beginning thinking a bunch of random things are happening and it doesn't make much sense. But also like those animes, it just gets interesting the more the story expands, explores its characters and explain things you might not understand at first. 
 
Although I don't get why it's left unfinished. They still have to defeat Brain Trust, deal with Akabane, find out Kagami's true purpose and see him fight seriously, finally finish Akabane, have Ban explain to Himiko the incident with her brother and plus the ending hinted Kanou's displease of the outcome. 
 
Maybe all my questions are answered in the manga. Wihich would make the read more interesting but for those unlike me who don't like exploring an anime's universe outside of the anime itself, it would be very frustrating. 
 
It was good overall and it was well done. Plus this was one of my childhood animes that I felt the need to rewatch to understand better than from when I first saw it.

6,256,99,5.856383215,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Hoshi no Koe,"Hoshi no Koe , using full 2D and 3D digital animation, is a story of a long distance love and mail messages between a boy and girl. Set in 2046 after the discovery of the ruins of an alien civilization on Mars, man has been able to make leaps in technology and is planning to send an expedition into space in the next year. Nagamine Mikako and Terao Noboru are junior high school students. However, while Noboru will be entering senior high next winter, Mikako is selected to join the space expedition. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","A schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine (Mika Shinohara (original Japanese), Sumi Muto (Japanese), Cynthia Martinez (English)) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of aliens called the Tarsians—named after the Tharsis region of Mars where they were first encountered.  As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a giant robotic mecha called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier Lysithea. When the Lysithea leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians, Mikako's friend Noboru Terao (Makoto Shinkai (original Japanese), Chihiro Suzuki (Japanese), Adam Colon (English)) remains on Earth. The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones. As the Lysithea travels deeper into space, messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years.
The narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet.  She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius Solar System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject ""I am here"", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him.
The ship's alarm warns Mikako that the Tarsians are surrounding her, but she does not understand.  A climactic battle ensues. On Earth, Noboru receives the message almost nine years later. At Agartha, three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed. The Lysithea is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction. After winning the battle, Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space.
In the manga, 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru himself has joined the UN, which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again.
","After watching the amazing 5 Centimeters Per Second, I figure I owed it to myself to watch Shinkai Makoto's first work Voices of a Distant Star. Reviews praised it and I assumed that it must be good. Well you know what they say about assuming. 
 
Story: 
Right off the bat I was unsure about the story. I liked the concept of love separated by distance as it worked quite well in 5cm Per Second, but the idea of lagging text messages is just ludicrous. You'd think that in the year 2046 we'd have invented a more effective form of communication, but I guess Shinkai Makoto didn't think so. Also look at the phones! No effort was made to even design phones that even had a hint of futuristic technology. Oh yeah, they could invent gigantic, space traveling, mechas, but more advanced forms of mobile communication devices are out of the equation! Moving on, the story gets no better from beginning to end and nothing is resolved. Practically no attempt is made to even strengthen the audience's true understanding of the connection that Nagamine and Noboru share. They just sort of tell you that they like each other and expect that to mean something. The years fly by without any coherent sense of meaning and the progression of time ends up not feeling quite right. Things don't change drastically enough for Noboru or Nagamine for me to even care. The story is just a mess. A pretentious, self-indulgent, mess. 5/10 
 
Art: 
First impression was a mixture of confusion and disgust. The characters are HORRIBLY designed. From scene to scene, depending on the angle, they look so different that I sometimes couldn't realize if they were one of the leads or a new character. Proportions were also SO off at angles that I had to really try to resist the urge to punch the screen out of anger. Emotions don't quite come across as clearly as I would expect which just compounds with all the other flaws making this OVA nearly unwatchable. The space battle scenes actually stand out as the best art in the OVA, but the doesn't mean anything. The mecha designs and animation is average and uninspired. Yawn. 3/10 
 
Sound: 
The sound in this also blows my mind at just how horrible it is. You know how bad the music is? So bad I can't even remember what it sounded like. I can't even remember what if there WAS music in this! And the seiyuu are as lacking in emotion as the Twilight movie actors. The sound effects in the space battle scenes are average, just what you'd expect for that kind of thing, so they leave no impression whatsoever. 3/10 
 
Characters: 
There were characters? Really? I just thought there were talking slabs of painted wood. Not that they had much to say. The characters are just so lacking in any relatable emotion since the OVA didn't spend enough time establishing the nature of Nagamine and Noboru's relationship to make the audience give a car that they are separate. I'd like to see what exactly they love about each other. Noboru is a distant, blank, emotionless guy and Nagamine is a clingy, whiny, child. Neither are developed and both are just without any sort of distinguishing personality. And the whole lack of ANY other characters just blows my mind. Really. 2/10 
 
Overall: 
5 Centimeters Per Second is, to this day, one of my favorite anime movie/OVAs of all time and I think, since it came after this abysmal pile of filth, that Shinkai Makoto is a very talented man. He knows how to establish atmosphere and characters, situations and emotions that you can relate to. He brought none of his skills in these areas to this OVA. Flat characters, a ridiculous premise, emotionless seiyuu and horrible art all make this one of the WORST anime ANYTHINGS I've ever seen. I will never understand how so many people could enjoy this trash, but they can if they want. I do not suggest watching this. Save your time for Shinkai Makoto's other works as they are worth the investment. 4/10

          
 
       Helpful The story line is just simple but how they portrayed it was just FANTASTIC. We all probably can think of a story like this one but its how the story was full of passion between the two characters which made this anime's story so beautiful.  This anime shows how easily love can determine one's future and thoughts. 
 
Although the story was good there were some ""not gonna happen, even for an anime"" moments, which was the heroine was still in high school and was going out to the universe. Although, this gave the anime a dramatic effect to it.  
 
It was interesting to see how 2-D and 3-D effects were going to be used together. The ships and meccas were nicely done in its 3-D style. Unfortunately the characters design were HORRIBLY done. Even for a 2002 OVA, the character designs could have been greatly improved on taking in account relating to the fact that the scenery was a lot better and it was also in 2-D. For a moment because of the character design, I thought I was watching the wrong anime. 
 
Due to the lack of time there is not much to say about the sound and character in my perspective. The sound played nicely in the dramatic scenes and also did a nice effect for other parts such as firing of missiles. Just the BMG alone could make a person cry. The characters were greatly developed in their relationship for the 23 min. The downfall to watching this series after 5cm and The Promise is that the character personalities are very similar.  
 
I enjoyed this OVA and is a heart breaking experience. I suggest this to anyone who has 20-30 min on their hand. Also If one would want to fully grasp the beauty of this, watch this before 5 cm and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. I do not think that this would ruin those other animes but further enhances the amines themes

          
 
       Helpful Melancholic story about love and long journey full of beautiful images. In less than half an hour Shinkai will drag you from the ""boring dead end"" train station somewhere in Japan to remote galaxies. He is executing the whole process very skillfully by mixing poetism with sci-fi.  
 
It is remarkable that he did all the work by myself. Deficiencies seen in particular on animation of characters, static backgrounds are however very nice. The film deserves more elaborate scenario. Fights animations are in my opinion, completely unnecessary and in this genre we should feel pretty comfy even without them. On the other hand, it must be said they are very nicely done. Same goes for sound effects and music which are splendid. Especially in romantic moments sounds of rain, wind, the city in the background and light tones of the piano brings the atmosphere almost to perfection. 
 
If you wanna fully enjoy this piece you have to got atleast a bit of empathy for the characters. For those who are of a more rational nature might be 8 years of waiting for SMS absurd in many ways. 
Yes his style might be over-sweet and naivé for somebody and I absolutely get it, but the bittersweet tones as the end comes so typical for Shinkai's ""manuscript"" are frankly said : the most appealing thing on his style. Best with bit of melancholy and tea.

She falls asleep but wakes up hearing mice squeaking...","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","Narrated by the adult Clara, she tells the story of Ragman, a mysterious old man who roams about the city looking into people's houses and turns children into mice if he catches them up past their bed time.
Clara is excited about her friend Fritz coming to visit the next day and refuses to go to sleep. Her Aunt Gerda  tries to frighten her with stories about the Ragman, but Clara says she's too grown up to believe in him. Uncle Drosselmeyer startles them with his arrival. He gives Clara a nutcracker doll, which she adores. She promises to go to bed immediately if she can keep it.
Clara awakens in the middle of the night to find her nutcracker gone. She sees a group of mice carrying it down the stairs and follows them into the living room. As she takes back the doll, she's confronted by the leader of the mice, a two-headed rat queen. The queen orders Clara to hand over the nutcracker, but she refuses. Clara is knocked out just as the nutcracker springs to life to defend her against the mice.
The next morning, Clara finds herself back in her bedroom. She tells her aunt about the mice and her doll being missing, but Gerda insists that she is talking nonsense and is ill with a fever. In her delirious state, Clara goes down to the living room and stares at the grandfather clock. Thinking she sees Uncle Drosselmeyer inside, she climbs in, only to be scared by the Ragman.
She wanders, looking for Drosselmeyer, until she finds herself in a palace. There she sees a portrait of a girl identical to her and a glass coffin containing a sleeping mouse person. A king and a group of mourners appear, believing Clara to be their Princess Mary returned. After Clara corrects their mistake, King Goodwin explains that she's in the Doll Kingdom. They were at war with the mice, led by the two-headed queen Morphia. When defeat seemed inevitable, the dolls surrendered. However, the King refused to agree to Morphia's final term: Princess Mary must marry her son, Gaar. As punishment for refusing, Morphia cursed the princess to look like a hideous mouse and lie in sleep until King Goodwin agrees to the marriage.
King Goodwin gathers all the world's wise men in hopes they can find a way to break the curse, but all their ideas are far fetched and illogical, and an argument quickly breaks out between them. Despairing that no one knows how to help, Clara leaves the castle and wanders the streets. A street singer points her in the direction of The Queen of Time, who is known for having the answer to everything. Clara goes to her and asks if she knows how to save the princess and defeat Morphia. The Queen of Time uses her magical crystal ball to spy on Morphia, revealing the only way to save the princess is to destroy the queen's source of power, the Nut of Darkness. This can only be done if the magical Sword of Pearl is wielded by someone with a pure heart. The Queen of Time provides the sword, but it's up to Clara to find someone to carry it into battle.
Clara returns to the castle, believing Franz, the captain of the guard, has a pure enough heart. She tells him what he must do in order to save the princess. King Goodwin promises Franz his daughter's hand in marriage if he's successful, and Franz leads the doll army off to battle. They arrive as the mice are celebrating Gaar's eminent marriage to the princess. Just as it seems the toy soldiers are losing, Franz destroys The Nut of Darkness and kills Morphia - but not before she places a curse on him, turning him into a nutcracker doll.
Clara carries the Nutcracker back to the palace, where she finds the court and King Goodwin are celebrating Princess Mary's awakening. Seeing Franz's new state, the princess abandons the marriage promise and calls the Nutcracker ugly. Clara leaves the kingdom to wander in search of anyone who knows how to return Franz to human, unaware that Gaar survived the attack and is following her. She eventually comes across the Watchmaker, who tells her the only way to save Franz is through an act of true, unselfish love. Clara declares  she loves Franz, but the Watchmaker says that isn't enough.
Exhausted from travelling, Clara falls asleep. She dreams that Franz is human again and they enter a magical kingdom made of candy. As they're about to ascend the stairs to live happily ever after in their castle, Clara's foot becomes stuck. Franz continues without her, leading Clara to grab his foot and beg him not to go. She wakes up to realize she's clutching the Nutcracker as Gaar tries to pull him away. She begs Gaar to spare Franz and kill her instead, but Gaar insists Franz must die for killing his mother. As he's about to stab the Nutcracker, Clara uses her own body as a shield. This frees Franz from the spell and destroys Gaar.
Clara wakes up in bed, with Uncle Drosselmeyer beside her. As Clara is recounting what happened and trying to ask Drosselmeyer what he was doing in the clock, Aunt Gerda comes in to say Fritz has arrived. He comes in, identical to Franz.

Story 
A bit confusing to understand certain connections. Such as the first villain's connection to the the other main villain. While i don't think it was made clear one was sent out to build a force for the other to conquer with. Aside from that the story was a delightful romantic tale with some tossed in drama. As for the ending a true fairy tale ending. 
 
Art 
This movie has come a long way. It used to be painted in such a dark fashion. Like a dream which makes sense given plot. But more of a dream where one would recall bits and peaces. For depending what version you had that is all you saw. Luckily there is a brighter more refined detailed version(which is what i saw). However, there were some dark areas but a real remarkable difference compared to the vch version. 
 
Although one element that was somewhat featured in the show was the portrayal of a real life ballerina. Not quite sure aside from innocence that had with the story. 
 
Overall: If you are a parent and wish to present a young girl a memorable tale to ponder as she drifts off to sleep i would suggest this. While sure it does have a certain England feel to it but the happy message comes out clear.Love conquers all. With the added bonus of possibly encouraging a proper follow through with bedtime hours.

","Let me tell you the strange tale of one of the most obscure cult-anime ever created. Back in the 80’s, when countless critically acclaimed classics were born, and movies like Akira created the first stepping-stones for anime to be recognized in the west, some countries were introduced to anime in a different way. This is not just a review, but also the story of Cyborg 009, the Swedish dub. 
 
The year is 1979. The cold war is fresh on people’s mind, the regime of Pol Pot just got thwarted, relations with China and the west are shaky, any opponent of the Bolsheviks gets funding from the US, and mistreated chemical weapons leak from soviet factories. Cyborg 009 was revolutionary for its time, for being an anime that took on more mature subjects like politics, religion, and war. It was no doubt a moral compass for children to grow up with, inspiring a new generation to work for peace and be more skeptical. Today, in 2016, the show’s messages would probably be ripe for censoring, particularly for portraying religion as a tool to instigate conflict several times. 
 
Regarding the artwork, the animation is not impressive by today’s standards, yet has that old retro style that is hard to hate. Some of the cartoony designs however stand out like sore thumbs. One of the African main characters is designed in a straight-up dated and offensive fashion. At the same time, the fact that the show included such an international cast was probably regarded as a step forward back then. 
 
Despite its mature sides, it can’t be denied that Cyborg 009 also contains a lot of 80’s cheese, with corny inventions and cackling cartoon-villains. Already in the second episode for example, we see a fisherman try to stop an iceberg with a measly harpoon, which comically clinks off the icy surface, and the man acts genuinely shocked that it wasn’t effective. The series also doesn't hold back on the use of swear-words, dropping f-bombs and insults wherever it likes. If that doesn't convince you, one episode involves a man in a killer-wheelchair trying to resurrect Hitler, and that is only a small part of the weirdness contained in this show.  
 
This is where the Swedish dub comes in, making the flaws even more apparent. What truly happened is a mystery. Very little info is available about the production. What we do know is that the dub was made by a one-man-army. The translation of the Japanese script to Swedish was all done by a single man, a Danish man to be more precise. Worse yet, he clearly did not fully grasp either the Japanese or Swedish language. One episode for example is titled ‘Giant Lizards’, despite being about gene-manipulated plants. Amateur-hour didn’t stop there though, because the same man did all the voice-work, which would include the voices for all women and children in the story. The end result, bad acting coupled with such illiterate sentences that you’d think the characters just had a stroke, and females that sound more like shemales. 
 
While this is only speculation, it is also rumored that the video-tapes of Cyborg 009 were distributed through a porno-company, handed out along with other sleazy titles for free. 
 
This is all a great example of something being so bad that it becomes good, starting out innocent with a glimmer in its eye, yet turning out unintentionally abysmal. Being 50 episodes long though, it’s a very lengthy show to watch for the sake of comedy alone, so the action and political messages thankfully does bring more to the table. Cyborg 009 manages to entertain both with its good and bad sides. Whether it’s the Swedish dub or another version, the show gets by on its charm despite its flaws. It is a fascinating time-capsule with a good story surrounding it, with bad execution and 80’s cheese sprinkled all over it.

          
 
       Helpful If I could choose one anime that I think the anime community doesn't appreciate enough, it would be this one. A sequel to the 1968 series (and the 2001 series aired on Cartoon Network, a remake of the '68 series), the 1979 series deserves to be recognized as a memorable series of its time, similar to Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato. However, its limited online availibility (had to watch the last 15 episodes in Italian without English subtitles, for crying out loud), could be the reason for this lack of knowledge of its existence. Someone should change that availability problem, but without further ado, here's why I think it's so damn great: 
 
 
Story: With 50 episodes, there's a lot to choose from, and the creators really used them well. There are many different types of episodes, ranging from dealing with various villains (along with villains working for THOSE villains), backstories, and those centered on individual characters. Overall, they are enjoyable, but sometimes the frequency of similar plots across the episodes can be repetitive, and the episodes don't flow together as well as they should. Many INDIVIDUAL episodes, however, are wrapped up very well or end on a suspenseful twist, and seeing it all come together will warm your heart and leave you shocked, respectfully. All of it is balanced with action, romance, drama, and a dash of comic relief and horror, making it a blend of everything one could hope for from an episode. 
 
Its originality is also worth noting. I've gotta admit that it feels good to see a great anime story that relies off of something like a team of cyborg superheroes rather than clichés like mecha, vampire/demon hunters, card playing/dueling, and/or high school slice of life comedies. Those genres aren't bad per se, I, in fact, like some of them myself, but a combination of originality and the quality of a work is what people remember as time goes on and as fads die out. 
 
 
Characters: The main strength of the show lies within the main characters, all of whom have apt, talented voice actors. 
 
Professor Gilmore is the glue that holds the team together. He's a strong mentor figure, similar to Gandalf from ""Lord of the Rings,"" and is always around to make sure that everything's going well and that planned actions follow through. His strong presence makes him hard to forget. 
 
009, our main character, is one that really struck a chord with me. He's a compassionate leader that tells the team what to do, and is an underdog with arguably the toughest past out of the whole team that just wants the best for everyone, from other cyborgs to random strangers he bumps into on the street. In terms of characters I remember from my early childhood, his overall demeanor reminds me of Arnold from the 90s Nickelodeon series, ""Hey Arnold,"" but 009 tends to be more serious in comparison. 
 
001, although a baby, holds the wisdom and knowledge of what to do, and is always willing to help out with his telepathic powers that many may underestimate. The shock value from one's underestimation of him makes him stand out. 
 
002 and 004 are similar characters. They're short-tempered, stoic, and can quite simply be dicks, but their style, realism, and hard work during tough battles make up for that. 
 
003, the subtle love interest of 009, is always looking out for the mental well-being of the team, and is the peaceful one always looking for alternative solutions for many things. 
 
006 and 007 are the comedic relief that can be found even in the toughest of times, and are practical with their superpowers, making them easy favorites. 
 
005 and 008, while admittingly the characters I found the most bland in comparison to all the rest, are members of the 00 Cyborgs that do contribute a very important role. 005, for example, represents both strong physical abilities and a strong mental ability, as his calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, together with his super power, can help out in any situation. 008, similarly, uses both his super power and his willingness to achieve victory by any means necessary to set everything in motion. 
 
The main villains of the show, from the Neo-Black Ghost's Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu, to the Norse mythology-inspired characters, have everything one could hope for from a villain: mysterious, creepy, dignified, elusive, cruel, power-hungry, and ingenious. The smaller villains, however, had less of these qualities, and because of that, they were hard to take seriously, and felt more like simple plot devices rather than pure evil that would make the audience shake in fear. 
 
  
Aesthetics: This show has a lot going for it in terms of the music, animation, and style. For starters, the theme song is relatively simple, but, unexpectedly, I eventually found it playing in my mind. Its ending song and background music are also very beautiful, embodying a peaceful, slow, nostalgic sound that I find less of nowadays.  
 
The animation generally flows well and looks pleasing for a dated show that didn't have the largest budget in the world; my only complaints are that low frame rate movements are rather common, and certain character motions look awkward and/or unrealistic. The settings in the show based off of real places are adequately designed as a whole, even though certain buildings aren’t very detailed. Fictional places, on the other hand, are drawn with great imagination and feel as if they could be tangible places. 
 
Its greatest aesthetic strength, though, is within the variety and overall style. The 00 Cyborgs will take you on their journey from Japan to the deserts of the southwestern US, the savannah plains of Africa, and everywhere in between. Due to the sci-fi element of the show, it also has that unique, late Cold War, retro-futurist feel that I really like, shown in everything from the fashion of the characters to the architecture and the technology. 
 
 
Conclusion: The '79 series, compared to the '01 series, has stronger, more in-depth characters, more immersive settings, and episodes that each individually have a good mixture of emotions and situations that end in a satisfying manner, leaving you wanting to marathon the episodes ASAP. Although the overall plot flow and purpose of the characters felt better in the '01 series, the '79 series is still worth checking out, especially if you can look past its age. So, whether you've watched one of the other series or have seen one of the movies, give this one a go and watch the various cyborgs with differing abilities save the day by putting their strengths all together.

Meet three normal high school guys with just one thing on their minds: girls. Quiet Kyoichi has been friends with Chiharu ever since they were young, but lately, his feelings have begun to change. Lecherous Makoto, a self-proclaimed master of the rules of romance, is ready to sweep the ladies off their feet. And Yoshihiko, a handsome sports nut, is unfortunately a bit clueless in matters of the heart. 
 
Join this hapless trio for a year of romantic misadventures that will change their lives forever! 
 
(Source: RightStuf)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","The title of the series is explained in the first chapter where the author refers to the quote ""Boys, be ambitious"", which was said by William S. Clark and has become a popular motto in Japan.The anime focuses upon the ups and downs, joys and sorrows of first love and teenage romance. Six students struggle to find the perfect partner and their adolescent limitations. While several characters are taken from stories in the manga, the story of the anime is unrelated to the manga. Each episode begins and ends with a philosophical quote which sums up the episode's content. The anime, while centered on Kyoichi and Chiharu, revolves around seven or eight main characters and their love lives.
","As we all know, life is not a fairytale. It’s cold, mean and will beat you to your knees and keep beating you if you let it. Boys Be… only scratches the surface of reality. 
 
Plot 
 
	Here we have a decent story about a group of friends finding their places in life. Some might fall in love with a star crossed partner, while others perish in utter defeat and depression. As in many love animes, most of their characters are portrayed as those who are deeply in love with their lovers and won’t mind spending their lives together for eternity. In Boys Be… hearts are broken, mended, twisted, doubted and even scared. In essence, this anime does not emphasis on a fairytale, where people marry each other and have many babies. This anime not only emphasizes on the harsh realities of love, but also even on one’s choices.  
 
Character 
 
     Though they aren’t the best characters out there, they are surely the ones we will mostly find relevant and comparable. Their actions are heading the right direction of everyday decisions that we make or will make. To be more specific, when we doubt those we love, we tend to medicate ourselves and bend the rules in game of love. The main protagonist will come off as a guy who is always dragged around, just like he would in most love anime series. Only this time, his revelations, thoughts, actions, and even conclusions are realistic. Not only him, but we also have a common perverted male (who always tries to get a glimpse at girl’s panties) and a hot-ignorant male. As for the womens, they’re spread out from a childhood friend to a unrequited lover. Each archetype is unique in his or her way and goes through problems we all have faced in the past.  
 
Sound 
	 
     The sound would be a 6. Not the best out there, but certainly better than a cassette tape.   
 
Art 
 
     To be honest, the art is horrible. Though made in the 90’s I guess I’ll give it a 7 since some women character in this series actually looks like a women. 
 
Overall 
 
     Every review I give, I try to give a complete and honest opinion about it. This series is absolutely underrated and I truly advise you to watch it. In most anime relationships, characters are portrayed as star crossed lovers and monogamous swans. In this series, they are finally and realistically portrayed as sharks. We are not animals made to support each other but ourselves. Like in relationships, if a bigger fish arrives, we’ll pounce on them like there is no tomorrow. Our greed and temptations is what defines our true selves, hidden behind a mask of lies and bitter sweet indecisiveness. I will have to acknowledge only one character in the series that is truly well played. The male protagonist reveals a side we all have inside of us. How we deal with our problems is up to our little hearts content, but this character’s decision is perfectly realistic. Love is like a bus, every 30 mins a new one arrives. If its broken down, then we’ll politely get off and walk ourselves. 


          
 
       Helpful Overall	 
I have tried to start watching this anime several times the last couple of years, but I always quit during the first episode due to bad animation, awful directing and general dullness. At last I managed to make it through the whole thing and it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. That's not to say it was good. More like a pale, anonymous ""not-a-complete-waste-of-time""... 
 
Animation	 
The last couple of episodes actually look decent, but for the most part, this anime just looks really bad. The animation is stiff and the characters are ugly and unpersonal. 
 
Sound	 
I consider the following sound related variables ""ok"", no more, no less: Voice acting, opening theme, ending theme, background music. Actually, background music was very repetitive, I think there was no more than a handful of tunes that got repeated episode after episode. 
 
Story	 
Very episodic and not too imaginative. It's fun to see people actually confessing their love to eachother in an anime, that doesn't happen that often. But the story itself just wasn't very interesting. Very linear and no actual tension.  
 
Every episode tries to be a bit philosophic, but it fails due to the story being so uninteresting you don't really care about the message. 
 
Character	 
The characters are somewhat likeable (if you disregard the fact that they all look ugly and suffer from a severe loss of depth) and are not as irrationally stupid as in some other animes. The characters were actually the reason I kept watching ""Boys be""; they managed to (barely) keep me interested throughout the episodes despite a boring story and bad looks. 
 
Value	 
Will not watch again. Too boring.

          
 
       Helpful No males in any culture act like these. Sitting around talking about their love lives, constantly in the company of girls otherwise. This story had to be written by a woman or a gay man. In the middle of the story I thought the main character was going to realize he was gay. that would have explained a lot. I usually like the slice of life animes because they are incredibly insightful. This one is an exception. It did not have the truth and warmth that I enjoy so much.

","A good anime on its own but as a sequel it took a really wrong direction.  
 
The first season was really something special with its mix of romance, human life and youkai world. This anime, however, ditched all that and became all about the youkai world and strongly resembles your typical shounen battle anime. 
Nothing wrong with that, but after watching the first season I was really hoping for more of the same and thus I'm really disappointed.  
 
The main characters human friends went from main characters to side characters which was the biggest downer for me. 
 
The romance aspect was cut down to almost none existent. 
 
The main character's personality was changed from Mary Sue to more appropriate for 12-year old. Which is not a bad thing if it was like that from the beginning. But changing it in the middle of the story is not something I'd like to see. 
 
And last, everything deemed to be strong in the first season turned out to really be kinda weak. This is a really common thing in shounen battle animes and really hits the point home why I didn't like this season as much as the last. 
 
To sum up again, this season is fundamentally different from the first season and went, I think, in all the wrong directions. Other than that, it was a solid battle shounen anime.

          
 
       Helpful I really got into this anime because I was looking for something short to watch that was on Netflix. After having seen all the other good ones that Netflix had to offer, I kinda fell to this one as a last resort, and it is just fine (6/10) - nothing too special, nothing too bad either.  
 
The story is all over the place - The overall plot follows Rikuo Nurarihyon, a young yokai leader, who tries to bring his demon clan (who actually helps people rather than hurt them) to overcome the evil Hagorome Gitsune, the evil leader of the Tokyo demon clan. The story seems pretty easy to follow on the surface, but man do they manage to make it confusing in the beginning. Since Rikuo, Rinan (his father), and Nurarihyon (his grandfather) all look pretty similar AND the show simultaneously shows their stories without really telling us who is who, I genuinely thought that these three people were the same people for around seven or eight episodes. It wasn't until the end of the show until the anime really clears up (and it actually gets pretty interesting) and I was like ""Oh.... that makes sense.""  
 
Art and sound - Pretty standard for a 2011 anime - again, nothing really fantastic, nothing really bad either. The endings are actually quite weird to be honest.  
 
Character and enjoyment - I would give characters and enjoyment a solid (7/10) only because it gets pretty good towards the second arc (when they invade Tokyo). I am actually amazed at relatively small shows like this one covering a nice array of characters and dedicating a solid time to each of them. My favorite character is actually Nurarihyon in his youth - he is untouchably slick. Enjoyment stems from good characters for me, so also a nice (7/10).  
 
I did not watch the prequel, nor do I intend to. This anime was definitely not good enough to convince me to spend time to backtrack. Also, from other fellow reviews, it would appear that this one is better anyway.  
 
Overall Rating: its a decent waste of time - if you are in the same boat as me (traveling with a Netflix account and need to download for offline viewing), then its not a bad choice. 

          
 
       Helpful I liked the first season of Nurarihyon.  It wasn’t great, but it was enjoyable.  I was hoping for comparable quality from the second season, and at first I thought I would get it.  I was wrong.   
 
I think my biggest problem with this show is that it takes forever to get to the point.  I don’t mind that at all with shows that only vaguely hint that something might happen and refuse to tell you what it is until it does.  With this show, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen most of the way through.  Maybe I’m just losing patience with entertainment made primarily for kids, but seriously, I got bored.  
 
This show starts out doing something a little different from usual, but by its end it has changed (slightly) into something totally formula.  I could hardly sit through an episode at a time.  When I did finally sit down and try to force myself to finish it, I got to the point where the birth happens, paused the show, and started looking for reviews.  I couldn’t find any negative ones so I decided mine could be the first.   
 
Okay, so this isn’t really negative per se, but all the people clicking “not helpful” just because they don’t like what I have to say will see it that way.  What I’m actually saying is that this show is pretty mediocre overall.  If you don’t expect much you probably won’t be disappointed.

       Helpful Captain Tsubasa, Road to 2002 is not among the best anime in my list. Having said that, I still think it is good and worth watching. For starters do not make the assumption that you need to be interested in sports in order to enjoy this anime. The fact is that even if you don't have the least bit of interest in football/soccer, you should find this to be a fairly entertaining watch. However, bear in mind that there is only so many episodes that you will be able to watch consecutively. My personal limit was ~7 episodes after which I needed a break from the anime. But then I came back to it. I would recommend Captain Tsubasa road to 2002 to anyone searching for a light and relaxing anime to watch in their free time. 
 
Story: 8/10 - The premise is based on the story of the captain of the Brazilian football team and while playing an important match, he remembers all the people that helped him to become who he was. The anime is basically a flashback into his past when he was a kid and it takes the viewers on a journey of his up's and down's as an aspiring professional football player. The matches are interesting to watch and generally the anime is quite entertaining. 
 
Art: 7/10 - Not magnificent by a long shot, but I would not call it complete crap either. I think the art work was &quot;adequate&quot; but you have to remember that this anime is quite old and I dont think it had an exceptionally high budget either.  
 
Sound: 7/10 - The sound elements did their job fairly well. The music was not particularly stunning but in a majority of the cases, it suited the thematic elements of the anime pretty well.  
 
Character: 7/10 - The characters were generally well developed. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 - As I mentioned earlier, I had a limit to how many episodes I could watch consecutively. This is of course true with any other anime unless if you are a robot who never feels sleepy or gets bored. However, I could not handle too many episodes of this at once. Even at the moment, I have not yet completed the whole series and come back to it often when I feel like relaxing. I recommend Captain tsubasa road to 2002 to anime lovers who want something to watch on a relaxing evening when they don't have much to do.

          
 
       Helpful Captain Tsubasa: Road to 2002 tells the story of the fictional Japanese national football/soccer team and how they came to represent Japan in the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea. It combines purely ridiculous (in a good way) football with classic anime action. 
 
The series places a strong emphasis on the progression of a few select characters- from talented middle school students to playing for top European football clubs as adults; Tsubasa Oozora, the title character's journey being most prominent.  
 
That said, there are asides about pretty much every minor character's origins as middle school footballers, or their struggles as they try to make a pro career and break in to the national team. There is also a love interest which is very much a secondary thing in the story and feels a little trite, though I'm sure anyone who's ever fangirl/fanboy/fanwhatevered over anything: a person in their lives, sporting heroes, a TV or anime character, etc., can relate to her passion. 
 
If you ever played a sport competitively, you should enjoy this series. Even people who don't understand the appeal of the game or sports in general will get a feel for what it's all about (or otherwise further affirm that sports are the new opiate of the masses; I understand both sides of it). Football fans in particular will probably smirk at a few football clubs, players, and managers who are clearly send-ups of the real thing.

Story: 6 
 
The story (synopsis available above) is pretty simply. It's simple without the need to get convoluted and is very enjoyable with it's innocent fun but... here comes my biggest issue with the show; it's not handled very well.  
 
To avoid spoilers I won't go into details: there are concepts introduced which don't show up for long periods of time, seeming like they were forgotten or copped out because of time restrains. Transitions between time 'skips' (for lack of a better term) is awkwardly handled, leaving the audience to piece together how much time has passed with very little indication for no reason and, my biggest issue, the extremely sporadic pacing. The pacing is all over the place in this show; some parts are calm and collected while others go from one thing to another so fast that there's little time to take anything in.  
 
Art: 8 
 
The character designs are very 'normal' (for the most part) without the need for flashy in-your-face characters or deformed bodies. The art is overall quite nice and the close-up shots on the instruments are pleasing to the eye. Very fitting with the rest of the show leaving no complaints.  
 
Sound: 10  
 
This is probably bias speaking, especially since jazz is one of my favourite genres--and the 'main' song ""Moanin'"" by Art Blakey being one of my favourites--but the sound of this show was damn near perfect. The voice acting was good and there were no overblown reactions for comedic purpose (that I remember), sound effects were fitting, and the music selection left little to be desired.  
 
Characters: 9 
 
I could go off on numerous tangents about each of the [important] characters but to save time and space:  
 
they were all well written with their own motivations, reasoning, likable and irritable traits, they had fitting reactions and were, in my honest opinion, more relatable/human/'natural' than in most other anime. Although some development is lacking, the execution more than makes up for it if I say so myself.  
 
Overall: 8. 
 
As much as I loved this anime there were numerous issues with the story which I found to be greatly detrimental to the overall show but not enough to make me dislike it. It's a show I'd definitely recommend and think stands on a solid 8/10. 

          
 
       Helpful I think that there are certain anime that come along in our lives that make us rethink our current ratings. They make us rerate the decent shows and the above average shows. They make 7's turn into 6's, and 8's turn into 9's. Why? Because you really don't know where to put them. Here on MAL we can only choose a single number to represent how we feel about the anime. But sometimes I'm left feeling like, ""Oh, this anime was better than so-and-so, so I have to rate it a 8. But it was worse than so-and-so so I have to rate it a 7."" Sakamichi No Apollon is one of those anime that confused me. Reading this review means that you're opting to know why.  
 
Story: 7 
Basic story. I think that often times in anime, if it doesn't have a show-stopping mindfuck of a premise, people rate the story lowly. I think that the only thing that matters is if the story is one that I can read about and then want to watch it. That doesn't make the story anything amazing, but it means that it has potential. I've never watched an anime based in the 60s before. That was cool. I've never watched an anime about jazz music before. That was cool. What the show lacked in is what it became in the latter half of the series. 
 
Art: 10 
I've got nothing but praise for the art in this anime. I kid you not, reading the dialogue wasn't my top priority a lot of the time. To me, the art was impressive. Usually in anime (or at least the ones that I have watched) they use very many lines. In this anime, they use blends. There's no line differentiating the skin that is shaded between the skin that is facing the sun; there's a blended transition. The fluidity of this anime was shocking. If anyone knows anything about anime, they'll know how there's usually a lot of corners cut when it comes to the art and animation. There's usually a lot of loops, and certain angles aren't fucked with. In Sakamichi, especially during their music scenes, there was nothing but captivation and awe within me. Like I said before, I've got nothing but praise for the art. 
 
Sound: 9 
An anime dealing with jazz... that's incredibly cool to me in itself. All this anime got me wanting to do is listen to Moanin' on a endless loop. The beginning theme is one of those themes that I will doubtlessly be listening to over and over. Something about Yuki's voice paired with the lyrics of the song gets me in this audacious mood. Seriously. It makes me want to get off my ass, go outside and live. The ending theme though, I can't say the same for. It wasn't bad by any or all means, but it wasn't captivating. I'd stop listening after the first 5 seconds. Mostly though, the music was enjoyable.  
 
Characters: 7 
This is where the anime began to fall on its face. One minute, I love the characters. The next minute they're doing some horribly dramatic, unnecessary thing. The main character, Nishimi, is probably the worst of them all. He makes the same mistake over and over and over again and makes things a lot worse than they have to be. And it's all is over absolutely nothing and it often escalates too quickly. He needed a heavy dosage of plz calm the fuck down. Sen is a character that I liked for the most part. I think that he was too quick to throw a fist, but I liked him nonetheless. He was funny, carefree and a good friend for most of the series. But he wasn't immune to enticing very worthless drama. Besides his few minor offences of that though, he was a good character. Ri'ko... I'm on the fence about. I have this huge thing against lacklustre, personalitiless, docile females in anime. There are SO many and they're all SO boring. She was a nice character and she did have flaws, she was just a... I don't know, boring character. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
12 episode anime that took me some like 3 days to finish. With that, I wouldn't say that it captured my attention that greatly. But it certainly held it. There are some anime that are just impossible to put down and there are some that are impossible to not finish, even if it's eventually. 3 days isn't bad, but considering that I'm out of college and all I've been doing is eating and working out, it's not good either. I think that in the middle of the series my interest dipped, just to peak again in the last episode. I kept watching though, which means that I enjoyed it enough. 
 
Overall: 8 
What happened when I watched this anime, is that I didn't know whether to rate it a 7 or a 8. It was better than Kaichou wa maid-sama, which I rated a 7, but it was worse than Nana, which I rated an 8. What did I do? Change my rating of Maid-sama to a 6 and Nana to a 9 (plus it's one of my favourite anime, I don't know why it wasn't a 9 anyway). I was so set on rating this anime a 7, but I was really impressed by the ending. If it weren't for that, this anime would have gotten a 7, no question. Judging by the posts on the last episode discussion board people are very up and down about the ending, but in my opinion it was the perfect way to finish of the series on a bittersweet note. It also had me feeling for the characters more than I thought that I would, since I was never 100% invested in them. I was very impressed.  
 
So is 8 an inflation? Sure is. If I could be more specific with my ratings, this anime would probably get a 7.5. Worth the watch, impressive bits, and slightly over average.

          
 
       Helpful This is true masterpiece! 
 
Story revolves around a somewhat lost and depressed shoolkid who, thanks to meeting an amazing person, manages to overcome his own downsides and discover joy in life. 
 
Story and characters. 
There are many amazing characters and 2 main are shown in development. They both have very lovable personality and you just can't stop from falling in love. 
Story is realistic and thought through. If you prefer stereotypical characters of shojo and action mangas this plot isn't for you.  
 
Art and sound. 
Sound is perfect, both voice acting and music. There is a lot of really well done music pieces and no cheezy ""disney-like"" moments. Enjoy pretty awesoem jazz and a bit of rock'n'roll.  
Art is done quite well. This anime is in semi-relaistic style, people aren't deformed and you can easily tell one character from another. I really loved design of characters and environment. 
 
Enjoyment. 
Though there are many very sad moments in ""Kids on slope"", overally this anime leaves you warm and fuzzy inside. I felt like crybaby in the end.  
 
Despite main action happening in school, I'd suggest target audience for this story is older than 20, probably 25+. One needs to have a bit of life experience to fully enjoy the plot. This anime is a must watch for all who like realism and need a little boost to their souls.

Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka?,"Putting his life on the line, Willem Kmetsch leaves his loved ones behind and sets out to battle a mysterious monster, and even though he is victorious, he is rendered frozen in ice. It is during his icy slumber that terrifying creatures known as ""Beasts"" emerge on the Earth's surface and threaten humanity's existence. Willem awakens 500 years later, only to find himself the sole survivor of his race as mankind is wiped out. 
  
Together with the other surviving races, Willem takes refuge on the floating islands in the sky, living in fear of the Beasts below. He lives a life of loneliness and only does odd jobs to get by. One day, he is tasked with being a weapon storehouse caretaker. Thinking nothing of it, Willem accepts, but he soon realizes that these weapons are actually a group of young Leprechauns. Though they bear every resemblance to humans, they have no regard for their own lives, identifying themselves as mere weapons of war. Among them is Chtholly Nota Seniorious, who is more than willing to sacrifice herself if it means defeating the Beasts and ensuring peace. 
  
Willem becomes something of a father figure for the young Leprechauns, watching over them fondly and supporting them in any way he can. He, who once fought so bravely on the frontlines, can now only hope that the ones being sent to battle return safely from the monsters that destroyed his kind. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","It has been over 500 years since the human race almost went extinct at the hands of the fearsome and mysterious ""Beasts"". The surviving races now make their homes, towns, and cities up on floating islands in the sky to keep out of reach of all but the most mobile of Beasts. Only a group of young girls, dubbed the Leprechauns, can wield the ancient Dug Weapons needed to fend off invasions from those dangerous creatures. Into the people's unstable and fleeting lives, where a simple call to certain death could come at any moment, enters an unlikely character: a mysterious man who lost everything in his final battle five hundred years ago, and had awakened from a long, icy slumber. Unable to fight any longer, the man, Willem, becomes the father those kids never had, caring for and nurturing them even as he struggles to come to terms with his new life, in which he feels the pain of helplessly waiting for his loved ones to return home from battle that his 'Daughter' once felt for him so long ago. Together, Willem and the leprechauns gradually come to understand what family means and what is truly worth protecting in their lives.
","When you see a title this long, it really raises the question if the creator put as much as creativity into his work as they did into the title. The original light novel is 5 volumes long while the anime adaptation is 12 episodes. So in essence, it shouldn’t be hard to adapt this into something fans can accept right? Well, that’s not entirely easy to answer as this show isn’t so easily recommendable to anyone. I will say this though, SukaSuka isn’t your typical fantasy thriller that just jumps right into the action. In fact, it’s far more than that as this series attempts to craft a tearjerking fantasy drama to reach expectations. 
 
I have to admit, watching SukaSuka took me some time to accept the story. The first few episodes has an atmospheric feel with its world setting, characters, and plot. We meet Willem, the male protagonist who happens to be the last human in a post-apocalyptic world. The show makes it clear that humans are extinct as the anime opens up with a battle scene involving them and the Beasts. Flash forward into the present timeline and we see how the world has changed since then. Now there are floating islands that feel so isolated from each other despite being populated with otherworldly species. One of the most prominent of these species are the Leprechauns, characters who can wield ancient Dug weapons that can destroy Beasts. In the meantime, Willem meets Chtholly, a leprechaun with a mysterious past. The show establishes Willem as a friend, father figure, and comrade for the Leprechauns. 
 
Right off the bat, I can say that SukaSuka’s characters are quite mysterious. Chtholly has a peculiar past that is explored throughout the show. Willem also has a past that I can say it’s too pleasant to remember. Then, there are the Leprechauns. The show creates an eerie feel as it blends them with child innocence and unsettling fear. It’s through revelations that Willem realizes what they really are and their roles in this series. Now, the more I got curious about the show, the more I wonder how the story plans to develop Willem and Chtholly’s relationship. Thankfully, this series doesn’t neglect their presence together and as each episode progresses, we learn more about the both of them. Character chemistry between Willem and Chtholly is also what I describe as charming that develops from friendship to romance. Willem also serves as a father figure for the younger Leprechauns. And in turn, the Leprechauns seems to grow really fond of him. This also brings a different side of the show as Willem realizes that the Leprechauns has a lack of fear. Because of this, the show makes it clear that Willem wants to avert any tragedy that can bestow on them. This goes to show how much Willem cares about the Leprechauns. It may also be possible that Willem doesn’t want history to repeat itself because of the way humans were wiped out. Regardless of how others treat him, he hopes to be a light of hope in this post-apocalyptic world. 
 
As a show with many species, you’ll often see characters that are far from ordinary. Besides Leprechauns, there are also trolls, goblins, and many other type of characters with animal traits. This also brings a racial issue into the show. It puts Willem into a compromising position at times as certain races does not like his presence in their world. (for their own personal reasons) However, what I do find interesting about this series is Willem’s main role. Does he play the role of a hero or someone that just wants to avoid tragedy again? It’s hard to judge entirely based on the characterization alone so in retrospect, the show leaves it more open ended for viewers to decide.  
 
Despite my initial impression of SukaSuka, I still find that the show suffers from several problems that holds itself back. First, the show really doesn’t avoid generic pitfalls you see in typical light novel adaptations. While the show has minimal fan service, it still has the cringe moments between Willem and various female characters. One particular trope (played out more as a joke) are the massages that attempts to make scenes sound much more lascivious than it appears to be. Not to mention, SukaSuka’s comedy feels really dry at times. It hardly make me laugh and although I realize the show isn’t built for that, it doesn’t even manage to ever draw a chuckle from me. Furthermore, I can’t really say the character relationship building outside of Willem/Chtholly to be worth mentioning. Oh and in terms of adaptation standards, the show does add some original content in attempt to make the story flow better. Does it really work out? That’s for me to know and you to find out. 
 
Taking a look at the animation, I have to admit that SukaSuka captured the atmospheric setting right along with its world fiction. Essentially, the atmospheric setting brings a spiritual feel. The character designs also has variety with the wide range of different hair styles and colors; with a credible reason too beyond just being decorative especially for the Leprechauns. The action is captivating and feels magical with getting its point across. While the series doesn’t have graphic violence, it does contain blood to show the dreadful feel of its story. The Beasts are also designed with a malevolent nature and some of them reminds me of Lovecraftian horror fiction. Character expressions is realistic and very human like with most of its characters. 
 
Soundtrack is distinguishable with a combination of being melancholic, haunting, and cheerful. As I had expected, the theme songs are very moody with its choreography. The character voicing acting also connects well with their personalities in particular with Willem, Chtholly, and Grick. As most of the Leprechauns are quite young, stepping into the shoes of these characters is not easy. However, I am proud to say that the show captured their roles pretty damn well and make you connected to them. 
 
The tenderness of this show is what attracted me to watching this. I have to admit, SukaSuka has a sublime-like creativity with its world setting and story. I wasn’t too invested into the characters at first though over time, Willem and Chtholly’s relationship started to really grown to me. Still, like most light novel adaptations these days, SukaSuka falls into the trap of generic tropes. Furthermore, I don’t think this series is recommendable for anyone especially those that have less tolerance towards moody shows. I’d still give it a try though. It’s not a masterpiece but for a title that’s longer than 3 sentences, it does earn more attention than that.

Our story is about a man, Willem Kmetsch, with a troubled past and problems to adjust to the current world after the world's surface was destroyed. Most people existing now are of new races (furries), and someone like Willem is considered a freak of nature looking the way he does, with no animal traits or anything. 
 
Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? or just SKSK is a deceptive anime when given its premise, as Willem gets assigned a new job with barely any requirements it appears that he will be taking care of what appear to be a lot of tiny girls. 
 
Now, Willem working as the caretaker for these leprechauns, is going to go through a lot of things and experience what it's like being the person who has to await for their dear ones to return from the frontlines. 
 
SKSK is a 12 episode anime that explores a new angle of war, rarely do we ever have the main character being someone not working at the frontline but instead can only hope the girls sent out all come home back unscathed. 
 
In a steampunk like world, we get to see a man with a troubled past taking care of young girls with no attachment or value to their lives, knowing they are made for the sole purpose to fight until they break or succeed in their missions. Willem slowly lets himself open up and adopts them as his own, but as he opens more and more of himself to these soldiers, the more vulnerable he makes himself. 
 
Witnessing some of the most organic development of love and tragedy. With interesting showcase of both the heartwarming home life and the heartbreaking reality of war. Every episode left me either with a feel good sensation or nervous nail biting hoping everything will turn out alright. 
 
For people who enjoy action (from street fights to monster slaying) and seeing a ragtag bunch of people creating a powerful bond worthy of being considered a true family, SKSK is a 12 episode anime I highly recommend. 
As the story progress, we get to know more of what happen to the world, what role Willem once played and the truths behind the leprechauns. 
 
If the very first minute of the first episode (exactly 1minute) catches your attention, then you will enjoy this anime. Honestly, if the first minute truly hooked you, do not drop the anime and stick to the very end. 
This anime will have a fair share of slice of life episodes mixed with the war, as those parts are incredibly important for Willem's character development and for us as an audience to understand the adorable leprechauns (and how the people of the world seems them). 
 
As someone who have not read the light novels, I am saved by ignorance not knowing if the story missed out on anything vital. But for what the anime was by itself, it was one of the best ones I watched this season.

6,204,107,5.51850481,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Yumeria,"On his 16th birthday, Tomokazu Mikuri had a realistic dream where he sees a girl battling a giant floating monstrosity. When he wakes up, he is surprised that the girl is actually sleeping next to him... Whenever he sleeps from now on, he ends up back at the dream world, and more and more people that he knows keep showing up there too. He finds out from a mysterious masked woman in the dream world named Silk that they are fighting against one named Faydoom, and he is the one who provides the powers to those girls so that they can fight these monsters. And so it goes... 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Harem', 'Super Power']",none,"I had a blast watching Yumeria. Being a person who is rather tired of the harem genre, I was surprised that I loved this show as I much as I did. While it doesn't boast many new ideas than what's already been done, it's comedy feels a bit refreshing, the art is very vibrant and beautiful, the girls in the show are all lovely, and there is enough gratuitous fan service to satisfy without offending. 
 What sets this immediately from other harem titles that came out around the same time here in the U.S. (Marburaho and Girls Bravo), is the personality of Tomakazu Mikuri. He's still as much of a loser as any other character you've seen, but unlike Keitaro in Love Hina, Kazuki in Maburaho, or whatever the kid's name in Girls Bravo was, Mikuri has a solid sense of comedic timing that goes beyond just seeing a girl naked in a hot spring and doing a double take, or being on the receiving end of a super kick for seeing panties (that's all still intact, mind you). He's a pretty refreshing character whose more well-rounded than other guys, and I compare him to Tenchi, who is also a bit underrated in the same respect. All five girls are running cliches that you've seen elsewhere, but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. Here's a brief cap of them; 
 Mone: Speaks only one word, borders on kawaii overload at times 
 Nanase: Mikuri's sexy guardian, pretty ditzy, but is she hot! 
 Mizuki: The brainy girl next door, bashfulness makes her really cute 
 Kuyou: Mikuri's childhood friend with little sister appeal rather than love rival. 
 Neneko: Probably would've been cuter if Mone didn't exist, but they gel well.  
  
 Pick and choose them as individuals, but as a unit, they are all enjoyable. The abusive homeroom teacher is awesome as well.  
 The animation is pretty slick, even if footage is reused for the ladies' transformation scenes (I didn't complain, these girls are worth leering at in my book), and the character designs are full of life, especially Nanase, who bounces around more than a D.O.A girl. The final two episodes do some really nice visual tricks that are kinda cool, and the action plays out pretty well placed without getting too cluttered or confusing. The dream world put me in the mind of a backdrop ripped out of .hack//SIGN, but it's surreal nonetheless. Whether it's for the beautiful girls or....oh hell, it's the girls...Yumeria is great to look at. Take that, super-skinny girls in Burn Up W. 
 Most of the humor is partly due to the English dubbed track. Most of the voice actors do a pretty decent job. Chris Patton, a voice actor I hate (it's an understatement just how much I don't like him) is alright as Mikuri, and Britanny Karbowski does a great job at accentuating Mone's....well, ""mones"" to reflect what mood she's in. It's not super impressive, but it's the little things like that to make it less monotone. 
 IN CLOSING: Yumeria is one of the last harem-themed comedies I enjoyed before they began to overflow the anime market, deluding the formula with carbon copies (Samurai Harem spawns Onimari Himari) simply existing to show girls in compromising positions. It's light-hearted, fun, not too perverted to make you feel dirty but gives enough for great eye candy, the girls are sexy and cute and entertaining (except maybe Neneko), and tiny bits of suspense and intrigue happens early on to keep you interested in the plot, even if the story is a bit flawed. All in all, this is a pretty solid title.

       Helpful Take any ecchi, sci-fi anime, remove ALL of the story and character depth, and you get Yumeria.  This is anime was produced solely to fill the dead space between commercials.  To put another way, don't waste your time.

          
 
       Helpful (Be advised that I only watched five episodes before dropping this anime. However, that does not mean that I didn’t do my research.) 
 
Yumeria certainly isn’t an anime that I’d watch again. I actually couldn’t even watch it all the way through. I lasted for maybe five episodes, and then I finally realized that nothing new was going to happen, and that this was just some harem/ecchi wannabe. 
 
There’s nothing wrong with harem or ecchi, if it’s executed well. If the anime wasn’t filled with clichés, had a good story, etc., then I would actually be glad to watch. If it was cliché, but everything else was great, I would also watch. However, Yumeria was just barely executed decently. 
 
I found the story to be lacking. I actually liked the first episode—I laughed a little, and I thought it would get better—but there’s simply nothing added to it. When I think of fighting monsters in a dream world, I think beautiful graphics, great transformations, vivid attacks, unique twists. Yumeria has none of this. Maybe I was too hopeful. 
 
Speaking of beautiful graphics and vivid attacks, the art did almost nothing to execute this. The animation was, in most parts, a bit faulty. Some things were drawn fairly well; a majority of things were not. For example, in the opening, the characters look different than they do in the actual anime. They just seem drawn wrong. 
 
In retrospect, I didn’t like the art style in general. If that’s what you like, then, by all means, take my opinion with a grain of salt. 
 
The music—I can’t really comment on it. I don’t remember any music in the episodes that I watched. The opening song wasn’t my thing; the ending song I never stayed to listen to. 
 
For Yumeria, characters got the highest rating at 7. I hate Tomokazu, our typical ""normal"" perverted main character... Except when he interacts with Mone.  
 
The girls were bearable, not necessarily because they were unique (they aren't unique at all - we have the biggest lolita, the cute one, the shy one with feelings for Tomokazu, the obnoxious busty one, and the obsessed stalker) or seemed real but because I thought they were amusing, and I liked the way that they interacted with one another (just not with Tomokazu). They were sort of funny. 
 
The girls in Yumeria are generally quite kawaii. Mone is my personal favorite. She's just adorable, though a little obnoxious. The transformation scenes were probably the best part of the animation—I thought they were fairly cool. 
 
Plus, I love me some cute anime girls—just like my absolute favorite character, Ishikari. 
 
Ishikari's just amazing… HE should have been the main character. Like seriously. 
 
Overall, Yumeria isn’t an anime to watch if you want something great and jarring. It isn’t good to watch if you want to see some good, hardcore ecchi, either. If you’re someone looking for some good light ecchi—nothing explicit—then you’re either going to have to find those diamonds in the rough or wait until you’re ready for the real stuff. 
 
If you want something light-hearted and slightly amusing, and you’re open to laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of the Yumeria, you might find this fairly enjoyable. Just don’t expect much, if anything.

6,37623,108,5.492071594,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen,"Modest Heroes will consist of three shorts by three different directors: ""Kanini & Kanino"" (""Kanini to Kanino"") by Hiromasa Yonebayashi will be a 15-minute fantasy adventure story of two crab siblings, and will be long. ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" (""Samurai Egg"") by Yoshiyuki Momose will be a 15-minute ""human drama"" showing the love between a mother and a boy. ""Invisible"" (""Tōmei Ningen"") by Akihiko Yamashita will be a 14-minute ""action spectacle"" that centers on the lonely struggle of one invisible man. Studio Ponoc describes the shorts as ""tales of modest heroes of our times."" 
 
(Source: ANN, edited)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","
","""Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen (Modest Heroes)"" is Studio Ponac's second movie project after their debut film, ""Mary to Majo no Hana (Mary and the Witch's Flower)"". The film is a collection of three non sequential shorts that each tell a unique story about a heroic character and his or her respective journey. ""Modest Heroes"" is obviously not going to beat ""Mary and the Witch's Flower"", but it's still an enjoyable watch and it did certainly kept me interested the whole way through. 
 
Short One: ""Kanini & Kanino"" 
""Kanini & Kanino"" surrounds the tale of two crab siblings whose life of living underwater becomes drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river. One night, one of the siblings attempts to travel to the surface, only for something dramatic to occur, ultimately leaving the two siblings to fend for themselves in the vast river environment. I can't really say much about the short. I enjoyed the visuals way more than the characters or the plot, with its fantastic blend of 2D animation with splashes of CGI for the river environment that is eye-catchingly beautiful to say the least (despite the CGI fish, but whatever). I'm not really invested in Kanini or Kanino, as forgettable as they are, and the fact that the short doesn't have any dialog hurts their dynamics as a whole. For the story and characters to be lacking in depth, the visual did make up for it to be considered for an enjoyable one-time watch. 
 
Short Two: ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" 
""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" is about the relationship between a mother and her son, Shun, who has a severe egg allergy that in-contact, could cause a life-threatening case in which Shun only has minutes to live. The short is based off a true story (claimed by the director) and it does a pretty good job keeping me interested in the characters and how they deal with Shun's condition. The mother is overly protected of Shun and tries her hardest to protect him from any harm, just to amend for all the times that she isn't there for him. Shun himself quickly learns to stay strong and formidable despite his unfortunate state and is eager to overcome any obstacles in his life to prove that he isn't frail and weak. The characters in this short are way more realistic and the hand-drawn artstyle complements it by having a sort of nostalgic feel, reminiscent of a children's storybook. The animation is fluid and the movements are more expressive that doesn't distract you from the overall atmosphere of the short. The intriguing aesthetic and the lovable character makes this short exceedingly enjoyable for anybody to enjoy, and this, along with the next short, produces a well crafted compilation if it weren't for the first short.  
 
Short Three: ""Invisible"" 
""Invisible"" contains an interesting and ingenious concept that is explored in a very creative way. The short follows an invisible man, whom others cannot see. The man is required to carry a heavy object since he could easily be carried by a gust of wind without it. The short basically surrounds a day of his life, in which he ponders about his identity in life and his struggle of loneliness. What makes the short especially unique is through several brilliant action-packed moments that is exemplified by the gripping animation and the spectacular choreographer of the whole segment. Aesthetically, the short is bleak and almost depressing with its dimmed colors and almost dreary tone that sets it apart from the bright and colorful visuals of the previous two shorts. The Invisible-Man himself carries a dispirited mood that I can't help but feel sympathetic for. These design choices overall make the conclusion of the short extremely satisfying and makes the whole experience well-worth the watch. 
 
So what can I say? Studio Ponac did a fine job producing these shorts and I highly recommend this to those who are fans of their previous film. Creatively impressive and tremendously entertaining, ""Modest Heroes"" is huge step for Studio Ponac to work with other directors and their consistency in quality has me anxiously waiting for their next project. 

          
 
       Helpful Modest Heroes consists of three shorts aimed at children. The first short is about two brothers braving the dangers of the river to save their father from a fish. It is a straightforward story that children will enjoy and adults will not be too interest by. The second short is about a boy that is allergic to eggs. This has more application to adult life because it shows how the mother must change her lifestyle for the safety of her son, and it shows how there could be any number of unknown threats with such a common food as egg. The best short is about an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible. It is my favourite anime short because of how it handles this premise. The art style is not smooth and fluffy nor sharp and edgy, and has a particular aesthetic, helped by the animation style, to visually explain what sort of a person this invisible man is. Although he is invisible, he still does the right thing and helps people even when they don't even acknowledge his existence. He is the most modest hero of all.  
Modest Heroes is primarily for children, and while not all the shorts may appeal to you, The Invisible Man is the best short ever made and deserves your attention. 

          
 
       Helpful Appearance and technicality is not everything in an anime : These 3 short movies produced by the Studio Ponoc seems more a beautiful technical demonstration of the studio pure animation capabilities than real narrative works, in-depth reflections or compelling/original stories.  
 
The first one is a mildly fantastic family friendly scenario with superficial events, classic stereotypes and extremely predictable outcomes.  
The second one is an ordinary slice of life story about allergy. 
The last one which seems at first the most original of the three was obviously inspired by John Carpenter's version of the Invisible Man and ends up in an ordinary fashion instead of bending to the mystical symbolism or spiritual side (which would have been more interesting to my opinion). 
 
Therefore, everything looks like very superficial and do not offer much aside from the beauty of the drawing, lighting and animation.  
When compared to other Japanese short movies such as ""Memories"" or simply recent anime series such as ""Mob Psycho 100"" or ""Mushishi"" which features unusual scenario, strange and disturbing symbolism, ambivalent emotion, and unpredictable events (and beautiful animation as well) you can realize the huge difference in terms of narrative and reflective qualities. 
 
  Therefore, unless you are interested solely in animation technical details, I do not recommend watching these very ordinary and somewhat trivial short movies.

6,390,109,5.476274638,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Suzuka,"Yamato Akitsuki travels to Tokyo alone to study in one of the high schools located within the area. He lives in with his aunt who operates a public bath solely for the ladies in the local district and begins his normal high-school life. One day, he chances upon a girl in school and is immediately mesmerized by her beauty. He is shocked when he realizes later that the girl, Suzuka, is actually living next door to him. From then on, Yamato's ordinary life begins to change little by little. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sports', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","Suzuka is a sports-themed romance comedy that intertwines the pursuit of love and athletics. The story is based around Yamato Akitsuki, a young man from rural Hiroshima Prefecture moving to the big city of Tokyo, and his new next-door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina, a skilled high jumper. Yamato falls in love with Suzuka and pursuing a relationship with her he joins the track and field team hoping to impress her. After joining, Yamato discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter.
Suzuka's character-driven plot predominantly makes use of dramatic structure to facilitate character development. Characterization is further achieved through the use of character back-story. The story in general employs a realistic tone, but occasionally uses surreal humour. Some events covered in the story are: track competitions, vacations, culture festivals, and outings to a Karaoke Box and a theme park. The manga and anime follow the same storyline, though there are minor differences. One of these changes is that the nude scenes are less graphic in the anime than the manga. Another disparity is the hair color of some of the characters such as the character Miki, who is depicted as having bright red hair on the covers of the manga, but is portrayed with red-brown hair in the anime.
","WARNING:LOTS &amp; LOTS OF DRAMA 
 
I had to put that up as like myself i really hate &quot;Drama Abuse&quot; if an anime is lacking in story/plot they add Drama in to make you feels more connected with it. 
  
 
Story: 
 
A cliche sort of story between he see's Suzuka at a school ground jumping the High Jump and falls head over heals for her but then realises she lives NEXT DOOR. 
Althought the cliche part is a bit annoying the way this turns into a 2 way love battle is nice and is really realistic as the way it developed.   
OH I FORGOT DRAMA, Well lets say nearly every episode has some sort of drama but its gets extreme near end which evolks a punch, Oh and its gets even more drama near the end. 
 
Slight Spoiler 
*It ended how i wanted too :)* 
*Well Kinda* 
 
Characters: 
 
Both female girls are developed greatly and when a relationship start its really unexpected but a nice twist for the story. 
You see enough from there past to make it ok (not alot) but enough so you know they had a past. 
IF YOU DONT HATE SUZUKA (charatcer) ALONG THE WAY THEN THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU..... 
She is the reason for &quot;HEAVY DRAMA&quot; what i mainly hate about her is the way she treats the Main Lead character i really felt sorry for him he tryed everything she would dismiss it and also talk down to him, come on shes a perfect girl but he doesnt deserve this so somehow in this anime you feel really really connected with the Main Guy if you are a male :p. 
 
 
Art-Sound: 
 
Art - Very Nice  
Sound - Quite perfect. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
Well i was ADDICTED i admit it i watched like this series of 24 in about 2 days :). its one of a few i was addicted to but i would say the Drama and they way Suzuka acts towards the main guy is terrible, I just dont know why he didnt give it but THIS is the reason you feel more involved with this anime which is rare. 
But somehow the ending made this a Perfect anime. 
But if enjoyment is happy feelings then this isnt here it made me more annoyed than happy :) 
 
Final: 
 
I would say its more a 9.8 not quite a 10 but very close if they made Suzuka more nicer then defently a 10. 
But DRAMA in this is annoying so dont watch this if you like happy/comedy's this anime got me fustrated which an anime should do but its one of those &quot;HAVE TO WATCH&quot; so i would advise watch it but be warned . 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Suzuka is not your typical anime romance/drama, whereas with a lot of anime romance it is either a harem or some magical tale, Suzuka stands apart as being a more realistic tale. The serise is based around Yamato and the girl of his dreams, Suzuka and all the trials and tribulations surrounding being round her. This series does take a panning from some people about the characters decisions during the series and how obvious it is that it is not the right thing to say, but for me that is the beauty of this anime, the fact is when you are in love you do say things that you don't mean and are too stubborn to take back, I found myself cringing watching events unfold as have happend to me in real life, and looking to see how the characters got through those difficulties.  
 
I find it hard to critise artwork and sound in anime, the artwork in Suzuka is not up to the standard of modern Gonzo series, but it works and is true to the manga artwork, the characters are all very well done and as for the sound, the characters all feel right, there isn't an out of place cast member so it all works well. 
 
The main characters are all developed throughout the series and you do get to know the characters and their manerisms throughout the series, as I said earlier the characters come in for some abuse from some people, but isn't that the point? That the charcters are flawed like everyone else and can produce the reactions that make us want to go and rant on the forums about how stupid they have been?  
 
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even all the bits that made me watch it from behind the chair and pause to get the courage up to watch the next bit, I thought I was alone in doing this but I gave this series to a friend and he did the same thing. Its a must watch in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful There's something wrong when my favorite character is the cat.  
I didn't really like much about this show. I thought that the music could be better. I thought the art wasn't anything to talk about. I wasn't all that crazy about an of the characters, and I think they cheated on the plot a little.  
First off they dedicate a lot to track and feild in this show. And yet in the end it's sorta ignored for other things. I couldn't stand Suzuka half the time and Yamato wasn't my favorite character in the later part of the series either.  
My major disliking for the show is Suzuka. One second she was warm and then she was cold and you never got to know her well enough to understand. You know next to nothing about her but that she's mourning over someone that she can't let go of. And yeah I can understand that but she had mood changes that made me want to just give up. Yamato was childish and ended up hurting people. He was also selfish and even though he said he got it he never really did. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like the characters, and by the end I was totally disintrested. Maybe this show is for some people but it's not for me.

To a fashionable socialite like Yuzu, this inconvenient event is just another opportunity to make new friends, fall in love, and finally experience a first kiss. Unfortunately, Yuzu's dreams and style do not conform with her new ultrastrict, all-girls school, filled with obedient shut-ins and overachieving grade-skippers. Her gaudy appearance manages to grab the attention of Mei Aihara, the beautiful and imposing student council president, who immediately proceeds to sensually caress Yuzu's body in an effort to confiscate her cellphone. 
 
Thoroughly exhausted from her first day, Yuzu arrives home and discovers a shocking truth—Mei is actually her new step-sister! Though Yuzu initially tries to be friendly with her, Mei's cold shoulder routine forces Yuzu to begin teasing her. But before Yuzu can finish her sentence, Mei forces her to the ground and kisses her, with Yuzu desperately trying to break free. Once done, Mei storms out of the room, leaving Yuzu to ponder the true nature of her first kiss, and the secrets behind the tortured expression in the eyes of her new sister.

","I won't go into political statements like other reviewers as it does not fit this anime whatsoever and frankly, it's unneeded.  
 
Citrus in a nutshell is a manga adaptation badly done, rushed and at times bland. 
It doesn't do anything too badly but doesn't do it right either. At the end of the show Mei is still a enigma, Yuzu doesn't go into depth as a character past the first impressions and everyone else seems to be there just for the ride. No doubt this is the result of a rushed adaptation.  
 
I can't recall a single song or OST that striked me as grandiose and the animation/art is what you would expect in every single other show. 
 
This is the definition of an average anime that just so happens to be yuri, nothing more, nothing less.

Aright I'm going to be completely honest in this review, In a sense this show is Really fucked up, I mean Really fucked up, but at the same time it's beautiful. I personally Really loved this show, when I first started I was a little creeped out but it slowly grew on me. Yes there are a lot of problems in the world with sexual assault and rape, but I don't think this show is like that. There are a lot of things this show could have done better. But all in all it was a beautiful romance that I enjoyed watching. I do have to say that this will never happen in real life but even so it was still beautiful and I'm happy I spent my time watching it

          
 
       Helpful Potential spoilers for the manga below... 
 
First - ignore all the hate directed at Citrus online. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. Other reviews and discussions will mock you for enjoying something they call trashy and melodramatic. They mock you for being entertained by something they have deemed so basic and depraved. And yet, after you've watched a few episodes you're thinking, 'why do I like this so much and why do I want to see more if everyone says this is garbage?' 
 
It's because Saburouta is punching WAY above her weight on Citrus. It's like someone took Jane Austen and plonked her down in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga. Yes, the very thing that all those haters will mock you for seeing in Citrus that they claim doesn't actually exist - the excellent writing, the deep character development, the touching emotional content - really is there, and it's been written quite purposefully and skillfully. 
 
To begin, let's put aside that this is yuri for the moment. Yes, you know it is, I know it is, everyone knows it is. But the point of Citrus is absolutely not the fact that it's yuri. Saburouta could have written this story with two asexually reproducing spores as the main characters and it would have been equally as compelling. The fact that it's yuri is not implicitly fan-service, and if you've read the manga you will know that Saburouta dishes out the fan service in such tiny servings as to lack any nourishment whatsoever. More on why this is an issue in a moment.  
 
Let's get the other elephant in the room out of the way - the non-consensual sexual content in the first episodes/manga issues. Remember that this is a work of fiction and the reader is not meant to condone or approve of the actions of any of the characters. This is the classic dramatic question of, ""is evil something you are or something you do?"" To begin with, Mei has been taken advantage of, used, and basically treated like an automaton by dear old gramps ever since her Dad left (we'll get to that later). At the beginning of the story, there is no Mei - there is just a robot that does what needs to be done in the name of the Aihara family. She has no mother, no father, and the only affection she has ever known has been the cruel affection of the jerk teacher that she was arranged to marry even though he was planning on leaving her once he had the academy. She has literally never had a proper emotional relationship with anyone, and all she understands is the use of physical affection as a means of controlling others, as she has been controlled herself. But yes, you say, Mei should know better. She should know the difference between right and wrong! Oh really? Who taught Mei right from wrong? That's right, no one! She's acting out the only way she knows how. And, by the end of episode nine after the run-in with Matsuri - shock of all shocks, Mei has learned right from wrong because never again in the entire series do we see Mei act this way. And guess who teaches Mei wrong from right by her actions - Yuzu does. 
 
I'd also like to address the actions of Matsuri that a lot of people have a problem with - don't forget that Matsuri is just a kid. Remember being a kid? Remember how bad your judgement was, and how you did a lot of stupid things that people called you out for? Again, you say, Matsuri should know right from wrong. But again, who taught her right from wrong - her workaholic, absent parents? Right. Matsuri isn't capable of understanding the consequences of her actions, something that Yuzu points out to her several times. ""Relationships are not a game"" and ""love does not come as easily as it does in a manga"" says Yuzu to Matsuri. Matsuri is similar to Mei (as Mei informs her on the train, and why Mei forgives Matsuri so easily) in that Matsuri is literally a kid alone in the world. But instead of closing herself off to the rest of the world like Mei did, Matsuri sought out attention - the bad kind - online with her ""clients"". Mei isn't joking or being self-sacrificing when she tells Yuzu ""that girls needs you"". Mei understands more than anyone, despite Matsuri's actions, that Matsuri needs a source of goodness and love in her life. This is why Mei says that Yuzu is ""one of those meddlesome people who give you love even though you didn't ask for it"". By the end of episode nine, Matsuri has very subtly grown as a person and again, never does any of that bad stuff again for the rest of the series (so far).  
 
Let's get to the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. They are, quite literally and figuratively, the yin to the other's yang. And let's get one thing out of the way right now - Mei and Yuzu are as gay as the day is long from the outset. This is why I said this story could have been about two asexually reproducing spores - the fact that they are gay has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing to do with this story. Why do I say this? Because neither Yuzu or Mei are struggling with their sexuality, ever. Being gay is so natural to them that they never question it. Need proof? Remember the scene where Yuzu is reading the sister manga, and Harumin (who wins as best friend in a manga/anime ever btw) suddenly scissors her. Yuzu *freaks out* and Harumin says ""this book shows positions for two women"". Why is Harumin so casual and Yuzu so freaked out? Because to Harumin, that position means literally nothing other than a curiousity - Harumin is so confident in her heterosexuality that she can do that without worrying what it means. Yuzu, on the other hand, is mortified because scissoring means something completely different to her - it means an expression of love, an expression of love she one days hopes to share with Mei. Which is what makes it such an uncomfortable situation with Harumin, for whom she has only a friendship type of love. 
 
And Mei, well, Mei is just super gay. And this is where Citrus is worth a deeper look and a rewatch or two. The thing you need to know about Mei is that she falls for Yuzu *for real* in episode eight. You know after Yuzu takes Mei to say goodbye to her father, Shou? After Mei sees Matsuri awkwardly kissing Yuzu in the street? Yeah - right there. That's where Mei falls for Yuzu. The cute little finger twidding scene with her stuffed bear followed by the passionate hug of Yuzu - right there. And here's where the central conflict of the series begins: Mei simultaneously loves Yuzu but also wants to push Yuzu away because of all the baggage that comes with loving Yuzu. Mei is pissed off with herself for being in love with Yuzu, and every interaction for the rest of the anime/manga is an expression of the internal love/hate that Mei has for Yuzu. This is what makes the story so bittersweet - we love Yuzu, Yuzu wants Mei to love her, Mei wants to love Yuzu, we want Mei to love Yuzu, but....Mei just can't allow herself to do that. If you've ever been in a similar situation, you know what's up.   
 
But back to the gayness. Saburouta never asks us to question that they are gay, as is the case with most ""will they or won't they"" yuri - we are meant to accept it as easily as the both of them do. So Saburouta has taken the standard yuri trope and cast it aside. 
 
I believe that Saburouta very purposely drew Mei and Yuzu as lesbians from the outset for the very reason that this anime/manga is getting so much hate - she wanted to remove the ability of the audience to fetishize the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. For the typical yuri audience, this is anathema - it defies the whole reason they read yuri in the first place. Citrus is, as its core, a very cute and bittersweet love story that most people - gay, straight, or otherwise, can relate to.  
 
In Yuzu, Saburouta has created one of the most likeable, and dare I say loveable characters in manga/anime. Yes, her earnestness and plucky, can-do, kampai attitude is a standard trope, but there is way more to her than that. She actually shares a lot with Mei and Matsuri, parental attentiveness-wise. Her Mom is cool but absent, and new Dad Shou literally married her Mom just so that Mei would have a place to live away from gramps and he's off who-knows-where-doing-who-knows-what. The very first scene of the anime/manga is Yuzu hanging out with the slutty mean girls doing the teen-sex-talk thing. Yuzu desperately wants to belong somewhere, even if it is pretending and exaggerating with the nasty gyarus. She is the light to Mei's dark, again, literally and figuratively. Where Yuzu is overflowing with kindness, love, goodness, and understanding, Mei is a completely dark and vacant empty vessel. Over the series, you watch as Yuzu's love flows into Mei and completely changes her. But what about Mei, what does Mei do for Yuzu? Let's face it - Yuzu is a scatterbrained airhead. She acts without thinking, she has very little personal discipline, and would be distracted by a squirrel playing outside the window. For Yuzu, Mei is a much-needed reality check. When Yuzu is off floating around in teddy bear clouds, Mei is the one who is there to make sure her feet don't get out beyond reach. And Yuzu realizes this and also changes her behavior to be a more diligent student (with mixed results). The two of them are inextricably intertwined and their lives cannot be complete - at all - without the other. 
 
This is why Citrus, and Saburouta, are absolute genius. The subtlety, the way that you can go back and rewatch past episodes re-read past chapters with present knowledge to unlock the motivations of the characters is brilliant.

","Day Break Illusion is a series that could of joined Madoka Magica in building the dark magical girl sub-genre, instead it simply copied it with little originality. What little originality this series does contain comes from its Tarot Card Reading theme which doesn't effect the progression of the series as much as you might think. Day Break Illusion can be exciting at times and deliver emotional scenes here and there but overall, it's a disappointment. Not a failure but a disappointment. Everything is actually really predictable except for what happens to Luna or the information dump in episode eleven. Day Break Illusion's story is centered around young girls who are called upon to sacrifice themselves and save the world as magical girls. In the beginning that was actually well performed, with each girl finding their own way to overcome or ignore the fact that they're basically executioners but we needed an antagonist to really get the ball rolling. Too bad that we literally never figure out why the antagonist (Cerebrum) does what he does until the last two episodes. Cerebrum was such a poorly executed villain, I felt that this show might have actually been better if the producer left him out, let the Daemonia appear as the creatures that naturally exist and focus on the girls mental and emotional development during their times as magical girls. This is just one of the reasons why Madoka Magica managed to be such a hit. 
 
 
Day Break Illusion tries way to hard to be Madoka Magica and that becomes incredibly noticeable after the first episode onward. After 12 episodes, you will finally know what Cerebrum is after and you'll most likely bust out laughing or facepalm because it's just plain stupid. This series really seems to give nothing to you but questions and the few answers that are given are either silly or seriously late for you to even care. Despite how disappointing Day Break Illusion it's not all bad I guess. The battle scenes between the magical girls and Daemonia are actually enjoyable but the animation makes some parts of the fight unrecognizable. 
 
 
Day Break Illusion's cast is made up of your average group of magical girls; the optimist, the tomboy, the joker and the weakling. The girl's primarily survive through the power of friendship and it's just so cheesy, I felt like I should of been eating mac and cheese while watching this series. Day Break Illusion gets points for action and disturbing atmosphere but not much else.

          
 
       Helpful Ah, another one of those dark mahou shoujo that try to cash in from the fad Madoka Magica created with its hype and financial success. Although it does a fine job at having polarized imagery of happy moeblobs on one hand and creepy murderous monsters on the other, it still fails to accomplish the thing that actually made Madoka Magica such a hit. Which one is that you may wonder? Could it be the deep characterization? The elaborate storytelling? The amazing analysis of its various themes? HELL NO, that show sucked in all that. 
… It was the production values, ok? 
 
AIC is no SHAFT. They can’t throw a mountain of money at it, nor do they have overrated anime creators in their disposal to hype the damn thing six months before it even begins to air. And this is why despite all the good efforts the artwork of Gen’ei doesn’t look very good and the soundtrack is just ok at best. The character designs are practically laughable and the motions during battles are very crude. The action bits that SHOULD feel epic for the build-up they get, end up being nothing but a random line of magic attacks with no real strategy and an excuse for the heroine to use the power of friendship. 
 
Anyways, as a stand-alone show it is not bad but sure becomes sort of repetitive in its plot very soon. Some person is lured to the dark side, turns to monster, does bad things, and the girls are sent to kill it. The theme of how you are willing to do murder in order to fulfill your deepest desires can be interesting but not when it is done in an episodic manner. Every episode is essentially 15 minutes of fuzzy slice of life, followed by 5 minutes of photo-epileptic battles full of gore and death around people we will never see again. It is hard to get attached to any of the characters since every conflict is resolved in the very episode it is created. Also, they resort to that stupid amnesia gimmick where the monsters and the victims of the monsters are erased from everybody’s memories. Their deaths are treated as accidents, which is a cheap way to maintain the status quo but also removes the drama from the setting. And sure, the main characters, the mahou shoujo themselves, remember everything but even they seem to get over it by the next episode. 
 
Once again the main heroine ends up being the most basic and dull of them all, constantly trying to reason with the monsters and save everybody with the power of love and all that crap. It doesn’t work to the most part (thank God) but it still makes you wonder why they even have her in the demon busting team. She constantly refuses to fight, which results to many lives being endangered, hers included. I mean I would understand if they kept her in the sidelines until she gains experience; but moving her from JUST GOT SUPERPOWERS straight to FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE is overkill and helps nobody in the longrun. 
 
I am also not fond of themes that are rubbed in your face, something which all dark mahou shojo do. They end up having depressing stuff along with cute moeblobs in order to manipulate emotions in the most obvious and lazy of methods. In case you have watched Blood C, Black Rock Shooter, or Symphogear, you will recognize that unsettling feeling of the uncanny valley. Now it’s cute. WHAM. Now it’s gory. WHAM. Now it’s loli fan service. And yes, that is too an issue in case you don’t take pleasure in watching naked moeblobs with squirrel voices for a few minutes before blood starts splattering all over the screen. 
 
What I do like a lot though is the attention they gave to slowly explain what is going on. The monsters have motivations, and the magic comes from an explained source, something which beats having no real reason than being evil and having magic. It is also not trolling you to think it is a fluffy show for 3 episodes before it throws in someone important dying. In those departments, it blows Madoka Magica out of the water. The problem still remains though; the drama and conflicts are piss poor and rushed, always resolved with brute force and mind control. Nothing matters past the episode it takes place in. 
 
The show is not bad in overall but lacks tremendously in tension. Despite being dark and violent, you just can’t get into it when they throw lolicon fan service amongst silly drawn characters and expect you to gasp at the tragedies they face before they forget them in 5 minutes. So in the long run it fails to be something actually memorable and poignant. Hell, I can even throw in the fact that Madoka also worked because most had never seen a deconstruction of the genre before, so they were taken by surprise. The same trick will never work with any show that tries to pull the same rabbit out of the same hat so soon. And boy, does this hat look ugly by now.

          
 
       Helpful Horror comes from inside and is directed inside. People who want to kill us are quite scary, but they’re a very specific problem. True horror is in realizing that we can be the killers, that we can be what we hate. It throws a big wrench in our grand narrative and shatters it to pieces. That’s why we limit our consciousness, assume the patriarchy or the media or the government is to blame for it all. Negative feelings are bad, but the true problem must be outside us. 
 
Obvious comparisons to Madoka spring up, but these are superficial comparisons. The latter is more existential and philosophical, less concerned with the emotions of its characters and relying more on structure and mechanics to deliver its philosophical idea. Daybreak Illusion is far more emotional, fantastical and wild. Each character has distinct demeanor, it has many arcs which peek into other people’s lives and the main subject matter is emotion, not the grand meaning of life. 
 
With that aside, let’s focus on what’s actually going on here, something deeper than how ‘logical’ the story is. Cliched stories that flood your cinema have an external evil. These are comfortable fantasies. The bad is always outside of us. We need to kill it. Some of them improve and we can converse with these evil, but it’s still outside. The third stage is recognizing something inside of us is evil, but an external thing brings it out. The fourth, and most horrifying stage, is realizing that each of us partakes in the conspiracy against the human race. 
 
Daybreak Illusion belongs in the third category, which is a weird one. Stories that reach there are aware of theme exploration, that their story shouldn’t just give us a good time with pretty visuals. You can’t reach that stage without trying to be deep. The anime really wants to be more, not just a copy of Madoka but to compete against it and expand on the genre. It does that fine enough, but not good enough. 
 
Daemonia are the big evil, but they’re amplifiers of already-present negative emotions. Yet by pushing the source of the bad outside, the series isolates it and doesn’t explore their issues too deeply. Many of the characters become ‘not themselves’ when the Daemonia take over, but that’s just avoiding the horror. The horror is realizing that the bad side is just as a part of ourselves as the good side. 
 
The series is always close to truly delving into the depths of emotion, but never getting there. A climatic conflict does it the best, showing how we’re responsible to each other. Main character finds herself needing to actually face another person’s emotions, and digging inside of her to find out what she really feels. It’s an interesting position to put the main character in, but it doesn’t solve the big conflict. All ends with a big Final Boss Fight full of flashing lights and explosions. 
 
In the most of the arcs though, the victims are just innocent people who are tempted by the devil. By the time they start their rampage, they’re supposedly ‘not themselves’. The escape from horror isn’t deliberate. Our heroes talk to the Daemonia and are frigthened by the fact that these are people. In a way, by showing us that these distorted monsters are still actually human beings, we’re supposed to be all the more horrified by our negative feelings. Yet this doesn’t work, since these Daemonia too end up too alien from us, their cause being external. People transform into monsters because something infected them, not because they made decisions (or were born in environments) that turned them into monsters. 
 
For the characters in the story these people are real enough, even when they come looking like man-eating plants. What it does better than Madoka is showing the journey and emotional development of heroes caught in the midst of a cosmic battle. Characters actually have a will and their reactions to the events. If in the first episodes the anime seems aimless, it’s only because it really tells the story of these girls and nothing else. Any time the story loses its direction is when it sways from it. 
 
Although these characters aren’t particularly deep, they’re given distinct views about the battle, the world and what they get from it. In the first few episodes the anime actually threatens to improve on Madoka, since it’s far more in touch with what kind of dilemmas and conflicts would arise in this situation. Of course it uses Monster of the Week format, because anything else is a distraction. At its most exciting, we see them clashing and arguing and talking about what they’re going through. How it feels like to be the hero is where the excitement lies. 
 
The drop in quality comes later. Suddenly we get a more rigid structure and a main villain. Already in the beginning we had some meaningless technobabble, but it avoided getting technical. Battle ended when there was no emotions left to explore in that conflict. The final conflict also ends thanks to the heroes reaching a conclusion, deciding to rebel against their own fate. Yet we don’t actually see them reaching this conclusion. 
 
A trait of messy anime, especially those with huge epic stories and wacky art styles is that they have a slew of themes and they don’t know which one to focus on, or even which one fit their structure. First the anime start with exploring how negative emotions get the best of us, how the evil is supposed to be inside of us. Then this is thrown away, not completely resolved and instead out of nowhere the girls are fighting against fate. 
 
Now, if the series had something to say about emotional determinism it would be fine. Exploring the conflict of will and choice is the next big thing, since so far we all agree we can’t control our emotions. The whole idea of fate comes from the Tarot, though, not because the series wanted to explore it in the first place. Messy structures tend to arise naturally from theme-focused anime, but here it’s because the show couldn’t focus on its ideas. 
 
At least on the surface it works well enough. As a simple heroic story, I’d take this over many others. Even if its exploration is shallow, it gains from it enough emotional weight. These battles matter. We see the characters going through something during these moments of violence and how their psyche is affected. It’s not just ‘beat up those deamons and get some shwarma’. It hasn’t reached the heights it’s aiming for, but it’s still an exciting story with great visuals. For some, that’s enough.

6,11981,112,5.417184895,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari,"The young girls of Mitakihara happily live their lives, occasionally fighting off evil, but otherwise going about their peaceful, everyday routines. However, Homura Akemi feels that something is wrong with this unusually pleasant atmosphere—though the others remain oblivious, she can't help but suspect that there is more to what is going on than meets the eye: someone who should not exist is currently present to join in on their activities. 
 
 Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari  follows Homura in her struggle to uncover the painful truth behind the mysterious circumstances, as she selfishly and desperately fights for the sake of her undying love in this despair-ridden conclusion to the story of five magical girls. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Thriller']","In the fictional city of Mitakihara, Japan, a middle school student named Madoka Kaname and her best friend, Sayaka Miki encounter a small, cat-like creature named Kyubey. It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and mysterious magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey. Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe, an upperclassman at the same school who is also a magical girl. Noticing their indecisiveness on whether to become a magical girl, Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka along on her witch hunts so they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.However, after witnessing Mami's death at the hands of a witch, Madoka realizes the life of a magical girl is filled with suffering and pain. This is further enforced by the appearance of Kyoko Sakura, a veteran magical girl whose wish unintentionally caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers magical girls give up their souls to form Soul Gems, the source of their magic, and that when Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, magical girls are converted into witches. Sayaka decides to become a magical girl after learning that doing so would allow her to heal a young musician whom she admires. However, her classmate Hitomi Shizuki confesses her love to him first, causing Sayaka to become disillusioned and fall into an inescapable despair that turns her into a witch. Kyubey reveals to Madoka that he is of an alien race that has been harvesting the emotions of magical girls for centuries to use as energy to counteract the spread of entropy, and thus stave off the heat death of the universe. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate. 
Madoka and Kyoko attempt to reverse Sayaka's transformation, but the plan fails and Kyoko is forced to sacrifice herself to allow Madoka to escape, leaving Homura as the only remaining magical girl. Following this, an extremely powerful witch known as Walpurgisnacht approaches the city. Homura attempts to stop it, but is defeated. She begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch when Madoka arrives. With the past month's events in mind, Madoka decides to become a magical girl and makes a wish to stop the creation of all witches in the past, present, and future. The paradoxical nature of her wish causes her to transcend into a godlike psychopomp, and establishes a new ""Law of Cycles"" in which magical girls are purified and disappear into a higher plane instead of becoming witches. A new reality, in which Homura is the only one who remembers Madoka, is formed. Homura vows to continue fighting in honor of Madoka and the world she cherished.
","I love the Madoka franchise. I had a great time watching this film. There's a lot to scrutinize here. My 7 is a high scoring. 
 
According to Urobuchi, ""Rebellion"" has nothing to do with the anime TV series. Seeing as it is, though, a sequel to the recap films it is up to debate whether this film is even canonical or not. Rebellion asks for a lot from viewers. It questions older fans by ""severing"" itself from the main series and develops Urobuchi's central themes in some unconventional ways. Simultaneously it begs the fanbase of the original series to follow along a confusing and often far-flung narrative in a new and possibly pretentious direction. Due to the position ""away"" from the TV series Urobuchi has asserted it leads me to believe that this film is both a belaboring of past concepts and strengthening of a young franchise whilst torpedoing into more abstract territory. Luckily though, the film rarely breaks into feeling dishonest about it's content. As it seems to set the stage for more Mahou Shoujo in the future, it is my opinion while this is not a masterpiece it certainly is a milestone achievement and should be watched. The Mahou Shoujo series may eventually become the centerpiece of Urobuchi's philosophy, and with the help of Shinbou Akiyuki may become a stylistic anime classic. 
 
Let me begin with the ending. Rebellion quickly draws huge and obvious comparisons to The End of Evangelion for it's confusing and jumbled close. Unlike The End of Evangelion though there is extremely little closure. Most of the finale of the film is actually slightly incomprehensible. Sure, we as fans can try and decipher the meaning behind some of the films closing events but we really know nothing definitive yet. The film is rarely abstract in the sense of interpretation, but deals heavily in abstractions. While usually this is a misstep by writers that end up writing conclusions exerting self-importance, Urobuchi manages to keep us feasting on his heroines' misfortune. The difference between the two movies deemed the ""deconstructions"" of their respective genres though is that End of Evangelion reaches a catharsis that was underlying since the first episode. Anno's vehicle for explanation, Shinji, uses his movie time finally deciding whether it is best to live or die, much like Homura.  Shinji's decision did not bring into question anything that was previously canonical, and strengthens the finale thematically. The ultimate flaw here was that by having Homura choose life in the final scene of the film, it is corrupting the original narrative slightly. 
 
Madoka's TV series ending was of course up to interpretation, but it was clear that Akemi Homura was in a powerful love with Kaname Madoka. By having Homura pull Madoka back into the plane of physical beings it springboards a lot of questions about their relationship. Has Homura forsaken her love for Madoka and turned it into a lust? Are we supposed to believe that her succumbing to absence of Madoka put her under so much strain that she would snap? Did her life truly become so dependent on Madoka that she would do anything to keep her around? And if that last question is true, why would Homura want to become the embodiment of evil by theoretically killing God? The hardest to understand is Madoka here, who despite being a God at this point does little to vocalize her opinion of what Homura is doing. The end of the film is a massive cliffhanger. The film does promise more great work, but it does not do what it claims to have been doing. It does not provide a conclusion, neither thematically to the series nor definitively to the story. It leaves much to understand about Madoka and her power as a deity, and about Homura. We understood that Homura was miserable but how does she feel now? The conclusion is steeped in massive mystique, and despite delivering a wonderful character study, seems a bit too convenient. 
 
What do I mean? There's a lot of convenience in this film in the narrative aspect, and it's often glossed over. There's a huge amount of content to unravel here, so it makes sense that not everything is explained, nor am I demanding it is. But there are certain plot points that just seem strikingly convenient - Why is Nagisa hidden the whole time as Bebe? If it was to not attract too much attention to the fact her memories had been altered, why wasn't it still simply obvious enough that Bebe was an extremely strange entity? Why were Charlotte and Sayaka chosen as the witches to guide Homura to Madoka? And the biggest question of all, why did Kyuubey and the Incubators care so much as to push Homura's Soul Gem to the limit? And didn't this twist seem rather non-sequitur? How did we get from the ending of the TV series where Homura was, to this ""world in world"" maze? Without explaining these things, the boundlessness and confusing nature of the Sci-Fi aspect in the Mahou Shoujo series seems to dwarf the tragedy aspect and make it harder to sympathize with. If the film aimed to create less ""twist moments"" we wouldn't be left with so many blatantly unexplained plot points and often paradoxical content.  
 
But that's part of the fun of Madoka too! I mean it! The Mahou Shoujo series is butt-clenchingly entertaining! It's fun to try and follow the zany twists and turns of the labyrinth-like film, even to the point where paradoxes occur. The ultimate themes from Urobuchi transcend the narrative content, and he explains them in an outrageous manner: Selfishness vs. Selflessness, the tragedy of losing a loved one and it's aftereffects, and the paradoxical nature of human love... Urobuchi has created a work of art that is worth trying to understand. He's vocalized his most honest feelings about these topics, and he's done so believably! And through the mouths of 15-year-old girls! Even if this wasn't the closure you were hoping for after episode 12, this is certainly just as exciting. It's a writer really putting himself on the line, questioning his diehard fanbase by challenging them with new questions and innovating and debunking all sorts of anime cliches. He is doing something unexpected yet not contrary. How easily he could have put this series to rest. It may be convenient that Homura's motives are up to question at the end of the film, but thankfully it means more work from a great writer who loves what he is doing. 
 
Also remember this film is about Homura. Is Sayaka the lead? No. Is Kyouko the lead? No. Is Mami the head? Hue. The other characters remain mostly static in the film, but that is okay. We have to remember that the other characters technically weren't even in this film. It's a one-man and one Incubator and one God show. 
 
As for the animation, Shinbou Akiyuki really out does himself here, and the age-old complaint regarding Studio SHAFT's budget can be completely ignored. This movie has the production and innovative genius to outshine most all animated films before it. The use of stop-motion, interpretive setting, and distinct and disturbing imagery all help catapult this film leagues ahead of it's contemporaries. It's an ambitious thing, this direction. The sparsity and seemingly obsessively exact backgrounds leave each shot a photograph. And by the time the film has reached it's second half the quick cuts bring powerful imagery together by linking each frame. Even without dialogue this film would have an incredible visual narrative. I'd like to praise a particular moment when Madoka descends into Homura's maze and there's a rapid blast of shots showing the two together. An ethical tour-de-force brought on by the cunning direction. Not only a visual treat, it's a visual feast. The cinematography is outstanding, especially for an animated film. And by the time you get to the transformation sequences, you're very aware that SHAFT is simply showing off. I love it. 
 
The original soundtrack draws on it's predecessors heavily, and for the most part uses that incredible score to liven and darken the mood. The new arrangements are all on par, not a tune out of place. Or should I say all but one. The Round Cake song. It's charming and gleeful, but at the same time... I definitely haven't been so disturbed by the series at any other point in the film. Good work keeping me baffled, SHAFT. The opening and ending songs were both nice. It seems SHAFT decided to play it safe in an experimental film and use the same bands to open and close. It's nice for a nostalgic effect but really these two songs add nothing of value to the film, as opposed to The End of Evangelion where Tumbling Down is the emotional height of the film. The soundtrack is still very strong, but the ""dark"" pop of Kalafina at the close gave a highly artificial feel. I don't even think the end of the film needed music. 
 
So should you watch Rebellion? Absolutely. It's a movie that is going to get a lot of buzz, and not simply in the anime community. It's a strong film, and joins the ranks of other baffling anime films like The End of Evangelion and Adolescence of Utena. It leaves a lot to chew and can be re-watched several times and still feel fresh. Though it remains a confusing piece of history in the Mahou Shoujo series, it will no doubt be an important pivot in Urobuchi Gen's canon of writing.

       Helpful A summary of my opinions, if you don't want to read the actual review: 
-The plot is either nonexistent or straight-out dumb 
-The characters are even flatter than they were in the original 
-Homura, the only half-decent character, becomes an utter ideological shitstorm 
-Shaft has a giant fucking budget and really wants you to know 
-The art is not as cool as it should have been because it lacks thematic/symbolic backing 
-Rebellion is a pretentious acid trip of a movie 
 
 
 
Plot 
 
To be completely honest, Madoka Magica has never quite had a conventional plot. Instead things are stringed together with bits of loose thematics and messages that, at times, encapsulate well the insanity occurring. Rebellion spends no such effort, either on an overarching story or on themes.  
 
The vast majority of the movie presents no apparent storyline or structure to follow. Instead it flaunts its prodigious budget with meaningless scenes. Several moments could be considered ‘climactic’ or monumental to the story’s and characters’ progressions, but with so many happening they become drawn-out and bland. Instances do not relate and cannot be cohesively connected. Rebellion awards nearly every frame with some sort of immense philosophical translation, therein forming an unintelligible array of alternate meanings that don’t adhere to anything in particular. 
 
While Rebellion was supposed to have ‘tied up loose ends’ for Madoka’s unsatisfactory ending, in truth it complicated the situation with the lacking plot of the final section of the movie. Homura discovers that she in reality is comatose, the new Mitakihara City an alternate universe she had created. Yes, it does attempt to shove down your throat a ridiculous story, and one that doesn’t exactly add any sort of precision. An absurd quantity of bizarre visuals pertain to this one fragmented plot point? Seriously? It tries, but doesn’t succeed, to create relevance for the previous events of the movie.  
 
Characters 
 
Yay. Another horrible aspect of Madoka Magica; Rebellion. 
 
Evidently Homura is the main character - the movie is shown entirely through her perspective. This is to say, she’s the one who first realizes that shit is going on, and she’s the only one who actually aims to resolve the issue. All other characters are, while present, completely useless. 
 
Poor Homura endures something of a development, beginning as a naive, sensitive girl to the terror she ends up as. This is reminiscent to her progression during one specific episode of Madoka Magica, though executed far worse. Her entire character arc comes across as choppy; it doesn’t retain any of the same, well, sense. Homura constantly makes frenzied and downright awful decisions that never seem to reflect her strategic intelligence. Instead, her inconsistency contributes *shock factor* that doesn’t refer to her personality in the slightest, only the pretentious air Rebellion is determined to sustain.  
 
What about the other protagonists? Well, there’s an irrelevant Madoka, a violent Mami, a watered-down Kyoko, an especially incompetent Sayaka, and best of all, a random witch-girl who fulfills no legitimate purpose. To sum it up, all other characters are oblivious, shallow, and utterly futile. They exist only to perform exaggerated transformation scenes and gape in shock at all the bullshit Homura does. It really is impossible to ascertain what the girls know and don’t know, as Rebellion likes to ‘keep you on your toes’ with their motives. Even though it’s safe to assume that they realize absolutely nothing, being the most impervious 14 year-olds on the face of the planet. 
 
Animation & Sound 
 
Well gee. If it isn’t something positive I can say concerning this trainwreck. Shaft, surprisingly, did take advantage of one of its many assets and utilized their gargantuan budget once every 0.05 seconds. This is to say that Rebellion is incredibly appealing, as far as animation and art go. Visuals are fluid to a ludicrous degree, making action scenes remarkably interesting, even if nobody really cares how they end.  
 
Madoka Magica’s intriguing use of symbolism amidst witch labyrinths is lost, but optically mirrored, in Rebellion. It possesses the same, if not higher, level of asinine graphics. Coupled with the unabridged void of plot, characters, and general sense, one intense acid trip of a movie is formed. Basically, Shaft has the resources and lack of care to do whatever it wants, and does it.  
 
The sound isn’t especially noteworthy. It’s on par with the original Madoka, hence enticing, dark music and squeaky loli voices. Decent enough sound effects and background noise.

Do you ever watch something that blows away your expectations completely? When I was watching this short series, I was blown away by how something so simple can be so complex at the same time. When I watch a flash cartoon, I expect something funny, silly, and sometimes downright vulgar. Typically, flash animation is not very provocative...however, this series stepped into that fray and did what most flash animators fail to do...tell a captivating story. 
 
The story primarily revolves around a female rabbit named Doki who meets a male cat named Nabi at a vending machine. She immediately becomes infatuated with him while he tries to avoid her knowing that it's socially unacceptable for a cat and rabbit to fall in love. In theory, it's a pretty simple story, but the societal issues of the story really pull at the heart strings when it comes to their relationship and really give the story life. 
 
Here's what I think makes this a great story... 
 
First of all, the entire series has zero dialogue. All that is shown are voiceless, animated characters in motion to the sound of music. It's the classic example of how a picture tells a thousand words because each episode is 3-5 minutes, has no dialogue, and tells a beautiful story of romance, friendship, and societal views and change. The music plays an integral role as it essentially tells the story with no dialogue. Even if you can't understand the music, the tone it sets along with the flow of the story helps set the mood.  
 
Secondly, I was absolutely stunned at how it approached the topic of intercultural/interracial relationships in society. While I'm not sure how it is viewed in Korea (the origin of the cartoon), in the United States, intercultural and interracial relationships were taboo for quite a period of time. Among some cultures and societies, it still is, but generally speaking it is more socially accepted now.  While it is more socially acceptable now, there was a time when it wasn't and you could argue explains in some nice detail about how that sort of society works.  
 
With that being said, I could argue that there are some pretty minor flaws. The series really didn't go into much detail as to WHY these relationships are taboo. In most cultures, there's usually a good reason...some reasons being because of a superiority complex...some being political reasons...and so on and so on. Here's a really minor complaint for me but I really felt like this was too short. There really wasn't that much ""character development"" between Doki and Nabi...as well as with the side characters. It's so vague in parts that I had a difficult time trying to connect the Jjinta Set (the three thug rabbits) and their relationship to Doki. However, I will say this...the character development that is there...is FANTASTIC. I'm not sure if this was only 5 episodes equaling 23 minutes in length because the story ended there...but I can assure you there's more to this story that can be told in more than 23 minutes. A minor complaint that I had that I didn't use to affect the score is I really wish there were English subtitles for the songs. Perhaps there are and I haven't found them but it really would help out in regards to understanding the minor nuances within the story. 
 
I'm going to come out and say this right now. Of all the flash animated cartoons I've ever watched, this series is the best flash animation series...EVER. I enjoy my share of flash animation cartoons, mostly for comedy. However, I've never seen one that's had such a captivating love story with the addition of social commentary. I will admit, I shed a few tears watching this and considering that was done by flash animation, that's impressive. I will admit, the first two episodes tested my patience a bit. I liked them, but didn't necessarily love them. The third episode is when the ball really got going for me and by the fourth and fifth episodes, I was in love with this series. I would recommend this series to anyone that's ever found themselves in an intercultural/interracial relationship, whether it be love, friendship, or even on the political spectrum to give this a watch. It's deep despite it's simplicity and it really shows how the power of love can change friendships and how it can change society for the greater good.

       Helpful I saw the first episode or ""step"" to this show and couldn't understand why it was getting a lot of hype. Curious I stuck around and watched it till the end. I have to say for those twenty minutes my face expression went from blank to *GASP*. 
 
Story: The story is plainly forbidden love. It's a more serious subject, that is evident in our world today. I'm glad that a few animators took the time to create something short and cute with that kind of topic.  
 
Art: The art is just cute. I couldn't help but aww at Doki and Nabi many many many times.  
 
Sound: No spoken words, just songs. Don't worry about not being able to speak Korean. You just gotta feel the rhythm and the animation tells the story without the words.  
 
Character: Ahhh the characters. Now the characters, seem typical. You have the guy, the girl, the envious one who likes the girl. But don't let this stop you from watching this!  
 
Enjoyment/Overall: It's short, it's cute, it touches an important subject and it's very enjoyable! It's definitely a good watch and I recommend it to all those who wish to watch it.

I also forgot what exactly the teams fighted for ahahah. But i can say, i feel this anime is one of the best exciting anime I ever watched as a little kid!  
 
My goodness! I REALLY wanna see this anime again! i wish i can find it... though it seems impossible, i still have hope for it heheheh 

          
 
       Helpful THUNDERBIRDS 2086, an anime adaptation of the 1960s show, was my first ever introduction to anime, or Japanese animation. I could have done better considering all the wonderful shows the genre has to offer, but this show makes for a great starting point and years later I still have a soft spot for it.  
 
The premise is pretty much the same as the original show: an elite rescue force commandeers a fleet of special vehicles to disaster areas. Any updates made are fairly typical: as back in the 1970s-80s space operas were the rage, the show not only features perils from space (a critical space station reactor, a mutated plant, an explorer ship returning after nine decades), but also alien encounters (notably the recurring antagonist Star Crusher, an unseen but near-omnipresent being who can control peoples' minds). Fortunately the Thunderbird vehicles are suitably upgraded and made into awesome mecha: a shuttle that merges with two other ships to create a juggernaut carrier, a submarine, a space station, and a collection of other awesome mech, that the series puts to use in various episodes.  
 
A word of warning though: despite the various adventures the cast experience, they aren't too well characterized - a young hero, his love interest, a veteran, a Texas cowboy and a token black cadet and their commander and that's about it. These aren't the cast from the original show, so that could put TB fans off (and ironically at the time of its first airing in Japan anime viewers were put off because it wasn't Japanese enough – no giant robots or alien invaders). Still, the episode stories are fairly good and more interesting (more dramatic and tense, as befits anime) to my mind than what the original show had.  
 
The series is generally rather obscure, but boasts some spectacular space visuals, fairly good dubbing by anime veteran Peter Fernandez (SPEED RACER, STAR BLAZERS) and a stirring musical score from Kentaro Haneda (one of Japan's finest composers and piano players). It makes for a great compelling watch.

","""The fastest way to happiness is to avoid looking at reality,"" 
 
I’m completely amazed by this anime. I have no idea why I haven’t heard of it earlier. I came watching this with absolutely no expectations, and after reading the reviews praising its greatness, I was surely expecting to be disappointed, or at least unsatisfied. Despite my worries, Denpa teki na Kanojo proved me wrong.  
 
A majority of the anime delves on the psychological state of individuals who were unfortunately succumbed to traumatic experiences. Because of this, much of the “antagonists” are made to believe that happiness can only be gained through taking other people’s happiness away. This is just a safe explanation as the events that occur during the climaxes of each episode will surely shock you. The build-up towards these climaxes are smooth and paced perfectly. It’s almost completely shrouded in mystery, giving us little doses of explanations that will make us wonder, but not exactly know what will come forth. This results in a satisfying viewing experience.  
 
The atmosphere and mood perfectly reflect on the show’s themes, with repeated glimpses of dark streets, broken signs, and barren buildings. It shows the right amount of blood and gore, leaving you feeling irked and disturbed, but not excessively so. The frightening imagery is amazingly displayed to show us the extent of such disturbing actions, without overstaying its welcome. Truth be told, the animation is perfect for this type of show. 
 
The characters are in the spotlight, and that’s exactly what you would expect from a psychological thriller. While MAL doesn’t exactly label Denpa-teki within the psychological genre, I personally feel like it has a lot to say about the state-of-mind of the “antagonists”. Despite the problems being quickly resolved, the shock value is going to really make a lasting impact on you. It makes you watch in awe the amount of extremes people are willing to take to fulfill their happiness. 
 
For being two episodes, it’s a shame the anime wasn’t longer. It had the potential to completely cover the themes it was trying to convey to the viewer, but because of its short length (even shorter than the runtime of an average film), it did not have the capacity to fully express its topics. Even so, this anime has done more than enough to satisfy me, and to also make me contemplate the reasons for why people would go through such lengths to fulfill their own view of what it is to be happy. I know this is an anime so it’s all just an exaggeration, but it’s fascinating to wonder about the state-of-minds of actual deemed “insane people” sometimes. All in all, Denpa-teki na Kanojo is a show that I am surprisingly impressed by.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 10/10 The story is outstanding for a two episode OVA. The storyline and the *SPOILERideaofhappypointsSPOILER* are original. The pacing was great, the plot wasn't given away too much at the beginning nor the end. Information and the plot were given away bit by bit along the two episodes. I especially liked the effects in the anime. For example, when the image of the very same statue pops up at regular intervals. Another example is when only words, letters and maybe a character or two shows up against a black background behind them. But it's not just the words, letters and characters on the black backgrounds, it's also the CONTENT in the words, letters and backgrounds. As I'm terrible at explaining, I'll just have to do with another example. ""It has reached him..."" So WHAT has reached him? Who knows? The ""..."" also means that something will bound to happen sometime. This adds the feeling of mystery and darkness into the anime.  
 
Art: 7/10 I absolutely love the backgrounds. The backgrounds were drawn well and were extremely detailed and physically attractive. The animations were also clearly planned and well thought. For example, in the sky in the majority of the scenes, the clouds moves slowly along like it would be in real life (yes, I've even noticed that), but in most anime, the clouds would just be static. This adds to the effects of reality. However, the character designs were a bit off to me. Sometimes, the eyes were too high and the hair & clothes were too plain and simple which contrasted with the beautiful backgrounds and pulled down the overall mark for the art (especially Juu). I would have gave the art section a 10/10 if the character art were more decent. Also, the Characters' thoughts and feelings were clearly portrayed. You can easily perceive how the character is feeling by their facial expression.  
 
Sound: 9/10 The background music brings out the atmosphere and gives you the type of outcome you would expect in the anime. For example, you wouldn't expect fluffy fairies and recipies for cupcakes would you? Another good point is that the background music stops and enters at the correct moment. This includes when the setting is in a normal, everyday classroom and usual conversations. However, I find that the school is a bit too quiet to be a school. It's peculiar to find a school with only a few people who were actually talking. I expect a school to be much busier than that. The voice actors have also done an excellent job, the emotions, thoughts and feelings were portrayed clearly through their voices. Their voices were also neither too high pitched or too low.  
 
Character: 10/10 The characters' personalities are realistic and can be related to people in reality. There aren't any Mary Sues/Gary Stus appearing in the anime. I can see a decent amount of thought put into character development. They're fairly realistic and not the over-exaggerated stereotypical -dere character. At first glance, it seems that Juu's personality is the only one which is properly developed. If you find that the other characters' personalities are a bit too 'plain', don't forget that the anime is mainly in Juu's perspective. It's impossible for you to see deeply into other people's personalities.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 It could be just me. I personally really enjoyed this anime. I especially liked the background music(or it could be just me or the fact that I just like creepy/depressing music). In my opinion, this is amongst one of the best thriller anime I've watched so far.  
 
Overall: 10/10 Overall, I personally believe that Denpa Teki na Kanojo is an outstanding anime for a two episode OVA. It's clearly well thought out and portrays reality. The strong points are character development and the story(and my enjoyment)

          
 
       Helpful Let me start off by first saying this OVA should've been a full series, Watching this anime made me realize why I first started watching anime in the first place.   Maybe it's just me but the ever repeating cycle of School based animes with boring leads and stereotypical archetype females became quite dull; that being said Denpa Teki na Kanojo is a breath of fresh air that left me hungering for more. 
 
In my eyes their are several reasons why i will watch an anime through and through -A. Well written story with no plot holes, B. Great Cast of characters that you really like and C. Great Director and Staff who have proven themselves before.  This anime has all 3, but the biggest reason I believe this anime succeeds is the characters.   
 
Juuzawa made this anime for me, I loved his character (then again i like delinquents and/or characters that don't give a crap)  FINALLY! I MEAN FINALLY! a character in a school setting anime that isn't a pushover that does anything the girls tell him to do.  Ochibana complemented  Juuzawa perfectly,  The reasoning for her attachment to him is a bit quaint but truth be told that doesn't matter.   
 
Im not gonna mention parts of the story because this is a 2 episode OVA, any mentioning of the story for an OVA this short feels like a spoiler.  Director Kanbe, Mamoru did a great job with this one, the voice actors match all the characters spot on, and the dark yet upbeat feel of this anime makes for a great watch. 
 
It's a shame that an anime as good as this couldn't get a full season considering the crap that Japan spews out.  I would've given it a perfect 10 but considering how short the OVA is I can only give it a 9

He enters ""The Alternative Trivia Research Club"" where the first of his many sexual encounters takes place. Despite that, he finds out that both of his foster sisters are in love with him, and he has to make a choice—who does he really love. Nikita Shindou loves the world of animation more than anything; he puts his life into it. He has never fallen for a real, living girl, until the day he meets Ren Aoi. 
We're introduced to young man Nikita Shindou as he's making his way through Akihabara, which is his main haunt and the place where he gets all his bishōjo games, which he plays in his room all alone in the dark. Keeping them a secret from his sister who just moved in a few months ago after their parents had died, Nikita loves playing up the characters having sex with each other and manipulating them as he can. To his surprise on his way home though, he comes across a park he hadn't remembered before and sees a beautiful woman there, one that reminds him strikingly of an older Sheeta from Laputa: Castle in the Sky! Even more amazing is that she comes into his room in some sort of dream sequence not too much later and keeps calling him Pazu and the two fool around quite a bit only for it to end up as a dream.
","This is nothing more than average hentai. The plot makes no sense, at least for what little plot there is. So it's really like watching random hentai clips, but with the same guy. That's fine, I guess, but that's why it's just average. 
 
The sex scenes are good, though all the girls have a similar look and body type (check out the cover photo to see examples), and their personalities seem nearly identical as well. They are all horny, not really shy, not really kinky, and right to the point. All of it is very tame, meaning no rape, no blood/virgins, not even any anal. Though there is incest with his sister, but the only thing different with her from the other characters is that she calls him brother. 
 
Mostly how it goes is that the guy basically comes in contact with different women, has a short conversation that attempts to give explanation about who the woman is and why she is there, and then the woman seems to realize she's horny and quickly seduces him in about 3 sentences. 
 
The way they try to loosely connect the characters (rather than letting it just be random, stand-alone strangers) makes it seem like you're missing something, like there's some back-story they forgot to let you in on. It's like I missed an episode, but I didn't. 
 
If you like the look of the girls, then you'll probably be satisfied with this as a mindless hentai, unless you were looking for some plot and personality to go with it.

          
 
       Helpful Seems I'm new to reviewing Hentai Titles, I'm just going to quickly tell you how I do things before I get started with the reviews. Now with me, hentai I find pointless trying to review each category of how the story was (if there is even one), then art and so on. Its pointless, hentai doesn't really go all into that, its about the experience as a whole so with Hentai reviews I'm just going to rate the overall Experience. Now onto the review: 
 
Akiba Girls could have been a quirky, tongue-in-cheek look at the hentai industry. After all, one female character leads into a sex scene with the actual premise that she needs practice for her next job as, yes, a hentai voice actress. If that isn't self-referential, I don't know what is. 
 
Sadly, apart from that particular set of lines, Akiba Girls is otherwise a dull, unoriginal show with mediocre sex scenes that often highlight just what I find to be wrong about hentai anime in general. 
 
For starters, most of the girls are saddled with breasts that do not match their body types. This is one of the things that annoys me the most in American pornography, and the transition to Japanese cartoons has not changed this for me. Maybe it's because I'm just a guy who really likes boobs. Either way, fake boobs irk me, and the boobs on the Akiba Girls are as fake as they get. 
 
The same could be said for the plot. We are expected to believe that Nikita (who's pretty good-looking for an utter geek) is supposed to go from unpopular to sex machine overnight. Uh huh, sure. It's pretty silly to begin with, but when his adopted sisters start professing their undying love lust for him, that's when things get utterly ridiculous. 
 
Since I already commented on the fake-looking breasts, I should be fair and criticize the rest of the animation, which is really rather lousy and doesn't work well with the standard hentai-game art style being used here. We also have another hentai cliche I really don't understand -- the fire-hose penis. Now, it is scientifically proven that the average ejaculation only measures about two or so tablespoons -- not much on the grand scheme of things, but certainly more than enough to do what is intended. In hentai anime, this figure magically rises to gallons, and Nikita apparently can get spray on a girl's face during an internal release. This guy is a one-man bukkake team, and it isn't arousing so much as headshakingly stupid. 
 
I never liked bukkake anyway, but that's another peeve for another time. 
 
Plus there's the whole ""adopted sister"" angle, which is just a goofy, poorly executed, and overdone ripoff of the whole Marmalade Boy idea. 
 
While the sex is consensual and there aren't any naughty tentacles or magic rope tricks, Akiba Girls is kinda like combining the tired cliches of mainstream Japanese porn with the fake boobs of mainstream American porn. 
 
I guess if you're desperate for animated sex and don't like the darker stuff, this might work for you, but there is a plethora of better titles out there. 
 
It's not quite the bottom of the barrel, but finding better hentai than this isn't hard.

Well it’s a story of a guy who joins a club composed of only girls, more like composed of only sluts. It’s ridiculous, he meets the girls and they instantly have sex with him, there is no development. 
About the guy, his parents died in a car crash when he was a kid. So he lives with his sister who has a crush on him. Not a crush, she’s in love with him, and not the brotherly sisterly kind of love, she wants him inside her. 
So this guy watches a lot of hentai and he falls in love with a hentai star, who appears to be in love with him too. So we have a love triangle. 
So after he has a lot of sex with the different girls, with his sister and with the hentai star, it’s time for the big reveal at the end. Now this ending is what killed it for me.  
The hentai star is his guardian angel who’s been looking over him ever since his parents died. And now that he has his sister to take care of him it’s time for her to leave. 
I hate the way this hentai just went off track at the end, kind of ridiculous.   
First of all the story is ridiculous, the women are ridiculous although I will admit they were hot especially the sister. 
 
Rate Mediocre 
Story sucks. 
Art is good. 
Characters: the women are way too easy. But I did like the sister. The angel made no sense.

(Source: Wiki)","['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","In the year 1885, the story follows Sara Crewe, the young daughter of, Captain Ralph Crewe, who is extremely wealthy due to running a diamond mine in British-ruled India. She starts attending an all-girl's seminary boarding school in London, where she excels in her studies and is loved deeply by many of her friends and classmates. 
Tragedy strikes when Sara's father passes away of Jungle Fever and her family goes bankrupt, leaving her to become a poor orphan. The school's headmistress, Miss Minchin, takes advantage of this situation and makes her an unpaid maid in the school, trying hard to make her life as miserable as possible. However, Sara, with the help of her friends, perseveres and tries to endure all her hardships until redemption comes at last.
When Miss Minchin continues to mistreat her further, Sara befriends Mr. Carmichael, a solicitor who wanted to save her from Miss Minchin's mistreatment until she meets her father's lifelong friend Tom Carrisford who lives next door to the seminary. Tom decides to adopt Sara to redeem himself over his guilt for the loss of her father and to restore her status as a diamond princess. Miss Minchin angrily confronts Tom to get Sara back to the seminary but to her dismay Sara has already been adopted, causing her to return to the seminary in disgrace as her younger sister Amelia angrily berates her for the mistreatment she had put on Sara by making her a maid and forcing her to stay at the horse stable, making Miss Minchin emotionally regretful for her actions.
Sara waved goodbye to her friends in the dormitory as she and Becky return to the British-ruled India for 4 months to finish the necessary formalities regarding her father's inheritance and to visit her parents graves by travelling in the cruise ship. But she does not forget when she was poor, she gives money to people on the street, maybe Sara and Becky will return to London again after 4 months.
","I love the novel A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, so upon finding an anime for that story I had to watch it. For the most part I found it enjoyable and faithful to the original source material. 
 
Story (8): 
 
The story follows Sara Crewe, the young daughter of a rich widower, who enrolls in an English boarding school. For the first fourth of the anime, Sara is praised by everyone both in the school and outside for her manners, kindness, and how pretty she looks in her fine clothes. By episode eleven she receives the news that her father has died bankrupt making her lose her position.  
 
The majority of the rest of the anime follows Sara's new life as a hard-working, unpaid maid for the seminary. She is tormented and mistreated by everyone save two faithful previous classmates, the other young maid, and the child who used to be her driver.   
 
This anime has an intriguing story that is meant for children, but people of all ages can enjoy it. There are good themes and messages such as: holding on when everything looks bleak, showing kindness to everyone (including your enemies), and forgiveness. Sara (and Becky) face a lot of hardship and abuse-physically, verbally, and emotionally-and through it all Sara still remains the bigger person by not stooping to their level.  
 
As mentioned before, for the most part I feel that the anime stays true to the book. Almost all of the important plot points are present (although they do sometimes occur in a different order, or different times than they do in the book).  
 
However I do feel that there are a lot of unnecessary filler episodes. I think about ten of these episodes could have been omitted and the story would have been the same. They're not bad episodes as they do include character development and show details of Sara's life as a servant in more detail that wasn't in the book. I just think that this story didn't need forty six episodes when thirty five to forty would've sufficed. 
 
Also, I feel the need to mention the ending. I was surprised to see how the ending of this anime differed from the one in the book. Having watched it I can understand why the creators of this anime went with that ending instead of the original. While some may not like it for obvious reasons that I can't explain without spoiling anything, I think it actually works in Sara's favor. Considering what she could have done (and what many people would have in her shoes) it shows the strength of her character with the decision she makes. I can't go into any more detail without revealing spoilers. In all I actually was satisfied with how the anime ended. 
 
Characters (9): 
 
For the most part I think the characters were portrayed accurately.  
 
To begin with Sara is a kind, cheerful girl who tries to find the best in any situation no matter how miserable it may be. She has a lot of courage, strength, and faith not to break after all she endures in the length of this series. She is a good role model for many children in terms of her kindness, generosity, and not seeking revenge. If I do have one complaint I do wish she would have defended herself more when she was in the right. Due to one episode concerning the doll Emily, I feel that the other students would have rushed to her aid had she stood up to Minchin more often. 
 
Next is the character Lottie. I didn't have much of an opinion on her in the book, but I liked her much more in this anime. She is given more of a role, and I love how loyal she stays to Sara-the one person who treated her kindly and with understanding. What more I like how on several occasions she is the only person to stand up for Sara. Lottie is given a lot of development in this anime and she is one of my favorite characters in the series. 
 
This version showed Minchin to be the cruel and loathsome person any human being could possibly be. I felt so bad for Sara everytime Minchin showed up to ruin things, and how she took pleasure in torturing Sara. However this anime did give a little backstory for her that was not present in the novel-although I don't think it excuses her for all the horrible things she did. 
 
I also like the extra characterization given to Lavinia. While she wasn't too fond of Sara in the book, this anime expanded a lot on this girl showing her to be as cruel and much of a bully as Minchin. It added more to the story of Sara's suffering as well as Sara's character by how she still remains kind to her despite all that happened. 
 
Lastly, I like the original character of Peter added in this story. It's nice for Sara to have another friend and someone to count on. At times I do feel like he is a dues ex machina character as he comes up with the solutions to many of the problems. Nonetheless he does add some good and comedic moments in this show. 
 
One complaint I have is I feel that Ermengarde is downplayed in this version. So many times I got annoyed with her for not speaking out on Sara's behalf. I know she is supposed to be timid, but I find it hard to believe she would just let the girl who is supposed to be her best friend get treated so horribly without speaking a word. The same could be said about the other girls in the seminary. 
 
Art (6): 
 
The art in this anime is pretty good considering it was made three decades ago. I especially love the backgrounds. So many of the locations such as: the park, the church, the marketplace/town, the interior of Sara's first room, and the attic all look real; they're very detailed. It's clear what city and time period this story takes place. 
 
The character designs aren't bad. Sara does look the way she's described in the book. Each of the main characters have their own distinct look. Even the minor and unnamed characters don't look lazily designed. The costumes look beautiful (especially Sara's birthday dress, and the clothes Lavinia's mother wears). 
 
The animation is not the best. There are plenty of times it looks choppy. What more there are a lot of background characters. What I mean by that is that the unnamed characters in the background rarely move, if at all, so they look painted on. There's one scene in particular where Sara and Peter are at the dock, and for over a minute a woman has her head turned to the side and doesn't move from that pose during the entire time. 
 
I do like the animation used for the ending where one horse-drawn carriage is followed closely by another. I just like the steady movement of those coaches. That's all that happens in the closing credits, but it's calming to watch. 
 
Sound (9): 
 
The sound is good. I like the voice actors chosen for each character. Not a single voice sounds out of place. The actress assigned for Minchin is byfar the best. The shrieking used when alarmed or angered is done well. All the voice actors did well with portraying emotion. 
 
The music is good. I like the opening and ending songs. They both sound cheery with a hint of sadness thrown in the lyrics, which I feel fits the tone of this story well. 
 
The instrumental score fits both the scenes and the time period of this story. 
  
Enjoyment (8): 
 
For the most part I found the story likable. There are some scenes that are hard to watch knowing how much suffering this character has to endure. On the other hand there are a lot of warm, endearing scenes that make up for the harsh ones.  
 
I like the sense of hope given throughout. Everytime Sara has something else taken from her, at times just because one of the other characters just wants to be mean, she still keeps her head high. It's actually pretty inspirational. 
 
Conclusion (8): 
 
This is a good, heartfelt story that will play with the audience's emotions throughout. Most of the characters are developed (even if some are deplorable). The art is decent, the animation is not the best, but it's not the worst either. The soundtrack is good. Above all there are important themes and morals in this one.  
 
I would recommend A Little Princess Sara to anyone. 
 
8/10

          
 
       Helpful This anime is basically the slowest something could be in the first place, and the plot after the first 10 episodes of everyone jizzing over the mc is her being tortured after that. The plot is mostly the other workers telling them (the 2 poor tortured girls) to work hard as those other workers slack off and large amounts of time being spent for the other characters to say yes to working harder even though they were already working hard, or the headmistress making some unreasonably bitchy complaint accusing someone of doing something they did not do that the headmistress knows that other person did not do, followed by a large amount of time being spent for the character to say yes and ""accept"" blame. Seriously that is the entire core plot, and it is so slow and takes so much time (if you have a brain in your head but still decide to watch this based on the relatively high rating, please keep that finger on the fast forward button). 
 
But what makes this quite simply the worst something could be is when MCmctorturedgirl is EXCITED to see the girl who spent the entire anime torturing her the most (ep 33?) and then calls her, and not just to not get into trouble, her fucking friend (ep 34?). Like I get that the point was to make her a messiah figure but this was the biggest, most poorly written stretch of all time. 
 
(the music is great when not being badly repeated, usually is badly, relentlessly repeated)

          
 
       Helpful [Spoiler free review] 
I'm going to keep this review short, because there's not a lot to say about this show. It starts off pretty weak with more than 10 episodes of build up before the actual premise is reached and then it suddenly gets good. The thing about it though is you could always see where the plot was taking you well in advance, and it just turned into an observation of a constant cycle. It was a loop of witnessing the main character's unconditional kindness, followed by a harsh dose of cruelty and finally a few tears shed and determined vows are made before the reset button is pressed. However, this doesn't mean it didn't have enjoyment to offer, it just didn't surprise me often.   
 
When the anime gives you a bone, to makes you think subsequent progression is finally on it's way, it violently tugs it away from you to remind you that there is nothing idealistic about the main character's position. It reminds you that only at the end will you get to savour the bone. And that it did. The ending was no surprise, but I feel like it would be unfair to fault it based on the ultimate outcome as apposed to rating the execution of it. I was prepared to see how they would execute the end and progress towards it and. While the execution was unexpected, it made me feel more disappointed than I had been in a while. The ending, metaphorically speaking, was like seeing an oil drum, filled with all the liquid idealism that the other episodes were starved of, pierced sharp by a pickaxe from a quarter bellow the top of the container - leading to it's contents uncontrollably gushing out until the level of it's contents quickly fell bellow the hole and thus stopped spilling. This ultimately meant that the built up was wasted as no one really got their just deserts. In fact, the ending pretty much excused all the heinous cruelty we witnessed and essentially touted forgiveness on the basis that it all worked out in the end anyway. This would be fine if it were not for that fact that the moral of the story ended up being ""don't mistreat people that seem like they have nothing to give, or else they might just not give you loads of money in the future"" - with an emphasis on the word ""might"", since all the antagonists in the plot were spared a serving of revenge and rewarded...  
I think it's clear that I was deeply disappointed by the ending and felt betrayed for investing time into the plot. I was especially annoyed by the fact that the most hate worthy antagonists were portrayed as good people void of maliciousness, when the complete opposite was the fact. It's impossible for you to think that the the character who spent the whole series bullying most the other characters in a disgusting fashion did not despise the main character, simply because she said it - but was in fact her ally in disguise who did nothing to aid her. I was extremely confused by the character who fit this descriptions having an immediate transition from antagonist to ally. 
 
Nonetheless, I chose to give this anime a 7/10, because as much as much as the ending disappointed, I enjoyed the majority of the series. I got to see Victorian era London is action, and was immersed by the environment. I was impressed by how much detail went in building the atmosphere and I enjoyed witnessing the main character discovering new things about working class London life during that era. Although the cycle I previously mentioned was sometimes damaging to my enjoyment, I don't think many episodes felt repetitive in terms of their content and there was still some progression that remained after the rest button was pressed every few episodes. Although the music was pretty mediocre (even for the standards of anime made during that time), I thought the voice acting was well done and the anime was pretty decent. The paintings of London used in the backgrounds were great too, and as a Londoner, it looked familiar to what I see everyday when I pass or go into old houses and buildings. And finally the characters (apart from a few) were very consistent and were somewhat unique - with my main issue only being the fact that some of the characters didn't seem to retain emotions spawned from previous episodes. Therefor I think it's deserving of an above average score, especially considering how much more enjoyable it was watching it compared to the majority of the other anime I've watched.

Sometimes they fail, because not everything is supposed to be treated as a part of the anime industry: there are also independent works, whose story is not always important, because they last a bunch of minutes, whose art is not always captivating, since they were made back in the 60s or 70s and try to be expressive more than realistic. The same goes for western movies: you can't rate sound, for example, if you're watching a silent film or dislike a black and white movie only because colors are not there. 
Kataku is a short independent, stop motion animated movie from 1979. It's a completely different experience from a yesterday-made series with bursting colors and flashing animation. A great experience I'd say.

6,39569,120,5.273375524,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Sora no Aosa wo Shiru Hito yo,"Set in the same Chichibu city as  Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.  its story follows two Aioi sisters, Akane and Aoi, who have lived together since their parents' passing 13 years ago. One day, older sister Akane's ex-boyfriend Shinnosuke Kanemuro, who is 31 now, visits the city to perform at a festival. At the same time, 18-year-old Shinnosuke, called Shinno, also time-travels from 13 years ago. While Aoi starts falling love with the 18-year-old Shinno, Akane and the 31-year-old Shinnosuke finally reunite... 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)",['Drama'],"In Chichibu, third-year high school student Akane Aioi is dating Shinnosuke Kanamuro (nicknamed Shinno), an aspiring guitarist. Shinno is also friendly with Akane's preschooler sister Aoi, and in turn the sisters support Shinno's band. Akane and Shinno plan to move to Tokyo after graduation, where Shinno will pursue a career in music. However, the girls' parents are killed in a car accident and Akane changes her plans, choosing to stay in Chichibu to raise Aoi.
Thirteen years later, Aoi is an aspiring bassist who plans to move to Tokyo after high school, while Akane works for the city hall. Masamichi Nakamura (nicknamed Michinko), the drummer of Shinno's former band, also works for the city hall. Michinko is planning to hold a music festival to boost the city's tourism, and the main performer is the famous enka singer Dankichi Nitobe. 
One afternoon, while practicing bass alone in the hall, Aoi encounters Shinno from thirteen years ago. Frightened, she runs home to Akane and awkwardly asks her about Shinno. Akane admits that she hasn't heard from Shinno since he left, and is not even sure if he is still alive. This leads Aoi to believe she had seen Shinno's ghost. Later, the sisters reluctantly help Michinko in welcoming Dankichi Nitobe, and they are surprised to see a grown Shinnosuke as the guitarist of Nitobe's backup band. Aoi then returns to the hall with her friend Tsugu (Michinko's son), where they confirm that the young Shinno has a physical body but is unable to leave the hall. Tsugu hypothesizes that Shinno is an ikiryō (living ghost) born from Shinnosuke's strong unresolved feelings. Shinno then asks Aoi to help bring Akane and Shinnosuke together, believing that doing so will return him to Shinnosuke's body. However, this proves to be difficult as Shinnosuke is rude, arrogant, and does not get along with the Aioi sisters—a different person from the Shinno that they once knew.
","A tale of experiencing first love for the second time, and that of losing sight of what you once dreamt of. 
 
Firstly, the synopsis is not that accurate. This is not a story of time travel, nor did Aoi only start to fall in love upon meeting the Shinno from 13 years ago.  
 
The movie starts with Aoi plugging in her earphones to practice her bass, drowning out all sounds. I feel that that is a nice touch. We are then gradually introduced to the other characters and how Aoi feels about them. There was also a flashback of her past which explains why the two sisters are living together, when Shinno suddenly appears.  
 
Story: 10/10 
There were some twists that I've never expected. At first, I thought only Aoi could see Shinno, but it turned out that everyone could see him too. They called him an Ikiryou (a spirit that is left behind when the living passes on) at the start, and I thought that that was the case too, when Aoi ran home to Akane and asked her for more details about Shinno - to which her reply was ""I don't know whether he is even living or dead"", which cemented my belief until minutes later when Shinnosuke appeared on the Enka stage as a guitarist.  
 
What happens when you meet face-to-face with your past self? That was the other big twist that I did not expect. Watch it to find out!  
 
The story built up emotions leading to that scene from the ominous cave to the landslide to the sealed guitar and to the meeting, and the tension - emotions at an all-time high was kept at that plateau for the rest of the movie. It was truly a work of art. 
 
Art: 9/10 
My first thought was that the older Nakamura looked like Poppo from AnoHana, but it turned out that they were different persons. Each scene, though ordinary somehow managed to look special while being not overtly imposing. I liked how the director transitioned from showing a dull welcoming scene to the appearance of a very flashy Nitobe, and how the camera slowly pans to the right to reveal the older Shinnosuke. That said though, while the art was great, it was not particularly outstanding hence the score. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
As I have mentioned in the introduction, the touch when earphones are plugged in and when Aoi tries to convey her feelings for the older Shinnosuke was absolutely stunning. Aoi fondly reminds me of K-On! when she plays the bass. I feel that her VA has done a good job in conveying her feelings for Shinno, like how her voice trembled when she spoke to him or that outburst when she found out what Chika has done. 
 
Character: 8/10 
Given the number of characters, it can't be helped. Although every character has some development, I feel that they could have given more depth to each of them, particularly the older Shinnosuke and exactly how did he come around. Also, the boy-crazy Chika could have been given more exposition - we never knew if she was telling the truth or not when she claimed that 'nothing happened', because we only have an idea of what's her personality like.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Overall, I enjoyed the movie enough to write such a long review about it. Even after watching the epilogue however, I am left with more questions that I had at the start and I think that this movie would have a better reception had it launched as an anime series instead.  
 
Overall verdict: 8/10

I was lucky enough to catch the movie in theatres as soon as it was released, I can safely say I enjoyed the movie but it’s definitely not rewatch worthy. Certainly not as good as the other movies released this year like Tenki no Ko or Fate/Stay Night Heaven’s Feel. 
 
There wasn’t anything particularly notable during the movie apart from the unusual setting and considerably weird plot... That... and my friend sleeping in the cinema. 
 
Well, that statement stands for itself. The movie’s concept is unique. It’s unusual setting which involves a form of time travel with an added twist. And a weirdly cliched plot with weird relationships. 
 
-SPOILER- 
 
Second-year high school student Aoi Aioi is an aspiring musician Aoi Aioi. Her older sister Akane's ex-boyfriend Shinnosuke Kanomura is a struggling guitarist. Aoi and Akane's parents passed away in an accident 13 years ago, and Akane gave up her ambition of going to Tokyo with Shinnosuke to take care of Aoi. Since then, Aoi has felt indebted to her older sister.  
 
Years later, Akane's ex-boyfriend, Shinnosuke, returns to town to perform at a music festival. At the same time as the re-encounter between the two former lovers, Aoi meets Shinnosuke's teenage self, who has traveled from the past to the present-and Aoi falls in love for the first time. 
 
-SPOILER END- 
 
There were... I must say, countless flaws in the anime. 
Firstly, was the fact that this anime barely had any originality in the entire setting of it. It was quite boring but I thoroughly enjoyed the concept and art which was mainly what kept me watching. That and the voice actors did a good job. 
Next, Aoi. The ending was what kept me thinking. The anime ended with the characters agreeing that Aoi is young and dumb but the thing about her is that she’s straightforward. My foot... Aoi has been a selfish kid throughout the entire anime. From a little girl to a teenager, she’s been selfish to a fault. She felt guilty because of that, of course she would... She doesn’t mean it. But instead of being straightforward and apologising or expressing her guilt by telling Akane she feels guilty for her selfishness and wishes to redeem herself. Aoi literally expressed her guilt with rebellion and resentment... Excuse me? 
 
In what world is that straightforward. 
 
Last but not least, why the hell was Young Shinno bounded in the room? That made absolutely zero sense! The worst part was that he was bounded by a freaking guitar. When the guitar broke, he was free. But the guitar was barely featured and the aspect of significance wasn’t given. Why was the guitar the catalyst? All that was said was the guitar was a gift of sorts from Akane. That made absolutely zero correlation to why it was the catalyst for his confinement. 
 
That’s not the end of it, there’s more. 
 
So why is it that I’m still giving the anime a 6/10? Because in its own right, the anime was okay. I could understand where all the characters were coming from, how they felt and how I can relate to them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the OST and the interesting correspondence between Aoi and Akane. 
 
-Spoiler- 
 
If you look at it closely, Akane’s boyfriend is Shinnosuke. She likes Shinnosuke and Michinko likes Akane! 
On the other hand, Aoi likes Young Shinno while Tsugu (Michinko’s son) likes Aoi! 
 
-Spoiler End- 
 
I loved all the characters and the musical cohesion that was supposed to be the main attraction. So it was pretty disappointing compared to anime like Your Lie in April where the musical romance was ways stronger.  
 
After thinking about it, Aoi was actually pretty useless. The anime made it seem like she was the only one that could change what’s about to happen but she didn’t do shit... She couldn’t decide between her sister and her sister’s boyfriend from the past. She didn’t help with getting Shinnosuke and her sister together. She didn’t do anything.  
 
Everything just sort of fell in place for her. From Michinko gradually accepting rejection and stopped wooing Akane... To the lack of crew members that led to Aoi joining Shinnosuke’s band... Even when Akane was in trouble and Aoi ran to Young Shinno for help only to find out that Young Shinno had met the current Shinno and afterwards talked the current Shinno into changing to a better person... Come on, that was your job Aoi... You’re supposed to be the Main Character not Young Shinno... 
 
What a mess really... 
 
Aoi was actually just the narrator. And a catalyst for fan hatred. 
 
Well... at least we can end off and call this an experiment for a newer approach similar to Anohana. 
 
This was an anime worth watching if you have nothing better to do. I rest my case.

So when she graduates from high school, it is no surprise that she applies to work at Eagle Jump, the company responsible for making her favorite video game. On her first day, she is excited to learn that she will be working on a new installment to the series: Fairies Story 3—and even more so under Kou Yagami, the lead character designer. 
 
In their department are people who share the same passion for games. There is Yun Iijima, whose specialty is designing monsters; the shy Hifumi Takimoto, who prefers to communicate through instant messaging; Hajime Shinoda, an animation team member with an impressive figurine collection; Rin Tooyama, the orderly art director; Shizuku Hazuki, the game director who brings her cat to work; and Umiko Ahagon, the short-tempered head programmer. 
 
 New Game!  follows Aoba and the others on their adventure through the ups and downs of game making, from making the perfect character design to fixing all the errors that will inevitably accumulate in the process. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Having been inspired by the character designs of a particular video game when she was younger, Aoba Suzukaze, a high school graduate, begins working as a character designer for the video game's developer, Eagle Jump. As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere. 
 
The rest isn´t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don´t want to concentrate or if you´re a Moe fan anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

Although he cannot be an heir to the throne of his father, Genji spends his life surrounded by every pleasure and love. And yet, his one longing in love is something that even the power of an Emperor can never give him. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Romance']",none,"If you are familiar with the ""Tales of Genji"", this is pretty much a anime adaption about it. While there is a bit of inaccuracies with it especially in the closing of the anime, certain things hold true such as Genji is playboy from the Heian period and is in love with his stepmother who is technically not that much older than him. 
 
My initial reason for watching this anime was to understand the text form of the story better since reading wasn't always my strong point especially when there are many other classes which had my priority (and the fact that anime was enjoyable). Having watch through the first 5 episodes, I was impressed on how well they kept up with certain facts such as the women he had slept with, the look alike of the women (central theme of the book if you ever read it). 
 
Not much can be said except that I wish they didn't use modern animation to portray a Japanese classic, but rather use something from ""Samurai Horror Tales"" to make it more nostalgic. It was quite interesting how the anime portray some aspects of it such as evil spirits and some part of Japanese culture during that period.

          
 
       Helpful This is an underrated gem. The visuals are stylized, but quite beautiful and well suited to the subject at hand. Centering on the amorous encounters of Hikaru, the series does in fact feature several intimate scenes, but they are not explicit and to focus on them is to miss the larger point of the work. This is ultimately a poetic, lingering examination of longing, attraction and the multi-faceted nature of love, all set to a dramatic and moving soundtrack.

          
 
       Helpful One guy going around seducing various women may seem like a pretty dodgy premise for an entire series.  But it manages to avoid being just a trashy harem anime by delving into the characters of each of the women and Genji himself. 
 
If you've seen some of the previous work of director Osamu Dezaki, you will recognize his style in this series: a lot of pan shots and still frames with artful use of filter effects.  Apart from helping make a fairly limited animation budget look good, this technique also punctuates the emotion or intensity of a scene and highlights the beautifully rendered costumes and environments.  It's almost like watching a shoujo manga come to life.  Even when I found myself thinking ""What is he doing? Why is she angsting so much?"" I couldn't help but be caught up in the emotion of the scene. 
 
Basically, if you're the type who likes romantic period dramas with lots of gorgeous costumes and soap opera relationships and a bit of political intrigue, then this is absolutely the anime for you.  If you're not necessarily a fan of those things, but can appreciate an artistic and well-made interpersonal drama, then do check it out anyway.

","If you liked Pani Poni Dash, you don't even have to bother reading the rest, you'll likely like the show. If your a fan of Negima the manga, your probably not gonna like this and you might want to delete any episodes you have on your harddrive (I mean return the dvd you bought, of course that's what I meant). I walk a middle ground here as a fan of both of those series, however, it did get boring for me as it continued on.  
 
Now, if you think you knew the characters from the series, you'll only be half right (for the most part) the characters are altered to be more humorous. For example, Asuna's search for the chupacabra (which is probably the worst depiction of the creature I've ever seen and yes I know that's the whole point of the joke). A few new characters are also introduced, but we all know how filler characters are.  
 
I suppose I should get this out here quickly, the story is altered. Instead of attempting to follow the plot of the manga then ending on a horrible filler ending (like its predecessor), it doesn't even try to the follow the manga and makes a whole new story revolving around a powerful magical artifact. This is kind of a double edged sword, atleast its not as bad as the filler ending in its predecessor, its not as good as the original story.  
 
The focus of this series is comedy and action, which sounds good in theory. The comedy, however, sometimes gets cringe worthy or boring. The action doesn't meet up with the bar set up by other fighting animes that have done some crazy sh*t (its a little dull in comparison, but others might still find enjoyment in them).  
 
Now, the English dub (all sub lovers can probably ignore this) tries to be authentic by giving all of the British characters accents (just the British ones). This would be ok, if Negi didn't sound so whiny and weak. Sure, he's ten years old, but he's ends up sounding whiny and like a wimp. In the manga, he had a little more balls. 
 
Overall, its an ok show and half the reason of my middleish rating was being fan of the manga. If you like gag comedies and action and wondered what happened if they were merged together, you got this show. If you can't stand the weirder kind of Japanese humor and a few jokes you sometimes can't fully get, you might want to look elsewhere (quick little note: pacing could be better). 
 
Go Baka-Rangers! (.....I hate myself for doing that). 
 
P.S. I like to just add, I think another problem was the feeling it was not Ken Akamatsu's work, but more the work of Akiyuki Shinbo.  
 
P.S.S Anyone else confused they made a new manga series to go along with this?  

          
 
       Helpful It's not the Negima that the fans of the manga know, it's Negima 2.0 the wacky version. 
 
STORY: This is the result when the studio Shaft, that is known for silly and over the top comedy anime like Pani Poni Dash and Arakawa Under The Bridge, get to do a remake of a story that the fans had already known about and let their imagination go wild.  
This is a second attempt at a Negima anime, but this time around things are sillier, more random, and has more action than the first anime with an original story.  
 
The beginning jumps straight into the Evangeline arc of the original source material right off the bat and introduces alot of the story relevent characters early (Like Setsuna and Chamo) and follows the gist of the Evangeline arc from the original story. 
 After that the story goes off and basicly wonders around with random gag after gag within it's continuing original story arc that's filled with alot of almost non canon and almost pointless events with the inclusion of the most annoying mascots you'll ever see that are unfortunately relevent to the story and the very lame but relevent and somewhat interesting second antagionst after Evangeline. 
Fortunately interesting characters who had no place in the first anime finally get their own spot in this one (I'm talking about the sword wielding character Setsuna). 
Some characters get a few tweaks in their personality, Asuna is an idiot who's obsessed with finding a chubacabra, Takahata-Sensei apparently loves ramen, and even the most ignored characters get their own gags once in a while. 
But in the end, this is not the Negima fans know and love, and said fans will feel a bit alienated. 
 
 ANIMATION: This is the biggest improvement compared to the first animes crappy animation. Very stylish, fiuld, and quite hyperactive.  
While it does look just like every other Shaft anime, with random images every where and well... just plain random, it looks great but alot of the female characters have very similiar looks and it doesn't help that they wear school uniforms. 
 
SOUND: Just like my review with the first Negima anime, I watched Funimations dub version and even the dub is better in this one. With the experience gained through the first dub, each voice actor does a better performance and they don't have that slow having to get used to it feel that alot of dubs suffer from.  
The most notable voice actor is Cherami Leigh, who voices Setsuna,  is new in this dub and can perform action scenes a great deal better than Dana Schultes, who was Setsuna's original voice actor, from the first anime.  
Even though everyone else sounds better, Greg Ayres still sounds like Negi with cancer.  
The theme music is quite catchy and Funimation even made a dub version of each theme song that, depending on your taste, may sound better than the japanese versions. 
 
OVERALL:  
The Good: 
+ Better animation than the first anime. 
+ Improved english dub. 
+ Minor characters get more screen time than other adaptions. 
 
The Bad: 
- Just a reboot, not a continuation (This is especially disappointing to those who read the manga and watched the first anime). 
- Way too random at times, and sometimes utterly pointless. 
- Fans of the source material may become alienated. 
- The gags are more miss than hit. 
- Annoying mascots and villains. 
 
Lots of disappointment is expected to anyone who is expecting a true to the manga adaptation, but this is still undoubtly better than the first anime with better animation, a better dub, more action, and a different way of story progression, but the gags can get annoying and the second half of this anime feels dragged out.  
But there is more screen time for even the most ignored characters and the short little gags at the end of each episode are enjoyable.

          
 
       Helpful Normally i wouldn't write a review for an anime, but as i did just finish this i felt i had to write something, and this is the 1st review i've written on MAL 
 
This anime is an eclectic mix of brilliant art and some rather...odd storyline. As noted in other reviews, this series has almost nothing to do with the manga storyline what-so-ever. Sure the Series starts with the Nagi-Evangeline fight, and that has some of the best visual presentation i think i've ever seen in an anime, but after that it goes....to left field...in a good way. (Not really...just keep reading...) 
 
One of the big differences a fan of the manga will notice right off the bat is the turning of 3 of the most minor characters in the series (though one is major in a few ways) into 3 of the characters that the story revolves around in one degree or another--those three are: Takamichi, Anya, and Nekane. And it also introduces 2 characters that are series exclusive- Shichimii and Matsuo...Character development in this series is a bit off as well, with Negi essentially making contracts with all of the students in his class, to avoid becoming a Chupacabra (Yes...i said Chupacabra) instead of the ermine that is mentioned in the manga. 
 
Story- As far as the story goes, it was enjoyable to me because i'm a Negima fan, while the first 3 episodes had me hooked, i am a bit disappointed in the rest of the series. It starts off well with the Evangeline arc, but then it begins to shift to a filler style storyline that sort of fits with what they were trying to do with this series. Essentially Negi is the target of a mysterious ""Darkness"" and between that and a mysterious ""Black Rose Baron"" as well as Shichimi and Matsuo things get...for lack of a better term...stupid. Often times episodes don't really have a solid story to them and have to resort to brief fillers to get through the episode, while some are mildly entertaining, most are pretty bleh. 
 
One thing i will say about this series is that it must be meant for younger viewers to help get them into the Negima universe, because as far as story plot goes, if you can guess about 2-3 possibilities, then there's a good shot that you're right--Case in point- the ""Black Rose Baron's"" identity- I figured out about 4-5 episodes earlier who that character's identity really was, and as it turned out- HEY! i was right...I really wondered for a while if it was meant to be a serious entry into the Negima world, because if it was, then the writers failed on an epic level with some of the plots and storylines and character developments. HOWEVER- I don't think this is the case, i think its just a playful series meant for entertainment as something different, not to be taken too seriously. 
 
And it seems that the SHAFT writers have an extremely weird fixation on all things Chupacabra...as you'll see it ALOT in the series, enough that it gets to the point where you're going ""Really? Move on already"", however they actually do that with a couple of other things as well....But despite all of my complaining, if you can stand all of the little quirks of the story,  its really not that bad. 
 
Art- SHAFT did this...which is often times obvious with their unique way of doing things. I will say on the record right now though, as stated earlier the Nagi-Evangeline fight is possibly the best animation style that I've ever seen in an anime hands-down. It was impressive enough to hook me all the way through to the end hoping for more...As far as the characters go, SHAFT did a good job not going overboard with things, all of the colors and characters pop out at you, though there are certain students who kind of seem to blend together, but in all honesty they do that to me in the manga too, so it doesn't really matter. One thing i'm personally curious about is SHAFT not making Asuna's eyes multi-colored---in the first anime, as well as the manga, Asuna has Green in one eye and Blue in the other. My thought is that maybe since they wrote out Asuna's abilities and essentially all of her history that they didn't need to make her stand out too much.  
 
Characters- well...i pretty much wrote about this earlier, but as stated above there are a lot of minor characters that play a bigger part in this anime. ALL of Negi's students become partners with him, so you have to see each and every student, sometimes that gets to be a little...overbearing. Sure to me its great watching Takamichi, but there are some students that are shown often that made me wonder why couldn't they fit another more recognizable character in this scene? Evangeline in this is actually rather tame compared to the other series and manga as well, which makes things kinda feel weird if you've read/seen those entires in the Negima! universe. Other than that, the only other point worth mentioning is Konoka and Setsuna's ""relationship"" the Konoka in this series is rather ""puckish"" in that she likes to play jokes on people at certain times, a lot of these times are at Setsuna's expense.  
 
Overall- If this is the first Negima you've seen, then you'll probably like it, if you've read the manga or seen the other anime series, you'll immediately wonder ""what the hell?"" and probably either watch it, or immediately stop. The only reason i kept watching was because it was random enough that i kinda wanted to see how everything turned out. Even though before most of the major plot points i already knew what was going to happen within a few episodes of it happening, though around episode 10-12, there's a major plot point that made me laugh, even though it was kinda expected...in a good way.

","First review! Great, probably gonna bomb this. Despite that, I can confidently say that this review will be a far better product than the pile of turd this anime turned out to be.  
 
One thing that I've learned from consuming any work, not just anime, is that the title is very important. A title is the first thing a viewer sees before they have a chance to watch something. It serves as a hook, something to reel a potential viewer in. Having a good title can not only attract prospective viewers, but it can also help to subtly hint at what the work is actually about. In anime, this is all the more important, as a bad title can not only turn a viewer off, but even give them the wrong idea of what type of anime the work may be. As one can tell by trying to read that mess of a title, this show fails miserably in this regard.  
 
Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka?, which roughly translates to ""Do You Like Your Mom? Her Normal Attack is Two Attacks at Full Power."" is a cluttered mess that definitely tells you what it is that you're going to watch in the least subtle way possible. Luckily, it was graciously condensed to ""Okaasan Online."" Not a great start. Unfortunately, things don't get much better. 
 
Story 2/10  
The story here is actually quite simple. Not-so-subtly named Mamako Oosuki, an extremely doting mother, has come to the conclusion that she and her son, Masato, need to spend more time together to bond and improve their relationship. She goes about this by, as you probably guessed, forcing Masato into a very poorly designed MMORPG that will supposedly do just that. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is yet another isekai that totally isn't adding to an already over-saturated genre.  
 
That sounded very harsh, but personally, I actually quite like the little wrinkle here. Parent-child relationships have a lot of mileage for fun, endearing stories, and as far as I can tell, there hasn't been an isekai of this type. This show certainly had the potential to be something great, unfortunately, the writing is so astoundingly poor that there were many times where I felt very heavily inclined to simply drop this anime and forget its existence.  
 
One of the main problems here is that this show has no idea what exactly it wants to be. It ranges from pure fanservice to comedy to mother-child bonding to a bad anime version of Dr. Phil. It's all over the place, and leaves me scratching my head at times as to how the writers can be so inept. After a few episodes, they seemed to decide on going about the anime Dr. Phil route, but (and I will go into this in more detail later), for now, let's just say that they did a pretty awful job.  
 
Art 5/10  
Not really much to be said here. The art is average. Nothing particularly special. Mostly generic medieval backgrounds. The character designs look okay. Easy on the eyes and they're all visually distinct from one another.  
 
Sound 6/10 
Again, not much to be said. The show relies on a few specific tracks that aren't bad by any means, but nothing I'd go out of my way to listen to. The voice acting is also very solid across the board. Special props to Masato and Wise's VAs. They did a great job throughout the show and (Wise specifically) managed to get a few laughs out of me.  
 
Characters 2/10 
Oh God... Where do I even start here? The characters range from forgettable to complete and utter disasters. For the sake of brevity, I'll only focus on the main characters that are prominent throughout the entire show, so no Kazuno or Medhimama.  
 
Masato 
I'll be honest, at first, he comes off as extremely unlikable. He seems like a spoiled brat that doesn't appreciate anything his mom does for him, and has no understanding of how good his circumstances actually are. As the show goes on, however, my position completely flipped on this poor guy. He's an adolescent looking for an adventure, and when given the opportunity, he bit. Sadly, due to his mother's obliviousness, he can't even enjoy the game he's in, for reasons I will get to later. Out of all the main characters, he's definitely on the higher end, which is telling since, ultimately, he is just another bland isekai protagonist that we've seen about a million times to this point.  
 
Shirase  
If I had to rank these characters, Shirase would probably take number 1. She just about saves this pile of trash, and if it weren't for her, I may have dropped this anime much sooner. Even in her fairly limited role, she manages to carry this anime for the most part. Her voice actor is outstanding, and almost anytime Shirase is on the screen, I'm usually cracking up. From her first appearance to the very end, she is a blast, and it's very unfortunate that her character is wasted in such a crappy product. Shame.  
 
Porta 
I'm not going to be extremely hard on Porta. She's cute, and that's really all there is to her. She is the only one of the three added party members to not be introduced with her own story regarding mommy issues. She's not necessarily a bad character, but there's nothing particularly interesting about her besides the fact that she's the cute lolita character that we've all likely seen before.  
 
Wise  
If Shirase is number 1, Wise is the distant 2nd. The token tsundere, Wise is actually pretty funny at times. Her obnoxious personality can be somewhat grating, but she managed to make me laugh more than once. She seems like a bootleg version of Aqua from Konosuba. Mostly useless, cries more than she should, but doesn't come off as totally unbearable. Sadly, her introduction is arguably the most controversial part of the show.  
 
Long story short, Wise was in a far worse situation that Masato. She wasn't just forced into the game with a person she didn't care to be around, she was forced into the game by a person who evidently didn't like her. Yes, Wise's mother, Kazuno quite literally abandoned her family to go off and party. I've seen a few people defend her actions, and quite honestly, it disturbs me that anyone would condone what she did. I don't normally allow anime to have a personal impact on me, but the way the writers handled this relationship pissed me off. They attempted to paint a picture of both sides sharing guilt, and ultimately, Wise was the one who apologized, despite not having anything to apologize for. They seem to be under the impression that children, no matter the circumstances, should be completely submissive to their parents' wills, if the parent has good intentions. This line of thought only leads to toxic relationships and spiteful children.  
 
I could go on for pages about why this story (and people that actually sympathize with Kazuno) is extremely dangerous, but this review is already long enough. Let's just say that I was very ready to drop this show while this story was going on.  
 
Medhi  
Oh boy.. Medhi. After the disaster that was Kazuno and Wise, Medhi's introduction actually gave me a little bit of hope. Once again, we were introduced to a mother that was borderline abusive, only in this case, Medhi's mother (again not very subtly named) Medhimama was too involved in Medhi's life. Her overbearing attitude and extreme expectations of perfection from her daughter had begun to cause Medhi to suffer psychological damage. Once again, I assumed the show would fail miserably in handling such a vile relationship, but I was pleasantly surprised when they had Medhimama actually admit to her role in the deterioration of the relationship, and give a heartfelt apology, allowing Medhi to make the decision on whether or not to forgive her. For all the things that this show did wrong, they managed to get this part right, and I like to give credit where credit is due.  
 
Unfortunately, they even managed to screw that up. See, Medhi seemed to suffer from some form of split personality disorder as a result of trying to please her overbearing mother. She acts all happy and loving around Medhimama, but completely changes her demeanor, releasing her hatred and resentment towards her when she is not around, making very snide, seething remarks that make your skin crawl. So of course, after the two had made up, you would assume that these actions would stop, right? Well no, apparently, Medhi is just a very spiteful bitch (pardon my French). Actually, Medhimama's exit only makes her personality worse, as she arbitrarily insults certain characters for no good reason, even to the point that they break down and start crying. Now I understand that this is played for laughs, but it makes only makes me wonder if Medhimama may have been justified in her actions, since she seemed to be keeping Medhi's personality in check. Not a very funny nor well executed joke, if you ask me. This ultimately hurts her character, making her an unlikable, two-faced piece of crap.  
 
Mamako 
And last of all, Mamako. Mamako Oosuki is supposed to be the quintessential example of what motherhood looks like. She loves her child more than anything else in the world. She's extremely doting, kind hearted, loving, etc. When you think of the 'best mom ever' Mamako is probably what pops into your mind.  
 
And yet, despite all of that, she may very well be the worst mother in this show.  
 
See, the problem with Mamako isn't that she's irresponsible like Kazuno, nor mentally abusive like Medhimama. No, her problem is that she is downright clueless as to how to raise a child. Does she love Masato? Yes, no doubt about that. Is she good with kids? I'd say she's perfect. Is she a good mother? Absolutely not. She makes absolutely no effort to understand Masato, and why he feels the way he does, and as a result of this refusal to understand his point of view, she ends up ruining the game for not only him, but all of the party members involved. If her goal was to bond with Masato, she failed miserably, as throughout the show, Masato's goal seems to be trying to go on missions without her present, so he can actually have a little fun of his own. Mamako's severely overpowered abilities are played for laughs, but really, all she's doing is being selfish, and hurting the relationship between she and her son. When she's not wrecking everything in her sight, however, she spends all of her time smothering Masato. She treats him as if he's still a toddler, incapable of doing anything without mommy's guidance. Through 11 episodes, the only thing that Masato has learned to do is put up with and justify her stupid actions, and I'm sorry, but that is NOT bonding. It's very easy to be fooled by Mamako. She's beautiful, kind, loving, and more. But under all of that is a very selfish person who is completely oblivious to the plight of her son, and that makes her an unbearable character to watch. Sorry, big tiddy MILF-san, you almost had me for a sec.  
 
Overall, the characters in this show aren't horrible, but the bad characters are so unbearable to watch that they bring the overall score down to a 2.  
 
Enjoyment 2/10  
As stated earlier, the writing in this show varies from decent to downright terrible, and more often than not, the writing is just terrible. Every now and again, there's a good joke or a well executed story, but those moments are few and far in between. Honestly, had I tried to binge this show all at once, rather than watch it weekly, I doubt I would have made it all the way through. The lows in this anime are simply too frustrating to sit through, and honest to God, I need that full week to process the trash I sat through. It's so unfortunate that a show with so much potential failed so miserably due to god-awful writing. I came in with relatively low expectations, and this still manage to not only miss the mark, but leave me utterly appalled at the sheer lack of quality.  
 
Overall 3/10 
There really isn't much more to say at this point. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone. It's a complete disaster with a few solid moments here and there. The moms are horrible, the characters are forgettable minus a couple of exceptions, and overall, watching this is simply not a pleasant experience. This anime is a complete waste of time and you're better off watching good isekai, even if their stories are somewhat generic to this point. Okaasan Online needs to be shut down. What a mess.  
 
Thanks to anyone that actually read this. 

          
 
       Helpful This show should be regarded as more of an allegory than a typical story. In essence, this is an allegory of the birth of the man-child, also known as puer aeternus, due to the overbearance of the mother. 
 
Masato is your typical male, desiring to separate himself from the dependence of his mother, while the mother wishes to infantalize his son forever. It is inevitable for a loving mother to do this, such is that, it is the duty of the father to forcibly separate the son from his mother, which gets to an interesting point. 
 
The father is basically missing from Masato's life. However, this is akin to modern society. Less fathers act like fathers, in that they teach their son how to ""man up"" and become independent, instead relying on technology to distract and the mother to raise them. This is even more apparent in boys who grow up in single mother homes. 
 
The ""adventure"" that Masato seeks is a reference to rite of passages of old that used to this. A boy would be forcibly removed from the protection of the mother to fend for themselves. Despite the father being absent, Masato still wishes for this independence, but is unable to do so. So his response is to forcibly reject his mother, saying hurtful words or to outright distance himself physically, which is the wrong approach. Yet, Mamako's desire to protect her son forever, is also bad for Masato, which comes back to the father's role in a family. 
 
The mother should be to provide comfort, and it is evident how good relationships develop when this is prevent. When the mother ISN'T comforting, great resentment is developed, which is also explored. Children tend to start ignoring their parents when they enter their teenage years, due to desiring independence, and the lack of any rite of passages in modern times. Yet, after entering adulthood, they should realize how important their mother was to them, and appreciate what they've done. Rather than viewing them as burden that needs to be discarded, mothers should be viewed as someone that they cherish and work with. 
 
This is the partial journey of Masato, which covers him going from rebellious child (who wants to unburden himself of his mother), to becoming appreciative of mother's presence. Will Masato ever establish true independence? Will Mamako ever relinquish her grip on her son? I guess I would have to read the novel to find out. 
 
 
 
Art-wise, using white as the color of pupils is really offputting. It's so unusual that I can't help but feel that they're staring off into space at times. Otherwise, the art style is generic good, in that there's nothing particularly bad nor good. 
 
 
 
Sound-wise, only Mamako's voice really stood out, largely just due to the character. Her voice fits the typical role of a caring anime mother very well. Everyone else's voice acting wasn't bad, just not outstanding. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment-wise, the reason why I rated this highly was because it really resonated with me when I realized the similarity of the story of the puer aeternus. If it didn't seem to have this relevance, I would probably rate it much lower.

          
 
       Helpful Ugh.... 
 
This anime has identity problem. Props to them for trying something new, but the series in the episodes I saw can't decide if it wants to be a parody, a comedy, a fan-service series, or if it is going to keep promoting ""parent-child bonding"". 
 
In the end by 4th episode they push the ""parent-child"" thing too hard and it becomes cringe-inducing.  
 
Story: 4/10 
 
As I said, identity problem. It doesn't know what it is trying to do so we go through fanservice phase, parody phase, and end up with ""parent-child relation"" phase. The relation thing sounds very preachy and shatters suspension of disbelief. Not that there was a lot of suspension of disbelief to begin with. 
 
Art: 6/10: 
Art is surprisinglyg good. It is kinda stereotypical, but detailed and well drawn, however by episode 4 I noticed attack animation reuse. 
 
Sound: 5/10: 
Okay, I suppose? They're tryin to joke with music on occasion, but it doesn't work. 
 
Characters: 4/10: 
Heavily cliched, with male lead being annoying to the point where you want to slap them. Definitely do not resemble real people in the slihtest. 
 
Enjoyment: 4/10: 
I didn't like it. 
 
Overall: 4/10: 
Not recommended. Visuals are nice, but this anime was quite unenjoyable for me, and characters weren't believable. 
 
So I dropped it after 4th episode.

6,3638,125,5.197840543,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Kaiketsu Zorori,"Adapted from the popular storybooks of the same name by Yutaka Hara, Kaiketsu Zorori follows the adventures of a scheming fox named Zorori, who is determined to become the King of Mischief with his very own castle and beautiful bride.  Although Zorori is notorious for his pranks and tricks, his conniving plots often backfire and end up helping his targets, and despite appearing to be villainous and immoral, he is actually caring and sentimental.  Nevertheless, Zorori has the wits, intelligence, and dexterity to always find a solution out of the most hopeless of situations.  Travelling with a pair of twin boar bandits, Ishishi and Noshishi, he continues on his journey to make his deceased mother proud.","['Adventure', 'Comedy']","Set in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji (かいけつゾロリのドラゴンたいじ, ""The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer"") and has published about two issues per year, totaling 70 issues as of December 2021. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on Cartoon Network Philippines on January 4, 2010.
Zorori was originally a villain for the series Hōrensō Man (ほうれんそうマン, ""Spinach Man"") written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when Hōrensō Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō (ほうれんそうマンのゆうれいじょう, ""Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle"") (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, ""Zorori Castle Part 2"" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Yōkai Gakkō no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the Hōrensō Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.
Using clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult kanji or any furigana, instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school ""children's book"", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the PTA demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).
At the time of publication, The Zorori League (ゾロリーグ, Zororiigu) and Stupid Monster (ボケーットモンスター, Bokeetto Monsutaa) (a play on Pokémon) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.
Furthermore, the Spanish word for fox is ""zorro"", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble Zorro.
","Kaiketsu Zorori, based off the children's book series by Yutaka Hara had a very fun anime, even for an older viewer like myself.   
Story:  
The story is fairly simple: A anthropomorphic fox named Zorori wants to become an evil king and own a castle and marry a beautiful bride to succeed the goals he said to his deceased mother.  Although two boars, Zorori, and Noshishi, tag along as his servants.   
It's a silly little story, but I rather liked it for the execution of it made it fun to watch in 52 episodes despite it's simplicity.   
Art:  
The art is actually good, nothing much to be said about it but it has a kiddy feel to it and is well-drawn for the most part.  It's use of vivid colors and simple background art just fits all in very well.   
Sound:  
The sound effects were funny and good to say the most.  Although the music, such as ""Zorori March"", was rather fun to sing-along to.  So it was pretty fun overall.  
Character: 
The characters Noshishi and Ishishi may lack character development, but they do serve a purpose to get into Zorori's character depth.  It wasn't the deepest, but it was fairly interesting to figure out Zorori and see some of him grow and somewhat develop 3-dimension-ally throughout the series.   
The large cast of characters appear at certain times too, such as his rival Gaon, but not much to say there besides a good set-up. 
Enjoyment: 
I really did enjoy watching each episodes.  For all the reasons listed, it just fell in place to my personal interests and had made it worth the watch . All the silliness and some good comedy made me laugh, the somewhat suspenseful parts really got me into it as well.  
Overall: 
Kaiketsu Zorori is a hit-or-miss thing, but most likely great for children as that's what it was aimed for.  For me, it was an anime for just enjoyment and relaxation for it's silly-fun story and characters.  I felt it was worth my watch!

Together, they play strange games, go on spontaneous journeys, crack silly jokes, and celebrate each other's successes. However, each individual must also deal with their own issues, whether it is struggling to meet a deadline or coming to terms with traumatic events buried in their past.

As the story progresses, the underlying conflicts of dreams and goals surface, as each character attempts to achieve their dreams, in their own way. One such example is the rivalry between author Itsuki and his friend Haruto. Itsuki's stories are driven by a passion for stories about little sisters with praise from a selective yet strongly supportive fan-base, whereas Haruto's stories are driven by victory and romance through more common, yet popular cliches. Each of their stories are riddled with common light novel themes and concepts, such as romantic comedy elements and erotic illustrations. They are all looked after by Itsuki's younger ""brother"" Chihiro, who in fact is his younger stepsister.
","Disclaimer: I do not have any problems with fanservice. It's just that the fanservice in this anime is not executed well and detracts from the better parts of the show. 
 
 
Imouto Sae Ireba Ii is an anime that excels in what it shouldn't excel in and fails at what it should succeed in. What a normal person would expect out of an anime like this is minimal storytelling and plenty of raunchy scenes full of little sisters. However, there are no little sisters to be found, and instead the view is given a minimal yet powerful and melancholic overarching story and fanservice scenes that feel overdone and boring, providing nothing else besides fap material.  
 
Story - The plot in this anime is practically non-existent with there being a basic premise and fun hijinks between college-aged friends. Despite this, individual episodes have the capacity to give off a melancholic yet beautiful vibe. On the other hand, there are fanservice episodes that give no effort whatsover and that beg for the viewer to buy a BD. These two balance out to a 5.  
 
Art - It's pretty good and the girls are cute.  
 
Sound - BGM is upbeat and fun, the OP is pretty good, and the voice acting is good. Nothing much else to say.  
 
Character - Like the story, the characters can be generally split between fanservice and melancholic. Miyako and Fuwa particularly pull at the heartstrings at times as they realize that they're missing something that Kanikou and Itsuki have. Kanikou and the manga girl are lackluster, on the other hand. However, unlike the story, the Characters are generally better with even the fanservice characters having decent development.  
 
Enjoyment -  Once again, the fanservice/melancholy dichotomy comes into play here. The enjoyment of the show shoots up when the writing really delivers, but is canceled out a week later when a meaningless episode made to make blood rush to the lower body airs. But hey, if you love that kind of stuff and like good character development here and there, enjoyment would be an easy ten.  
 
Overall - As said above, this show is for people who crave fanservice. Its excessive nature at times will deter possible viewers away, especially in the first episode. However, if you are willing to endure this, you are in for a real treat. Tissues may or may not be needed. 

          
 
       Helpful First, if you haven't watched ... skip to 1:42 of the first episode, you will probably thank me. 
 
The series isn't a Bakuman for Light Novel authors, but it gives you a good approach at the industry and allows you to learn about how things go in their ""normal"" days. 
 
I put this series on hold, some weeks ago, but then against my better judgement gave it another chance and I'm kind of glad that I did, the enjoyment from the first part of the series wasn't much so I put it on hold, but ...  
 
I rewatched ep 4 and went with 5 instantly, the 4th was funny but it was the same as the other, but ep 5 was super interesting and you can see how the mind of an author works, then ep 6 was even better a really strong episode, I would even say it was the best of the series (Haruto turned to be my favorite character)... and ep 7 happened, it was rising really good my interest and then a full 100% fanservice episode, it made me remember why I put on hold the series, the rest of the episode were interesting too, but they had the same faults, going up and then down between episodes and even in the same episode.  
 
in the specific section: 
the story isn't something out of this world, we have our average harem protagonist ""in college"" (well...), at least that is something more new. He's a novelist (works in light novels, *cough eromanga-sensei *cough) and has a big ass fetish on imoutos (little sisters), but he doesn't have one, instead he has a ""trap"" little bro that really cares for him. He isn't that bland as a protagonist, he has some complex (it's a japanese series so you can easily guess what's going to be), with just one day he can grew hair really fast, it's not a bad one, but I wouldn't call him the best MC of the season.  
 
the series goes for the slice of life with a tint of gags each chapter that makes you think it's a 4-koma (seitokai yakuindomo), but the series is based on a LN, it has a manga adaption in neither of them have that style, so it tends to feel really flat when overused each chapter and it was used every single episode, it also has a side A and B of stories, that one tends to be a tabletop games and that trust me, are pretty funny most of the time, except ep 7 that went too far though, but most of the time they don't give you much detail in the characters, but I would probably play with friends some of them. 
 
art isn't bad, music isn't bad, OP is fine, ED is great, and they have a little music to announce each chapter that is pretty nice, and appears from time to time each episode (the same as with the gags, it can be easily overused, and probably will -and it was-). 
 
characters are pretty much stereotypical, but ochinchin girl is cute and except for the boxers scene, she's charming and she kept her style all season, you can love her or like her (and you can notice the original author fetish *cough nun dress *cough), she doesn't get annoying. already talked about the MC, the best friend got his episode and he used pretty well, since ep 6 I really liked each time he appeared and how he acted was the most realistic one of the bunch, he's pervy too, he can fall in love, he isn't dense, feel envy, sadness, joy and complements pretty well the MC and it's good that he's there so he doesn't have to monologue as other protagonist.  
 
this series is pretty much binary, you like it or you don't ... I don't know how I found me in the middle and kind of glad I did, but if you can put up with the innecesary fanservice and want to know more about the characters in another LN adaptation of the creator of Haganai, do it, it's on your own risk.

          
 
       Helpful ""But wait! There's more, really!"" 
 
Yeah, like everyone here I agree that the first few quotes of this series are incredibly off-putting, if not at least polarizing. 
 
BUT, after buckling down and watching the first few episodes, I've come to really enjoy the shameless cast because they aren't afraid of who they are. They're dynamic, they feel real, and the relationships are relatable. For those of us who know nothing of the writer's profession, this is also a pretty nice peek into that. 
 
This is an example of a finely written slice-of-life. There are no action scenes; the humor isn't all ecchi; in fact, most of the humor isn't roll-on-the-floor-funny. BUT (yes, but), you'll keep watching. Why? Because the show is well-put together, the writing can be witty, and the show will very subtly get you invested in the cast. Before you know it, you've finished S1. 
 
TECHNICALITIES: Animation is a solid 8. The music reminds me of Oregairu, so a solid 9. Watched subs first which was good, then dubs which was GREAT because of the voice actors. Ended on a cliffhanger so eagerly looking forward to S2.

As the days pass, the eleven cadets must deal with their suspicions of each other as well as the sudden knowledge that the spaceship is in a decaying orbit around a star, which is causing the temperature on the ship to rise. With this rise in temperature, a sickness begins to spread among the crew as they work to stabilize their orbit and determine who among them is the spy.
","They Were 11, an overlooked classic. 
 
In the distant future, warp technology has allowed humanity to explore the vast expanses of space, meeting strange races and populating other planets far away from our humble earth. They Were 11 follows Tada, a man who aspires to join the prestigious Cosmo Academy. As part of the final entrance test, all of the remaining applicants are split into groups of ten and put into actual starships to work together and survive for 53 days without outside assistance. 
 
However, as soon as Tada and his group are safely aboard the starship, they notice something is amiss. There are 11 people aboard. Who's the odd man out? How did he get there, and what is he after? This is the premise of They Were 11, and I have to admit, that alone compelled me to watch this movie. 
 
For fear of spoilers, I shan't venture too deep into the actual plot, which is definitely the main attraction. Seeing the group, riddled with suspicion and paranoia, make their way through day after day, all while facing different challenges and hardships will keep you on your toes. I wanted to find out who the 11th man was just as much as they did, and that's a sign of solid storytelling. Naturally, there are twists and revelations along the way, as well as a conclusive ending. (Which I suspect could be controversial, but I was more than satisfied.) 
 
Let's talk a little bit about the characters. They're great. A varied bunch of personalities, some of them with alien appearances, customs and physiologies. Some get more time to shine than others do, but with eleven characters and only an hour and a half to work with, that's perfectly understandable. What we do learn about the characters in terms of background helps to not only flesh them out, but also flesh out the setting, as each character's tale lets us learn something about his homeworld, and its struggles and conditions.  
 
Again, I find myself limited as to what I can discuss for fear of spoiling anything. I'll just say this; the movie has a lot of heart. There's a sweet charm to much of the character interaction, and a few humorous moments you wouldn't expect a movie like this to have to be found throughout. I appreciated them a lot; they provided both the characters and the viewers with a little break from the suspense. 
 
While some viewers might be put off by the art-style, I find it delightful. It holds up well, and just looks damn good period. There's a lot of personality in every character design, and the setting is brought to life with nice backgrounds and subdued colors. The animation doesn't hold up quite as well, but it was never to the extent that my enjoyment was hampered at all. 
 
Overall, ""They Were 11"" tells a unique, suspenseful and well crafted tale of survival and cooperation in dire and uncertain circumstances. It has heart, charm, an interesting setting, and will keep you guessing and smiling. It gets a strong recommendation from me; they rarely make'em like this, either now or back then!

Slight intro to this movie without spoilers 
Often we see/hear events/people but having a second thought is not really done. Although, when one is put into a important situation does one start to really care. Sadly, that tends to be a little too late. Luckily they have a life line to use but that is it exactly a 'life' line. And they only have 'one'. 
 
Story 
-Was a bit confusing at first but it made sense. It was an okay confusion because when it comes to science fiction anything most often something is made up and once your mind welcomes that idea or concept the rest starts to sink in.  
-Introduction was narrative 
-conclusion was nice for it was almost memorable. Kind of like the way the breakfast club movie ended. You get each characters follow through without really stepping in their shoes and seeing from their eyes. 
 
Art 
-no complaints 
-I think changing the art would ruin the show.

Enjoyment 
I found this movie entertaining. From the plot being hard to predict. Strong character management, not just by being independent from each other but interaction wise as well. Original concept or rarely seen in terms of messing with your mind. Face it, when we are told a story it plays out one way. Introduction, followed by plot and ending result. In other words, we don't need to think just watch. Here, thinking is a must. Not only that but depending on the situation you must think fast. Hitting the pause button for this would only ruin the thrill.

They Were 11 takes place in the far future where the united races of space have constructed an academy that trains the future leaders of the galaxy.  Only the creme de la creme even stand a chance at passing the entrance exam.  Those that do must face a final test before admission, and that's where this particular work takes us.  Ten applicants must survive on a decrepit spaceship for a giving amount of time.  Upon arriving, they find their are eleven rather than the prescribed ten. 
 
The concept for this story--as near as I can tell--is one of the most original I have found coming out of the Sci-Fi-mad 80s (note I speak here of anime originality, as certainly 11--like so many other 80s Sci-Fi works--takes the Lost in Space que as its foundation).  And within the story there are enough plot twists to keep anyone from being bored.  I have to say, at least one of them seemed just a little too convenient for the story to progress, but it added an interesting dynamic and allowed for a satisfactory conflict.  Short of this, I can only say this is one of the best stories I've ever had the privilege to watch in a Sci-Fi anime.   
 
The music and sound effects aren't anything particularly special.  I have had a separate opportunity to watch the English dub of 11 (only the sub was released on VHS), and so I'm including it in my review since the DVD is the likely copy you will find.  The dub is fair.  Fewer awkward moments and statements than many other dubs of 80s anime I have seen.  However, I have to fall-back on saying I prefer the Japanese version.  This is mostly my own feeling that one or two character's voices aren't fitting (though all the others are a nice match).  Also, the American-equivalency of an Osakan accent was, frankly, overdone here.  I therefore recommend sticking to the Japanese version. 
 
The artwork for 11 is nice.  It's not as pretty or shiny as some other works, but it gets the job done.  The character design suits the portrayal of each character.  And while the players in this flick do seem to be inspired by stock character types, there's enough interesting back story to give the important characters presence.  
 
My enjoyment of 11 ranks right up there with Space Adventure Cobra and LOGH.  I might watch the movie about twice a year on my own, but take any given opportunity to introduce it to an unfamiliar audience.  11 has several qualities that seem to have inspired later anime (such as Infinite Ryvius), so if you're a more recent fan of the Sci-Fi genre, They Were 11 is an absolute NECESSITY to watch.  You may call it Lost in Space, but by this point I think we're beyond forcing connections between anime and early live action movies/shows.  11 stands up for itself without having to be supported by inspiration from 60s television.  It's a movie you don't want to pass-up.

Actually, they're only playing for their school, but haven't exactly covered themselves with glory. When the new player, Gregor (Daichi Kakeru) arrives at the school, they just had faced a resounding defeat again. However, thanks to Gregor, things are going to change. Highly motivated, they'll try to get rid of their ""always-loser-team"" image. Their strongest enemy are the Devils, who Gregor provokes right from the start. However, it's not all about football. When the captain, Mario (Hongou Masaru), is not pursued by his female fans, the Kickers often hang around and do stuff together. 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Shounen', 'Sports']","The story is about an enthusiastic kid soccer team at the Kitahara elementary school, who struggle without a competent striker, when little Kakeru Daichi's (大地翔 Daichi Kakeru) family moves into the town. He immediately applies to join the team, keen to use his skills gained in the kid team of famous soccer club ""The Falcons"". With Kakeru the team becomes complete in every sense and he motivates the team to challenge the ""Red Devils"", a strong secondary school team whose goalkeeper Uesugi is considered undefeatable. They lose 10 to 1, but Kakeru's scoring a single goal is still a small miracle. Under the strong leadership of their own goalkeeper Masaru Hongo, Kickers then enter the kid championship and fight their way up through hard won victories. Meanwhile, Hongo falls in love with Ayumi Daichi (大地歩 Daichi Ayumi), Kakeru's cute, sporty sister. In turn the striker enamours Akuna Yukie, a fragile, angelic pianist girl, who happens to be Uesugi's much younger sister. These affairs lead to some embarrassingly funny situations as well as numerous complications with the team's devoted and jealous cheerleader trio.
For a short while, Kickers gain a professional trainer whose instructions help them win their way to the semi-finals, just to meet the Red Devils once again. After a dramatic match, that spans two 20 minute episodes, Uesugi fends off Kakeru's final freescore and so the Kickers are out! The devastated team is soon divided by the arrival of Harry, a famous junior talent, who has been fired from three big name teams already for subversive behaviour. He infiltrates and splits Kickers, but his rudeness and Hongo's strong leadership re-unite the team. Harry then seduces Ayumi and assembles a faux team out of the school's scum so he can defeat the Kickers almost alone. Although the naive Kakeru is no match for the older and much stronger Harry, the Kickers's teamwork spirit and Uesugi's support secures a victory in this dirty match and Harry is devastated. The anime series ends with a redeemed Harry reconciling with the Kickers, before leaving the town to play overseas.
","Overview: 
 
Why are Germans better than Americans at football or ""soccer"" as we say here in the US? The largest reason is not simply that they care a little more about it (understatement of century), but that it is so much a part of their popular culture that they are actually weened on poorly drawn soccer cartoons. In 1986 a poorly received soccer anime was on the verge of being scrapped, but the Japanese ported it to the Germans hoping that maybe it would find an audience there. It became one of the most massive anime hits in German history. On facebook the MAJORITY of Die Mannschaft admitted to being big fans of this anime growing up! A single video of the German intro on youtube has over 4 million views! Lets take a look at this cheesy 80s classic that none of my fellow Americans have heard of, but my European friends never stop talking about! 
 
Story: 5/10 
 
The story is about as generic a sports story as you can get. It is every kids sports movie ever made compiled into 26 episodes. Just think of The Little Giants, the Mighty Ducks, The Big Green, and the Bad News Bears all morphed into an anime. 
 
Art: 3/10 
 
The art is TERRIBLE! However, it was the 1980s, so most anime without huge budgets like Akira and Ghost in the Shell looked pretty shoddy by today's standards. The art also adds a cheese factor that makes the show more enjoyable honestly. 
 
Characters: 5/10 
 
The 2 main characters are the generic good guy Daichi and the big bad guy Harry, who groups together a bunch of thugs to defeat Daichi's Kickers. I forgot what they were called in the German version. Any German voters can help me out by posting their local translation names on my wall and I will edit this review. If you liked the characters in Shaolin Soccer, you will like these characters. Although personally I prefer Shaolin Soccer because Stephen Chow is one of the funniest human beings on the planet.

Do you wish to see A German live action movie as I do? Let us remind those other euro countries in the 2016 Euro Cup what it is like to live in fear of our Mannshaft.

The mission is to train talented people to bear the world's future leadership. However, recently, the suicide rate in the academy is increasing and there is hardly any information being released to the public.  
 
Fujimiya Aya is sent to infiltrate this school carrying out criminal investigation and disguise himself as a teacher. In fact, actually, there is a connection between Koua academy and the global terrorist activities that are frequently occur. Therefore Persia assigns Hidaka Ken and Kudou Youji as well into this mission to solve the truth and connection of the incident behind Koua academy.  
 
(Source: AniDB) ","['Action', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","Four young men consisting of Omi Tsukiyono, Ken Hidaka, Youji Kudou, and Aya Fujimiya, are members of a group of assassins called ""Weiß."" They cover their operations by working at a flower shop during the day and solving/fighting crimes during the night. This is no ordinary group: they kill the murderers, big businessmen, and other assassins that the law cannot touch. Each one is fighting for their own reasons, whether it is for revenge or to help the people that they care about. But they soon realize that there are connections between some of their cases and try to find out what is really going on. They use whatever they can to complete their missions and kill the people that are targeted by Weiß's leader.
A short story entitled The Meeting can be found in the All That Weiß official artbook. It explains how the Weiß members met the first time. According to the official Weiß Kreuz chronologies, the version of how Weiß was formed from The Meeting is the one working with the series.
","Gluhen’s first review, show Weiss Kreuz some love, people! Especially to the previous 25 episodes and OVA. This sequel Gluhen adapts the previous formula and works when you think of it as one long episode/mission spread over the 13 episodes here. 
 
- Art: 6/10 - A marked upgrade from the previous season, with greater animation all round. There are character redesigns due to legal behind the scenes stuff, but it occurs a few years later so makes sense anyway with the updated appearances. 
 
- Sound: 4/10 - Its fine on the grand scheme of things, Weiss Kreuz does has it’s own signature theme and music to enjoy.  
 
- Characters: 5/10 - Love all the characters, but the score applies to the fact it focuses on the new ones, when I wanted to see the original members from the start, and have the new ones alongside them. Spending 25 episodes, OVA (also drama CDs and side stories, TV Tropes has the best chronology) with Weiss Kreuz is a very long time. Yes it makes sense to introduce new faces, the studio was likely thinking that it couldn’t do the same things forever, and could use this new season to mix things up, fair enough. But when Omi is in the background, and Ken and Youji appear about half way through the season, I would have preferred the focus on the four main guys we’ve gotten attached to as always. Having said that this is fine if we consider the whole of Gluhen as one extended episode as said above. For instance in the previous season, in one episode when the focus was on one cast member you wouldn’t see someone else for half the time, if that, so it’s fine.  
The cast we've come to know and love, and the new people introduced shine best in later episodes when they're all present. Schwarz and the Crashers (from Aya’s backstory, before he joined Weiss) also appear, and everyone and the plot develop to culminate in some of the greatest episodes of the entire series. 
 
- Story: 3/10 - No, didn’t want Omi placed in the background by being Persia, yes I wanted Ken and Youji right from the start, no, wasn’t fond of how after everything they’ve endured they continued to be emotionally drained (though understand this was done to generate drama, and it shows they’re not monsters, they’re bothered by what’s happened because they’re human, good save) but I understand why the creators changed direction. They were fazing them out so they could retire and live safely, but involve new members to keep the Weiss series going. Weiss was always about the four first and foremost, to be with Aya, Ken, Omi and Youji for so long, to have them move on to different lives, and then the story continues as if that’s ok, but it's not, it was always about them. Will have to pretend it ends like before with them together and taking out anything that gets in their way, an alternative and better happy ending. They didn’t need to get out safely, they needed to solve their issues by leaning on each other more, but it’s a drama thing, and a there, they're out safe and alive aren't you happy? So it’s understandable the story took the direction it did. 
 
- Enjoyment: 10/10 - it’s a series that can chuck cat litter at me, I’d like it no matter what, no point in saying what’s good and bad just appreciate what’s been given, you only think that’s for series that impact you so guess this is one of them. And as stated, the final episodes are some of the best of the entire series. Even though it came out a while ago, newcomers can have a fond sense of nostalgia on the entire series, somehow, even if you’re not a part of that time period. Weiss is magic like that, it generates it's own unique feelings. Aside from the final plot points and people themselves, a best part is a reaffirmation of the ultimate trust and bonds the four members have with one another, the heart of the series.  
 
- Overall a good 6/10 - On it’s own, and using this sites ratings system, Gluhen is a ‘fair’ anime. As a sequel to a quite precious series, it’s part of the treasure (if you modify the ending so they remain together, or take a break then come back together and pretend they’re in the discontinued Side B manga sequel to Gluhen, again, together) and so the 10/10 for personal enjoyment matters, especially for the entire series as a whole. It’s good the series got to continue, it was a Seiyuus project, I love it, and brings closure to an overarching threat for the entire series, at which point the team can finally find peace.  
(Btw Aya doesn’t die, this series fully embraces the awful grisly ends for like everyone (they’re necessary evil assassins taking out greater evil) and they’ve all overcome worse than a simple knife wound multiple times. It ended with Aya alive, conscious and able to stay upright, no way ever a death scene).

In Brazil, Marco boards an immigrant ship and arrives in Buenos Aires, where he meets a puppeteer called Peppino and his family, whom he knew from Genoa. They accompany him to Bahía Blanca to try to locate his mother.

His mother is very sick and needs an operation, but she is too weak. As soon as she sees Marco, she regains her strength and manages to go through the surgery successfully.
At the end of the series, Marco and his mother return to Genoa, where the family is reunited.
","Marco: Haha wo Tazunete Sanzenri, also known as How to Butcher a 52-episode Epic Series is a movie that trims down 1196 minutes of character development, magnificent settings, drama, sentimental bursts, emotions and empathy into 90 minutes of nothingness. The original series is a work of art that makes you feel what the characters are feeling, that makes you care for them and create emotional bonds. This movie lacks every single kind of emotions that made the Isao Takahata's 1976 production a masterpiece. Every hardship Marco goes through in this movie seems completely artificial, different from the series where the hardships are felt by you as much as they are by Marco. 
 
Don't waste your time watching this. Watch the original series, one of the masterpieces of Isao Takahata's career, along with Heidi and Anne of Green Gables. They're capable of making you a better person.

","there are a lot of things that can be said about this but im just going to point out some that stick out the most. 
 
the movie itself is one of a woman who questions herself about her life more or less in a nutshell. the intro and some other music in this movie was calming and made portions of the movie seem serene which was a nice touch. the art work would have achieved a better score if it weren't for one thing and this is just my opinon, but did any one else notice how bizzar looking Okajima looked everytime she smiled? she did not look 27 at all when she did, but more older.  
 
the story line did not appeal to me as i hoped it would and was bothered by the fact that her life in just the 5th grade was just downright awful and made me wonder and would bring that up a lot and the result of this i started to get bored.this and the the artwork is what resulted in the character's score and the boredom was more or less just left a thought of ""why just fifth grade? could there perhaps been worse times after that?"" the final thought at the end was that there was a resolve and she was finally able to figure out what was missing in her life like Shel Silversteins book ""The Missing Piece"". which saved itself from me giving it any lower then a three.  
 
overall: less pity 5th grade. liked the 5th grade her and kids making her move at the end.she should smile less, it creeps me out. i would give it a 3.5 and it would be categorized as a meh. 

          
 
       Helpful First I was scared to be bored because of the design and the subject. I avoided this movie for a very long time. How stupid have I been? -> very stupid!! 
 
There’s no magical elements in this Ghibli movie. It’s grounded in reality. It's definitely on the adult side. It feels like reading a novel about what made you as a person, dealing with adulthood and finding your way in your 30s. 
 
The storytelling is smart and heartwarming. The romance aspect is realistic: no big drama or childish reaction. The writter/director totally nailed the subject and the emotions that go along. I feel like this is the kind of movies you can rewatch and have some deeper connection with as you grow. 
 
In the end, the design and the animation were totally fine. They perfectly fit the scenario. 
 
Overall, I think you’ll be left with a nice feeling - and maybe with hope.

i think the theme of this story is growing up, or it's don't catch periods. pretty good dub. it's not very #relatable to me but also i didn't pay much attention. there are two hours of movie and only about half an hour of it is actually engaging. don't do alcohol, that's not really related i just think it's a good idea for anyone reading this. 
 
i cant say that this is a good movie, because it's not, it's bad. this movie is horribly paced, it's bad. i don't like this movie, it's bad. the only feasible excuse for this movie being so fucking awfully rambling is it being the memoirs or life experiences of one singular person. as far as i'm aware this is not based on a real person, it's bad. 
 
this is a studio silly movie so of course it's pretty to look at, unfortunately one can only spend so long appreciating anime art before it gets up and leaves. the dub is good in the child sections, it's also fine in the not child sections. too bad nothing fucking happens in this movie.

Neo-Venezia, based on Venice in both architecture and atmosphere, is a harbor city of narrow canals instead of streets, traveled by unmotorized gondolas.At the start of Aqua, a young woman named Akari arrives from Manhome  [sic] (マンホーム Manhōmu, formerly Earth, sometimes stylized as 地球（マンホーム） with the base text for ""Earth"" serving as a gloss) to become a trainee gondolier with Aria Company, one of the three most prestigious water-guide companies in the city. Her dream is to become an Undine, a gondolier who acts as a tour guide (see Terms below). As she trains, Akari befriends her mentor Alicia, trainees and seniors from rival companies—Aika, Alice, Akira, and Athena—and others in Neo-Venezia. Aqua covers Akari's arrival on Aqua and her early training as a Pair or apprentice. Aria continues her training as a Single, or journeyman, culminating in the graduation of her, Aika, and Alice as full Prima Undines.
Each chapter is a slice of life episode of Akari's exploration of the worlds of gondoliers, Neo-Venezia, and Aqua itself. Amano frequently uses several pages of lush art to depict an environment, showing the wonder of both everyday activities as well as one-of-a-kind events. It has been described by reviewers as very similar in tone and effect to Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō.
","MOD EDIT: Review contains spoilers 
 
I am so thankful for this OVA. While the last episode of Origination was utterly fantastic and had me on the brink of tears, this truly helped give me closure from the depression I felt immediately after finishing this incredible series – an extreme feeling of loss. I think one of the only problems I had with Aria as a series (and trust me when I say, it’s a very small problem) it’s that Alicia seemed TOO perfect, to the point where she was almost detached from everyone else. 
 
In every episode, she never showed fear or anxiety, anger or pain. And near the end of the series, when she dropped the bomb she was getting married, it seemed almost illogical, because if she was so close to Akari, why didn’t she ever tell her she was seeing someone? It’s funny, because I often wondered how it was possible guys never seemed to approach her. Then all of a sudden near the end, she’s not only been seeing someone, but she was ready to marry him! Why wasn’t he even mentioned? He should have played some part or at least been mentioned in my mind. 
 
That’s the only qualm I’ve ever had with this series: that Alicia didn’t seem to have full humanity – she was basically a goddess. But this OVA, I think, was meant to address this issue. She was sad when Grandma left and she was apprehensive about taking a student but she fell in love with Akari - truly in love as a sister - rather than as a watchful protector. And when you see this episode, you really feel a lot more strength when you think of the last episode of Origination, when Alicia visits Akari after retiring. Before, it felt like that visit would be one of just a handful and Alicia was gone pretty much for good, much like Grandma’s first student, who also married and moved away. But, with this episode, it was more and it really gave a finishing touch to Aria. You know that Alicia won’t be at Aria Company anymore, but she will always be nearby and Alicia and Akari will forever be the best of sisters and friends. 
 
This was fantastic and I would even go so far as to say it is impossible to appreciate the full breadth of this anime series without this last episode.

          
 
       Helpful When I think of the ""Aria"" series as a whole (Animation, Natural, and Origination), there are certain things I've come to expect:  
 
1. Outstanding Animation with scenes that take your breath away. 
2. Memorable and quotable characters that you can't help but root for and can easily relate to.  
3. A story that both entertains and satisfies the viewer without leaving a ""what the heck"" aftertaste in my mouth. 
 
""Arietta"" meets all these expectations and then some.  
 
1. The animation as a whole was both familiar and shocking to me. The viewer is still treated to the outstanding visuals that have remained consistent throughout the whole series, with rich textures and attention to detail, but Arietta turned it up to 11, showing much MORE detail than even ""Origination"". I would be remiss if I didn't mention two particular scenes that took my breath away. The first was the opening sequence over the song ""Nanairo no Sora o"". The rich colors, the use of light and shadow, and the view of the buildings leading up to Aria Company was something that I can safely say I've NEVER seen in any anime of this genre. The second scene is during the practice session between Akari, Alice and Aika (A scene I will discuss later when I talk about the characters). While the previous three seasons did an outstanding job showing the rustic beauty of this city, the OVA once again outdid itself and made Neo-Venezia shine even brighter. Every single detail from the cracks in the building to the downright gorgeous reflections in the canal water make this particular scene one of my favorites. The attention to details with regard to shadows and shading also deserves special mention. Character designs remained pretty consistent and true to the earlier seasons, with subtle changes to Akari and Alicia.  
 
2. While it's true that the story of ""Arietta"" mostly revolves around the relationship between Akari and Alicia, “Arietta” does an outstanding job of integrating the other characters that we’ve come to know and love. All the characters, even those that don’t have a lot of screen time, shine as brightly as they did during the series and pickup right where they left off. I have to admit, after watching the conclusion of “Aria: The Origination”, it was really heartwarming to see our three gondoliers-in-training practicing on the waters of Neo-Venezia again in that black gondola; Aika forbidding any and all sappy comments, Alice offering her cool commentary on the topic at hand, and President Aria…well…doing what he does best; laying around letting others cuddle him. It’s this, plus the earlier mentioned animation that makes this one of my favorite scenes in this episode with the Campanile scene at the end a very close second. Additionally, the flashback sequence, where we see Alicia, Akira and Athena as new young Primas was a very surprising and well done scene. Overall, it was as though the last couple episodes of “Origination” never happened, and this is just another heart-warming episode.  
 
3. If there’s one thing “Aria” is good at, it’s weaving a good story that leaves the viewer satisfied; “Arietta” is no exception. The story is basically one of self-doubt, knowing when to hold on, when to let go, and finding the strength to carry on. It compliments the ending of “Origination” perfectly. I especially love how every character is integrated into the story, without taking away from the principal characters. Just like the planet Aqua, everyone is connected in some way, shape or form. 
 
In conclusion, ""Aria The OVA: Arietta"" is the perfect companion to the ""Aria"" series, combining great visuals, the same interesting and intriguing characters, and a story that leaves you feeling satisfied.  


          
 
       Helpful Let's dive right into this. 
 
STORY 
Compared to the usual stuff from the series, this episode is more relevant to the characters themselves, namely Alicia and Akari, and reveals that Alicia does have her weaknesses (who'd have guessed). 
It also hints at what is to eventually come. 
For a 30-minute OVA I had the impression it was longer. Not that it's bad - moar Aria is never bad - in fact, it only made the enjoyable experience longer. 
 
ART 
The background, CG and animation were just about perfect, but I can't bring myself to like the different drawing style of the character's faces compared to the TV series. The cheeks are too thin, and the eyes a touch too big, making the faces rather...disproportionate. A contant distraction. 
 
SOUND 
On par at least with what we've been getting from the franchise. The OP takes some getting used to, but I liked it; it fit very well with the overall tone. 
 
CHARACTER 
With the dearth of development for the sempais for the TV series, a huge dose of delicious jailbait Alicia backstory is just what the doctor ordered. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
As relaxing and uplifting, with a touch of melancholy. Though as mentioned above the faces were a constant distraction. 
 
OVERALL 
Still can't get over the drawing style, but otherwise a great OVA.

God's power is scattered across the Earth, and if He does not gather enough by the turn of the millennium, He will die. To block Him, The Devil had sent out agents to gather His power, which is the beauty in human hearts, in the form of chess pieces. With Finn's assistance, Maron transforms into the reincarnation of Jeanne D'Arc in order to hunt Demons hidden within works of art. When Maron seals a Demon, the artwork disappears, and to the outside world it is as if she has stolen it, and she becomes a kaitō (""phantom thief""). Maron's best friend is Miyako, the daughter of a police detective in charge of Jeanne's case.
As the series progresses, Maron and Miyako fall in love with new classmate Chiaki, who wants to stop Maron collecting the chess pieces, for he knew that Finn Fish is the Da-Tenshi (Fallen Angel), but apparently in the form of normal angel. Chiaki at first ""fakes"" falling in love to get closer to Maron, knowing Maron is Jeanne. Later he falls in love truthfully after realising that Maron is worth the effort, even if she does ""hate"" him. Maron, on the other hand, is confused and does not know what ""love"" means because her parents abandoned her when she was around ten years old when they were having problems getting along, so no one taught her. As a result, she does not know how to respond to Chiaki's advances.
The manga relates in detail Finn Fish's background, expounding on Finn's relationships with other angels and the events that led to her becoming Maron's partner. This backstory of the angels is not shown in the anime. Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne has often drawn comparisons to Sailor Moon for the magical girl theme and similarity in appearance between Kaitou Jeanne and Sailor Moon.
","So this anime is great, i love the romance, i love the magic, i love the characters. 
 
story : 8/10 
 
i said i love this anime, but this anime is really stressed on what is absolute evil and what is absolute kindness, im kinda against that so i personally think this is an anime for younger kids and would like u to know that the plot is great its just my personal issues. There are good points and bad points to both the anime and manga, i recommend watching both. The manga have a better ending, though the anime already have a happy ending(i meant it you are not new to anime you pretty much know all this kinds of anime leads to happy ending) but the manga ending is like even more happy or something? 
If you watch both, you will get a very detailed backstory for each main character.   
 
art : 10/10 
 
the art is PERFECT. it is so shoujo-ish, its exactly for girls. Now i would say that the manga actually have better art than the anime but... the anime' transformation is awesome. so this anime is tittled 'kamikaze kaitou jeanne"", 
and you can kinda guess that it have somethings to do with theives. The main characters actually go through a transformation, which involve flashy lights and lots of turning and stuff. But in the manga its kinda dull, there's not really the process for transformation, like poof the girl has changed. 
 
sound : 9/10 
 
The sound i great, but its like average... there's no really good points and there's no bad points either... 
 
Character : 9/10 
 
the characters are awesome, there's a lot of backstory given for the girl, and a little for the guy. they have strong personality and there's so much of character development. But you know you can never have too much. Now in the manga, there's is more backstory given to fin fish. So it's best to read both manga and anime. 
 
Overall : 8/10 
 
i know it will be 9/10 if i don have a preference over what kinds i like, so it's just something personal.

          
 
       Helpful My first anime. I was so moved. I enjoyed watching my first anime Dearest (as I called them later). As I liked Chiaki I hated Fynn.  
Watching this anime I had fun, but for me, manga was better. Anime isn't so close to manga, and some actions are really bad. Oh, and I hate openings. I always skipped them >.>

          
 
       Helpful I just finished watching this anime for the second time today, and I adore it. I love the plotline, and the characters have great personalities. 
 
The story and progress of the story is a little slow in the beginning, but Maron's past and her slowly evolving bond with Chiaki managed to keep me interested. Of course, her adventures as Kaitou Jeanne and the adorable Fin Fish, as well as the mystery around Kaitou Sinbad and Access rope you in as well. 
 
The second season is when this story really starts to get amazing, in my opinion. You start to learn more about Jeanne d'Arc herself, Maron and Chiaki become closer, and the drama gets more intense as it progresses as you learn more about Maron's parents. Not to mention what you learn about Fin. ;D 
 
I love this anime for many reasons, and if you like Magical Girl animes, this is a must watch for you.

6,267,134,5.104978645,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Gungrave,"Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowel, two friends so close they could be called brothers, receive an abrupt and violent reminder one fateful day of how appallingly merciless the world around them can be. Their whole lives before then were simple and easygoing, consisting largely of local brawls, seducing women, and committing petty theft to make a living and pass the time. What they failed to realize is that in this cruel world, happiness is fleeting, and change is inevitable. 
 
Enter Millennion, the largest and most infamous mafia syndicate in the area, which accepts Brandon and Harry into their ranks and starts them at the bottom of the food chain. Harry has ambitions to ascend the ranks and one day replace Big Daddy as the supreme leader of Millennion, while Brandon only wishes to support his friend and appease Big Daddy who has taken custody of the woman Brandon loves. 
 
Based off the third-person shooter video game under the same name,  Gungrave  is an epic story of friendship, betrayal, and avarice that spans the course of several years, ultimately tying back to the gripping and foreboding first episode, all the while building up to the story's thrilling conclusion. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen', 'Super Power']","Gungrave opens thirteen years after Brandon Heat is betrayed and killed by his best friend Harry MacDowell. He is reborn through the use of necrolyzation as Beyond The Grave, and begins a quest of revenge against the crime syndicate. The series then backtracks to Brandon's youth, and follows him and Harry as they rise through the criminal underworld, detailing the circumstances that led to their eventual falling-out.
","Trust, honor, family and above all else, loyalty. 
 
 Throughout the years, Gungrave has become a cult classic within the anime community. It's a title with so much mafioso stylistics, so much grit, so much bravado oozing in every scene, that a panel consisting of Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese would find themselves salivating at the mouth upon viewing it... well at least for the first 15-episodes that is. As for the rest of the show, it all depends on if a Terminator revenge/monster mashup movie hybrid sounds like a good idea to you (I wish I was kidding when I said that). But I implore you, don't let that deter you from watching this. If you're a fan of mobster flicks, Gungrave offers enough trademark elements of this niche genre to keep even the most jaded of audiences attentive. Watching it for just the relationship dynamic of the show's main characters, Harry and Brandon, is reason enough to give it a chance. And for many, that remained the only reason for why they finished it to begin with. You come for the mobster appeal but stay for their compelling relationship.  
 
 It's safe to say, that in order to fully appreciate this title, one must first suspend their disbelief for the supernatural elements that it contains. If you've seen the 1st Berserk adaptation in 1997, then this anime follows a similar pattern in terms of story execution and character interaction. But unlike Berserk, Gungrave is a self-contained story that leaves you with a conclusive ending and not the infamous cliffhanger that the aforementioned is known for. The 1st half of the story functions like a platform buildup of sorts, giving us the proper motivations of the characters, all the while foreshadowing for things to come in the show's 2nd act. Where the show receives most of its accolades is within the buildup itself. Nothing feels like it was just there to steer the plot. We as viewers see the beginning of the ""snowball"" effect, as it gradually grows into the outcome that befalls both central characters. Anyone familiar with the elements typically associated with mafia flicks, would be aware that the cast is quite extensive. To avoid going for a lengthy period of time highlighting all of them, I'll instead only focus on the two main characters that the narrative centers around, Harry and Brandon.  
 
 Harry can be summed up in just two words: ambitious and cutthroat. He's the kind of charismatic guy that always seem to have an appetite for more, which constantly places him and his companions in a ""tight squeeze"", for the lack of a better term. On the surface, he appears to be just a stud who just wants to have a good time, but as the show progresses, we can see that facade slowly crumbling away, after a series of life-changing decisions pushes the dormant animosity within him. This gradual chain of events that brings upon a change in him, paves the way to explore a multi-layered character with a great deal of depth found within each plunge into his inner psyche. The amount of detail they were able to pull off with such a simplistic ego is quite impressive. A feat in proper characterization that the writers behind the show deserve praise for. He's not a man that's easily pegged with just a singular viewpoint, but rather one that gains dimensions as we gradually see his metamorphosis throughout the narrative.  
 
 Brandon, despite being the ""short on words"" kind of guy, provides a great deal of insight through his narrative role in the show. What he doesn't say in words, he does with his actions. His body language is his way of communication. He too changes as an individual as the story progresses. Although we get nothing from him at face value, the brief monologues and his internal moral strife help establish his characteristics and drive. Brandon isn't as demanding as his counterpart in terms of motivation, instead, all he really wants is the power to protect the ones he loves. He isn't the most compelling individual to follow, but what he lacks in spunk, he more than makes up with heart. His bond with Harry is what drives a majority of the intrigue with him as a person.  
 
 Speaking of their bond, Brandon and Harry's relationship is a rare dynamic to pull off correctly. Second only to Guts and Griffith's from Berserk, their relationship with each other is like a dance between ideals. It's handled with such gravitas, that it becomes almost eerily realistic at times. They establish history. A friendship. A rivalry. A love. And eventually, a hatred, all the while feeling the pain of every exchange. A struggle between friends that's grown so close to each other, that their very closeness ends up tearing themselves apart. They share a comradery so tight-knit that it becomes a delicate walk on a tightrope, where the slightest push can become fatal. And it shouldn't have to be stated but that's where the heart of the conflict rises. It's ironic, but in the end, both men became a monster in their own right. This is how you properly execute the ""two sides of the same coin"" motif. 
 
 The rest of the cast is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each character adds a much-needed element to the show. Some becoming the embodiment of a certain theme, such as loyalty, while others become common mobster stereotypes for added flavor. They're nothing incredible on a stand-alone evaluation but becomes the heart of the show when looked at in an overview. 
 
 Alright, now that we're done talking about the sentimental stuff, let's talk about all the awesome shit that makes Gungrave, GUNGRAVE! 
 
 The anime was made back in 2003-04 and it still blows my mind how pristine it looks even today. You can tell a lot of love and effort went into its inception. From the fluidity of the actions scenes to the detailed art that brings the world to life, Gungrave is an anime that was built to last. But then again, that's to be expected when you have Madhouse at their prime, kicking ass and taking names. Their reputation speaks for itself, with Gungrave being another notch under their belt. The art-style and character designs are very similar to that of Trigun, and to no one's surprise, given that Yasuhiro Nightow is the man responsible for the birth of both series. The art-style draws heavily on western influences and it shines through in every scene.  
 
 This anime is chalked full of ""rule of cool"" and awesome action set pieces. Everything has substance and weight to it, making for an addictive watch. From the over-the-top shoot offs, to the monster battles that takes place, later on, there's never a dull moment to be found. And with a brisk pace that doesn't take any detours, it makes Gungrave into an easy binge-watching experience.  
 
 To accompany us on our journey, we're given a very diverse soundtrack, drawing heavy inspiration from jazz, swing, and blues. With guitar pieces that worked in unison with the violin, to the more upbeat heavy base guitar and trumpet, every moment was rich with sound, sucking you into the mood being transmitted on screen. It breathed life into the mobster setting, with the atmosphere and tone needed to sell the experience. With beautiful art, attention to detail and a soundtrack that held its own, Gungrave was a project that delivered on every front.  
 
 Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
 
 Be warned, this is a manly man's show that will cause you to grow hair on your chest. Gritty, action-packed and always in motion, this will be a title that I'll remember for years to come. Of course, this doesn't change the fact that it takes a lot of the substance it established and squandered it with the monster mashup during the 2nd half, but I still enjoyed it as a whole. The mobster theme was still there throughout, it just takes a backseat for the 'shoot em up' carnage towards the 2nd half. Thankfully, it offers a great payout with the final handful of episodes. Even when taking the shortcomings into consideration, Gungrave was still a very enjoyable ride.  
 
 Overall: 7.5/10 
 
 As a whole, Gungrave was a good show that was hindered from being better. More doesn't necessarily mean better, something the creators of Gungrave seem to have missed. With compelling leads and an inviting mobster setting, Gungrave could have easily been a universal classic, but due to the unneeded supernatural elements, it was knocked off course, having to settle for the cult classic archives instead. Even with all things considered, I still highly recommend this anime to newcomers and veterans alike. It had style, it had charm, but most importantly, it had heart.  
 
 
 I'll make you some recommendations that you can't refuse (sorry couldn't help it lol): 
 
 Berserk: The main character relationship are extremely similar in progression and they both start off in relatively grounded setting, before slowly merging towards the supernatural. The biggest difference is the setting itself, but when stripped down to the essentials, they become very compatible. 
 
 Trigun: Other than the fact that both were handled by the same person and share similar art design, the 2nd half of Trigun plays out identically to Gungrave. There's more comedy and the content is treated more lighthearted here, but fans of one might enjoy the other.  
 
 Black Lagoon: Take out all the character depth and leave all the over-the-top ""shoot em up"" elements and you'll essentially get this. A more brainless popcorn flick than anything else, if you just want the action of Gungrave then this is the go-to choice. They also play out in a similar setting and contain supernatural elements as well. 
 
 Darker than Black: This is a loose recommendation but both contain organized crime syndicates and the main character is also a man of little words. DTB is more of a mystery setup with x-men characters but still one you might find enjoyment out of if you liked Gungrave. 

          
 
       Helpful Gungrave is a show which is almost completely about the buildup for two very powerful and dramatic moments which rank up there with some of the best episodes I've seen in anime. There's a catch though, the rest of the show rolls around in mediocrity with redeeming moments placed in such a way as to keep the audience sucked in just enough to think that the show will make an upturn. Let's start from the top, shall we? 
 
The first episode is a failed attempt at dramatic foreshadowing which is not only unnecessary but a huge spoiler for the first dramatic moment and great episode which occurs about halfway through the series. Worse yet, the first episode is completely retold with a few additions later in the show, making it a definite skip for anyone watching Gungrave for the first time. 
 
The first half of Gungrave revolves around two street punks rise from the streets through the ranks of the mafia. If you can buy into the protagonists Harry and Brandon, then the ride is probably worth the waiting. Gungrave commits the cardinal sin of boring it's audience on a regular basis. Plotting and depth of character are talked about a lot but rarely shown but it remains a character oriented show. 
 
I felt for the self-inflicted plights of Brandon and had a growing distaste for the ambitious Harry, as the writers wanted, so when the drama started to kick in I lapped it up. I managed to overlook the zombies as they served a point in the progression of the plot but they really should have been replaced with something non-science fiction. 
 
After their introduction, the zombies take a backseat for some solid character drama, the first real high point of the anime. After the first climax we have more zombies then a jump to the future where the show takes a major nose dive. Word on the street is that Gungrave is a tie-in to a PlayStation 2 game of the same name and these episodes make me believe it. The drama is mediocre and the action is awful. The zombie helicopter is the low point of the show, it makes no sense and the character who transforms into it has been such a background player that I couldn't care less about his death. 
 
A mess of episodes focusing on characters who we are supposed to care about but who never had any development ensues. Unfortunately one character who was developed and did have a shot at having an interesting arc is thrown away in the series of game tie-ins. Finally we can leave the carnival of pointless zombie ""science!"" for good and go back to the core of the show. The conclusion to the show is epic and one of the most satisfying, and tear jerking, conclusions that I've seen in a long time. If it didn't require all of the build-up of the non-zombie episodes I'd recommend just watching it but unfortunately it's a package deal. 
 
Gungrave makes an excellent candidate for a show to be remade with better writing and the crap flushed out.

          
 
       Helpful Boy, this sure was made by the creator of Trigun. That was one of the first observations I made while watching this anime, and it held true to the end. Many creators have some recurring styles and motifs shared between their works, and comparing it to such a well-known and well-loved classic has the capacity to be both good and bad. It certainly doesn't help that this was also adapted from a video game; game adaptations in general rarely fare well, and from what I've heard the original game itself was mediocre at best (I haven't played it though, so take that with a grain of salt). With such a strange, potentially disastrous production history I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this series. It's still very much its own thing, but its creative background is definitely notable enough to warrant mention. Don't make a drinking game out of the times I say ""Trigun"" or ""video game"" in this review, because it will kill you. Just wanted to get that out there. 
 
Madhouse of the early 2000s wasn't as consistently solid a studio as they are now, and Gungrave is definitely a little rough around the edges. Nightow's character designs definitely give the show a distinct flavor, leaning more toward realism than Trigun but still retaining a tendency toward some weird proportions, with scraggly limbs, long faces and broad shoulders. Grave's design in particular looks like the unholy lovechild of Legato Bluesummers and Brilliant Dynamites Neon. It's a rough, harsh-looking series, nary a bishonen to be seen, and I think that's what they were going for. The style takes a little getting used to, and when the budget drops it can be hard to keep those designs appealing, but when the animation hits its stride it looks great. Of particular note is its use of lighting and lens distortions, which add a lot to some already incredibly tense moments. Like Black Lagoon, another famous gunfighting Madhouse series, the action scenes occasionally amount to the characters standing in one place shooting without worrying about getting shot, but thankfully this gets phased out in time for the climactic battles later on. The animation isn't great, but it's good. Let's leave it at that. 
 
This series boasts a strong soundtrack that's largely comprised of vaguely Italian-sounding string and orchestra pieces with a little synth mixed in, generally sticking to the mafia motif while ranging in tone from warm and familial to cold and dangerous. There's some really good music here, but weirdly enough I think Gungrave is at its best when there's no music at all. This series thrives on quiet character moments, and some of its best scenes go by in complete silence. There are some exceptions, but on a whole the music for this series is at its best when it's either gentle and understated, diegetic (from a source that the characters themselves can hear, like a radio) or just not there at all. The soundtrack is still great, though, so you should definitely give it a listen if you ever get the chance. 
 
The cast of this series is 99% populated by gruff old men, which means the Los Angeles pool of voice actors is perfect for the job. All the big boys are here: William Frederick Knight, Michael McConnohie, Beau Billingslea, the list keeps going. The Japanese dub was very good as well, but there's one actor in the dub who steals the show completely, and that is Tony Oliver as Harry. His Japanese seiyuu, Kenji Yamada, plays him as fairly laid-back, in control but unassuming. Tony Oliver, on the other hand, seems to understand the character much better, his voice always carries a twinge of aggression. Harry is a very ambitious character, someone who's always taking the initiative to get ahead, and Oliver captures that ambition with every word he speaks. Kirk Thornton, Steve Blum and a several others play their roles well, and Tom Wyner does a fantastic job as an older version of Harry in the second half of the show. As usual there are some awkward secondary characters here and there, but on a whole it's a laudable dub well worth listening to for Harry alone, though not quite good enough that I'd recommend it to dub haters. 
 
While Trigun was well-known for its creative worldbuilding and grand concepts, the thing that really set it apart from the crowd was its strong beating heart, and the same can be said of Gungrave. Yes, there is technology that can revive the dead and create super-soldiers, not to mention a very well fleshed-out look at mafia operations and the underworld, but the thing that really holds this story together through it all is the concept of loyalty, and what it really means to betray someone. Millenion is held together by a cardinal rule known as the Code of Iron, which declares that all traitors to the organization, regardless of status or standing, receive an equal penalty: death. Such a code is simple in theory but exceedingly complex in practice, and the first half of the series, which follows Brandon and Harry's rise to power, takes full advantage of that ambiguity. Millenion's leader, Big Daddy, carries a lot of understandable guilt and self-doubt after dirtying his hands the way only a mafia boss could over the years, and the Code of Iron that forms the crux of his loyalty to those below him is how he comes to terms with it. The various members of Millenion, as well as several third-party characters, all have their own concept of loyalty, but it never becomes trite or stale the way shonen friendship speeches do. 
 
That's not to say that the show is dour and political all the time, though, it's also very cool. The characters here all have ridiculous, over-the-top, completely badass names: Brandon Heat, Harry MacDowel, Balladbird Lee, Bear Walken, Cannon Vulcan, Laguna Glock, Blood War (no, seriously) and as yet another Trigun comparison there's even a character named Descartes. The mafia exploits are intriguing, the ways they make money and how they're integrated into the community is intricate and closely resembles how a real-life mafia would operate. Aside from the choreography hiccup I mentioned earlier, the battles are intense, imaginative in the different weapons and styles used but still very grounded and often telling us something meaningful about the characters involved without breaking suspension of disbelief... at least in the first half. Even when it gets really talky, Gungrave is never boring. This is a rare balance that keeps the show engaging if you don't want to think about it too hard, but there's still a lot of depth and subtlety to the characters here for those who want something more from their choice of entertainment. 
 
The characterization, though, is definitely the meat of the story, and at the heart of it all are Brandon and Harry. Harry is ambitious to the point of ruthlessness, but his goals aren't without principles. His philosophy is that those with power are free not only to take what they want, but also to give it away, and while he's hardly a paragon of selflessness there's a lot more to his vision than pure egotism. He has a grand plan and believes what he's doing is for the best, which makes him extremely corruptible. Brandon is a much purer individual by contrast, and his goals are much simpler. He's quiet and unassuming (think ""video game protagonist"") but earnest and genuine. He just wants to live a happy life with his friends and loved ones, and if that means helping Harry climb the ladder then he'll become a mafia sweeper without hesitation, but he's also there to step in if his best friend strays too far off course. But of course, it's never that simple. As Brandon comes to love and respect Millenion's leader, Big Daddy, alongside his continuing relationship with his childhood friend Maria, it becomes clear that staying loyal to one might mean betraying another, and he has to come to terms with this in his own way. Several other side characters bring their own perspectives, but for the sake of brevity I'll not delve too far into them. Suffice it to say that the first half of Gungrave is one of the greatest betrayal stories in all of anime, right up there with Guts and Griffith. Now if only the story had a stronger sense of focus. 
 
Once again following in the footsteps of Trigun, about halfway through Gungrave shifts its tone and focus dramatically and doesn't quite manage to tie up its loose ends. In the first half, a process known as necrolization is introduced that brings back the dead as super-soldiers. Okay, I could go with that, it's both necessary for Brandon to come back as Grave and a good way to fuel Harry's ambitions. In the second half, a new process is introduced that can transform living soldiers into mindless drones called Orgmen, as well as transforming their leaders into sentient monsters known as Superiors, and this is where it gets pretty ridiculous. Aside from a little added perspective to an already-peripheral ""have I overstepped the boundaries laid down by god?"" subplot, these elements serve next to no purpose and could easily have been written out completely with relative ease. Instead, it turns the show from grounded character drama to over-the-top action spectacle, and the show's video game roots start to rear their head. The Orgmen are video game mooks, and the Superiors are video game bosses, period. These fights are just there to be cool and action-packed, but that was never what Gungrave was really about. 
 
Nightow is a creative man to a fault. He has a lot of grand, wonderful ideas but doesn't always know what to do with them. Maybe with more runtime or tighter writing it could have given meaning to the cacophony, but the world of Gungrave is a cluttered mess. Even in its stronger first half, the seeds of its oncoming problems were present--allusions to an unspecified war, Tomases from Trigun racing in the place of horses and some really outlandish technology make it clear just how little we know about the world of Gungrave, and it stays that way to the very end with disparate elements that really don't feel like they all belong in the same story. None of that, however, was as obnoxious as the inclusion of the Superiors, which took what could have been some of the most emotionally involving confrontations and made them... well, not bad, but they mostly didn't have nearly the impact they should have. It's hit-and-miss. In the last few episodes a rival faction comes pretty much out of nowhere just to make the ending fall into place. Thankfully, that very ending turns out to be the show's saving grace. It brings the story of Brandon and Harry full-circle in a way that's cathartic, completely justified and entirely satisfying. 
 
I'm not sure whether I can truly call Gungrave ""great"" or not, but there's certainly a lot of greatness in it. The plot goes some weird and unnecessary places, and like Harry himself it becomes something of a victim of its own ambition, but the parts of it that shine through are truly fantastic. The humanity of its cast and the sincerity at its heart--not to mention a damn near perfect ending--are more than enough to blow past its flaws, and I warmly recommend it.

This anime is very enjoyable for children. If you are looking for something a little more intellectually stimulating, try a different anime. This is a bunch of cute little kid fairy tales. It can be enjoyed by anyone who likes Hello Kitty at any age though.

Kōji Nanjō is one of the most successful rock stars in Japan, with his hauntingly beautiful voice and very attractive features. But beneath all the fame and glamour, he is a damaged and hurt young man who has absolutely no happiness or interest in life.
One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.

I don't know why they say it's yaoi. it's a one sided love only in the end it looks like that the white guy is about to rape the brown guy but in the end even that doesn't happen. the brown guy has only showed hatred to the white guy based on nothing literrally nothing. the brown guy found the white guy passed out between some garbage and just ignored him only for later to come back for no particular reason and when they woke up the brown guy is suddenly angry at the white guy. 
 
there is no good explanation about the past. The mother murdered the father because she loved him! No you didn't read that wrong it's literally what happend. I was also like wtf is happening.  
 
there is no logic in this anime and maybe it's me maybe I have to high expectations of yaoi because I happend to see one really awesome yaoi and got all hooked up on the manga because there were only two episodes. No, no it's not me, or is it? let me think a second. Yeah... I still don't think it's me.

To be honest the cover art and yaoi genre through me for a loop. Both i did not expect to be what i ended up seeing. The emotions and drama that went into this movie caused my emotions to stir. The passion, the strength of will really could connect to the viewer. Sure at first the story portrays a kind of screw you (hate you) kind of moment. However, had it not have been would the same ending have been reached? The cover art is there to show the stone cold emotion/emotionless feeling. The genre is there because both main characters are both strong roles. I am not saying a woman can not be as strong. Women can even be stronger but they are known for there emotions not there muscles. Hard truth but it is the truth. 
 
Along time ago i heard from an unknown source fight fire with fire. How can you do that if your love has been involved in a murder? making matters worse your parents are both the murder and victim. How can one recover from that? This writer found a way that i thought there would be none. The murder weapon needed to be in the hands of the innocent but how? How was the question. 

          
 
       Helpful The decision to start Zetsuai was a random one for me.  I am not the world’s biggest yaoi fangirl, not that I am somehow morally against or disgusted by the subject matter, but I always attempt to try new things.  I really did try to go into this with an open mind but sadly this turned out to be exactly the kind of tripe I was originally expecting.  As an anime in general this may be the worst drawn and most poorly designed show I have ever seen. 
 
The story starts out with a flashback of our hunky lead reminiscing about a football hunk from his childhood.  Excuse me will I clean my keyboard after spilling my tea laughing at that statement.  I lied; there is nothing hunky about our girly man leads.  Back on point, the lead Koji Nanjo is a super famous and popular musician who insists he isn’t gay, despite having these thoughts about this footballer.  Coincidently the now grown footballer, Takuto Izumi picks up the passed out and drunken Koji from a rainy alley and nurses him back to health.  I’m sure this kind of thing happens all the time.  Straight man picks up a drunkard from an alley and takes him home then sleeps lovingly with him on the same bed.  What a nice man. 
 
Actually this illness, and let’s call it what it is; IT’S A COLD!  It’s not life threatening!  For the most part healthy young men do not drop dead after getting wet and developing a small fever and the sniffles.  However this is a recurring theme in this anime.  I would guess that at least 60% of the story takes place in a hospital or in someone’s sickbed.  I know, I know, I am sure this is supposed to drive home some kind of splendid drama or titillate me with the promise of healing buttsecks. 
 
All this being said there is some decent drama beneath all the sickness and gay-angst.  Sorta.  Kinda.  Koji moves from a man who claims he isn’t gay to a flaming symbol of gay pride in the span of 10 minutes.  Most puzzling we are supposed to believe that it was the look in Izumi's eyes that so captivated him when he was younger.  Towards the end though the drama is fairly interesting as Koji tries to get his feelings across to the emotionally damaged Izumi.  The story doesn’t really end satisfactorily but it isn’t horrible.  It doesn't change the fact though that Koji is an obsessive psycho and there is nothing to make you think either one of them have any real feelings for each other besides what they say.  Additionally the sports action and portrayal of the music industry is unrealistic to say the least.   Yaoi fans looking for a lot of guy x guy action are also not likely to be satisfied either.  There is very little intimacy between the ""lovers"" and absolutely zero chemistry and nothing that is even close to being called romance. 
 
The cast for Zetsuai is small and pretty much keeps to its two leads.  They are both underwhelming as characters.  Izumi attempts to be played as this macho and manly athlete.  But he comes across as a heartless brooding asshat.  Yes, he’s had it rough.  He is haunted by the murder of his father by his mother and her attempted murder of him.  Because of the societal rejection of him as the son of a murderer he is understandably scarred emotionally and distant from people.  He is moderately sympathetic as a character because most of what happens to him or has happened in his life is really through no fault of his own.  I suppose the most inspirational thing about his is as a warning to people on why you shouldn't pick up strangers in the street and take them home with you. 
 
Koji on the other hand is equally passionless.  Though what exactly he is messed up about is anyone’s guess.  I find it quite laughable that someone with so little interest in anything could ever become a successful musical artist.  The only time he shows any real passion about anything is in playing the pining man-wife type, while he tries to force himself on Izumi.  He is a complete psycho and his antics get more and more over the top the more desperate he becomes. 
 
What can I say about the art?  Well it is without a doubt one of the most horrible things I have ever subjected my eyeballs too.  This kind of thing is precisely why I don’t watch this genre.  If you want to see two women together why not just watch a yuri anime?  It seems 99% of yaoi artwork is a rip-off of CLAMP designs.  The guys are way too feminine, with long girlish nails and fingers, long silky hair, and thin faces with knife like pointed chins.  Either the artist really loves Jay Leno or this is supposed to be attractive.  Additionally the characters are supposed to be 16.  Despite the silliness of that when it comes to the story, these guys don’t looks like they are 16.  No way in hell.  It’s not just the character designs that are hideous, the backgrounds and settings are just as bland and uninspired.  I suppose I should give it a bit of a pass being that it is from almost 20 years ago but I can’t see this looked good ever.  Even a cave artist would have thought this looked like shit.  
 
Perhaps the only thing worse than the art is the music.  Wow.  I can’t believe we used to listen to this trash.  If you want to reminisce to the good old days of hair bands and trite lyrics and corny keyboard sounds then maybe you will get a smidgeon of value.  As hair bands go Mötley Crüe rocked, this is more like listening to Nelson.  The acting performances are equally uninteresting and unmoving. 
 
Overall Zetsuai 1989 is an anime that should be avoided by all but the most undiscriminating viewer or yaoi fangirl.  I would say you could watch it for the lulz but you should love yourself more than that.  The only thing it really has going for it is that it’s a million times better than its epically shitty sequel.

       Helpful Randomness! What better way to waste some time than with a mindless show with a whale floating in the sky and a girl that randomly generates plush dolls? Well, maybe I can think of a few better ways, sure...nevertheless, on the contrary to what I initially thought, watching this little flick was actually quite interesting. It gripes me that it was so very, very short, though; the initial setup calls for a more fleshed-out storyline, but with twelve episodes spanning five minutes each, it never even really manages to take off. But would this idea ever be taken to a more fully fledged anime, I'd be certain to have a look at it. 
 
Story: 2/10 
As said, the initial setup is promising. A guy ends up at an academy for some reason, meets up with a bunch of odd characters (mainly girls), and random stuff occurs. Usually I write a coherent little summary under this headline, but it's rather hard to do it this time around without spoiling the entire...um, &quot;storyline&quot;, because of it being so short. But that's the gist of it, kinda. 
 
And...that's really it. A few characters are introduced in the first few episodes, but they're given such scarce airtime that you hardly get any time to bond with any of them. Massive plot points are left out: It's never explained how the main character ends up at that strange academy, and he also seems to have the hots for his little sister who wakes him up in the morning - this is also just left as-is. In the beginning, he's startled over the fact that a large blue whale floats high up in the sky, watching over them, but a few episodes in he's adjusted remarkably well to all random facts. And sure, there are a few episodes that link together, such as the trip to the beach, but many episodes seem torn and jumbled together from totally different storylines, and because of the length of the episodes they barely manage to make any sense, much less make an impact. So story-wise, there's very little to gather from this show, unfortunately; the show makes several nice plot directions, but they are simply never used. 
 
Art: 9/10 
Save for Yun-Yun's caricature appearance (a character that simply magically appears in the fifth episode without any trace of introduction), I have no complaints about this. The art and animation is in a style and quality you could expect from any anime show, with delicate lines and soft coloring. A few small details seem created with CGI, but they blend into the animation harmony nicely without sticking out like sore thumbs (as I've experienced some CGI effects to do). 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The voice acting - wavering between &quot;decent&quot; and &quot;quite good really&quot;. The music - beautiful, matching nicely with the mood of the show. It lacks an intro song, but with such short episodes it's to be expected I suppose. And the ending sequence is good, so it makes up for it somewhat. 
 
Character: 7/10 
Even though they're never quite delved into, I really can't rack down on the actual character designs - they all have their funny quirks, differing them from one another. I couldn't really say that any of the characters are uninteresting, save for the main character...I think that's how it's supposed to be, though, that the main character starts out as a slightly more blank slate than the others, and then gains his/her personality by interaction with the characters he/she meets. 
 
In this case, it's not entirely possible, though, since... 
 
...yeah, I've said that the anime is short quite a few times now, so I suppose you get the gist. I'm sorry. :p 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
Despite everything said and done, I enjoyed looking at this. Not for the storyline, but for the humor and situations embedded in the show. Every so often, it brought me to a laugh (randomness is a perfectly valid source of humor), and sometimes it delved into drama. Not so intense, not for so long, but still enjoyable. Naturally, the lack of a story robs the enjoyment of some points, as well as the fact that there's a lot of &quot;dead time&quot; in the show - drawn-out pauses, or scenes that are much longer than actually needed to put an impression through. Had they cut some of those pauses, they could've fit more substantial stuff into the show. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
Overall? A nice little pause from reality. Never mind the storyline - it was nice to look at, it was nice to listen to, and it was nice to chuckle at every now and then. And even though I doubt it will ever happen, I intensely wish for a more complete Saishuu Shiken Kujira to be released some time in the future, where the story has more time to develop and root in our minds. But until then, do try this one out - it could be more entertaining than what first meets the eye, if you'd give it the chance to be. 
 
And now, to check out the OVA! :)

          
 
       Helpful If you're thinking of taking a shot at this anime, I strongly advise you to click that little red X on the top of your screen and don't look back. I'm sure you can find other ways to use 60 minutes of your life. 
 
If you've already watched it, however, there's not much I can do. Go somewhere quiet and lie down. Take a nap. You'll probably develop a headache from trying to make sense of what you saw. When you've rested, get yourself a lawyer. You'll want to get your time back from the creators of the show. 
 
*Here Be Spoilers. But then again, there's not much of a plot to spoil* 
 
STORY: 1 
Storyline? What storyline? Saishuu switches from Slice-of-Life speed to Action about 3/4 of the way into the series. Of course, with 5 minute episodes, there are time constraints, but the contrast in speed (and apparent plotline) is beyond horrible. It feels like the series only had the first episode and the last episode made from the storyboard, and then cut the 2 into 12 five-minute episodes. You'll notice the HUGE gaping plothole near the middle, and will probably fall in. 
 
ART: 4 
Character designs were alright. Nothing amazing quality-wise, and none of it moved (Saishuu's world apparently does not have wind). The colors, however, were soft and calming, which is nice if you're into this style. 
 
SOUND: 6 
5-min Episodes = no BGM. There's rarely any soundtrack, and when there is, it doesn't match up with what's going on sometimes. However, Eufonius sings the ED, which is probably the best thing that happened to this series. 
The voices were not matched well either. The main boy has a very feminine voice even though his character isn't girly at all. Also, most of the voices (if not all) carry zero emotion. 
 
CHARACTER: 1 
No character development whatsoever. The first few episodes were slow, and characters were introduced. Then most of them magically disappeared by about the 8th episode, and never came back. Odd? You bet! 
 
ENJOYMENT: 3 
If you can manage to ignore all the outrageousness and plotholes, Saishuu can actually be enjoyed in an awkward way.There were some (rare) moments of genius as well. The flying bit was cute, and the beach episode was so cliché it was funny. Other than the complete lack of emotional scenes, it could be enjoyed if forced. And of course, the Transformer-Whale-UFO is all worth it in the end. 
 
OVERALL: 2 
If you turn a blind eye to all the weak spots, you'll have your eyes closed for the whole duration of the anime itself, and only watch the ending theme. 
With that said, Don't Watch! If you love your life, find something better for your time :)

Im about to write my first review in awhile, as until now its really been awhile since I found an anime so good, that it touched my heart to the point where I simply couldnt only give it a number and be done with it. Neo Angelique abyss is definately an anime out of the ordinary. I will be writing a review without any spoilers in it! 
 
Angelique is a girl with strong spiritual powers, in all her life, she has quite admired her parents who are doctors, to the point where she wanted to be a doctor herself. she kinda dismissed it as anything out of the ordinary even tho she had a feeling deep down where she thought something in her life was out of the ordinary. Life drastically changes when she meets a special man named Nyx, whom has read about her in the newspaper, and now is present.. at her school; here to invite her into his little group of people who fight and resist the terrible fate that is upon arcadia, The evil monsters called thanatos. Daily life is about to change for angelique the moment she heads into a brand new life and meet many new companions. 
 
her journey, I will claim is among the most emotional and worthwhile journies I ever saw per today in an anime. 
 
I thought the first season was pretty good, so i gave it a very good score, but the 2nd season really blew me away. not many shows have the capability of making the sequel beat the prequel, but this show nailed it. perfection is an understatement for this anime, 
it is amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even makes you forget about the time as you are watching it. I was up watching this, both seasons, but especially the 2nd season until 7am every morning. the characters are well developed, and just as it feels like the story is about to get predictable, it changes in a crazy way you would never see coming. I would certainly say that this anime has that element of surprise not many others have. This is one of the animes I have heard about a couple of times through my days of anime watching, but I always postponed it.... My advice to everyone out there who find themselves in a similar situation concidering watching this anime, do it immediately. you will surely not regret it. 
 
the soundtrack and music for both seasons? Id rate it nothing short of a top score, even now while writing this review I cant get the openings out of my head, the ending of the show? it was quite good. actually... it was PERFECT! But you have to watch the anime to see it for yourself. enough said, Im quite picky about my anime, and this anime... it was painful, but it easily dethroned one of my other top 10 animes.

          
 
       Helpful Neo Angelique Abyss was one of the first series of animes that I've watched. Watching the first season made me want to continue onto watching the second season. 
 
The story and plot was well written. As I finished the first season, I continued on watching the second season. I couldn't stop watching the anime. I spent the whole day watching the second season. The anime just kept me wanting to have more. By the time I realized that the second season had ended, it had me craving for more. It is unfortunate that there isn't more. 
 
The art in this anime was done well. The details of each character were magnificent. Overall, I found this anime enjoyable. This certainly was not an anime that I would put off to watch later.

          
 
       Helpful I loved the whole thing from the first season to the second one.....it was full of great n interesting scenes that just kept u wanting more....i think that the whole thing was very nicely planned out^^.......i would recommend this anime series to anyone who lovs great fighting scenes...lov.....n fantasy that are full of joy...so plz enjoy this anime as much as me^^

Their objective is to assassinate other teenagers who have the same abilities. The Flowers have no choice but to complete their missions without fail. Their organization has taken their family members hostage to ensure this. For the Flowers, failure would mean death not only for themselves but also for their loved ones.

","Not much to report on what we see on the show. 
 
 Some comment ""This is a bad story, it didn't entertain me enough in those 38m"", but look ...What is an original work is that in its planning was to tell a drama surrounded by much war and blood, where it was seen or made a little clear why this case is occurring.  Due to this, both in the animation, as in his commitment to develop a little history and its characters that would finally stand out more in the show, so as not to be white at all. 
All those explosions and gunshots were great, but they were enough to be bothering. 
 You see!!!!! 
In the middle of the house frame / explosions / shot / blood, we see animation interlaced and well placed in size and visibly suited in the middle of the sequence. 
Finally, it is a work that leaves something to be desired, as the initial approach is quiet, and in sequence it is already good for the rapid development and not very viable, I say that if there were a much more explanatory series in its narrative, and adequate and well-suited characters.  worked in the business, Under the Dog would be a good anime on his action list, sc-fi, Thriller. 
 I don't know what rating to give for this OAV, a 5 should be one more than not suitable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Under The Dog, An OVA episode that was not worth the hype. From the first PV and the $900,000 they were funded from kick starter, it was a disappointment. 
 
Story: The story was not incredible, fairly generic with the ""Pandora"". IT centres around a high school raid for no apparent reason, would have been better if it was done in a different place like a shopping mall or a stadium.  
 
Art/Animation/Sound: Art and animation were incredible in the fight scenes but alright in conversations and long-shot. The designs were typical and the colour scheme was too pale but got better in fight scenes. Explosions, Guns and effects were animated beautifully but that's about the only thing that was animated well. 
 
Character: Characters were underdeveloped, something that you would expect from an ova episode but could have done better. 
 
Overall/Enjoyment: The fights were cool, Characters and story were rushed in a way and was different to what i expected from the PV. I guess its worth the watch if you want to see some nice action scenes but other that it's not worth.

          
 
       Helpful It's fine.  For something trying to tell a story in under 30 minutes, it does okay.  As a concept, Under the Dog isn't bad at all, it's actually rather intriguing. 
 
Story:  There isn't much of a story, but for an action short it manages to have a few implications that are at least interesting despite, or even because of not being explained.   
 
The next paragraph you could consider spoilers, though there isn't much of a story to spoil and it's just speculation. 
 
From the OVA, we can assume that the idea is that there are these monsters throughout Japan and maybe the world that are extremely powerful and deadly.  The only way to kill these monsters is with assassins called Flowers whom we can infer have a more limited set of powers than the monsters, but are still the only things that can stand a chance.  In order to get rid of the monsters (I assume), they need a person who has the power of the monsters within them, but which has not manifested itself.  And the story here just follows an instance of trying to get  one of these people. 
 
Like I said, it's fine.  It's a sort of insta-plot that you've seen a thousand times, but if the show is tagged as Action, chances are you aren't looking for a deep intricate plot that requires lots of analysis.  All it is is a way to make things go boom and have cute girls with guns, and if that's what you're here for, it gets the job done fine. 
 
Art: Also fine.  Now I can understand why some people might be upset because in an action show with the most basic plot of all time and the most unexplored characters as well has pretty middle of the road animation, but once again, it does it's job.  The show has explosions, it has guns, it has some little parkour bits, it has scenes of people running through a hail of bullets, it has big monsters.  It's not supremely smoothly animated, which I feel like there could have been more effort put into that considering that it is only a half hour long and there isn't much else to come for, but it's fine.  To the average viewer, like myself, it works.  It didn't blow my ind, it didn't have anything that I wanted to watch over and over because of how cool it looked, but it''s passable.  Just because something isn't exceptional, doesn't mean that it isn't solid. 
 
Sound:  I believe in the idea that sound is done well when you don't notice it and done expertly when you have to take note of how well it fits.  Here, the sound is done well.  There was no music that took me out of the show for any reason, there were no sound effects that were bad or out of place, and while I can't say a ton about Japanese voice acting, it was fine in my opinion.  There were a couple slips in the English voice acting, but not to the point where it took me out of it, just maybe 2 spots where I chuckled a little at the line read.  While I can say that it caught me off guard a little bit when I first heard English acting in the Japanese dub, it certainly isn't a bad thing, just an unexpected one. 
 
Character: Now normally a show with no character development at all would bother me, considering that almost all I care about in any story is the characters.  Here though, it's fine.  It's only 30 minutes long and the emphasis is on the action, so I can't blame them for wanting to just present cardboard cutouts and have them fight.  If this show were 12, or even 6 episodes at 20 minutes a piece, I would be pissed that it had so little character development even though it's not as much of a priority because of the amount of time they had, but here?  It's fine. 
 
So overall, it's a waste of time.  But it's not a bad waste of time.  Currently it has very little substance, but with more time it could turn out to be something good with the plot seeds this OVA planted as well as the lack of explanation of the characters, there is room to work with.  It's not great, but it's not bad, and it's only 30 minutes long, so why not give it a watch?

6,543,140,4.976147799,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Vampire Hunter D (2000),"The story revolves around D, the infamous ""dunpeal"" (born of a vampire father and a human mother) outcast and renowned vampire hunter. His prowess at hunting the creatures of the night allowing his acceptance among humans, he is called upon to locate Charlotte Elbourne, the lovely daughter of an affluent family who has been mysteriously kidnapped. 
 
When the sun sets, the hunt goes on! Charlotte's father offers a rich bounty, be she dead or alive, a task D willingly accepts, even with notorious Markus brothers and their gang of bounty hunters seeking the prize as well. Amidst the chase and unknown to all lurks, a sinister evil which has been secretly manipulating their every move and has set a chilling trap that none will expect and few will survive. With the tables turned and the secrets revealed, the hunters could quickly become the hunted! 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy']","In the middle of the night, Charlotte Elbourne, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a vampire nobleman. Several days later, Charlotte's wealthy and wheelchair-bound father, John, hires D, a dhampir, to rescue her, dead or alive.
At the same time, Charlotte's older brother Adam hires the Marcus Brothers, composed of their leader Borgoff, the hulking Nolt, the blade master Kyle, the frail/physically bedridden psychic Grove, and Leila, a woman who holds a grudge towards vampires. D and the Marcus Brothers race after Meier, learning that Charlotte was not kidnapped but chose to accompany him out of love for the vampire.
Meier hires the mutant Barbarois to guard him, consisting of the shapeshifter Caroline, the shadow manipulator Benge, and the werewolf Machira. Nolt is killed by Benge, resulting in the brothers confronting the Barbarois in their home territory. At the same time, D visits them. Grove causes a large ruckus using his psychic powers, and D becomes trapped in a void that Benge creates. D escapes the void, and the Marcus Brothers avenge Nolt by killing Benge. They then travel to a nearby town, where Leila convinces the local sheriff to stop D. Fortunately, D is saved by an old man who recalls the dhampir rescuing him as a child.
Meier's carriage stops to rest during the daytime, and Charlotte wanders out, meeting D and Leila. The two fight against Caroline while Machira escapes with the carriage. D defeats Caroline but is forced to seek shelter after absorbing too much sunlight. Leila faces a revived Caroline and survives only by chance when lightning strikes the mutant, killing her instantly. She takes shelter with D after and reveals that a vampire back in her childhood kidnapped her mother. This resulted in her being stoned to death by the people of her hometown when she returned as a completely different person and killed her father. Leila joined the Marcus Brothers to avenge her parents' deaths. The two make a pact to visit each other's graves upon who dies first.
The Marcus Brothers trap Meier's carriage on a bridge by bombing it and carjacking Charlotte. However, their trap is foiled by Machira's enhanced senses, resulting in Kyle being killed and Borgoff falling off the bridge but surviving, losing an eye. Meier and Charlotte reach the Castle of Chaythe, where Countess Carmilla Elizabeth Bathory awaits them. Meanwhile, Machira stays behind to fight D, but the vampire hunter slays him.
It is then revealed that Meier and Charlotte had reached out to the Countess, hoping they could fly to the City of the Night, a vampire refuge located in space. However, Carmilla betrays the couple, temporarily slaying Meier and tricking Charlotte into being bitten. Revived by Charlotte's blood, she uses hallucinations to haunt D, Borgoff, and Leila. D is unaffected and saves Leila from her hallucinations depicting her tragic childhood, but Borgoff is tricked and turned. Grove reappears and saves Leila by blowing up the now vampiric Borgoff with an embrace. Grove then dies as a result. D confronts Carmilla and is able to destroy her spirit whilst a reawakened Meier destroys her physical body. D and Meier then clash for a final time, with D gaining the upper hand. During the fight, Charlotte dies from her wounds, with her ring tossed to D and Meier by Leila. D ultimately spares Meier's life and leaves the castle with Leila while taking Charlotte's ring as proof for her father and brother. As Meier uses the castle's ship to depart to the City of the Night, D and Leila look on, with Leila wishing the vampire success.
Years later, a funeral is held for Leila, with a large crowd attending. Among the crowd is Leila's granddaughter, who recognizes D from a distance and invites him to spend time with her family, but he kindly refuses. D reveals he is glad Leila was wrong about nobody being at her funeral and leaves contentedly.
","Bloodlust is a movie about a half vampire who hunts vampires. The basic setup is that a young woman from a wealthy family has been taken from her room by a vampire. The family responds by hiring vampire hunters to go after her. That's where D, a half vampire, enters the picture. The movie primarily focuses on D and a second group of vampire hunters going after the vampire and trying to bring the young woman back. It's pretty well constructed and there are a lot of references to traditional vampire lore. So it's pretty obvious that a good deal of research went into this. That being said, it does have a lot of original ideas and it's presented very creatively. The action scenes are very intense, although a few end very anti-climactically, and interesting to watch. My only issue with the story is that the beginning has an exposition dump that gives information that could have come out in the narrative, in fact, most of it does rendering that entire scene pointless. 
 
The characters really vary. D and Leila, one of the other hunters, are both really well developed and interesting but the rest of the characters are pretty flat. Their motivations make sense but they don't have a lot in the way of personality. The only reason it kind of works is because the focus stays mostly on D and Leila. 
 
The art is very nicely done, albeit a bit dated. The dark colours throughout most of the film set the tone well and the use of brighter colours for the ending is very symbolic. The only real issue I have with the art is that some of the monsters just look silly rather than intimidating, although there are only a few cases where that happens, like the werewolf inspired monster who just looks really ridiculous after he transforms.  
 
The voice work is spectacular. Tanaka Hideyuki and Hayashashibara Megumi both give really strong performances. The only real weakness of the voice acting is Nagai Ichirou who just sounds bored when he delivers his lines. The music is very sombre and suits the tone well. 
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. The female characters barely interact with each other and their interactions don't illustrate sexual tension.  
 
My final rating for Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is an 8/10. It has a few issues, but overall it's a very good film. If you're a fan of horror or you like vampires when they're done well you'll probably enjoy it. 


          
 
       Helpful For as long as the medium of visual storytelling has existed, vampires have continued to be a subject of interest for many artists for a seemingly infinite amount of reasons. Perhaps it’s the elegant and ethereal nature of aristocratic vampires, the ones who lure anyone who falls for them into their grasp, only to feast upon them when the time comes, or the more sub-human vampires who stalk the night as barbaric creatures looking for their next meal. Whatever the case, the subject of vampires has presented itself with a number of ways to reinterpret, and sometimes question, the mythos surrounding these characters, and anime is no exception. This is where Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust comes it. While it might not necessarily be the first anime to involve vampires, it certainly presents them in a light that, for its time, was incredibly intriguing, and presented a vampire anime experience unlike any other. 
 
The story for the film was based off of one of the original Vampire Hunter D light novels, which proved itself to be more character-based than narrative based. If there is one thing noticeable about the story from within the first couple of minutes, it’s that it seemed as though the film, for at least the first 40 minutes or so, was trying to be several different films at once. Is it a spaghetti western? A Ghostbusters-style supernatural comedy? A dark and dense vampire romance-drama? Although the film scrambled to find a solid identity while trying to tell a coherent story, it managed to figure out what it wanted to be by combining all the aforementioned story types and having them interact with each other. What results from that is a narrative that is fascinating to watch, as these story types are all different from each other, but does not prove itself to reach the full kind of potential that it should have. A little messy, a little clever, but ultimately satisfying. 
 
As I said before, this film is all about its characters, and fortunately for this film, all the central characters exude charm and style from beginning to end. The forerunner of all of this is is D himself, who is written with a stoic, almost Clint Eastwood-style of cool that makes him more and more of a mystery that the viewer tries to solve as the movie progresses. What is interesting about him is that he doesn’t take a single moment out of the film to explain his back story, yet has his past explained through interactions with a number of characters, allowing for the emotional resonance within those memories to cement its importance within the story. As an example, there’s a scene involving a shopkeeper that currently stands as my favorite scene in the film, primarily for how it’s written and how it explains a lot about the character without directly involving the character himself. D is an anti-hero that strongly represents the film as a whole: dark, mysterious, a puzzle, and fascinating to watch.  
 
The rest of the cast also has their own role in making this film a bit of a surprise upon first viewing, and that’s bringing about questions about the vampire genre through character development. While these characters start out as usual archetypes for the supernatural vampire/hunter genre (the loner, the gung-ho leader, the tortured soul, etc.), they somewhat break out of that mold by the time the film ends, but not too much that it provides answers to some of the questions that their roles pose within the genre: Why change a human into a vampire? Why turn your back on your own kind?, etc. What this film manages to successfully do with the characters, though, is to develop them beyond just walking tropes and provide them with strong-enough personalities that, once their task in the film is done, they have left a good-enough impression on the viewer. The only exception to this might be the parasite that resides in D’s left hand, whose catty remarks often lead me to believe that those lines were ad-libbed by the actor and were not part of the original script. 
 
And then there’s the art. My goodness, the art in this film. The entire style of the film was based on illustrator Yoshitaka Amano’s original art for the novels, which featured his trademark wispy ink work and androgynous individuals. Trying to adapt such a fluid art style may sound like a formidable task, but the animation studio Madhouse went above and beyond in allowing for his style to fit an animated format. As a result, the film is presented in a semi-realistic, but still characteristically anime style that has the potential to appeal to viewers who might not like anime, but enjoy horror and animation all the same. The character designs present the whole cast with distinct features without anyone looking out of place, all while putting them against lushly-detailed landscapes, both during the day and at night. There was one particular scene involving D, the hunter Leila, and a girl named Charlotte, that took place by a river near a forest that I wished could have lasted an extra 5 minutes just so I could look at the art a little more. If there is any reason for you to give this film a watch, it’s for the beautiful artwork and expertly-handled animation, some that I find to be vastly underrated amongst the pantheon of stand-alone anime films. 
 
If the animation is the most impressive part of the film, then the sound and voice acting would, while not being the exact opposite, have to be the area that would benefit from the most improvement. Much of the soundtrack composed in this film is a mixed bag as far as its overall enjoyment goes. Some of the music does its job in accenting the excitement of certain scenes and nothing more, while others can be grabbing in how sonically powerful they can be. The latter is especially true for the last quarter of the film, which features an ominous choir joined by a powerful and gothic lead organ. The rest of the music, however, is mainly synthesized, which strongly contrasted against the high quality of the film’s artwork. The voice acting itself, which I listened to in English, was passable for the dub of an anime, but nothing superlative. However, it was interesting to hear people in a film that, while they are considered industry veterans now, were only really beginning to dip their toes in the water as far as the voice acting game goes with this film. While the dub certainly isn’t the worst to come out of the anime boom of the noughties, it isn’t one that would certainly convince people who prefer their anime subtitled that dubs can have their merits as well.  
 
Despite its flaws, I ended up enjoying the movie a lot more than I thought I would. I first saw the trailer for this film over 10 years ago, and ever since then, I’d wanted to watch it because it intrigued me so much. When I finally sat down to watch it, I found that it was worth the wait, challenging my expectations with each scene and presenting me with some beautiful artwork to go along with it. This is a film that I don’t often hear in conversations about good anime films, but one that I wouldn’t immediately place on the same pedestal as anything Studio Ghibli has done. It’s a highly beautiful, but slightly indecisive, film where the strongest parts of the film have aged wonderfully and have made the film worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful So I was thinking about how in general I've seen anime and stuff that had kind of grimdark anti-heroic sort of characters and sometimes it works and sometimes not so much, Vampire Hunter D is the former category, and it's also named Evangelion and consequently people might be sort of less familiar with it.  
 
I saw it because a friend had it awhile ago and I believe it's technically Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, a movie which came out in 2000 which I'm pretty sure is this one so here's hoping..  
 
Anyway! Vampire Hunter D is about the Vampire Hunter D, who travels the kind of bleak post-apocalyptic world in search of treasure and in the back, revenge. It's not so much a startling sort of experience but there is something sort of charming about D, like something beneath the wide brim hat and this kind of introverted quiet sense that shows it isn't so much an anti-heroic character but more like a partially heroic one... 
 
So isn't so much a world and character without purpose or cause, but kind of just like a crooked moral compass, one that functions intermittently. He is sort of without purpose in the grander sense, why go and fight a revenge against this guy anyway, why not go a different direction, and yet there's something about all the staging and kind of theatrics that makes it sort of compelling anyway. It's kind of like watching Phantom of the Opera or something, it's just like this sort of stagey drama that is just kind of like a romp into the night or something, you know what to expect and kind of what you feel but you end up just sort of magnetized anyway.  
 
I couldn't give Vampire Hunter D a super high score,  because on the one hand he's really kind of a jerk at times, he's not really like a super good character, but at the same despite all those things it really is so much more compelling an anti-heroic (or as I say, partially heroic character) than so many other things like Yuno Gasai or whatever that girl's name was that are more like fake-dark type of characters. 
 
It's like, it's wrong and weird, and yet, it doesn't matter too much at the same time, because there's something about the whole aura and experience that is somewhat compelling.  
 
D himself like I'm saying.. just something about those brooding eyes and this like torturous sort of thing, like... it's like there is this constant sense of doing things that are kind of questionable along with a sort of awareness of that.  
 
Also, I'm not really a fan of AMVs but in this case I thought this was pretty well done and thought I'd put it here to generically primp the thing.  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybyU0pdIu4Y 
 
So yeah, I can't really give it a crazy high score because it is just kind of a messed up anime, but it's like the ""good"" kind of messed up, so I gave it an 8.  
 
That's kind of a weird way to summarize the situation, but I think what's what the grimdark antiheroism thing was all about in the first place, it's not a neat thing all together thing all the time, but it would be unwise not to pay it heed.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Love Com is a love story between a boy and a girl in Sakai, Osaka. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is 172 centimetres (5 ft 8 in) tall—much taller than the average Japanese girl. The boy, Atsushi Ōtani, is 156 cm (5 ft 1 in)—way below the height of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, the pair are called the ""All Hanshin Kyojin"" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference. The difference in their heights is extremely exaggerated (in the opening credits of the anime, for example, the top of Ōtani's head doesn't even reach Risa's chin when it should be approximately level with her mouth.)
During summer school, a very tall student named Ryouji Suzuki (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him because he is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. Their efforts fail spectacularly as Suzuki and the girl whom Ōtani had a crush on - Chiharu Tanaka - end up becoming a couple. All is not lost though, since Risa and Ōtani become close friends.

It soon sparks into a one-sided love and eventually lead you through a love story with their relationship on the line with every episode.

The art itself is very nice, it adds to the humour with the exaggeration on the character's facial expressions and even actions. You never cease to get bored when looking at the characters because they always offer something new. 
Sound:9 
No complaints, it was all very well done. Voice acting was great as usual.

Overall: 10 
Definitely a recommended anime, I enjoyed it a lot and I think you would will too. I was always looking forward to the next episode because each one offered a great cliff hanger as well as finding myself smiling like crazy filled with excitement and never getting bored.

unofficial review 
 
the thing about this anime is the artistry involved in showing so many of the intricacies in the unrequited love relationship 
 
the depression sadness hopelessness.... the confusion and fears... 
doubts 
 
that feeling where you're just fed up 
or that feeling where you're so overjoyed you skip around and sing and everyone can tell you're in a good mood... 
 
this anime really really showed that up to my amazement. 
 
not many people will appreciate those details... but i'm 30 and having fought for going on 5 years 6 weeks and 2 days... i can. 
 
the only thing is the story dragged on only a little. 
 
the art was average for that era 
 
i enjoyed it... cuz i was able to identify with so many of the characters 
 
my advice.... rewatch when you're in your 30s... and see if it doesn't take on a whole nother appearance to you. 
 
yes i will rewatch it... but not now...i want to forget the story so that i enjoy it just as much as i did today.

          
 
       Helpful Lovely Complex has just became on of my favorite romantic comedies.  The scenario in which romance develops on is unique and teaches us the boundlessness of our emotions.  One of my favorite aspects is that this anime is half and half romance and comedy, there's always a sense of comic relief to any seriousness and vice versa, but that still doesn't take away from the captivating emotion inspiring or the hilarious humor (seriously this anime made me laugh so much).  Furthermore, all the characters are great in a variety of ways.  They are unique, entertaining and funny, but also complex which is really seen in how character relations are grown.  The romance in Lovely Complex centers on actual growth and development of the relationship and feelings, and I think that is splendid.  You will actually view the sentiment and connection between the two main characters flourish to feel a sense of progress and growth that you may be able to relate to.  The anime does time well, it really captures the essence of future, past, and character development, and not only captures our emotions but empathy of separation and love.  Anyways, overall I enjoyed Lovely Complex for how it made me cry in laughter, happiness, and sadness.  Watch it.

6,5918,142,4.94310165,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Deimos no Hanayome: Ran no Kumikyoku,"Two siblings were happy on Mt. Olympus, until they fell in love. Deimo's sister Venus got imprisoned in the Swamp of Death. To save Venus's life, he must find a human reincarnation so that they can continue their love. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","Bride of Deimos revolves around high school girl Minako Ifu, who has become the focus of the attentions of the demon Deimos. Minako appears to be the physical reincarnation of Deimos' lover and younger twin sister, Venus, the former goddess of love. In order to rescue Venus from the fatal punishment she received as a result of their relationship, he has to bring Minako to the underworld so Venus can possess her body. Over the course of the manga, the reader sees the various ways that Deimos attempts to accomplish this, interspersed with random chapters of Deimos involved in bringing suffering and death to whichever humans he happens to encounter.
","How on earth did this pilot not get picked up for more episodes!? 
 
This was clearly meant to be a episodic anime about a girl who is the reincarnation bride of deimos (based on the Greek myth)! And has him giving her guidance and advice (similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night’s Maria mixed with Luka from UraBoku). 
 
Judging by this first episode alone, this could of became one of my favourites. (I love episodic detective series like Darker Than Black), but unfortunately, we only got one episode. 
 
The art for this anime is dark and spectacular (even though they use one of the animation scenes 3 times, but I see it as being symbolic of the episode’s themes). 
 
The reviews for this anime are poor (probably because many don’t realise that this was a pilot episode for a show that never came to be. 
 
I won’t go into detail about the story of the episode as I believe you should go in blind. It’s only 30 minutes long, so it won’t take up too much of your time. 
 
I hope this does one day get picked up (maybe give it the JoJo treatment of renewing the series with a much larger budget). But until then, give this pilot a watch! 
 


          
 
       Helpful Another case of ""it's very pretty to look at"". But without the context of the manga it's based on, there isn't a great deal to latch onto. 
 
(And even after looking up that context, this feels even more random than before. Why not make an OVA covering most of the manga instead of just this random chapter???) 
 
Overall, I enjoyed the visuals far more than anything else in this. I really am a sucker for 80s anime in that sense. But aside from that, it offers little else of value when it's the most random-ass story set inside a far more interesting story that is barely touched on. It's hard not to be left feeling cheated, honestly.

          
 
       Helpful The OVA Deimos no Hanayome is, in one short sentence, a glorified demonstration of the manga. Does it make it bad? Not quite, but it definitely represents wasted potential. 
 
First of all, do you see that pretty interesting premise for the plot in the synopsis? Yeah, forget about it. The main plot is told in the first few minutes and the rest of the OVA dedicates itself to a side story which is pretty much filler, so no revengeful gods, unconventional love or something like that. This is by far one of the greatest flaws here: you've got yourself some good enough source material for an entire series, yet choose to pick a random story and go with it. 
 
Despite all of that, the story for the OVA is actually pretty interesting, so it's partially forgiven. The main character, Minako, is looking for her friend, who disappeared after he went to a certain orchid specialist's mansion. Minako finds herself in a very dangerous situation when she faces the siblings Touko and Kaname, both hiding some bizarre secrets... It's not a complex plot, but  it certainly works and fits within the overall tone of the manga: dark, tragic and containing some twisted love stories. 
 
The visuals are very good and able to successfully express the melancholy and morbidity through an overall Gothic atmosphere. Despite following the shoujo traditional art style, the characters have more mature looks to match the story nature. The main problem is the animation itself. Sure, many series and OVAs at the time had some awkward animation consisting of still frames in dramatic and action sequences, but it still looks very dated. To the OVA's merit, though, some of the scenes are quite stylish. 
 
A good soundtrack helps tremendously in building a great atmosphere, and Deimos no Hanayome realizes that... sort of. Well, the musics themselves are good and most sound effects are okay (except a certain annoying and completely unnatural scream), but the transition between background sounds is done very poorly: the music just stops in the middle of the scene, then pops up again later, with very little fluidity. 
 
The characters are the weakest part of this, since the main characters are only fully fleshed out in the manga and there is not much time to develop the bad guys. That's why they should have settled for either really adapting the original plot or making a complete standalone OVA with nothing to do with the manga. However, there is a huge problem which unfortunately manifests in the manga as well: all of the characters have their dumb moments sooner or later, and when they do, it's really dumb. They go from the basic ""I'll reveal my whole backstory before I kill you, like a classic villain!"" to ""I've got evidence, experience and good reasons to assume that I'll be killed, therefore I'll walk straight into the danger without any plan! "". The backstory is interesting, though, and that is the only redeeming feature. 
 
This OVA had the recipe for disaster with underdeveloped characters, technical inefficiency and failure to grasp the original plot, but the engaging suspense and nice visuals saved it. In the end, it's still a disturbing story with an interesting development, so horror fans should definitely give it a chance. If you enjoy more mature shoujo stories, Deimos no Hanayome might be for you as well, but be warned that it's basically advertising for the manga and doesn't try to hide that fact.

","Firstly: I'm going to keep it to the point to save you sifting through miles of text :D 
 
I was new to Shoujo-ai anime I thought that this well done. 
 
It has all the things that are expected from Romantic Comedies, but it also has its own turn on the genre. It has a balanced set of characters, which are really well developed, and they all bring something to the fray, be it comedy, or a serious point of the storyline. 
 
Although the anime was a little predictable in the storyline, it didn't matter, as it was enough to keep me watching and not dismiss it. Generally it focuses on the relationships of the protagonist and her struggles but it makes you wonder if they made it into strictly a romance or a comedy whether it could have been better. 
 
However, despite this, as a result this anime is thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully drawn, made and developed, its the characters, laughs and warm feel it gave that kept it going until the end with a good conclusion. 
 
I'd recommend it to people who are regulars to the shoujo-ai scene and also to people who are new to it as I was. It has an enticing story and it kept me watching. 7/10 :)

          
 
       Helpful Sasameki Koto is a rarity in the Yuri anime world, it isn't the uber-drama fair of the more highly regarded shows, but neither is it gimmicky and insincere like some on the other end of the spectrum. Instead it's somewhere in between, it's an anime which is gentle and light-hearted but at the same time it feels genuine and it's for this reason alone that it's my favourite Yuri/Shoujo-Ai anime. 
 
Another thing that sets it apart is the lack of ambiguity when it comes to the girl's sexuality. The story doesn't exist in a vacuum where there aren't any boys and the suggestion is that the girls are just pretending until 'real' love comes along. Nor does is exist in a parallel universe where everyone is gay, making it unbelievable. Instead it's set in a co-ed high-school in an anime version of the real world. One main character is openly gay, the other is very gay, even if she keeps it on the down-low and the other two main girl characters are in an open, committed relationship. Again, a rarity in the Shoujo-Ai genre. 
 
The tension in the show doesn't come from whether or not Sumika and Kazama's feeling are real or not, instead it's from them trying to make the delicate transition from best friends to lovers. 
 
Yes, as per the synopsis, one of those the roadblocks is the fact that Sumika isn't Kazuma's 'type'. In saying that though it probably the least significant issue standing in their way. The second, more important problem is that Sumika is still in the closet, and as a result her best friend has no idea she's even interested in girls. The other, and I think the main issue is the fact that Sumika is scared to death of ruining the most important relationship in her life which is pretty relatable if you've ever had a crush on a friend. 
 
The characters are all interesting and loveable. Sumika is the typically athletic and academically gifted tomboy, but she's insecure and adorkable enough to make her relatable. Kazama is the generally calm, mature and motherly one, except for when it comes to 'cute girls' where she slips into manic immaturity. Thankfully these moments are only there briefly as an early plot devise and slowly become less of a thing. Tomoe and Miyako are the funny and (mostly) supportive lesbian couple who help encourage Sumika while also acting as an example of what could be if she'd only finally confess. Even Azusa, the Shoujo-Ai fiction fan girl, there to act as a brief 'cock-block' was far less annoying than I though she would be. My heart even broke for her a little bit at one point, which is an achievement in my book. 
 
Despite it's light heartedness Sasameki Koto doesn't shy away from some issues most Shoujo-Ai tend to ignore, mainly the stigma that comes from being gay in society which prizes conventionality above all else. Kazuma's bullying at a previous school, to the point she had to leave and the insinuation that she would still be a victim of it if it weren't for Sumika's presence not only makes her character seem even stronger but also adds to the story's reality. It's never really a main plot point but serves as another hint of reality. 
 
Overall I love this show. It's gentle, beautiful and romantic. The characters are delightful, the art and animation are good and the music is great. Only the 'Read the Manga' ending stops me from giving it a perfect 10. More like a 9.5. 


          
 
       Helpful I think we all know how painful it can be to love someone who doesn't love you back. I certainly do, and I don't think I've ever seen an anime series that depicted the loneliness--and very rarely the joy--of one-sided love as well as the shojou ai romcom Sasameki Koto did. 
 
I began watching Sasameki Koto at the very beginning of the year, around the same time I started Junjou Romantica. I could not have picked a better first shojou ai series. Although it is basicly about the love between two girls, it is way lighter and more fun then some of the more dramatic shojou ai series out there, making it a perfect introduction to the genre. 
 
Sumika Murasame is an intelegent, tough as nails highschooler with a big problem: she has fallen in love with another female, her best friend, Ushio Kazama. The problem isn't that Ushio doesn't like girls--in fact, she's absoluely crazy about them--the problem is that Ushio only likes ""cute"" girls. Small, weak, shy girls that one would feel compelled to protect. Sumika, being unusually tall and a martial arts expert, does not at all meet this description. 
 
Sasameki Koto presented a very simple story, and was able to do a lot with it. Something different happened every episode, and they managed to bring in very satisfying romantic scenes and wonderful comedy without being too unrealistic. The only problem was that some episodes had no real significance, and could have been skipped over in order to make room for a decent ending. Note before you watch Sasameki Koto that the ending is very abrupt, and will probably leave you unsatisfied and thinking 'That's it?' 
 
The characters made this series what it was. Each character was unique and quirky, and you pretty much had to love every one of them. We start out with the two mains, Sumika and Ushio, and their friend, the happy-go-lucky Kiyori. Later, we are introduced to Akemiya, a dorky boy with a huge crush on Sumika, Tomoe and Miyako, a lesbian couple who hopelessly attempt to start a school club for lesbian girls, and Aoi, a passionate fan of a series of yuri novels. The characters are all very well developed, and it's very entertaining to watch them in their everyday lives. 
 
The main reason I like Sasameki Koto is that you can feel the characters' emotions as if they are your own. There are several scenes in this series that will make one think ""I've felt that way before."" The series manages to perfectly execute the drama of one sided love without being melodramatic, and seeing as this is a Highschool story, this is a major accomplishment.

The episode order is not sorted based on the year the story was written. For example, the first episode ""Tragedy of P""'s story was written in 1991 while the last episode ""Senmuno inu""'s story was written in 1994. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']",none,"When i first saw the dvd box from this anime, i thought it was a story about a theater company, playing their acts. Well, it´s not, but almost. This is a uncomon and curious kind of anime. 
 
 As you know, or not, Rumiko Takahashi is the creator of Inuyasha, Ranma, and others, so you´ll know allready the kind of characters, their expressions, etc, from this. 
 
 So, we have 13 episodes, each one has a total diferent story from the others, and this is the first point that i analyze. You ´ll never get bored from the stories, as a said, they are all diferent, and the stories are all about situations, that we live with it every day, or some special ocasion. Even once, when you see the anime, you think, that you saw, or lived that situation one time, or more. 
 
 About the art, as i said up here, if you saw the other animes from Rumiko, and if you loved theme, then you´ll feel like home here too, there ´s nothing new here, in my opinion, her animes always had great drawings, and characters.  
 
The music is nothing extraordinary, and the stories don´t ask for that, but they feet very well with the situations, simple and kind 
 
Even the stories are diferent, and the characters from each one, they always meet in other episodes to, and that´s one thing that i found funny (even inuyasha and kagome apears! xD) 
 
I really enjoyed this anime, i found there something funny, emotional, and refreshing. The only thing that fails here, i thing, is his lenght. It´s a bit short, it could have more episodes, maybe 20. 
 
I highly recomend this one, for the people how want something really diferent and light from anime/manga. Check it out (sorry my english, i´m portuguese xD)

       Helpful Hello all, hope this review finds you well. This is my first real review, since my other one was a joke. Now let's begin this review.  
 
Unlike many people on this site, I started JoJo on the manga, on the very first part. I vehemently hated JoJo for the terrible fanbase that I was constantly in contact with and had no option to avoid, due to the airing of the anime. However, I decided to give the series a shot, and I was hooked from the first page. Now, I've recently finished reading what is currently available of JoJolion. I was very curious about this little OVA series, as I had heard little of it and in my opinion it looked far better than the 2013 anime adaption of Stardust Crusaders. I gave it a shot, and to my surprise... I loved it. But I am a man of objectivity, so let me discuss why this series is worthy of the masterpiece ranking. 
 
STORY - 9 
 
I was not a huge fan of the Stardust Crusader manga. While stands were certainly an interesting concept, due to the sheer volume of stands and fights which resolved themselves in similar manners (i.e punchy ghost knocks them out), I found the part to be bloated and, dare I say, dull. Granted, this problem is mostly fixed when the Crusaders make their way into Egypt, and stands become far more interesting, like Anubis, Geb, and Osiris being highlights. I think Araki refined his craft in later parts, where stands really did just get more memorable. What has this got to do with the OVA? Well, this part of the OVA takes place in the later half in Egypt, and cuts out most of the uninteresting and, dare I say, shitty fights (like Sethan). I actually prefer this to the manga. I'm saying it now. A few decent fights were lost, but Geb and Osiris are highlights of the part and were kept as they should have been. DIO's WORLD is still kept as the epic conclusion, and its about the length of an average film in this, taking up half the entire episode count of the OVA. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is because as an adaptation it isn't perfect. 
 
CHARACTER - 10 
 
Characterisation from the manga has not been lost from the transition in animated form. If anything, this OVA increased my appreciation for certain characters, who I cared little for in the manga, such as Kakyoin. I don't have much to say here, but the characters are as they were in the manga, which is a plus for me. Granted, characters who were fairly uninteresting like Avdol are still uninteresting, but I still found a greater appreciation for them in this, which says a lot. 
 
ART - 10 
 
The colours and the art in this OVA are much more vibrant and unique than the look of the 2013 adaptation, which just looks terrible in my opinion. The colours in the anime are duller and the art-style is far more generic and ugly. The detail in the faces of the OVA comes from more than just adding lines onto the faces of characters to attempt to replicate the chiselled, masculine look of Araki's art. Not to mention the animation itself in the anime is jerky and disgusting in comparison to the silky smooth animation of the OVA. This is courtesy of Satoshi Kon, whose work I am not familiar with but I am certainly interested in. His loss is one that cannot be overstated or comprehended in mere words, if this is anything to go by. I cannot judge the anime entirely, as I have only seen clips, but regardless I feel that the OVA is much better in this regard. This truly proves that the transition to digital art is a great shame, and the decline in OVAs as a result of Evangelion's popularity is a blight that should not be overlooked. 
 
SOUND - 10 
 
The sound design is excellent. When Dio is in stopped time, a unique effect is added to his voice, which really adds to the atmosphere of stopped time. The soundtrack fits the anime like a glove, and from what I've heard of the JoJo anime's soundtrack, this fits the series far better. The Japanese dub is the best way to go when watching this, but I am okay with the English dub. I feel the voices fit the characters better in the sub, and the performances are also a little less cheesy, which adds to the more serious atmosphere that this OVA sets (more on that in the next section). It takes a lot for me, as a firm sub watcher, to praise a dub, but I am admitting that this is a dub that is in fact watchable, and I might even watch entirely dubbed at some point in the future. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 10 
 
This OVA blew my mind. I hadn't heard much nice about it, but I approached it with an open mind, and what I found was a glorious adaptation of the best parts of Stardust Crusaders with all the shitty fights removed. The tone is a much more serious one than the one set up in the manga, but this OVA pulls it off flawlessly. It plays the ridiculous nature of the part completely straight, in comparison to the goofy manga and the goofy anime adaptation, which is something I do really like. This is one of my favourite entries on this site, and within the world of anime itself.  
 
OVERALL - 10 
 
This OVA is nothing more or less than a masterpiece. It is an underappreciated gem, that is far better than it's over-appreciated lump of coal sibling, the 2013 anime adaptation, speaking in raw technical aspects. Sure, the anime is a more accurate adaptation, but I would far rather watch this work of love than the ugly new adaptation. I would recommend anyone whose read the manga to watch this, and anyone whose watched the anime to stop being a dumbass and read the superior manga and then watch this OVA.

          
 
       Helpful I found this anime by hitting a random button, and recognizing the word ""Stand"". I had seen the Gintama episodes about it, and figured I should watch the real thing. It was actually quite enjoyable. I know nothing about the original manga, but apparently that probably increased my enjoyment.  
 
Story: 8/10 
There is a bad guy. Good guys gather to fight him. They run into Bad Guys minions. Some minions turn into Good guys. They fight the Bad Guy.  
This is true for pretty much all shonen. What differentiates them is the action itself. Stands are a cool medium, and the action is decent.  
 
Art 10/10 
The art is definitely reflective of the era it was made in (1994). As such it looks like an early 90s anime, which I actually appreciate. There is a good amount of detail in the drawing, and there was clearly a lot of effort put into the art.  
 
Sound: 8/10 
Its fine, nothing distinctive, but nothing bad. 
 
Characters:  8/10 
For a shonen, the characters are relatively diverse and work well together.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
It is nice and short (only 13 eps) unlike say Naruto, Bleack, Dragonball. It really feels more like Trigun than anything else.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
If you liked Trigun, watch this. If you like Naruto, but hate fill, watch this. If you like K-On!, then this probably isn't for you.

After seeing his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and fighting Joseph's friend Muhammad Abdul, Jotaro learns that the ""Spirit"" is actually Star Platinum, his Stand, or fighting energy given a semi-solid form. Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick.

Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all. ","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando); another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, ""Ripple""), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular ""JoJo"". The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.

Part 1: Phantom Blood (ファントムブラッド, Fantomu Buraddo)
Volumes 1–5, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century England, Jonathan Joestar, the young son of a wealthy landowner, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp him as heir to the Joestar family.

Volumes 13–28, 152 chapters. In 1989, Dio Brando (now referred to as ""DIO"") awakens after his tomb is salvaged from the ocean. Because Dio had managed to capture Jonathan's body, Stands (スタンド, Sutando) awaken in Jonathan's descendants, consisting of Joseph, his daughter Holly Kujo, and grandson Jotaro Kujo. Holly, however, is unable to cope with her own Stand, and has only 50 days to live. Jotaro, Joseph, and their new allies set out to defeat Dio before this deadline expires, and encounter Dio's henchmen along the way.Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable (ダイヤモンドは砕けない, Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai)
Volumes 29–47, 174 chapters. In 1999, the Joestar family learns that Joseph has an illegitimate son, Josuke Higashikata, who lives in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh.

Volumes 81–104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline's 1890, United States President Funny Valentine holds a cross-country horse race with a $50 million reward to the winner.

Local college student Yasuho Hirose discovers a young man buried in the rubble and nicknames him ""Josuke"". Suffering from amnesia, Josuke tries to uncover the secret of his past as he is also confronted with the activities of a local crime syndicate, which sells the fruit of a mysterious Locacaca tree, capable of healing people and then ""taking"" something in return.Part 9: JOJOLANDS (ジョジョランズ, Jojoranzu) (Tentative title)
In the September 2021 issue of Ultra Jump, Araki confirmed that part 9 of the series, tentatively titled JOJOLANDS, would begin following a short break.
","(This review applies to the entire series, both the 1993 and the 2000 continuation episodes. Though the second half, especially the last three episodes, is noticeably superior.) 
 
Yes, it is certainly bizarre. 
JoJo is the thinking man's surrealist DBZ. Except instead of endless 3-frame loops of tedious ""fight animation"" it has sudden, subtle, blink-and-you'll-miss-it fight scenes. In it, weird fighters use weird powers in weird ways; typically by outwitting -- rather than merely overpowering -- their opponents. 
The series' greatest strength is the unexpected, shocking oddity of it. Whenever you think the series is about to devolve into fighting game cliche, something utterly bugfuck happens. A villain will gleefully and intentionally decapitates himself to show his badassery. A dog addicted to coffee flavored chewing gum kicks ass with a voodoo sandstorm. Somebody telekinetically stops his own heart. A man with two left hands...I-I-I can't explain it. Oh, did I mention that most characters are named after random popstars? 
The greatest weakness is the needlessly idiotic character models. Each character model includes numerous, distracting, embarrassing design choices like stupid clothes, inexplicable hair and mindbogglingly moronic jewelry. Jotaro's has a 50 lb chain hanging from his lapel and a hat that might be just a visor made of hairgel. Abdul (named after singer Paula Abdul) has hair like an untidy pile of soupcans and a necklace which might actually be the world's heaviest and least comfortable set of earrings. Even the final boss, Dio Brando, looks like a Hakuto no Ken villain re-imagined by Bronies. And then there's Polnareff. Fucking Polnareff. Good lord, Dorkula...cut back on the styling mouse, dude. You look like a cracker cosplay of the skinny guy from Kid'n'Play! 
Only two characters aren't dressed like retarded clowns: Joseph Joestar, who looks like Richard Branson cosplaying as Indiana Jones; and Iggy....who is a dog and therefore doesn't wear fucked-up clothes or psychotic earrings. 
 
Story. 
Although it descends into wonderfully addlepated madness in the details, the overall plot can be boiled down to: Team of super-powered badasses travel around the world to kick the Big Bad Evil Guy is his smug face. After fighting all his super-powered henchmen first. Rinse Repeat. 
 
Art 
The art is nothing special. Perfectly workmanlike if you can get past the insane character models I ranted about above. 
 
Sound 
The sound effects used by the various Stands were oddly memorable, unlike the music which left no impressions at all. The voice acting (in the English dub) was slightly above average. 
 
Character 
Although each character is initially off-putting, they do grow on you. Yes, even Polnareff won me over. 
 
Enjoyment 
This series is viscerally fun and memorably deranged. It doesn't merely zig when you expect it to zag. It zrbft's and then zlrfts. 
This is would DBZ would be like if it wasn't vapid, and what BoboBo BoBoBoBo would've been if that show hadn't lived off a diet of paint chips and monoxide.

          
 
       Helpful An oil tanker for you 
 
That is all, its just the review needs to be longer for me to submit it, dio is the best part of this ova and if you are planning on watching jojos this is the best place to start as you will see it is a very family friendly series similar to Pingu in the City as dio even offers you a full oil tanker, how thoughtful of him. 
 
I rate this ova very highly in every field, as I and many other believe that it is the perfect anime ever made ever and should be on everyones watch list 

          
 
       Helpful I would never recommend this OVA to anyone as a replacement for the manga or the 2014 anime adaptation, but as it's own thing and a companion piece to the original story that offers different takes on some things it works surprisingly well. 
 
The character designs are at least interesting, the animation is extremely fluid (vastly outshining SC anime) and the music is great at illustrating the tone. Sadly the weird self depricating humor that the series is known for is almost completely gone. The whole thing takes itself really seriously and that works as a detriment to some of the most riddiculous moments (like Joseph smashing the camera with his stand in order to produce a nude photo of the family's arch enemy whose head is posessing his grandfather). Sadly the voice acting and sound design fall flat, but I don't know if it is caused by the performances or the fact that I got used to the over the top voice acting kown from the modern adaptation of Stardust Crusaders. Overall I wouldn't recommend this OVA to anyone not fammiliar with the original but it's a cool thing that it was made.

Chiaki, the little one, is the calculating and manipulating one; she likes to be admired and loved by Haruka and always gives trouble to the less blessed Kana.

Now it's time to see if they'll survive this age change since Haruka is now a young adult; she has even more responsibilities, having to watch over the young while integrating into the adult life.

","Man, compared to Okawari, this one is a breath of FRESH air. However, since they didn't do a whole lot of changes, I won't have a very long review like I did with the last two. 
 
Right off the bat, they appear to have embraced the art style of the better season again! However, they unfortunately kept the redesigned characters of the second, so they all now just appear as though it were season one again. Even the backgrounds look more cheerful and colorful as they did in season one! Truly, this is a faithful new season in every good way. 
 
My only complaint with this new season is that we had to keep those new designs, despite them even going on about how this season was to be faithful to the first. However, it's certainly more cheerful and colorful than the second and I enjoy it a lot. However, had it done a few things differently, it would have competed pretty well with the first season. 
 
The good side with it merging with the two season is that it kept that Kana and Chiaki bond where they were starting to get along better and they did it really well. They took every good element from both seasons and basically made a really fresh season, which is something I have NEVER seen an anime do before; going back to an older art style. It is quite interesting. 
 
So the question you are all waiting for: do I recommend THIS season? YES. It is a significant improvement and any Minami-ke fan will love it. If you loved the first season, you will enjoy this a lot as it is the true ""second"" season of Minami-ke in my book and you should not miss it. I even recommend the OVA as well, as it still retains the style of this season. 
 
Funnily enough, they actually tried changing the hair lines briefly in one PART of an episode where they had the classic across the hair, akin to season one; mixed with the new way they do lines. Then after that segment ended, they went BACK to the original art style they implemented. It was quite hilarious and occurs at some point, so look forward to it.

          
 
       Helpful Okaeri is the third and last season to the Minami-ke series. Picking off from where Okawari left off, it's pretty much the same slice of life done in it's usual 'Minami-ke Style'. While the second season was a bit of a disappointment, the third season saved it from it's low points bringing back the cheeriness of the OP and the ED and an improved art style resembling the first season. 
 
Story - Slice of life sums it all up, but is good enough to make you wish you were part of it. You really do wonder if these kinds of innocent happy times take place in a family of three adorable sisters is some part of the world. 
 
Score: 9 - did what it wanted to do. Good job there. 
 
Art - Has it's unique art style. Best of all three seasons. I love how all the faces are just ( ' A ' ) 
 
Score 8 - Great art, if they just overdosed with a few nicely added effects it would've passes as a 10 
 
Sound - konobakayaro! 
 
Score 8 - Voice acting is the strength to this. I can't really remember any of the music to this. OP and ED are good songs fit for the anime. 
 
Character - Jesus, will I ever finish this review? Chiaki Minami will make you commit suicide in the hopes you'll be reincarnated as someone close to her. Freaking adorable. And the trap Makoto, just win, epic win. 
 
Score 9 - Nice nice. I love all of them and would spend my live savings on figures. 
 
Enjoyment - I got what I wanted and I'm really happy that i decided to spend my withering life span on this anime. I don't feel cheated at all! 
 
Score 8 - made me lol, i have enjoyed 
 
Overall - Great in it's own category. Probably one of the best slice of life I've ever seen. 
 
Score 8 - it came made me lol then left. I would want to see more... 
 


          
 
       Helpful Minami-Ke: Okaeri is the third installment in the Minami-Ke series, and while it does suffer from some problems, it should still be a series that most fans of the anime will enjoy. 
 
Story:7/10 
In any slice of life anime, we know that a strong storyline won’t be part of most of the series out there. As such, Minami-Ke: Okaeri sticks very strict to it’s layed back story formula. If you have seen the earlier two versions of this series, you will find pretty much the same kind of pacing and humor, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The jokes between the various characters are all present, however it seems to be missing the charm that the first two seasons brought to the table. Being that this is the third installment in the series, I was really hoping that at least some of the character relations and/or friendships would have come to some kind of closure or resolve. Sadly however there really is little to none here. Many of the ""Kana vs. Chiaki"" scenes that were made staples are sadly missing, as is many gags from Hosaka and Makoto (however, what they do have by them is indeed funny). And really that has been what the series has always been about; comedy! There are some pretty clever bits in this version, many of which can be quite hilarious. Now that doesn’t mean you get all giggles, because there are some hit and miss episodes, or ones where it starts off very funny, then starts to come down a bit (and vis a versa). One thing that I have always praised about the Minami-Ke series for, was how the show never relies on one sol character to keep the storyline funny, and once again it delivers on that regards nicely, and each character adds their own humor as only they can do! So aside from some hit and miss episodes with the humor, it still remains an enjoyable title for the ""slice of life/comedy"" fans out there. 
 
Art: 6/10 
I still to this day don’t know why they had to change the artwork from the first season. I realize that it has since been done by a different studio, but even still, the earlier version seemed to work well enough for it! Well they ended up tweaking it again, and gone is the creepy looking faces the characters would get when they were annoyed and the like. The eyes have been made a little bit smaller, and the characters seem to look a bit more mature. The backgrounds were pretty washed out, and didn’t really eave much of an impression. It was really hard to adapt to at first, but I found myself getting use to it by episode 4. The art isn’t anything bad really, it just seemed so unnecessary to change it in the first place. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
All of the background music from the series has followed along nicely throughout all the seasons, all with a little bit of tweaks here and there, it still remains quite down to earth and relaxing, with many soothing instrumental pieces. The voice cast has all returned to fill their roles for all the characters, and once again pull it off very well. The opening and ending songs are much more lively when compared to the original Minami-Ke soundtrack, and are quite catchy with their happy upbeat sounds! A nice soundtrack for the ears! 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters (along with their comedy antics) have always been a staple to the series, and once again it delivers. I found the character chemistry between some of the various cast members to be a bit more planned out for this version. We get some funny and tender moments between Chiaki and Kana! Hosaka and Makoto, while not seen as often as in the last seasons, are still as funny as they ever were. We also get some humor from characters either not usually funny, or even shown that much. Such as Riko and Touma. Heck even Fujioka has plenty of good humor to give! I was happy that the characters remained as fun to watch as ever! 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
I really did enjoy what the third season had to offer, the comedy and character interactions were overall very fitting to the Minami-Ke franchise. However, due to the fact that the comedy also wasn't quite as funny as the last 2 seasons, I enjoyed this one a little bit less than the previous. Still, what it does have to offer is still very good! 
 
Overall: 7/10 
The anime seems to be keeping a solid pace for the franchise. I don’t think the series has been quite as good as it had been back with ""DAUME, "" but I still feel that fans of the show should indeed check this one out as well. The comedy is still there, the characters are still as charming as ever, and hey--it is more Minami-Ke!

       Helpful Love is perhaps one of the most complicated feelings in the world. We may all have experienced sometimes in our lives. Whether it’s platonic, romantic, or parental, it’s something that humans feel because that’s who we are. As part of growing up, people learn to understand these feelings. Yet, there are also people who make stories out of their lives from such feelings, in ways that become so twisted and disjointed that they become scum. Welcome to Kuzu no Honkai, a show that gives the characters a chance to grow up. 
 
As a manga reader, I was already prepared although it’s easy to judge by the premise that the story itself will be saturated with drama. Ever heard of ‘friends with benefits’? That’s pretty much how the premise sounds like. In the beginning of the story, we learn quickly that Hanabi and Mugi are engaged in a “relationship” that seems like those of a happy couple. Yet deep down, both suffers from pain because they are in love with someone else and are only using each other to ease their pain. It’s not hormone that’s driving these young folks into engaging in sex but that they simply want to feel something rather than pain. I have to admit, a show like this definitely takes on a more mature approach at romance than your typical high school rom-com. Make no mistake about it, Kuzu no Honkai is an emotional story that deconstructs romance in many ways more than one. 
 
The character cast is small yet complex because almost every character has their own personal issues. Some are more complex than others as the show focuses on them in their own twisted stories. A primary example is Akane, the seemingly lovable teacher. Yet, as the story progresses, you’ll quickly learn that she isn’t exactly what appears to be. Fans could easily label her as a bitch in sheep clothing and hard to accept. It’s also relatable too as Akane is a type of character that can easily be encountered in real life. That’s what also makes this show more realistic than some others as Kuzu no Honkai demonstrates a lot of realism. Relationships draws a line between love and sex. Can sex lead to actual love? Or is it just sex? 
 
In the meantime, character relationships in the show deconstructs what you’ll find in most romance stories. Yes, there are love triangles but Kuzu no Honkai has characters that uses others to satisfy themselves. Hanabi and Mugi is one but many examples. We’ll also learn in the show of how childhood friends will take the risk of being rejected and hurt. The fact is, no one is really safe of being happy in this series. Happiness is more like an illusionary word in the world of Kuzu no Honokai. Even when certain truths are realized and confessions are made, it is the stone cold truth that brings in even more pain. It doesn’t fall for every circumstance in the show as some characters are more willing to accept reality. However, the truth is still there that makes character relationships in this series seem like a losing battle. That’s a tough pill to swallow. 
 
As you can imagine, the show is drama heavy with a lot of emotions. Jealousy, regret, greed, hopeful, mistrustful, fear, are just a few to name. Action has consequences and this show brings out the worst out of human behavior. Think about it really. Kuzu no Honokai translates to Scum’s Wish as the title references to one’s interest to satisfy their own desires. Most of the characters does this and is drawn by humans emotions. At the core of these emotions is love. However, this show deconstructs love and very few characters actually understands it. Or perhaps there is no real answer because everyone has different perceptions. Narumi (Hanabi’s homeroom teacher) is a rare example in this show where he accepts certain people for who they are even after learning the truth. Still, the truth can hurt doesn’t it? 
 
Yes, don’t expect much comedy or humor from Kuzu no Honkai. It occasionally throws in some comedy from time to time but the majority of the show retains its mature feel. Now, the anime portrays sex as what it is and believe me, there’s a decent amount of it. The manga even has more explicit scenes to illustrate its point. So in essence, this show is not designed for a younger audience but suitable for those looking into a serious yet twisted story. The word ‘love’ doesn’t fit in there as that word is more or less an illusion. Still, I am happy that the adaptation captured the general idea of the original manga. It sticks to its point without derailing from its coming of age feel while inserting human emotions. 
 
Lerche surprisingly did a fairly decent job at crafting the artwork. Character designs look mature especially for the adults such as Akane and Narumi. Ebato has that pure nature lady look that makes her desirable. However, Moca’s character design can be bothersome to get used to as she looks like a child being stuck in a mature world. Be aware that the show has a lot of fan service such as make out scenes, sex, and other suggestive innuendos. One thing I am impressed by the artwork is how there are certain scenes in the show that captures the characters’ expressions at fullest. It accomplishes this with a more detailed visual of their feelings but importantly makes them look impactful. 
 
Soundtrack and music retains a somber tone. It’s a drama heavy story so what else did you expect? It has a feel of melancholy throughout the series along with light instrumental OST. Music director Masaru Yokoyama (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans) does a fantastic job at the directing as expected. The OP and ED theme songs have some symbolism along with a drama-like tone. But in terms of voice mannerisms, this is where it gets sort of mixed. Characters such as Akane and Ebato are really hard not to feel attracted to with their mature voices. In the meantime, I have to mention again that Moca is a source of annoyance whenever she opens her mouth. 
 
Kuzu no Honokai is like walking into a world of twisted desires. It’s like going into a maze with endless doors and no way out. Behind every door is a truth or lie that brings anything but joy. However, I think the show does bring up a good point of showing the realism of love. Examples in this series can really happen to anyone and realistically, it does. It’s part of us being human as there’s no real answer to what love is. Or to put it simply…. 
 
Love hurts.

I will try and explain, as clearly as possible, the rationale behind the rating above, everything that this anime does right and wrong, and why you should or shouldn't watch it. 
 
Story:  
Kuzu no Honkai is a breath of fresh air, a new and unique romance-themed anime that will leave you speechless - just kidding. Kuzu no Honkai is a story about a group of kids playing house, featuring wishy-washy characters in that high school setting we all know and love. Apparently they're calling it seinen now.  
 
The basic premise consists of an intricate love triangle featuring a perpetually depressed flake of a girl, an emo boy-toy, a standard issue onii-chan, a cougar, a lesbian, and a loli. In episode 1, Person-X decides to have sex with Person-Y. Repeat this for 12 episodes with different combinations of X and Y and congratulations, you've finished this amazing series. 
 
Kuzu no Honkai is pretty much a hate-it-or-love-it kind of anime. The problem with this series is mainly how pretentious it appears to be. ""I'm 17 and I'm deep"" is the theme of the day. When I was in high school, the first and foremost thing on my mind was passing the university entrance exams. Relationships were important but I never forgot my priorities. Of course, that's only me, and you can't compare an anime to real life, but they wouldn't have made it a high school setting if they didn't want people to relate to it. I'll take the liberty to allude to Golden Time here: a similar romantic-themed anime placed in a university setting. For all its flaws, they at least they got that part right, and that made things a lot more real. Perhaps the setting is an unfair point of criticism, but the incredulity of it all was a dampening factor on my enjoyment of this series. 
 
What does this anime do right with the story? For starters, I find its openmindedness towards love quite commendable. Love knows no bounds in this anime: (low-key) incest, lesbianism, lolicon, student-teacher love. Phew! Raunchy stuff.  
 
 
 
Art: 
Average 2017 animu art. However, one interesting thing about the art is how closely it resembles that of a shoujo anime - the suffocating close-ups, the excessive blushing, the simplistic nature of the backgrounds, fluidity with transitions, etcetera. Unassuming at times, allowing the viewer to focus completely on the trainwreck unfolding in front of them. 
 
 
 
Sound: 
One redeeming quality of the anime is definitely its music. The one thing you'd expect from the music would be to compliment what you see on screen, as opposed to jarr/seem out of place, and that's what the music did here.  
 
 
 
Characters: (Minor revelations/spoilers, proceed with caution.) 
With the exception of Ecchan, pretty much everyone is a flake.  
 
Let's start with Hanabi. Supposed ""honour student"", has a thing for her onii-chan. Is fooling around with three different people at the same time in order to numb the pain of unrequitted love. Enjoys playing the victim card, is easily hussled into sex, and doesn't know how she feels 99% of the time about anything. 
 
Next, the emo boy-toy, who has such a bland personality that you wonder what women see in him at all. 
 
Third, we have a piano teacher who loves sleeping with underrage boys. And yet, Mugi the boy-toy enjoys perpetually jerking his little ding-dong to her, despite knowing what a tramp she is. Attraction to someone's looks is apparently called ""true love"" and entitles you to mope around 24/7 and wonder at how deep your life is.    
 
Fourth, we have a loli who is actually just a stuck up little bitch. Also an osananijimi who you know will lose just based the trope she represents. 
 
As you can see, there really is nothing likable about any of these characters and you can't really relate to any of them, owing to how bland and pretentious they are. There is no real character development either, apart from little revelations about each ones' true colours, which I don't really consider development. 
 
I can, however, appreciate that this anime has some stellar relationship development. The true strength of Kuzu no Honkai, for me, lies in its character interactions. I keep harping on this, but the roller-coster relationships that characters experience with each other is actually quite realistic, and would have felt a lot more relatable in a university/work life setting.    
 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
This anime does not provide an iota of feel-good enjoyability at all. You will feel discomfort, jealousy, cringe, and at times, even disgust. But you'll probably want to keep watching with a grotesque interest that you'd have watching a butcher cutting up a piece of meat. 
 
Overall: 
In the end, Kuzu no Honkai has its good points, but is a painful pill to swallow. Vaguely resembling a B-rate drama, if you derive any more enjoyment out of this than what you'd get from a cheap soap opera, I commend you.  
 
Depending on what parts of this anime you love or hate, you might end up calling this a 2/10 OR an 8/10. I recommend you watch and find out.

6,1506,149,4.878904238,Seems to be a love story but actually not,Detective Conan Movie 10: Requiem of the Detectives,"After receiving a strange invitation, Kogorou Mouri pays a visit to the Miracle Land theme park along with his daughter Ran, Conan Edogawa, and the Detective Boys. Once there, Kogorou and Conan are tasked with finishing an unsolved case by a mysterious stranger. Realizing that the invitations were actually an elaborate trap, the two have just 12 hours to solve the case or face grave danger. 
 
With the help of familiar faces like Heiji Hattori, Kaitou Kid, and even Saguru Hakuba, the group of detectives must unravel the web of clues surrounding the case in order to find the culprit and bring them to justice before it's too late. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Conan, Kogoro, Ran, Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko and Haibara are invited to visit a client in a hotel beside a theme park called Miracle Land. Ran and the kids leave after being given free theme park wristbands, while Conan and Kogoro are forced by the client to solve a mystery to remove the wrist watches, which are set to detonate. The client also reveals that the wristbands given to Ran and company are set to detonate should they leave the premises. The mystery man reveals that two other detectives gave up, one killed, while one is still working.
Conan and Kogoro investigate an empty hotel where they find ski masks and a gun, which were used for a robbery. On the same date of the robbery, Kaitou Kid stole some jewels from a nearby company. Kogoro retrieves the bag, but ends up getting arrested as Kid's accomplice. The mysterious man calls Conan, correctly identifies him as Shinichi and gives him a second clue.
Conan meets Heiji Hattori who reveals that he is also part of the search, with his friend Kazuha also held captive. Hattori and Conan work together and end up in Yokohama Ocean University where they join together with Hakuba Saguru, a famous detective from the North. They find out that one of the former presidents of the club, Nishio, was charged with the murder of a classmate. Hattori then confirms with the client through the phone that the mystery he wants them to solve was the murder case.
They are attacked by two motorcyclists working for a person who is trying to kill Kaitou Kid. To escape, the three detectives split up. Conan ends up falling from a bridge and breaks his leg.
Kogoro is already giving his report to the client in the hotel when Hattori knocks him out so he does not get killed for giving a wrong conclusion. They then discover the client who is a blind wheelchair user and reveal the truth to him. The client, Nishio and Reiko, a woman who the client was in love with, were staging the robbery of an armored car. The robbery went wrong when a guard was killed and the robbers' escape was then witnessed by Kaitou Kid. Thus, the Nishio was murdered in order to keep the involvement of the other two silent. Conan and Hattori reveal that Nishio was already dead before the client shot him and that Reiko was the true killer. When the client panicked and tried to leave the city, his car was sabotaged in an attempt to kill him.
Reiko appears at that moment and confirms the truth behind the incident. She attempts to kill the detectives but is knocked out.
Conan accesses the computer to change the settings on the wristbands but fails due to the computer receiving damage from a loose gunshot. Conan manages to deactivate the link but not the restricted area however. The watches are then collected by the police except one (Genta) which is not accounted for as the police thought that the number of wristband is correct. They forgot to include the fact that Sonoko Suzuki is not involved in the case therefore they should include one more in the number of wristband collected. After the police collected the wristbands, all of them went to the snake ride. Genta brought along the wristband for the snake ride. At the start of the ride, Hattori saw the wristband and shouted. Haibara managed to remove but due to the motion of the ride, the wristband lands on the last seat of the ride. When the ride reaches the sea which is out of the restricted zone, Kaitou Kid took the wristband and let it explode safely.
Conan reveals that Kid was with them for a long time, disguised as Hakuba Saguru. The death of the three previous detectives hired by the client is revealed to have been staged.
","This movie is probably the most questionable in the entire series. It's so questionable, I don't know if I can even call it a movie. It's more like a TV special made to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise, but ended up being turned into a movie instead. As much as this movie may have its fans, Detective Conan: Requiem of the Detectives fails to impress as not only an anniversary film, but a film in general. 
 
The only saving grace about this movie is its story, which has Conan and the other detectives try to solve a case for a client before they all explode. There is some semblance of a looming sense of dread, as every moment is leading closer and closer to death as the movie goes on. There are even a few decent character moments here and there. Of course, this is where the praise for this movie stops. 
 
While the story itself is good, the execution is extremely lacking. Despite being under pressure to solve a case as soon as possible, the way the scenes are shot fail to capture that urgency. Everything feels so slow and plain that it eliminates any semblance of tension that the characters may be under right now. What also ruins this movie even more is its art and animation. The Detective Conan movies usually have a level of polish that puts them above the anime series. Here, there is no trace of quality or refining done to either the art or animation. It is, quite literary, an extended episode.  
 
If this were a TV special, then I wouldn't mind it so much (then I wouldn't even need to review it). But this isn't just a movie; it's a movie celebrating the 10th anniversary of the series. When put into that context, what does it have going for it? What can you watch in this movie that you can literally see in any other movie? Heiji and Kaito Kid? They already have their own movies. Everyone is going to be killed if Conan doesn't solve the case? Try the Eleventh Striker. Requiem of the Detectives' main problem is how basic it all is; every other movie before and after it did the same things that this movie does but even better. It's almost like this movie only had the story to work with and just did whatever with everything else. 
 
Before I end this review, I do want to stress that this only just me speaking and that my opinion may not apply for everyone else. These movies are like different flavors of ice cream. Some are like chocolate. Some are like strawberry. Some are even like pistachio. If I had to define Requiem of the Detectives as an ice cream flavor, it would be vanilla. Not French vanilla or vanilla bean; just basic vanilla. Some people like vanilla and that's okay. Even I'm morbidly curious what maple bacon ice cream tastes like. As such, Requiem of the Detectives will always be somebody else's favorite Detective Conan movie no matter what I think of it.

       Helpful Another great case featuring Shinichi Kudo aka Conan Edogawa. Although the case is a bit prolonged, its story and pace more than makes up for it. First off, a mysterious client asks for Mouri Kogoro (with Ran, Conan and detective boys) to meet at a hotel. There, they were given an electronic wrist strap as a vip entrance to a nearby theme park where they can ride anything for free - on condition that Mouri and Conan will stay and solve the case. It gets more interesting as the two meet up with Hattori and other detectives, only to discover that all of them are in the same predicament -- solve the case or the people they love will die! Its a fast-pace adventure as both conan, hattori, and mouri (he's serious for once, aww) race ahead of time to save their loved ones in the theme park.
