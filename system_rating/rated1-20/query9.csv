****THIS IS AN OPINION**** (Someone kindly informed me about it lol) 
 
But please, hear me out. 
 
I decided to write a review after episode 6 left me in tears. 
 
(Skip this part if you don't like background stories) 
Man, this brings back memories. I was one of the few that enjoyed the English server of the mobile game. The strong suit of the game is the story itself. I was truly immersed on the world of yggdra through storytelling alone. My heart broke into pieces when I heard about the server shutdown. By that time, the devs made all map energy cost into 1 so everyone can ""Enjoy"" the last moments of the game. 
 
I didn't. I uninstalled the game right after hearing that.  
 
By no means that I liked what I did, it broke me. As exaggerated as it may sound, it left a hole in my chest. What was once included in my daily routine, now gone. I felt like I broke up with 5 girlfriends compressing all that feelings into one instance. Until now I never found a mobile game to replace this particular hole in my heart. 
(Skip this part if you don't like background stories) 
 
Now enter the anime. I was hyped to hear about the anime, but was keeping a low steady expectation due to it being a game adaptation. An android game to boot. Adaptations never get the anticipation fans are expecting. For one, that is actually our fault. The game and the anime have different ways of delivering the message to the audience, (Check out MatPat's vid about adaptations for detailed explanation) but this adaptation took me into a whole new world. A Darker one to boot.  
 
*Contains some spoilers from the game* 
 
The end of Chapter 1 for the Mobile game has you, the hero, defeating Black King. The twist and turns of the whole book one unfolds into the last chapter, Black King being revealed as Phoena's father, and Black Knight being Yuri from a different Chain Chronicle world. The anime tackled a different route, where Yuri didn't defeat the Black King right then and there. Yes, the story may have turned into a darker path but I enjoyed it as to how it shows that the franchise itself had grown and matured to tackle on a darker light.  
 
While it's a shameless attempt into pulling anime fans into the game, it is indeed actually recommended that you finish Book 1 and as many character story possible. You will appreciate all the anime has to offer. For one, Julianna's story line in the game was actually one of the driving force for her to take on the Throne. Shuza's Nine Territories' storyline shows when and how the two joined forces to fight the Black King. 
 
Seeing all that connections, all that immersions, being twisted in a different, dark light gives a whole new rejuvenating enjoyable new experience the anime adaptation has to offer.  
 
*Update* 
 
I have to admit. Aram is really a big ass pull character. I wished his backstory and how his powers came to be was explained more clearly. 
 
I hope this somehow helped you into reconsidering to rewatch the series with all the points in mind. It saddens me that the score is dwindling down. Though I must admit, I will rate this 6/10 if I don't have any background in the game. I've seen it firsthand while watching some of the episodes with others that don't have the game background simply bored out and start spacing out mid episode. But as to how each episodes tug into my heart and my emotion, I just won't take it to look at this series going down without a fight (or atleast an explanation). 

          
 
       Helpful ENG-The story is pretty classic and boring. The hero who believes in the hope that must beat the great villain of despair with the power of friendship. It's seen and already seen. 
From an artistic point of view, this anime is rather good. The animations are fluid. However, there are some errors in some passages. 
The sounds and voices are also good. Despite the fact that in my opinion Ishida Akira (whom I admire) is not meant to be Yuri's voice. 
The characters are very numerous and detailed: congratulations to the character-design team who had to work very hard. 
I enjoyed this anime because even if it is a basic story, it remains good and pleasant to follow. 
 
FR-L'histoire est pl?tot classique et ennuyante. Le héros qui croit en l'espoir qui doit battre le grand méchant du désespoir à l'aide du pouvoir de l'amitié. C'est du vu et déjà vu. 
D'un point de vu artistique, l'animé est plut?t bon. Les animations sont fluides. Cependant, il y quelques erreurs dans certains passages.  
Les sons et voix sont aussi bons. Malgré le fait que selon moi Ishida Akira (que j'admire) n'est pas fait pour être la voix de Yuri. 
Les personnages quand à eux sont très nombreux et détaillés : félicitation à l'équipe de character-design qui a du travailler très dure. 
J'ai apprécié cet animé car même si c'est une histoire basique, elle en reste bonne et agréable à suivre.

          
 
       Helpful Chain Chronicles looked beyond the characters roles and into their hears. An impressive and beautifully animated story. 
 
When I first looked up this anime I saw some seriously negative reviews and I was almost swayed by them. I am so glad that I didn't listen. This anime is such a gem. I think the characters and the plot are all quite unique and well thought out. There is also sufficient character development throughout the series for all the main characters. I mean generically you always have a plot where the Hero gathers their team to defeat the Demon king and you don't often see an anime which looks at the consequences of the hero failing. Personally I think this anime was not only well written, but a very decent exploration into the adventure/fantasy genre. 
 
The animation, now Telecom Animation Film did a splendid job with this. All the characters all looked beautiful, you can tell the budget was big  on this one. Although I'm not very fond of the whole 3D animation theme, they used it sparingly and at beautiful moments. It transformed some of their action scenes into complete masterpieces. 
 
Which brings us on to the fight scenes. It's not often that I get so excited by fight scenes that I am practically rocking in my chair. Trust me I love me some fight scenes and If you want to see some serious fighting then I am telling you, you gotta watch this because their swordplay is not only beautiful but intense. All the various characters have their own styles, the Sakuga is great. Trust me it will keep you on your toes. 
 
The soundtrack was also impressive. It felt like your favourite generic adventure themes with this added hype that got me so hyped for every scene, I tell you the soundtrack made the most menial scenes really awesome. 
 
Please don't listen to negative reviews and give it your own chance please, you really don't know what your missing.  I personally think no matter what your ending opinion of it is, it is definitely worth your time.

9,16067,1,10.57234817,A group of people living together,Nagi no Asu kara,"Long ago, all humans lived beneath the sea. However, some people preferred the surface and abandoned living underwater permanently. As a consequence, they were stripped of their god-given protection called ""Ena"" which allowed them to breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the denizens of the sea and of the surface widened, although contact between the two peoples still existed. 
 
 Nagi no Asu kara  follows the story of Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido, along with their childhood friends Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki, who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea. 
 
Hikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","Since long ago, human civilization had lived on the ocean floor, developing a scale-like layer on their skins called Ena which allows them to live underwater. However, there were many humans who wanted to live above the surface and they moved to land creating a fundamental separation between the two. After Nami Junior High School closes down, four 14-year-old students from the sea village Shioshishio have to attend Mihama Junior High School on the surface. What follows is their struggles adjusting to a new environment and the relationships between the land and sea humans, while dealing with their own newfound feelings that have just started appearing with the end of their childhood.
","Nagi No Asukara is, for me, an example of a series with a great potential that was executed poorly. Althoguh people mark this show very highly, the story is really badly written, the characters are sketches and the fantasy aspect was just ruined. The best aspect of this show is the animation. 
 
The series is set in a world in which there are two types of human: those who live under the water, and those who live on the surface. The story is about students from an underwater village who transfer schools to a school on the surface, and its main subject (as much as I understood) is the racism between the two kinds of people.  
Now, the story has a great potential, but it was very poorly written, and this is the main reason for my mean score. We don't get to know about the background and history of the world (which is essential for a fantasy books and series), so things like the strong racism between the water and the surface human, the sea god and her powers, the salty rain and many other are just left unexplained, although they play a very important role in the series. The characters often act stupidly and without reason (an example - Hikari hugs Manaka after she hears a very bad news. Manaka kicks him hard, and sees surprised of herself). The dialogues are stupid (the characters argue about whenether they should change themselves. But why do they have to change? What should they change in themselves? No clue).  
The turning point of the story was quite promising, but from there, it deteriorted quickly. When a disaster comes close, the people on the surface act normally - continue with their life as nothing will happen. The few dramatical dialogues between the characters did not sove this problem. And when they finally found a possible solution, it was just horrible and pointless  (I will not spoil), and if you ask me, it was added just for the drama. After that, I dropped the series, because I saw that it was not heading to a good direction. 
 
The characters themselves are really one-dimensional. Hikari just keeps shouting and hitting other people (he is the only character who gets a character development, but it is too sudden and polar to be reliable). Manaka is just cute. Kihara is the only character that I found convincing. 
 
The animation, however, is really good. The character designs, the school, both of the villages were done very well. 
 
Overall, I think Nagi No Asukara is a rather dissapointing series. The story makes no sense, and although the fantasy setting sees promising, there is a lack of information about it, which is essential for the series. So if you try to find a fantasy series with a good story and not just a good concept, I suggest you to skip this one.

          
 
       Helpful Nagi no Asukara or lull in the sea is a good anime in my opinion. the story has an interesting concept of human living under the sea and it's prejudice to the people who live in the land. It has a complicated love story as you don't know who will end up with one another. It kinda gets bland  after the time skip. 
 
The anime's animation is such an eye candy, it has a lot of bright colors that makes it bright.The character's design is simple with  characters having big eyes  that makes them quite cute.I did like the color of the eyes, Since I am fond of  color blue.  
 
I also love the OP and ED song of the anime especially OP2 and ED1. 
 
The characters are good. I wish they put more emphasis to Tsumugu because I didn't really get to know him as a characters besides that he is not close to his parents, He loves the sea and fell in love with one of the characters.  
 
 
Well overall, I enjoyed watching it but It could have been better. 
 


          
 
       Helpful In my opinion, it is my belief that most anime that have been hyped beyond belief (at least the ones that have been airing recently) are of significantly poorer quality that most would've hoped. This happened with Sword Art Online, Kill la Kill, and for what has been shown already, Black Bullet (keep in mind I've only seen 4 episodes of that show at the time of writing this review). The worst thing about hyped shows are not actually the shows themselves, but their effect on other anime airing in the same season as them. Many anime that are arguably better than those shows are often overlooked by the general populous. This happened with shows like Shinsekai Yori, Golden Time, and the anime I will be reviewing today, Nagi no Asukara.  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Story: 
 
The thing that I like the most about the story is how it has a multitude of themes and messages to send to the viewer, but it does it in a way that feels very subtle. Even during the dramatic moments, nothing really feels too overbearing, and has a more lighthearted scene (but not completely comedic and out of place, mind you) almost directly after that to ease you out of it. It almost feels like the pacing and timing of the story was trying to mimic that of a wave crashing onto shore. A dramatic moment would resemble a strong wave full of emotion, and, most of the time at least, retreat back to where it comes from.  
 
As previously said, there are a multitude of themes and messages throughout this anime, ranging from rascism, to climate change, unrequitted love, and of course, change. Focusing on the first half and the ""rascist"" aspect, the thing I liked about this was that it didn't shove the theme down you're throat like you're mom forcing you to eat brussel sprouts. It's not like the two villages were on the brink of war or anything, just a very bitter relationship.In this case, it works with the atmospheric mood of the whole anime. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Characters: 
One really weird thing to talk about concerning this anime is that of character development. I say this because of the whole ""change"" aspect of anime. A lot of the anime focuses on how the various characters want to stay how they have been. This is actually one of the best parts of the show, as the characters are noticeably aware of their own ""character development"", and they want to stop it from occuring. I won't spoil how that actually turns out, but it's rather enjoyable to witness. 
 
Moving on to individual characters, let's start of with Hikari (Hii-kun as Manaka would say). There is one line in the anime that Miuna, Hikari's friend and another main character, says. She says that Hikari is straight (among other verbs, but I can't bother to find the particular line). Now, I don't mean in the sexual preference kind of straight. He fixates on one particular goal, and never stops until that goal is complete. He brash, and speaks before he thinks, but he truly cares for his friends (and his love interest). Although the way he goes about things is not really the way I would do it, it's interesting to see how he reacts to the various occurences that happen during the course of this anime. 
 
I don't want to drag on much longer than I already have, so I'll just give brief sentence summaries for each character, and then you can witness each of their greatness for yourself. You have Manaka, the bright and bubbly girl, and Hikari's main love interest. Kaname, the more logical of the group, who always tries to be in control of the situations and his feelings, even though thats the root cause of his pain sometimes. Chisaki, a busty purple-haired girl who is fairly silent (and probably my least favourite character of the bunch, but I won't go into detail on that). Tsumugu, the land dweller that has a strong passion for the sea. Last but not least, you have Miuna and Sayu, the two younger best  friends who are also troubled with love. 
 
Although the amount of screentime and focus of some of these characters (mainly Kaname) is very inconsistent, you really do feel their dilemna, and you have a strong sense of really getting to know who they are.  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Animation: 
 
Atmospheric. That's the best term to describe the animation of Nagi no Asukara in my opinion. The backgrounds are absolutely stunning, the movement, albeit a little limited at times, is fluid and precise, and the distinct look between land and water was phenomenal. At times, it almost feels like this anime had the budget of a movie. It's something that is pretty hard to match. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Sound: 
 
This is probably the least enjoyable thing about this anime. Not to say that the music is bad, because it isn't. It's just that everything else is so great that the sound kind of gets buried by it all. A lot of the music is very simplistic, sometimes only using one or two instruments for any given song. This can be seen as a pro and a con. It fits the atmospheric and scenic tone of the anime to a T, but most of it is really that memorable in the slightest. Fortunately, it knows when to kick it up when you have more dramatic scenes coming up to play. Lastly, the openings and endings. To be honest, I found almost all of them to be pretty generic. The exception to this would be the second opening. It still wasn't great, but it was a good notch above the other OP's and ED's this show had to offer. 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
The great thing about this show is how well it knows who it is, and how every single aspect of the show has a place. There are very few moments where the characters, music, pacing, etc. stray off from what the show is. What this show is is a feast to the eyes, portraying an enjoyable romance, relatable characters, and a well written story, all while doing it in such a manner that feels natural and realistic (well, as realistic as you can be with a tribe of people living underwater). And to discuss the ending, I can safely say that it was very well done, if not just a tad unsatisfying. I won't spoil a thing, but let's just say there is a major point in almost any romance anime shown near the end that the show forgets to add, and it just made me a bit sad. Overall, this anime gets a high recommendation from me, so make sure to watch it sometime. 
 
Also, remember me saying how every single aspect of the show has a place? 
Well, there is one line in the first episode that breaks that, but in the most hilarious way possible. SMELLS LIKE YOU'RE OVULATING. Like seriously, I laughed for a good ten minutes on that shit.

9,33564,2,10.481972,A group of people living together,Armed Blue Gunvolt,"In the near future, there are people with special power called Sevens. It seems like the country has maintained peace by a company called Sumeragi Group, but they are the one who captured the people with the special power by force and did inhumane experiments. Gunvolt, the main character who has the power of Sevens, used to be in Feather, a resistant group who fought against the Sumeragi Group. The story begins with meeting the heroine, Sian. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.
The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.
Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.
After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.
However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.
","*THIS'LL BE A SHORT ONE* 
 
Azure Striker Gunvolt is a beloved action platformer series that has spawned two games, with more probably on the way in the upcoming years. From the footage I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun. Since the franchise has been a success, it would pretty much be inevitable for someone to make an anime to either adapt or promote the games. I'm not sure how fans will react to this OVA, but I'm not impressed by it. Some of you might bemoan me for ripping on a glorified advertisement for a video game, but that didn't stop us last month when tearing up Fate/Grand Order: First Order, and it certainly didn't stop us from obliterating Mars of Destruction or Skelter+Heaven. Now, is it as bad as those few? Oh, hell no! It would be a sin to put this in the same ball park as the latter two abominations from yesteryear, and it's not as ridiculously bad as the former title either. Even still, when compared to other OVA promo prequels for beloved video games (like Megaman X's ""Day of Sigma), this OVA falls flat. This is coming from the perspective of a newbie that is planning on getting into the series, so maybe fans of the games will have a better time with this one than I did. So, why didn't this electrify me in the slightest? Well, let's find out, shall we? 
 
STORY: 3/10 
 
Basically, this is the story of how an adept, named Gunvolt, saved an adept by the name of Joule, with the framing decide being that Joule remembers being saved 6 months prior (how did she remember the stuff she wasn't there for? Did Gunvolt tell her? Dunno.). It's all basically a search and destroy mission and a generic OVA. Gunvolt breaks in, gets caught, has a poorly placed and poorly excecuted flashback, kicks some ass, finds the ""core"" that he needs to destroy, goes AWOL because it's the hero way and because he can relate to his target, and kicks more ass before getting kicked out. There's not much too it really. If the story was written tightly around that, with no asspulls, deus ex machinas, or any of that, this would be perfectly fine. However, specifically involving Gunvolt's fight with an adept by the name of Marik, and even before that, that proves to not be the case.  
 
In said fight, Gunvolt powers up out of nowhere, and he gets helped by an unknown sniper who isn't even seen by the end of this (unless there is context in the game to prove that it was someone we know), all in the middle of a generic and boring fight scene. This was clearly made for fans, as they make no attempt to explain much about anything here, leaving newbies, such as myself, in the dark. It all ends on a lazy advertisement of what's to come in the games, as was the case with the other glorified ad anime that came out recently. All of this may seem too benign for a 3, but, in 21 minutes, it stacks up really quickly, and with no flavor or anything to really mitigate the damage. Oh, we also see his rival, Copen, randomly because of course we have to shoehorn the rival character to advertise him. Maybe it was him who fired the shot? He hates adepts, so, why didn't he help kill the enemy adept? We'll never know. Well, let's move on. 
 
CHARACTERS: 4/10 
 
Another reason this OVA was boring was due to its characters. I understand that in 21 mintes, it's hard to really sell a cast of characters, especially when it's an adaptation of a video game, but shows like Steins;Gate have proven that to be possible, making us love the cast by the end of episode 1. Everyone feels stale and generic, but not stupid or excessively generic. It's a lukewarm cast with a lukewarm hero (Gunvolt, who I'm sure is more interesting in the games), damsel in distress (Joule), and Gunvolt's now ex-organization, QUILL, and Nova, the headmaster of the evil organization, The Sumeragi Group. There mainly there just for the sake of putting them in this scenario to advertise the game, and it shows since almost none of them have a personality that goes beyond the basic archetypes. 
 
ART: 7/10 
 
Gunvolt was animated by ""LandQ studios"", and they did an alrigt job, even with the borderline ""generic LN"" character designs. It really shines when they animate some concert scenes with Lumen, the pop idol who just so happens to be an extension of Joule. Everywhere else, it's merely ok; even by OVA standards, this isn't anything notably impressive. The combat is mediocre but not poor, and I'm glad they kept the mechanics from the game in check (unlike some adaptations out there). It's decently animated by a relatively unknown studio, and that's all we care about for this section. 
 
SOUND: 4/10 
 
There really isn't anything special about the background OST aside from the pretty decent Lumen songs. They make a good backdrop to whatever goes on, even if there is nothing else that has any real merit (like a sense of memorability). As for the dub, it's really bad. Given that it came out the same time as the sun, it makes some semblance of sense, but Space Dandy has the same scenario and, from what I've heard, it has a great dub, so what's Gunvolt's excuse? Everyone sounds like they're just reading their lines from a script instead of actually acting, and it really shows. For 2017 standards, that is unacceptable. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 4/10 
 
All in all, this was a very dull advertisement OVA. Nothing really tried to stand out, and it was all middling and lukewarm. The dialogue was also meh, as was the fighting. Nothing felt like it was really trilingual to entertain, and it's a shame. Still, at least it wasn't excruciatingly boring, but it was dull nonetheless. That's all there is too it, aside from one funny like about Marin complaining about Gunvolt's actions and lines sounding like a generic hero. 
 
OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 42/100 
 
There's not much left to say here. It's a boring OVA that, while meant to make us interested in the franchise, probably succeeds better at giving a small treat to existing fans than drawing new ones in. It doesn't do anything interesting or play it's events up in a way that is fun, but at least it's not as bad as some of its earlier contemporaries. Still, it's not one of the better ones if it's kind out there. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.

          
 
       Helpful Gunvolt, a game that I've watched the walk through for because I do not have the money to buy it on eshop. I don't even know how to put money on eshop. I absolutely loved the game and I was even more excited for the anime. But there are things that they should of done to improve it. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Compared to the game itself, it mostly showed the very beginning. This leads me to disappointment as I was expecting a lot more than just the beginning. If they were targeting people to go play the game, they did a good job. To gunvolt fans who waited forever hit the dust as it was just about the beginning. In a story, there is a beginning, middle and end. We have one thing but where is everything else!?! 
 
Art: 8 
 
I really liked the art style in this episode. It really gives that spark. Especially when the blue lighting kind of flashes. Sadly when it came to a long battle. The portals kind of confused me. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
It was pretty decent. It did give energy, especially to the ones who have played the game as the song is recognisable but it was mostly all lumen. I know there is more music then that. Especially during the fight. What could of made it better is some dramatic fight music! 
 
Character: 4 
 
Where the heck is the character build!?! Yes, I know that it's hard to do something like that in 21 minutes. I bet anyone that has watched this and is basically new are wondering what is QUILL's main objective, what is the sumeragi and how many are they, what is an adept? If they did a whole series. It would give them time to build up more character in not just the main character but the supporting also. I'm betting right now that first timers only remember 2 names and it's pretty obvious what those names are. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
I really enjoyed it. What I never expected was Gunvolt wearing glasses and all that normal attire. It just gives fangirls a squeal. Like I said before, it was quite confusing with all the portals. Although I did really hate that it was only available on eshop. It would of reached far if the good quality was available for other devices. 
 
Overall: 6 
 
I enjoyed this one short episode. I believe it would of been better to have it as a series than a 21 minute video. There was so much left out just by doing one episode. Like Danganronpa. It started as a game. It had a 13 episode series which not only attracted people to play it but also to play the sequel and other games in the DanganRonpa franchise. Other than that, I liked it! 
 
I hope you find this helpful

          
 
       Helpful Armored Blue Gunvolt or Azure Striker Gunvolt would be an awesome anime series. All of it the story, art, sound and characters match the game so well. After finding it and watching it I watched it at least ten times. When and if they make this into an anime I would rewatch again and again. All in all I give it a 10/10. For the record I am still rewatching it till this day.

They hide their powers so as to assimilate into the environment. They have been living together in harmony with the humans for many years to come, and their predecessors continue to do so. Sasami was enthroned with magical powers since her birth. However, at the age of three, she was told by her parents never to use her innate powers and from then on, had kept it a secret from everyone. On the day of a new school term, a new transfer teacher by the name of Wajuu arrives and from then on, Sasami's life begins to change tremendously. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Fantasy', 'Magic', 'School']","Sasami Iwakura has been endowed with magical powers since birth; but at age three, she is forbidden by her parents to use them. So she decides to keep her magical powers a secret. But at the start of a new term, she encounters the new transfer teacher Washu and her pet Ryo-Ohki, and her life is about to change.
The first series/season is dedicated to character development as we are introduced to magic girls Sasami, Misao, Makoto, Tsukasa, and Anri.  As the girls discover their awakening powers, they also learn a bit about themselves as they train with Washu and Daimon as part of their ""cooking club.""  This culminates in their taking a trip to the magic world, where they compete against other magic squad teams, some having boys in them.
The second series/season is dedicated to plot, where Sasami's magic girl squad's activities have impressed the Chief Sorceress.  As such, she wants those girls as part of her plan to change the human world (Earth), which she sees as too corrupt.  The girls, especially Misao, must not only learn to master their abilities and magics, but also learn to face their own fears, lack of understanding, and the like as they walk a dark road set down before them by the Chief Sorceress.
This anime also features Misao (Shinohara) and Sasami's homeroom teacher Mihoshi.
","(Note: This review is for both season one and two of Sasami Magical Girls Club.) 
 
Shall I take you into the mystical world of “Sasami: Mahou Shoujo Club”? A world in which both humans and witches have lived in peace and harmony, until that fateful day when humans had betrayed them and cast them away for their abnormal powers. The witches had no choice, but to build a new world, separate from the human world, where they lived in that world to reclaim the peace and harmony that was once theirs. But some witches have stayed in the human world for several purposes: family, friends, and more. However, in order to stay in their world they had no other choice, but to never use their powers again. As a result, their powers grew weaker and weaker where it seemed as if they never had them to begin with. Soon hundreds and hundreds of years have passed and than for some strange reason, a few children all over the human world have discovered these powers. However, it is unknown if these powers are for good or evil, should these powers be ridden of for all eternity in which the same event shall not be repeated in years to come, or is this a chance for humans to finally come and accept these creatures again? There’s only one way to find out!  
 
Plot: 
 “Sasami Magical Girls Club” is an anime about five girls, but they’re not your normal girls, each of these girls has wondrous powers which are special and unique in their own way. Usually in a magical girl anime you’d expect them to go battle some evil bad guys, however these girl s don’t have to do such a task. They usually just go on some weird adventures and such, and the whole season are mainly these girls slowly learning about the witch world and magic lots and lots of magic. So if I were to put it in a nutshell, I sometimes feel that the whole season are just plain fillers, I mean some of these episodes are just pointless, I feel like they’re not even needed in the anime in any way, only to teach us those cliché anime lessons about how much friendship is extremely important. During the last few episodes of the anime, the series grew some big boy underpants because it finally started rising up to the climax.  
Season 2 is a continuation of season 1, only a tad bit more serious and interesting.  It does start off a bit more slow, but later on in the series; I promise you it gets much more interesting because these girls finally have their first evil villain which I was very excited about because I like to believe that in an anime such as this one, it needs an antagonist to add as an obstacle for the magical girl group. The rest of Season 2 is pretty much cliché in a way to put it because I’ve seen this sort of development often in a magical girl anime. Its ending was somewhat to be expected though I could clearly tell that these producers could have given us a better ending.  
 
Art: 
The art style is nothing to die for which is a definite fact. It uses the kodomo art style which is a heavily popular style of manga, and possibly the most popular character type of anime. The kodomo art style, I must say is a perfect fit for this anime because it enraptures the cuteness needed to fully display the overall effect and maybe even potential the series has. The anime uses a large amount of colors which I really like about the whole art style because it uses the unrealistic hair colors I haven’t seen in a while, you know like weird and out of this world hair styles that can only exist in anime and manga. The art style does a great job of expressing the mood of the whole anime which are just a bunch of mixed feelings for me that is nothing special. One of my favorite things about the way the characters were drawn was their eyes, they were really adorable, and I just couldn’t stop looking at them. 
 
Sound:  
“Make a wish and ride with, me into the moonlight.” The opening of this anime was how do I describe it? Oh yes magical, so magical that if you just close your eyes while listening to the music, you will imagine that you are flying on shooting stars. Yep, I love the opening of this anime so much that its one of the top 20 openings in my opinion. The anime, I believe uses uncommon background music we rarely hear in anime because it uses those old effects we see in cartoons like “popping” and that sort of thing. The anime still needed appealing background music though to better add the mood of the events occurring throughout the show. I believe if the anime had some special sound effects or more official sound tracks than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to an 8. 
 
 
Characters: 
In an anime of the “Magical Girl” genre, I usually tend to love all main characters. However, season one of this anime took a different approach to teamwork which I can tell you is not a compliment in anyway, actually I believe it to be one of the many downfalls of this anime is its characters which leaves me and probably some of its other viewers a feeling of slight disgust in some of these main characters. The problem I have with this anime is that two of the five main characters, leave me with the impression that their bullies when their supposed to be one of the good people. When I watch this anime, I see these two girls each and every episode insult the main heroine calling her ‘stupid’ and some other insults which I find so revolting, even if it was meant to be a joke, they take it too far by insulting her each and every episode, even counting her as being the ‘fifth wheel’ of the whole entire Magical Girl group! Even though the creators try their very best to showing the viewers that these two girls are not that bad, and that they actually care about the whole Magical Girl group, it does little to no help in changing my opinion to the characters. Another problem I saw while watching this anime was that the creators didn’t do a good job of showing the girls grow closer, or get to know each other better. I didn’t see much interaction between all the five girls when it came to getting to know each other; it was like they were already best friends when they’ve only known each other for a day.  By the time the “Sasami Magical Girls Club” reached its second season was when I can finally understand that these girls really have grown to love each other a lot. Unlike season one, the anime finally dug up a hole and found gold because now the viewers can finally see the characters get to know each other more and more.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I originally watched the anime on 2009, three years after it came out, however dropped it because I had gotten extremely bored with the first six episodes that I actually yawned a couple of times and ended up daydreaming while trying to listen to what the fudge was going on. So yes, I was bored even after rewatching the series. There were absolutely no moments where I felt like this anime was actually worth watching, but I did get confused, very confused. “Wait, what the, why is, isn’t that, but I thought she was the mai- OH WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!” Pretty much that was what I was saying for some parts of the anime. There were also some times when I got jealous for some romance parts, yes there is some romance in this anime, I guess you could call it that. All I know is that the romance was so cute and adorable that I imagined my crushie doing that with me… OTL If only he would do that, but sadly, not all boys are as so sweet as to act as gentlemen.

A fellow squatter sits next to him, notices the blood and tries to get help, but the injured man is no longer alive when he returns. The other homeless goes to the police to report his fellow's death; the officers follow him, but the man is gone. The squatter goes to search for the old man and finds him as a zombie, who attacks him.
Hye-sun, who ran away from her former life in a brothel, now lives with her boyfriend, Ki-woong, who intends to pimp Hye-sun out again due to money problems. After a fight about this, the two separate and are caught in the chaos bursting out of Seoul Station. Hye-sun escapes with a few survivors into a police station, where they are trapped by a group of zombies within a jail cell, along with a policeman bitten by a zombie. Meanwhile, Hye-sun's father, Suk-gyu, interrogates Ki-woong for his daughter's location. The two go to Hye-sun's home, only to find that the landlady had become a zombie. Sun-gyu and Ki-woong both hide in the bathroom after another zombie attacks them, escape through the bathroom window and climb to the roof. Sun-gyu devises a plan with Ki-woong to get the zombies' attention, while he goes down to get the car. They drive away in shock, but focus on finding Hye-sun.
At the police station, the bitten officer calls for backup before succumbing to his infection, reanimating and biting another survivor in the cell. Help arrives and draws the infected away, allowing Hye-sun and an old man to escape the cell and get into an ambulance. The ambulance crew seems oblivious to what is happening to the infected. Hye-sun calls Ki-woong that she is heading to the hospital and to meet her there. The old man panics when he realizes they are en route to the hospital, where many reports of bite wounds appear to be coming in. He attempts to take the wheel from the driver and causes the vehicle to crash. Hye-sun and the old man flee through the subway tunnels. Meanwhile, Suk-gyu and Ki-woong make their way to the hospital, but discover that the zombies have already taken over the place. They barely escape before continuing their search.
Outside Hoehyeon Station, Ki-woong calls Hye-sun, but their conversation alerts the nearby infected. A group of people call them to a makeshift barricade while fighting off the infected. The two are saved, only to realize they were placed in a quarantine by riot police, who mistakenly believe the crisis to be an insurrection. Suk-gyu and Ki-woong try to persuade the police to let them through, but are rejected as the officials refuse to tell them why martial law has been ordered in this town. The survivors slowly succumb to growing numbers of infected people. After a speech on his poor position in society, the old man explains the whole situation to the officials about a zombie virus invading the town. Angered the reason of martial law has been pried from the government, the officials kill the man by gunfire, throwing the crowd into a panic as the infected charge in and overrun the barricade. Hye-Sun is able to escape, but is scratched on her foot by a zombie.
Hye-sun makes her way into an empty showroom and notifies Ki-woong of her location before falling asleep. When Ki-woong and Hye-sun are reunited, she reveals that Suk-gyu is not her father but rather her previous pimp. Suk-gyu has been searching for her because she has stolen back her late natural parents' money he was keeping for himself. This outrages Ki-woong, who thought a deal was made to help him reunite with his girlfriend, yet Suk-gyu becomes violent to the point where he explains that he wants revenge on Hye-sun for theft. Ki-woong tries to subdue Suk-gyu with a knife, but to no avail as Suk-gyu takes the knife from him and kills him on the spot. Hye-sun tries to flee, but Suk-gyu subdues her. As he prepares to rape her to death, she dies instantly. Suk-gyu frantically applies CPR while apologizing for stalking her, but then he spots the scratch on Hye-sun's foot and realizes that she is infected. As Hye-sun reanimates and kills Suk-gyu, the camera zooms past a dead Ki-woong and the infected overrunning the quarantine.
","Seoul-yeok / Seoul Station is clearly not a must-watch movie but represents an average movie for zombies fans and a bad movie for Last Train for Busan's fans. 
 
If you have never watched the live-action film Last Train for Busan, please go ahead and watch this masterpiece of modern zombies films. I watched many films with this thema, going from classics (George Romero's fims such as Zombie, Night of the Living Dead, etc) but also modern ones (Resident Evil saga, World War Z, 28 Days Later, etc) and Last Train for Busan can easily enter my top 5. 
 
So for those who have not watched it yet, Seoul-yeok takes place in the eponym Korean city where you will follow a woman & her boyfriend, being separated at the beginning. They both have to survive the debut of a zombie apocalypse, with regular humans turning into bestial creatures who only desire to bite/eat non-infected livings. The story is basic to follow and has nothing exceptionnal. In fact most viewers watched it because they appreciated Last Train for Busan? 
 
And it was disappointing... indeed, this film does not add anything to the original work, it is actually totally canon. There is no common point, not even a train that seems to go somewhere. Well ok, some scenes take place in the underground, on the metro/train rails but that's it. What frustrated me the most was the total absence of any relation, any easter egg or anything that indicates a relation. 
 
I was not asking for a very obvious point but for example, in REC 3, you have a 10 seconds scene where a TV in the background shows a scene from REC 1/2. This little detail was totally missable for someone who did not watch the previous films but acted as a related element for those who did. Easy, short & gives you a smile. Seoul-yeok did not even fulfill its role to be a sequel for Last train for Busan. 
 
Disappointing overall with horrible tearing scenes (I mean, characters crying, not something heartbreaking) that made me laugh like crazy. An animation correct at the best, even a bit mediocre on some points. The story was... skippable, even if the conclusion tends to be more dramatic than expected (however I did not care much about it). Very shameful that they did not EVEN give a single hint reminding the original film. Also, extremely ironic that it was called ""Seoul Station"" but most scenes took place OUTSIDE of a metro station...

          
 
       Helpful It may be about zombies but the director seems to take a zombie apocalypse to bring out a social scope on the matter; South Korea’s homeless predicament  is a ubiquitous theme throughout the film, prostitution secondly, youth runaways. Centerpoints which all come down to a social class theme. 
 
At least that’s what I thought of it.  
 
Homelessness was tied to all the prominent characters from what I saw as I scrubbed the video to the beginning, going back before finishing the last act, pausing at the each character’s first appearance onscreen. Their surroundings tell all and are primary motivation for specific characters decisions; where they are at first, and what one could infer from the scenery at that moment pretty much paints the picture of the character. 
 
It should be noted that this isn’t some crappy z-flick movie best left in a trash bin. The plot is quite good, it definitely plays off at the end, leaving one to think about what was and what ended as the movie drew to a close. 
 
Just like the rest of the z-flicks, it’s not a happy story - but it’s one that puts out its key punches in way unique from most of the rest.  
 
It’s a pretty well polished film, great music and ambience, with a distinct animation style, great rendering if not a bit over the top character gesturing. With that, the film smoothly strong-arms the characters’ emotional state onscreen most of the time. 
 
Just one quick thing to point out about the criticization of the graphic animation. It was well done imo, the style probably wasn’t in many people’s tastes. I could only count of two short and quick scenes where I was there were a few more lines of details instead of, say in one, where the floor was just a flat green one color. 
 
More importantly, in addition to the animation expressing the character’s emotional state, it does extremely well detailing the bodies of the animated cast. The physical appearance of a character’s body should be kept in mind as the film moves on and when extra detail is shown of or when the camera centers in on a part of the character. I thought it was very emphatical keying into the those cues. The background and scenery art’s relationship to the film’s theme of home also became very well emphasized as one of our mains reacted with the surroundings at the last act. Again, here the film gives an image to allow the viewer to contemplate the events that had past in the film to the current moment on scene. 
 
To summarize my take on the art a bit, I saw the graphical representations to be quite detailed and refined for most of the time in the film. I thought at times the visuals, and the little details especially, should be definitely taken into account in order to sink into the atmosphere of the movie. The blurring, animation and style of locomotion could be offputting at times, akin to Knights of Sidonia’s style but any negative aspects in the film’s art is offset by the important details put in scene. 
 
 
On how the film kicked off and died slowly then lingered after:  
I thought it was unique a intro and background-reveal to one of the main characters, although I was a bit annoyed with the first act’s prime character’s method of speech, a different character from former first described. 
 
Finally, I thought the ending was just lovely for me. It hit the right notes for me.  
And on a musical perspective, it hit the best note with its song at the very end. I was out of breath and forgot to take one in. Stunning. 
  
 
 
 
- - - This isn’t the average zombie movie. And if one like this type of horror, it’s well worth a watch and it may leave some nice surprises that gives more than one what was initially looking for - - -

          
 
       Helpful Okay, where do I start with this? 
First of all, it's not really as bad as you would think seeing as the score is nothing more than a mediocre one - however, it's live-action sequel counterpart is better by lightyears.  
 
The story itself is not very consistent and I personally couldn't find any meaning or red thread in it - hence, I couldn't find as much enjoyment as I otherwise probably would. If you've watched or are planning to watch the live-action ""Train to Busan"", this is by no means an important part of understanding and enjoying the story. In fact, this doesn't really explain anything in regards to the events in the live-action sequel. What I expected was a story leading up to exactly what caused the outbreak, but I never got that. In short, it's no use watching this film if you're expecting a solution or explanation as to why the events in ""Train to Busan"" occured.  
 
The art is a very subjective matter so it's not fair of me to say that the movie became ""less good"" because of the artstyle. However, I personally found that my enjoyment was quickly reduced when I was introduced to the artstyle as it is not my personal prefference. If you can pull of 3DCG then please do make a series or movie depicting the actions and real life-like suspense 3D animation can bring forth. This film however, did not succeed in that as the art fell flat along with the suspense and storyline. When utilizing 3D animation, I expect them to do it to it's fullest - and by that I mean not just using it as an easier mean of animating characters but also utilizing it's ability to beef up the perspectives and movements of the so-called ""camera"". If that's not used, I don't see the point of using 3DCG even if it does make animation alot easier if you know what you're doing. In fact, I personally find it even more useless if the project is even made when you don't have the guts to animate it properly. 
 
The sound was nothing more than mediocre. I can't even remember the music at the top of my head as I usually do. I know that plot-heavy movies and series doesn't put as much effort into creating the musical atmosphere as other projects but it still does lift the suspense and deepens the action. So I can't really understand why they didn't use that element. It would've certainly made my experience better.  
 
The characters were fairly built with some surprises hidden in them - thanks to that my attention deepened towards the ending. But I would've appreciated if some of the characters (I'm looking at you, main character) weren't so annoying, irrational and just plain boring. In an emergency situation, like a zombie apocalypse for example, you wouldn't think rationally, would you? I know that, but the main character seriously took that irrationallity way to far. She did not make any effort to find the ones looking for her but did cry and scream at them to find her as she just escaped farther and farther away. She did have to escape if she didn't want to be killed, but the fact that she blamed the others for her misfortune in running away was the icing on the cake for her annoyance.  
 
So did I enjoy it? At some points. Do I recommend it? Not really, at least not if you're looking for an explanation to the live-action film. So overall, with all my points in mind, I'd give this a 7 since it did peak my interest at some points.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",none,"The first season was quite enjoyable. After season 1 ended I was quite satisfied with an anime ending for once; no more was needed.  
 
At first, I was excited about a new season. For a few weeks I anxiously waited for a new season, hell I even got up early enough to check if I didn't miss the first episode. So in excitement, I waited. 
 
Finally, getting up early was worth it. The first episode aired sometime in July 2003-04 ish, correct me if I'm wrong. After watching the first episode I went all &quot;Well, it can't be THIS bad throughout the entire season, could it?&quot; The answer is yes it can. My very first impression watching it was &quot;I thought people grew UP, not DOWN!&quot; In the first season, the BladeBreakers looked mature (and thank god they regained some of that maturity in GRev) but then they went all Chibi.  
 
With hopes of the show improving and having its classic feeling again, I watched the season all the way through. It's hardly memorable and easily forgotten because it's so horrible. All I do remember is for once getting annoyed with Tyson and friends. 
 
Story:  
 
I've read better fanfiction. Seriously, watching the paint dry is much more interesting then the story itself. 
 
Art:  
 
I actually like the old school style of Beyblade. Why the hell did they choose to make it chibi? In the first season, the character's faces actually varied. But when this new style came in, they all had the same freakin' face. The only designed I like was Dr. K's (was that her name? I forget) because she at least looked mature.  
 
Sound: 
 
Not bad, but mediocre.  
 
Character:  
 
My biggest pet peeve of this season was the characters. Tyson/Takao becomes a bigger brat then he was (and he isn't funny while doing it like he was in the first season) and it was hard to take him seriously. Kai is emoer then usual (does he have to angst at every chance he's got? Seriously.) and he became extremely annoying. Ray came off as a ditz most of the time. Max was just plain out annoying. You think that's bad?! There's more! 
 
So it seems that the animation studio decided to add in a cheerleader for the Bladebreakers because Yugi had a cheerleader (AKA Anzu Misaki). Yes, I am talking about Hilary/Hiromi. If I were to ask the BladeBreakers anything, it would be &quot;How did you put up with that bitch?&quot;. Honestly, just how did they put up with her?  
 
I was seriously hoping that Hilary was only going to be there breifly, but no, they had to make her a major character. She's basically only there to be the bitchy cheerleader who seems to enjoy hitting Tyson at every chance she gets. That's seriously all she does. She's more annoying then comic releif if you ask me.  
 
What was her purpose anyway other then cheerleader role? At least Anzu had a purpose in YuGiOh.  
 
Enjoyment: 
 
One word: Pathetic. This season is the shadow of its former glory. Compared to GRev and the first season, this one sticks out like a sore thumb.  
 
Overall: 
 
I personally did not like this season at all. Maybe someone who has not seen the original first season might enjoy it, but any fan of the first season is gonna hate it. 

          
 
       Helpful Okay, I would like to point out just how varied those scores are, i'll explain that as we go. 
 
Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002 (Beyblade V-Force in the U.S.) is a tragic failure at a series. 
 
Story- 
Now, except for G-rev Beyblade fails at stories. This is the worst of it. There's more coherency in a drunk dad solo song at a wedding than in this. You'll never know where you're at in the story until the last 3 eps and other than that it offers nothing new or exciting. 
 
Art-  
Good, not butt ugly, it's passable and the CG blades look nice. The problem is consistency. Last season the characters looked 14 to 15. They look like 11 year olds here. There's just a lack of follow-through that hurts what could be a fun art style. 
 
Sound- 
Suffers from generic songs. The Japanese version has increasingly generic music that bores that they can put on for you to ignore while you watch a terrible show. Don't ask about the dub, it suffers from the Rap in anime plague. 
  
Characters- 
Let me get something straight. Beyblade has one of the better main character sets in anime; their main 5-6 I absolutely adore; however, I dock 4 points for this season specific characters. All the season 2 only characters here are badly designed, generic, annoying, and there's more of them than periods in War and Peace. Good luck keeping up with them. 
 
Enjoyment- 
Only if you're a sadist can you enjoy this. It's generic, you can't follow it, and you shouldn't try. 
 
Overall- 
I'm not giving it a 1 just because of the main characters, the fact that the art isn't in itself terrible and the sound isn't terrible. If it didn't have the mains, this would be unwatchable.

          
 
       Helpful The story was very good. It was exciting and attention grabbing. The concept was amazing. Being able to control ancient beasts using modern technology. 
 
In the first season, the art was very...rough and not good. The characters were ugly, to be frank.But as the second season and third season arrived, the art improved and the charcters became more good looking and clear. 
 
The sounds were very good. They were catchy and upbeat. There were mostly of rock genre. 
 
The character profiles were okay...Some characters were not clear and due to that were ignored. 
 
This is the show to watch if you're bored. Basically for those who have never seen anime before. After watching this, you would want to watch more and different anime. It piques your interest.

9,171,6,8.989503474,A group of people living together,Strange Dawn,"Yuko and Eri are two normal girls who are sucked into the alternate world filled with tiny people. The people of this mysterious world sees them as their ""Great Protectors"" who can protect their land in a time of strife. The two girls set out on a mission with a group of warriors from the village to find out how they were brought here and how might they return home. However, there is a war brewing and these two Great Protectors are the political tool that every faction lusts for to rally the people to their side.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","Two teenage girls (Yuko and Eri) are transported to a magical planet which is dominated by small semi-humans. To the girls surprise they are treated as Gods by the little creatures. They learn that princess Alia used her magic-powers to transport them to their world, because they believe Yuko and Eri are the 'protectors' and will end the horrible war that has been going on for years on their planet. However Yuko and Eri try to convince them that they are nothing more but two girls and are no Gods, all they want is to go home. They befriend Shall who comes to the decision to protect Yuko and Eri he tells them that Princess Alia was captured right after she summoned them. Shall then leads them into a long journey to find Princess Alia, unfortunately other countries discover the appearance of the two human girls and are doing anything that they can to use them for their own benefit.
","Strange Dawn is a surprisingly good show for how obscure it is, but has some crucial flaws that prevent it from being great. In this case I think the flaws are more interesting to look at, so that's primarily what I'll be focusing on, but keep in mind that I think it's an overall good show worth watching. 
 
The writing is mostly solid, with a well-paced and engaging plot tackling interesting themes. The characters are well-rounded and seldom completely good or evil. The animation is also well-done, especially considering it's a 2000 show. The background music is charming and appropriate to the tone, and the voice performances are generally good. 
 
The art style, however, is one of the major problems. Except for the two main characters, all the characters are drawn in a super deformed style, or ""chibis"". While there's nothing inherently wrong about this, it really doesn't fit the tone of the show, which is a pretty serious and at times violent fantasy series. This style of character design is traditionally used for more comedic anime like Hetalia or Damekko Doubutsu, and so it just doesn't feel right to have to take them seriously when they talk about politics and war. 
 
I would assume that the choice to make the inhabitants of the strange world super deformed came at least partly from the realization that it's a simple and cheap way to draw and animate characters; anime is after all a medium that evolves through figuring out how to do things effectively on a small budget. However, this decision affects the show in more ways than just the general sense of tone mismatch. 
 
The premise of the show is a well-known formula: our protagonists get mysteriously transported to a foreign world, where they get involved in local affairs while trying to figure out how to get back home. The inhabitants of the foreign world all being tiny, the protagonists are initially feared and respected, as their sheer size makes them forces to be reckoned with, especially in a pre-industrial world where the main weapons are tiny swords and bows and arrows. Despite this, throughout the show they are mostly passive bystanders, victims and McGuffins. Although it tries to use this to further a theme of learning to stand up for yourself, the cinemanarrative dissonance of seeing these giant God-like creatures so easily restrained and bossed around by people so small they'd die if you stepped on one is too strong to really make it believable. 
 
Not only do the protagonists often feel powerless, they don't even feel important to the story a lot of the time. As characters they're well-written, they have an interesting relationship and they have some good development, and yet it feels like it'd only take 10 minutes in the writer's room to patch up the hole left if you just took them out. Of course, as with all works with this kind of setting, having a representative of Earth Humans present can make it easier to quickly and efficiently introduce the world and point out its differences to ours, which absolutely has its advantages, particularly in shorter works, but if that's all they're going to contribute it would be better to cut them and introduce the world more naturally. I half-seriously suspect that the only reason the main chars were added was so they had an excuse to use super deformed art designs for most of the cast and cut down on costs. 
 
Finally, although the plot is quite high quality most of the way through, the ending feels very abrupt. Without any inside info I can only speculate that perhaps it was intended to be longer (it did feel like a 2-cour show to me in terms of pacing for a large part of the show), but it got pulled prematurely. While this is a shame and I would have liked to see a better ending, I doubt it would have done much to alleviate its other issues.

          
 
       Helpful Very obscure anime that I saw all of one time as a kid Arabic dubbed on TV and finally found again after years of wondering if I'd imagined it. And it is beautiful. Children's rating though? That's a lie - the only reason anyone would have to believe that this is a children's anime is the fact that the characters look like little Teletubbies. But it's an anime with lots of blood and violence, themes of war, love triangles and melodrama - heck, there's even (somewhat...) an attempted rape scene! If there's one major problem it's the very abrupt ending, as if the show had been cancelled or something - but given that the beginning was just as out-of-nowhere and abrupt, it seemed kind of fitting. 
 
The story talks about two high school girls, Natsuno Eri and Miyabe Yuko, who find themselves lost in a world inhabited by 'humans' that are barely 2 or 3 feet tall and have the body shapes of marshmallows. The anime literally just starts with them walking around in this world wondering where they are and how they got there, which I think is great; no time is wasted seeing what they were doing before they got there, or how they got there, or anything of the sort. The importance of the story happens in this fantasy world, and ends as soon as they leave. 
 
The same could be said for the two main leads themselves actually, as while you're watching, you don't get the feeling the story is really about them either - they're just sort of there. There's nothing special about them other than the fact that they are three times the size of every other character, and the fact that their personalities are completely polar opposites. Insofar as the anime focuses on their struggles, it's mostly in the daily necessities that the fantasy world is sorely lacking in - bathrooms, sanitary napkins, a change of clothes - you know, the things that are never really addressed all that much in other anime, or any story really, that involves a character being transported to a past-times fantasy setting. 
 
The real importance lies in the inhabitants of the fantasy world, the little people of Belzerg, who are trying to protect their village that's being caught in the middle of a war between two neighboring countries. These are the characters you'll find yourself caring about or hating, and these are the characters that go through trials and epiphanies and realizations by the end through their interactions with each other and the two main leads. 
 
While I was watching the anime, I found myself able to enjoy it that much more after I decided to distance myself a bit from Miyabe and Natsuno and view them the way the little people did - as otherworldy beings with unimaginable powers, unable to empathize with human emotion. That way it made a bit more sense for their personalities to be so extreme, with Natsuno being quiet, uncertain, but trying to be helpful and Miyabe being loud, contrary, and completely uninterested. Even if you do try to put yourself in the girls' shoes though, when you think about it, their actions do still make sense - they don't really get full grasp of how serious these little people are taking their personal dramas and their war, and that their fights aren't just little squabbles but dangerous brawls with real weapons where people do die or get hurt, because the whole situation doesn't feel real to them, especially given the fact that, again, the little people look like baby Teletubbies. 
 
Not to dump on the character designs though; they do look cute, and more importantly individualized, and the art and animation is actually more solid and fluid than you'd expect. I love the bright colors in the anime, and the music is simply breathtaking. The one that stands out the most would be the opening song. It was actually the opening theme I was looking for when I found this anime, as it was what I had remembered most from the Arabic dubbed version I'd seen before. It sounds just as gorgeous in its original Japanese as it did in Arabic, and I advise you to give both a listen even if you don't want to watch the rest of the anime. I actually hadn't planned to either, at the start, but after sampling the first few and continuing to end on a cliff hanger with each episode, I ended up watching the whole thing in two days (when I should have been studying for a midterm too...)

          
 
       Helpful If you quickly pass by Strange Dawn thinking that it’s just a happy little kid’s adventure, then I’m afraid that you’re missing out on some interesting drama and political, bloody battles that are packaged in a simple, yet very unique design. If you’ve ever seen Kaiba or Shadow Star Narutaru, you’d know not to judge an anime by its cover. Strange Dawn is one of those anime—it’s warm and childish on the outside, but thoughtful and serious on the inside. 
 
STORY 
 
At first glance, the story of Strange Dawn doesn’t sound very unique at all. Two high-school girls get sent to another world and are expected to save it; we’ve seen this concept before in popular shows like Fushigi Yugi, Inuyasha, Escaflowne, Magical Girl Rayearth, and so on. However, there is something special about Strange Dawn that really sets itself apart from the others, and that is its setting. Fantasy settings typically possess dragons, demons, magic, and elaborate kingdoms, but not this one. The two girls simply enter the land of the ‘little people,’ which are creatures that closely resemble human dolls. 
 
Right from the very beginning, the girls are caught in a war between two countries, Griania and Baljidan, as they try to gain control over Belzeagle, the place that they end up protecting. Everyone calls them the “Grand Saviors,” but they are merely seen as giants who can be manipulated for power. The girls can hardly believe that these little people are capable of so much chaos and destruction, and it takes a long time for them to grasp the seriousness of the situation. The little people really stab each other, bleed, and die. It’s no children’s game. 
 
The pacing is really slow in the first half, which turns a lot of people off. Most of the time, the characters are just hangin’ around and talking, but I think that this is important for establishing the characters and setting. In the second half, the story takes a giant leap into all the exciting drama and action. There is something horrible happening all of the time, and even the characters that are on the same side are constantly bumping heads. 
 
My only gripe on the story is how it begins and ends. One word: Abrupt. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
Ah, the charm of the series. The little people are packed with so much energy, personality, and drama that you can’t help but love them. We have the quiet and serious leader named Shall who strongly believes in the Grand Saviors, the chief’s daughter named Reca who has strong feelings for Shall, her best friend Mani, Princess Alia, and many more. It’s so much fun to watch them interact, and they have the most adorable character designs ever. 
 
The two human girls, Yuko Miyabe and Eri Natsuno, are complete opposites. Yuko is loud and rude, and she takes no interest in the little people at all. On the flip side, Eri is soft and sympathetic, and she wishes to help them more often. Throughout the series, they angst, complain, and simply wish to return home. They also choose not to participate in most of the little people’s affairs; they just sit by and let bad things happen to them. These things can get annoying sometimes, but it all comes down to the idea that nothing ever feels quite real around them. 
 
I really like how this series portrays their inconveniences, such as having no toilet, no change of underwear, no technology, etc. Anime tend to neglect these kinds of things, so I appreciate that they’re being treated as little important issues here. It makes you wonder how you would also fare in such a place where you don’t have the luxuries of a bathroom, a clothes store, or a McDonalds. 
 
Yuko and Eri aren’t particularly special characters, meaning that they’re ordinary in every sense of the word. That might be boring to you, but I think they’re a nice break from other heroines who typically possess a special power that saves everybody in the end. Yuko and Eri just rely on their normal human strength to pull through hardships. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP song “Sora E” by Eri Kawai is beautiful, and it adds a wonderful atmosphere to the series. It is actually very addicting to listen to, but if that’s not enough, the instrumental version of the same song is played in the middle of every single episode. It’s a great tune, and hopefully you won’t get too tired of hearing it. The rest of the soundtrack is also very good, and it has a warm spot in my little OST collection, but the main theme song clearly stands out above the rest. 
 
OVERALL 
 
Despite that Strange Dawn looks so cute and fluffy, it actually has a pretty serious tone. The series throws away certain clichés that are typically found in ‘girl gets sent to new world’ premises, and the characters are incredibly charming and memorable. I’ll never forget the ‘little people.’ It’s just unfortunate that the series begins and ends so abruptly. Some interesting things that are mentioned are never fully explored, which is why I had to knock off a few points. But despite that, this is a good show. At the very least, listen to the gorgeous OP song.

9,6288,7,8.972512242,A group of people living together,Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer,"In the year 2314 AD, the world is at peace. Thanks to the sacrifices of Celestial Being and its mobile suit pilots, the people of Earth experience a time of prosperity and unity, enjoying tranquil lives once thought impossible. Celestial Being, an organization once painted as villains by the Earth Sphere Federation, now exists in public perception as a group of heroes, celebrated in film and culture. 
 
When an extraterrestrial threat arrives on Earth, threatening the newly acquired calm stasis, Celestial Being springs back into action. Led by ace pilot Setsuna F. Seiei, the Gundam Meisters of the group battle the hostile alien forces, teaming up with old rivals to protect the human race from certain doom. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","Two years after the defeat of the ""Innovators"" and A-Laws, an unknown alien fragment lands on a research station and reactivates it, causing it to head towards Earth. In Celestial Being's Asteroid Base, Ian Vashti greets his wife, Linda, after her 2-year assignment and unloads two new GN Drives and a new incomplete Gundam, the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T]. Saji Crossroad is taking care of Louise Halevy, who is still under medical care in a hospital due to physical changes by the Innovators. Marina Ismail and Shirin Bakhtiar inspect a colony construction facility but their shuttle is attacked by assassins. However Setsuna F. Seiei arrives and destroys them, with Lockon in the cockpit stopping another assassin from killing Marina, afterwards he leaves with Setsuna.
Meanwhile, the Earth Sphere Federation has found the research station heading towards earth and sends out GN-XIV's, led by Andrei Smirnov, to destroy it. Kati Mannequin arrived on board the Celestial Being station with Patrick Colasour and encounter Veda along with its surviving Innovades, now serving the Federation to maintain the mothership. They later meet the newest emerging Innovator, Captain Descartes Shaman. When the probe ship is still heading towards Earth despite being hit by GN missiles, Descartes heads out and pilots the GNMA-Y0002V Gadelaza, successfully destroying the ship, with debris falling to Earth. Soon after, Earth experiences strange events, with electronic vehicles and devices operating on their own. A young girl Amia Lee arrives at her home, only to be attacked by a man (Sky Eclipse) in a space suit.
Billy Katagiri meets with Mehna Carmine to analyze Amia whose body has been partially assimilated with a new metal. They hypothesize that the events occurring are related to the alien metal lifeform, now dubbed the Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS). During this time, Setsuna and Louise's quantum brainwaves give them ominous feelings about upcoming events. Setsuna's concern magnifies when the Ptolemaios crew is unable to contact Allelujah and Marie.
Saji witnesses a blackout in the hospital with Louise. They scream as a man in a spacesuit appears before them. He is about to touch Louise when Setsuna appears and shoots the man's visor, revealing him to be the same type of Innovade as Ribbons Almark. The attacker is only stopped with a plastic explosive. In Mongolia, a traveling Allelujah Haptism and Marie Parfacy are attacked and chased by living technology infected by the ELS. Lockon Stratos arrives in the GN-002RE Gundam Dynames Repair and helps destroy them and brings them back to their mothership, the Ptolemaios.
The same Jupiter research station that had been destroyed reappears and the Celestial Being forces moves to intercept it. Setsuna heads out in the 00 Raiser Condenser Type, along with Lockon in his new Gundam, the Zabanya, and Allelujah, paired with Marie in the Gundam Harute, confront the ELS. Problems began to arise when Setsuna is unable to fight the ELS due to quantum brainwave interference. The 00 Raiser begins to undergo assimilation, however Tieria Erde arrives in the Raphael Gundam and rips out 00 Raiser's infected left arm, allowing Setsuna and the team to escape. Unknown to both the Federation and Ptolemaios crew, the ELS had begun launching its forces from Jupiter's Big Red Spot, sucking in Io and Ganymede.
The Federation forces later travel to Mars in order to discover the ELS's intentions, with Descartes heading out first in the Gadelaza. However most of its ships and Mobile suits were assimilated, and Descartes ends up being assimilated as well, killing him in the process. Celestial Being arrives too late to save the Federation soldiers and engages in battle against the ELS. Setsuna executes Trans-Am Burst in an attempt to communicate with the ELS, theorizing that this is the ""dialogues to come"" that Aeolia Schenberg was conditioning humanity for. Unfortunately, Setsuna falls victim to a mental attack from the ELS and is rendered comatose in the middle of battle. Tieria reveals Raphael Gundam's backpack, GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II, and rips 00 Raiser's cockpit from the frame, handing it to Lockon as Tieria tries to hold off the ELS with his quantum brainwaves. With the ELS surrounding him, Tieria self-destructs his Gundam to take out ELS with him. The Sol Brave Squadron, led by Graham Aker, arrive and help Celestial Being escape. Tieria's conscious mind returns to Veda and Feldt Grace desperately awaits at Setsuna's side to awaken. After the battle, the Ptolemaios crew and the Earth Sphere Federation witness the appearance of a large moon-size ELS, determining that it will arrive at Earth in 92 days.
With most of the civilians being informed of the situation and heading towards shelters, Saji tells Louise that he's going to the Orbital Elevator to help fight the ELS as the last line of defense. On the day of the ELS's arrival, the Federation Fleet gathered alongside Forces from the Federation Members and launch a counterattack against the ELS with a missile barrage, which is rendered futile by the ELS' adapting. Kati, in charge of the operation, orders to fire the ship's main cannon, which damages the ELS superstructure. During this time, Tieria requests that Ian Vashti install a miniature Veda terminal in the cockpit of 00 Qan[T] to handle the massive amounts of information that would result from linking with the ELS again.
The battle begins, many of the Federation's Baikal-class ships are assimilated by the ELS, who subsequently created their own copies of the technology. Zabanya and Harute arrive to assist the ESF and member forces in battle. Despite the much needed backup, the ELS still overwhelms the allied forces and assimilates many ships and Mobile Suits. Andrei Smirnov notices one of the ELS ships heading straight for Earth and self-destructs his GNX to destroy the ELS ship at the cost of his life. Meanwhile, on board the Ptolemaios 2, a still-comatose Setsuna lies in a dream-like state. There, he has visions of the first Lockon, Christina Sierra, and Lichtendahl Tsery. Setsuna then sees the flower that Feldt gave him and finally wakes up with Feldt at his side. He sorties in the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] for battle, while Feldt returns to the bridge.
In battle, Patrick's GN-XIV is hit by an ELS and is slowly assimilated. He prepares to self-destruct before saying goodbyes to Kati, when Setsuna blasts Patrick's GNX, saving him from assimilation. With a large number of ELS appearing, the Harute is eventually assimilated and Allelujah and Marie are forced to eject. Setsuna attempts to communicate with the ELS via the Twin Drive’s quantum effect, but it is to no avail as the ELS constantly thwart Setsuna's attempts. Tieria, now a small hologram inside of the 00 Qan[T], tells Setsuna that Trans-Am is necessary for the dialogues. Graham Aker, now partially assimilated, decides to believe in a better future for humanity and sacrifices himself to create a large hole using Trans-Am, allowing Setsuna to enter the core of the ELS ship. The Battle begins to transform into a massacre with swarms of ELS even attacking the orbital elevator where Saji is working at. After Setsuna establishes contact, he realizes the attack was a misunderstanding as assimilation was their only means to understand humanity. It also revealed that the ELS's original homeworld had been consumed by a red giant star and they began searching the universe for a new home. Along the way they reformed various planets and eventually found a new home, eventually setting out into the vast reaches of space to explore the universe. Through Setsuna's quantum brainwaves, the true intention of the ELS's arrival to Earth was understood, and the battle was halted. Setsuna becomes humanity's liaison and uses the 00 Qan[T] to quantize to the ELS homeworld. The ELS then uses Setsuna's vision of a flower to alter the superstructure of their mother ship, ending the battle.
In a flashback, a much younger Aeolia Schenberg is shown speaking with E. A. Ray (the human base for Ribbons Almark) of his plan, and comments that humanity must unite if they hope to have any chance of reaching the future. Fifty years later, the flower in space is now a deep space station for intergalactic travel, with the ELS now co-existing with humanity. A ship named after Sumeragi is being prepared for travel, being crewed by Innovators. As a news correspondent is talking on camera, a Tieria type Innovade can be seen floating by. In an undisclosed countryside, a blind and older Marina is playing the piano and senses someone entering. He reveals himself as Setsuna, now an ELS/Innovator hybrid, fulfilling his promise to see her again. Setsuna tells a crying Marina that he finally understands her message of peace, and they share an emotional embrace. Outside, an ELS winged 00 Qan[T] covered in flowers emits GN Particles in an angelic fashion.
","Two hours. Two hours gone that I will never again get back. Two hours in which I could have done much better things with my life. Who knows, I could've created the next Flappy Bird clone in that two hours but no, I spent it watching this. So instead, I pass the torch onto you. Recreate Flappy Bird. Don't watch this. 
 
Conceptually, this movie could have been something great. The basic premise, though simple, could have easily been expanded into a whole 'bother season. For the first time in some 30 odd years, the Gundams aren't fighting other humans. They are fighting an alien race. You would think that the creators would have went all out on this idea and made it at least on the same level as the series it's based upon but, alas, failure and disappointment are all that we get. 
 
***Be forewarned, there are some spoilers ahead.*** 
 
To start with, let's get the ""plot"" of the movie out of the way. Four years have passed since the end of season 2 and things are going well for Earth. Peace has pretty much been found and the Gundams, though still around, aren't really needed much anymore. That is, until ""they"" appear. Who are ""they"", you may ask? Yeah, I don't know either. Gray space blobs from Jupiter is what it seems like. Though we will just call them ELS as the movie does for simplicity. Anyway, the ELS appear on a derelict probe that was sent to Jupiter some 100 odd years ago and are headed for Earth. Quantum brainwaves are there goal and where can they find those? In humans, of course! Yada, yada, time goes on and we humans are about to be annihilated. So we fight back. Kinda. Really, it's all about love and understanding our enemy. Seriously, that's about it. Through his mass amounts of love and understanding, Setsuna saves the day and the ELS create a giant flower in space. WTF? 
 
What about the character development, you may be asking? Well, look elsewhere because none will be found here! The only real development is that Feldt suddenly has a burning love for Setsuna. I don't know about you guys but I didn't see that one coming. But then she decides that Setsuna's love is simply too great for any one person. He's just too hot to handle. Other than that, Setsuna goes all flower power on us and turns into some shiny white-haired guy/thing. I hope that's not their idea of what the Innovators should look like. Other than that, everyone else just stays the same. I thought they had some potential with Descartes but nope, they kill him off in the most anti-climactic way. And what's with Meena? Who the heck is she and why is Billy with her? Oh, it's because she has a nice rack and legs, as evidenced by the fan-servicey scenes involving her. 
 
The animation was good though so it's got that goin' for it, which is nice. 
 
Really, I look at this movie in the same way I'm looking at Vladimir Putin of Russia right now. He spent all this money and all this time on the 2014 Sochi Olympics so that the rest of the world would look at Russia in a new light and then he goes and ""invades"" Ukraine. In one single move, he ruined everything he was working towards. And that's what this movie does to the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 series. It takes everything that I found masterful about the original series and smashes it all to bits. 
 
So again, I say to you, save yourself. Save yourself two hours of your life. Flappy Bird must live on and you can save it. Don't make the same mistake I did. Let season 2 be the end of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 for you and pretend this movie doesn't exist. You'll thank me later. 
 
Over and out.

          
 
       Helpful To be very serious in reviewing this movie, I would say this is not at all a gundam series and that falls into several big problems that this series has. 
  
Art; 8 points 
Firstly, the art it is self is great, it is what you would be expecting out of a movie at this time from the Gundam anime industry. It represent a lot about how much the art has developed through time in the Gundam history. However, it is not the best art and graphic you can find from Gundam. Unicorn on the other hand is an OVA series yet, its attention to small details and effects are amazing and flawless. Therefore, in compare to an OVA airs about the same time that has better qualtiy overall, a movie has this level of art cannot receive its full marks. 
 
Sound: 8 points 
The sound effect is solid. It fits the movie really well. 
 
Characters: 5 points 
Even more new characters are being introduced and follow second season's fashion, they are underdeveloped. Some very great characters are presented heroicly but was given less attention;  while other, included even some core characters, are being overexagereated in a very unrealistic way and could not resolves much about them granted extensive time spent on these characters overall.  
 
Story: 3 points 
The worst aspect of this movie is the story. There is no clash between ideals,  the story is very cartoonish and lacks the freshness value that a movie should have had. the untolerable point of this movie is that it has more elements of a super robot movie than a Gundam. Many striking similarities to Fafner can be recognized. The movie has a increasing amount of meta-science elements that leads its collapse at the end due to its conflict with the logical based concept that has always been the core behind any great Gundam series. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 points 
The battles are great as akways but that all it has...again, there are 'supermans flying around destroying everything'  to a point, it becomes very typical. Anyone that dislike beam spamming should be dissappointed watching this movie since this has 10 times more beam spamming than Seed or Destiny ever had and for 90% of the time the Gundams would flying around spaming fangs, bits and beams...again. 
 
The story is the crucial part to a Gundam movie or to any anime series overall since the art quality has been steadily improving in recent time while the level of depth to a story has been long given far less attention than it should really have. In addition, 'Awakening of the Trailblazer's failure to distinct itself as a Gundam series from the super robot series is perhaps its greatest weakness.  
 
Thus, overall, even the beautifully done animtion cannot covers for its easily recognizable weaknesses, so the overall score I can give ti tis 5, average. 
 
To sum up, the series has done very well in the first season but starts to decrease in quality over time while  could not able to meet expectations from experienced old Gundam fans. If you are a new comer to Gundam and you prefer action rather story then 00 may not be a bad place to start with; however, it should be note that even if you watch 00, you can't obtain a throughout understanding of what a Gundam series should be as well as the greatness in the stories of many great old Gundam series. I would highly reccomend any UC series over 00

          
 
       Helpful I had high expectations when I first heard of a gundam movie (although I shouldn't have with the crappy ending of 00) and I was thoroughly disappointed. The artwork and sound were fantastic as you would expect from an anime movie made in 2010 but it couldnt make up for all of its flaws.  
 
Firstly, the story just didnt make any sense and it just seemed like it was trying to push some kind of peace message. The fighting was not very good and somewhat sparse throughout the movie. Honestly, this disappointed me the most as I was looking forward to some badass fighting.  
 
The movie also introduced a lot of characters out of the blue and many for no reason. Also it was odd that everyone from 00 somehow became friends (and lovers...) quite quickly. I found it very weird when random characters were so unexpectedly in love with other ones. 
 
Overall, its an interesting watch but dont go in with your hopes up. Then again I guess we should be used to sunrise by now...

For them, the slaughter in the city is nothing but the perfect ritual sacrifice in order to bring back the Order of the 13 Lances, a group of supermen whose coming would bring the world's destruction. Years later, no one knows if this group of officers succeeded, or whether they lived or died. Few know of their existence, and even those who knew began to pass away as the decades passed. 
 
Now in December in the present day in Suwahara City, Ren Fujii spends his days at the hospital. It has been two months since the incident that brought him to the hospital: a fight with his friend Shirou Yusa where they almost tried to kill each other. He tries to value what he has left to him, but every night he sees the same dream: a guillotine, murderers who hunt people, and the black clothed knights who pursue the murderers. He is desperate to return to his normal, everyday life, but even now he hears Shirou's words: ""Everyone who remains in this city eventually loses their minds.""

In present-day Japan, Ren Fuji is released from the hospital after recovering from a brawl with his friend Shirou, when the Longinus Dreizehn Orden returns.
","Story: Fairly interesting, although incomplete by the last episode. It's not nearly as confusing as people are making it out to be, though I can understand thinking that it's confusing because all of the information simply isn't there. If anything will leave you scratching your head it's the last episode, which concludes ""in the middle of the climax"", as best as I can describe it. It's interesting enough and has some unique concepts, perhaps remnants of the critically acclaimed visual novel. Still, the way it is handled falls short of ""good"", and without the ONA this is clearly an unfinished production.  
 
Art: Once again, fair. It's not a high budget production, and this shows in both the art and the voice acting, but it has its moments. Acceptable.  
 
Sound: The voice acting is overall fairly weak, and the background music doesn't stand out in any particular way. Passable. The guillotine song is kind of cool.  
 
Character: Eh. They're not extremely well developed and come off as pretty generic, but that's fine. Some of the bad guys are interesting.  
 
Enjoyment/Overall: An alright anime. Not something I would recommend you go out of your way to watch, but not a total failure. I will watch the ONA to see if the story gets fleshed out more. There's plenty of better stuff to spend 11 episodes on, though. Be warned that the (Funi?) translation is pretty bad, and kind of ruins a couple of scenes with awkward lines and misunderstandings.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Overall, Dies Irae is not an anime for everyone. Looking through comments before watching the show created doubt and gave me the feeling of searching for the imperfections in the anime. 
 
Beginning with the story, it is very complex. There are many different stories from different perspectives of characters that are followed and all intertwine with each other, however, it all surprisingly fits together. I have watched close to mid 200s, maybe even 300 series and it required quite a bit of attention to detail to fully understand the show. If you can follow along with stories well, and create sense out of it, then I definitely recommend this show. If anything, I wouldn't recommend comparing this anime to others due to its diversity. 
 
Both the art and sound were very good. Battles were enjoyable to watch, and sounds fit in perfectly with the art. 
 
Character development through the show is on the higher end. I enjoyed how more and more is known about the characters as the anime progressed. The main characters all had great development and the explanation of the characters by Kraft explained a lot. There were unnecessary development of side characters, which did add some confusion to the overall story, but it did help in understanding intentions. 
 
To sum things up, Dies Irae is a really controversial anime in the way that it touches on Nazi topics and is very complex in itself. Do not let the low rating of the anime discourage you to watch it though. If you want to see if this is a good anime for you, I'd recommend watching around 3 to 5 episodes, not including episode 0. Really hoping for a second season for this anime to see what happens after the ending and just to see what happens with everything in general.

          
 
       Helpful Dies Irae is actually not as confusing as everyone says. In fact, I find it very smart. Many things are not directly told but if you have watched enough anime you will be able to grasp the situation of what is going on.  
 
Although the themes and genre are typical, the execution of these ideas are brought in a dark and sometimes gory atmosphere which supports it really well. 
 
The characters are really unique and are over powered in their own ways which makes it really interesting to watch. However I agree with most people that there is not enough development and makes them see a lot like only supporting characters. 
 
S0me scenes are kind of awkward especially with the soundtrack that is not always fitting, but nevertheless it was a good watch.

","Story 6: 
 
The storyline of ""Asura Cryin' "" happens to be one that has a lot of detail and a lot of planning to it. However, it is one of those storylines that as good as it might be, was definatly not executed to the best ability. On top of this, there are a few things that one should know before they watch the anime. 
 
One of the things that is problematic is that the storyling does not flow well, there are constant flashbacks, and important details that help the anime to run are revealed at intervals that are not always the best time for them to come into play. 
 
Another thing is some of the humor that is crammed into the storyline. While some of the humor is actually funny, some of it is not that funny, or it happens to be put in at the wrong time, or the humor is not needed for the story to run along. Some of the humor is sex related. 
 
Another thing is, ""Asura Cryin' "" is not really about the occult, and not really about the church. It is really a fantasy version of the two, where magic, demons, and mechas exist. Yes, I said mecha... technollogy actually plays a big role in this, which was not something I was expecting. But the way they work together is a nice asspect, however, not exactly executed to the best ability. 
 
Art: 7 
 
I may be the only one, but I was in a way disturbed that two of the male characters had a bang of hair that was longer then the rest of their hair, like double the length, if not more. The art work, which is beuatiful, had been given a down trodding by such things as this that just don't seem in place, or they have a wierd effect. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The sound on this is supreme. The opening and ending is beuatifully done, not to mention that the voice actors are fairly good. The sound effects also work into it well. 
 
Character: 9 
 
Another strong point in ""Asura Cryin' "" is the numbers of different characters that are within the work, and the depth that has gone into them. Problem is, we only get a glimpse of them overall. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
I had to say I enjoyied the anime for it's relativly neat ideas and concepts here, though I was disapointed by the way the storyline was executed, it seemed sporadic and disconjealed. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
This Anime is definatly not going to be for everyone. As stated above, it will have it's problems. But if one overlooks, or is even forewarned about the storylines... ddity... they might be able to get through it.

          
 
       Helpful Asura Cryin is a series that seems to be about ghosts... but then turns into a story about mechs and humanoid demons. It is a combination of comedy/mystery/action/mech. I originally jumped on this series due to some fairly interesting teasers and good OP/ED. However, the series seems to hide everything from the viewer to the extent that I ended up confused after each episode. The character development seems half-hearted and the story, though eventually interesting, is cryptic for the majority of the show. If you have a short patience, this isn't your show. 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is fairly good throughout. Colors are vivid, effects are of good quality, and characters are well drawn, though I don't know how being a demon entails multiple eye colors... Sadly, all the mech scenes, and a significant part of the fx, are done with CG, and not in a good way. It is used enough that it seemed to be a huge cost-cutting measure. 
 
Sound: 
The OP and ED were above average with an electro based OP and eerily dark ED. The bgm is average but decent. The only VA that stands out here is Misao. I didn't find anyone that outstanding. I was also wondering why one of the girls is like monotone all the time (explained near the end of the show). 
 
Music: 4/5, VA: 3/5 
 
Story: 
Asura Cryin seems to merge verbally-named special attacks from  with the random appearing mech aspect of Kyoshiro and a ghost/apparition aspect of . The combination of so many disparate bases doesn't mix very well, yielding an angry fruit salad based product that is anything but smooth. 
 
There are constantly mysterious themes that repeat throughout the show that are either only explained near the very end or (for the most part) are totally unanswered. It was very displeasing to finish the show and still have no idea what the majority of the show was about. The only consoling aspect is the fact that there will be a second season. The second season does yield more dividends, see that review for more details. 
 
Character: 
The characters feel very underdeveloped in this series, mostly since additional background will be given in the second season. For this series, much of the characters pasts are completely unknown and the rare flashbacks that the series provides tends to beget even more questions. The lack of story focus carries on here as well as numerous secondary characters appear, play a significant role in a single instance, and then join the gang and from that point onwards play a minor role (until maybe the second season?). Regardless, it was difficult balancing so many seemingly unimportant characters. 
 
Value: 
There are some humorous moments, some occurrences that are just wrong, a bit of fan service, and a few relaxing moments. However, the majority of this series can be described as chaotic and anything but normal slice of life. It tries to bolt on too many features to the extent that none of the characteristics stand out in the end.

After i posted my 1st review and after discussing it with several people in forums,they told me i should definitely watch the follow up as soon as possible..They told me i would be astonished and that it would knock my socks off..And it did if i'm honest but not for the reasons you might think..So let's cue the music. 
Now i have to say that this season was better and before you stop reading and call a doctor hear me out cause what made this season better was also what made it equally worse to the 1st one in many many ways. 
 
And we start with the most obvious issue..The anime itself..You see it's all nice and dandy wanting to make something better but it's how you're gonna do it that matters the most,that is called common sense..But i don't think the writers and the studio had the luxury of common sense since the 1st season was a total failure of a thing,so they had to do some drastic changes.. 
 
And boy did they do some drasticery(yes i know grammar nazi's)indeed and they went berserk..So say you made an anime that was all about a love triangle fest with some weird shit in it such as super powers..And that didn't pan out so well...What you do is take the same anime and apply what i'd like to call THE STALLONE FORMULA. 
 
Now this formula is able to make an anime go butch with tons of action and tons and tons of adrenaline pumped chicks wreacking havoc in the town..And this is exactly the problem with this season..The direction it took is another anime altogether..It's like taking an anime like Ghost in the Shell and making it about Major Kusanagi going to high school with her friends,then making a music club,forming a band and then....BOOF..You have K-on on anti depressants. 
 
Who in their right mind would give the green light to such a preposterous idea?Well someone thought that this transition was cool and crisp and funded the damn thing..Ok how is this for an idea?Our shy,screaming when wind was blowing in her hair and sending EM waves that could kill aliens in space is now a super spy driving a Mustang....Or rather this is anime so for copyright reasons it's now a Fustag maybe?! with a suit and a side kick and is part of an organization that helps poor power users from being kidnapped by an evil organization..This makes no sense whatsoever. 
 
And i know you might say this is a good thing..This thing packs more action in the first 2 mins than the entire 1st season and it's set 5 yrs after the events of Code-E...Yes indeed but do you really want me to believe that in 5 yrs time the scaredy cat went all Cat Woman?Where's the damn continuity?As a stand alone anime yes it would work to some extent but even then it still has so many issues i don't think the internet is big enough to list them all. 
 
This was extreme change to say the least and i feel there were 1 or 2 season material that could fit between the 1st and the 2nd season. 
 
Another problem would be the inability of the writers to just stick with one plotline..There are sub-plots and loose ends left lying all over the place..There are more plot holes in here than pot holes in the streets of Africa and as for the ending it's more rushed than having sex with me.It doesn't take all that long,i should know.. 
 
It also failed to conclude such major points such as what happens to Milis or Chinami's and Kotaro’s ""relationship""..We don't even see Sonomi’s husband and kids.As for Yuma?Well she gets all 5 mins of screen time...And as for her significant other,he's showing up for a total of 5 secs in the last episode..Oh there's also a villain again that shows up at the last episode and then-again like the 1st season-disappears.. 
 
Problems this season then is awash once again but it's a better deal than the 1st one..Mind you that doesn't say much cause My Little Pony is better than the first one..Having a kidney replacement surgery in a run down ""clinic"" in Mexico is better,catching your wife doing the 2 headed beast with a horse is better...In fact i think even the last Star Wars is better...Nah fuck that it was utter bullshit. 
 
So like i said,as a stand-alone anime maybe it would work if it was more polished and introduced its' ideas in a more believable way.In fact there are many anime out there with almost the same basic idea but done a lot lot better and i'd highly recommend you watch one of those series rather than wasting time like i did...And know what?I think you haven't thanked me at all for my self sacrifice..I think you should..Contact my agent in order to obtain my bank account number and send me lots of money to support my drinking habits. 


          
 
       Helpful Mission-E wears its heart on its sleeve.  From the opening sequence, one sees female superhero figures with character models that appear to have been inspired by Bubblegum Crisis.  The story reveals that these heroines don't just wear high-tech suits, they also have minor electricity-related superpowers, possibly inspired by the paper-related powers of Read Or Die. 
 
The voices are decent, the art is pleasant, the story is well within the bounds of what one might expect of a superhero technothriller.  The realism level seems to be about on par with an old James Bond movie. 
 
The ending sequence is not as well-animated as the rest of the series, and starting at episode 3, the ending song is remixed to sound as if it had been sung by badly-programmed computers.   
 
I plan to watch all available episodes.  This is solid, crowd-pleasing entertainment.  On the downside, I doubt that there will be any major innovations or artistic originality.

          
 
       Helpful I watched ""Code-E"" first, it was meh romance with a bit of fantastics, so when i saw the poster with Chinami and some other girls in superhero suits, i almost laught thinking that it should be another stupid action. 
But it turned out that the series are good and even better than the previous ones. In Code-E, Brinbergs' topic was the most stupid thing, but here you should enjoy parts where Melissa and Adol appear. It was an interesting step from comedy to drama. 
One more interesting thing is how Ma-chan takes Chinami. Chinami is chatting, Maori silently looks at her and we understand how naive and careless our ex-protagonist is, and it even irritates. 
Story is interesting, but there are still some points that are not clear even after watching all the episodes. 
Art is ok but the colours are worse than in Code-E. 
And there is action and fights in superhero suits, i don't like that sort of action, but maybe you'll enjoy it 
Overall, 6/10 because it is not great but rather pleasant. Did you forget that 6 is a good mark too?

Little incongruities that occur around these nine eventually lead to a larger, unimaginable event that may alter what is considered common sense in this world.
","I really don't write reviews, but I felt like this show in particular deserved one considering the response it has gotten from most people in the community.  
 
Occultic;Nine, for lack of a better word, was a total mindfuck through and through. I almost dropped this anime after the 1st episode because of how ""all over the place"" it was. But after discovering that they squeezed an entire volume+ into the one episode, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, it actually became significantly better right from the 2nd episode on.  
 
The mystery just kept getting thicker with each episode, the supernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery.  
 
Now as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least. The show being a 12 ep season did not do the story justice, and the rapid dialogue didn't help it either. There were many times where I was genuinely lost in the story because I had no idea what was going on, and at first, I thought the reason for the fast-paced talking was to make the characters come off as more intelligent than they really were (cuz we all know when you spout facts out really quickly, you're basically a genius). It wasn't until towards the end that I realized that the production team was going balls deep to try and fit in all this plot and development into the few episodes that they had... 
 
This is by far the biggest complaint for many viewers, but for me, it honestly did not bother that much. The whole reason for this review is to give credit where credit is due.  
 
This anime had great character design, art, atmosphere, and sound. I appreciated all these elements despite having to deal with a ""rushed"" story. I completely see why people are disappointed. A lot of questions were left unanswered, our main character didn't get the happy ending some of us were expecting (especially after seeing how convenient the final episode was laying it out to be), and the potential for an incredible mystery was somewhat lost in order to speed up the story.  
 
For me, I really enjoyed this anime to the end. I personally didn't find the final episode to be confusing at all. Instead, I thought it to be one of the easiest episodes to understand, and a perfect way to tie any major plot points that confused me. Sure the pace could have been much better with more episodes, but sometimes those things may be out of your control, and perhaps they have some sort of plan in mind if they were able to continue this story.  
 
Overall I give this an 8/10. Many see this anime as a big let down, but I want to see it as an anime with the potential to provide one amazing story. It has its flaws, but I feel they're already stepping in the right direction. 

          
 
       Helpful With the legacy of Steins;Gate behind it and a multitude of very polarized reviews, I fully expected Occultic;Nine to be one of those extremely metaphorical anime with a unique, nontraditional narrative that a lot of people just don't ""get.""  
 
I'm fully aware of how pretentious that sounds, but not enjoying those anime isn't a bad thing in my opinion, it's just a different method of storytelling that works for some and doesn't work for others. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is not one of those. What Occultic;Nine lacks in genuine symbolism and unique storytelling, it attempts to make up for with implausible pseudosciences, plot contrivances, unnecessary (and subsequently abandoned) plot threads, and what may possibly be the most abhorrent pacing and plot decisions I've seen in an anime in a very long time.  
 
-Story: 4/10  
 
It starts out good enough, with an interesting cast and genuinely intriguing mysteries. Though the pacing starts out as bad as it ends, I actually initially found myself drawn to the breakneck conversation speed and scene-to-scene transitions. It meant that every second of this anime was important, and there would be virtually no filler or fluff content. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine actually managed to teach just how important filler content can be, even in a 12-episode anime.  
 
It really wouldn't be wrong to classify this anime as only one, really long exposition dump. Even in important action scenes, there's nonstop explanation coupled with the distracting visuals. The longer the anime runs for, the weaker and weaker the actual plot becomes. Whereas Steins;Gate devoted a large portion of its runtime to making its science at the very least plausible within the unique constraints of its universe, Occultic;Nine quite literally gave the impression of making things up as it went along. The premise seems to promise a unique, ambiguous debate between the scientific and the occult, but in reality the show is more or less ""made up science with a few  unimportant urban legends thrown in for good measure."" 
 
Subplots seem to come and the disappear as quickly as they were launched into the show.  Though the anime does attempt to explain the driving forces behind the main plot, it still leaves an offensive amount of unanswered questions and unresolved character plots. Also, in the midst of its ""explanation"", several points of the plot hinge on what can only be called contrivances. Contrivances that go far beyond Deus Ex Machina and enter the territory of ""the writers honestly had no idea how to fix this mess so they just made the solution appear out of thin air.""  
 
All in all, the terribly paced and inconsistent storyline culminated in an ultimately unsatisfying ending that didn't leave me wanting more, and instead just made me relieved it was finally over. I wasn't left with a desire to learn more about the characters or the world of Occultic;Nine, I was instead left frustrated and annoyed at the lack of basic storytelling integrity present all throughout this anime.  
 
-Art: 6/10 
 
Though the animation and character designs are nice enough, there's often a complete disconnection between what's happening visually, and what's being said. Normally, you'd expect dialogue to frame a scene and interesting visuals used to make an otherwise boring-but-necessary conversation fun to watch, but Occultic;Nine fails in all aspects, quite miserably I may add. Exposition dumps are accessorized with awkward, disjointed camera angles and extremely forced perspective that makes the rapid expositioning even more difficult to listen to. The further you get into the show, the more its predictable and amateur visuals blend together and the easier it gets to completely tune out, which given the sheer amount of exposition present in any given scene, is not a good thing.  
 
-Sound: 7/10 
 
Probably my highest point of compliment, which is... sad. The opening and ending are nice enough as standalone songs and the OST does a fine job of creating the right atmosphere throughout the anime. Unfortunately, though, no tracks particularly stood out as breakout or iconic works. Good, but ultimately forgettable.  
 
-Character: 4/10 
 
This is probably where the anime falls short the most. Right away the anime introduces us to not only the main cast, but several minor characters as well.  The rapidfire pacing is what makes it possible to fully introduce so many characters at once,  but despite the information overload, only a handful of these characters actually end up being necessary. Major characters start out with important subplots that lead nowhere, and minor characters are given last-minute evolutions to major players in the events of the story. Altogether though, there is virtually no character development. The show ends with virtually the same cast it began with. This is due largely to so many characters getting very little screentime, with several of the 'major' characters getting maybe 3-5 scenes of important dialogue in the entire anime. The cast is largely held together by a few inconsequential character traits with little to no depth, which is rather unfortunate given their admittedly very interesting designs.  
 
-Enjoyment: 4/10 
 
If you're a longtime fan of anime, then you should know that sometimes even a bad storyline and bad characters aren't always dealbreakers. Despite everything, sometimes a show just has a certain spark, an appeal that makes it enjoyable even though by all means it shouldn't be. I was desperately looking for that piece of Occultic;Nine throughout its entire run. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted it to be a good anime. But, unfortunately (I've certainly used that word a lot), it almost totally lacked enjoyability for me. It isn't even good in a ""so bad its good"" kind of way. Sure, there are a lot of very laughable plot points, but altogether, it hardly stands as something you can use to just pass the time. 

          
 
       Helpful First off, I'd just like to say that for me at least the art was one of the best parts of this show. It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots. 
 
The characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though. 
 
The story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacing is slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it. 
 
For me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again. Maybe I'm just not a fast enough reader, but anyways. 
 
Overall a pretty engaging show if you don't drop it after the first few episodes because of the pacing and the speed of the talking.

9,36904,12,8.083436034,A group of people living together,Aggressive Retsuko (ONA),"Some offices have stereotypical dynamics: the chauvinistic pig of a boss who never does any real work; the employees whose goal is to suck up to the boss; the ones whose lives seem perfect; and the individuals who have all the actual work pushed onto them. Retsuko the red panda is in the last group, as she stays late most nights to make up the work her coworkers are too lazy to do themselves. 
 
Her relief from the stress of her everyday life comes in the form of singing death metal at a local karaoke club. Night after night, Retsuko channels her grief into a microphone and considers the place to be her own personal sanctuary. But as she moves further away from her comfort zone and the ideas people have of her, she discovers that letting others into her world of death metal may not be such a bad thing. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Retsuko is a 25-year old and single anthropomorphic red panda, working in the accounting department of a Japanese trading firm, trying her best to navigate through the typical problems encountered by young adults in 21st century Japan. Facing constant frustration every day from pushy superiors and co-workers, Retsuko lets out her emotions by going to a karaoke bar every night and singing death metal. After five years of working the daily grind, Retsuko's misery causes her to undergo a series of events that puts her job in jeopardy, forcing her to shift her relationships with her co-workers and ends up changing her life in unexpected ways. After this, she continues to come up with ways to find happiness, and eventually comes to the conclusion that she would one day like to get married and raise a family. Unfortunately, her social anxiety combined with her na?veté often causes her to get into far more trouble than she expects while pursuing her dreams. Beginning with Season 4, the show focuses less on Retsuko as the protagonist and more on her colleagues at the office, each with their own unique set of problems. In the upcoming Season 5, the show will mainly focus on Retsuko being involved with the Japanese government along with Haida's life after quitting his office job.

Aggressive Retsuko or Aggretsuko is a 10 episode net animated series mostly adapted from the 100 episode short series both of which were written and directed by Rarecho and produced by Fanworks. The story is centered around a red panda named Retsuko 烈子 (which hilariously means ""angry kid"") and her stressful daily life as a Japanese office worker. 
 
Retsuko spends her day dealing with busybody coworkers, unappreciative superiors, and struggling to pay the bills. When things build up too much she lets off steam by taking a trip to the local karaoke bar to revel in her true passion. Death Metal. 
 
It's a silly show with a silly premise but the execution here absolutely blew me away. The show follows a semi-arcing narrative with a general plot or reoccurring characters that establish continuity, but generally spaces it's 15 minute episode block with short scene comedy. The short blocking was certainly a good choice for the show as it by no means overstayed its welcome and left me dying for more by the end of episode 10.  
 
The art design is chibi, cute, and simple owing to Retsuko's origins as a character from Sanrio (a mascot company). All of the characters are animals and it gives the world a very Zootopia vibe that appeals to degenerates like myself. 
 
Character designs were great here. Every character served their purpose and most characters given more than a few minutes of run-time proved themselves much more complex than one-note gags. This coupled with the incredible sound design and musical ques unified to make a real addictive experience.  
 
I CONSUMED this show. I watched the whole thing on a whim with a friend and we both loved it. Unfortunately because of that and because I watched Perfect Blue almost immediately after this show I forgot to write a review until recently. Aggressive Retsuko is a concise and enjoyable experience and by being so compact even if it's not totally your jam like it was for me you are doing yourself a disservice by not having viewed it.

I am actually shocked with how this show, with the most childish art and animation style, is one of the greatest anime I had seen which tackles mature and relatable to adult struggles and in an office in particular. 
 
We see how the main character, Retsuko, a red panda who is frustrated with how her life turned out to be and how it is like in an office where she is fed up and looks for ways to avoid that alongside stereotypical office people you will end up meeting. I am shocked Sanrio approved this and it is probably their best move since Hello Kitty, I will explain why and as short as possible. 
 
This wonderful anime has all characters which one can relate to, and we haven't seen an anime like this in a long time and its charm hooked viewers like me who wouldn't even give this a shot just by looking at it, but I just happened to see this in Netflix. 
 
The musical number towards the end and the overall love for heavy metal is just amazing and symbolic plus memorable and this anime is on my mind after completing this, I love it so much. It also helps us, the viewers, get to understand how adult life is going to be and how much we are going to struggle when you reach that point in life. For me, I am glad it stick to this sort of art since it helped me understand that it is okay, and not everyone is a jerk, there are nice people there who are considerate like Mr. Tone and we see his nice side. 
 
The romance between Haida and Retsuko is amazing, I like how pure Haida  
 and it is just beautiful at how he is the most mature anime protagonist you will see in a long time, plus Fenneko who is Retsuko's friend is also looking after them both with a nice romance with no drama or complications, just simple, mature adult love romance which is something pretty fresh into anime now. 
 
Overall, this is one of my favorites, it is short and charming yet beautiful and had left a strong impact on me, I love that bird and gorilla so much and glad they got a lot of screen time. I will watch this again, it also has a strong re-watch value. Praying for a second season.

I feel that because I watched the English translation and did not watch the original, which may have contained more memes and references to the stereotypical Japanese office life, I didn't get the full experience. The show is probably a notch or two better than I really think it is for Japanese people watching the Japanese version, so take this review with a grain of salt. 
 
But anyway. 
 
Aggretsuko is a series that manages to blend a few flavors of humor together into a great little office comedy. It's very light hearted, and doesn't really explore any dark themes, but that's okay. There are quite a few moments that show shockingly deep insight into the depressing reality that is the adult world, and I as fellow member of that same corporate lifestyle related to it A LOT. That is what kept me going through the series despite a number of slow/lame moments that detracted from the experience. 
 
I didn't know how to rate the story of the show, because there isn't really a story. Aggretsuko is I guess what you would call a slice of life, and what made it interesting was the characters. Retsuko herself was a particularly good character not because of her special traits, but because of how average she was. There was something very realistic about her laziness and lack of direction in life that made her seem like a regular person. I also felt this way about Haida, who almost seems like he could represent just about anyone who lacks the guts to go for what he wants. Instead of drinking for stress relief, like most other people, she screams death metal at a karaoke bar every night. That was a nice touch, but didn't really have anything to do with the show's main themes. 
 
Other characters, like Fenneko and Resasuko were great representations/parodies of other weird traits you see quite often in people -- social media induced psychopathy and ""braindeadedness"", respectively. The way that the writers brought these weird phenomena into the show was spot-on, and really brought a smile to my face. 
 
Although I didn't give the show a killer rating, I highly recommend checking it out if you want a show that is pleasant and light-hearted but not afraid to take a few jabs at the bleakness of being a low-level employee in the corporate world. It's fun, has an interesting soundtrack, and definitely has its moments.

","Well directly to the point, I'm fan of the Visual Novel, so the animation of it story was happiness at my ears, but facing the reality of it, this what we got, so read carefully if you intent to see this anime: 
 
.-Pros: Story created by Sprite, the ones that did KoiChoco, so you can expect a good tale. 
The animation and sounds are from the very visual novel originality, that brings so much life to the story, characters and flow that are based on it so the material to see is very great.  
Gags and story balanced so the flow of the seriousness and laugh don't opaque each other. 
 
.-Cons: Unfortunately, they have so much material to work and they didn't make a good summary of the story itself, you can never expect to have all in one anime, that happens to manga and light novels, too with their animations, but this was even perceived by the ones that didn't played the VN. 
 
>The first bad point is the overwhelming blending of the situations that mark the story. The protagonist is replaced by the heroines in the situations/flags/gags, so the heroines can show up their evolution as a team and friends, no so bad but this happens all the way until the end. 
 
>Second bad point is the result of the first, the supposed protagonist is now a super shadow support character, and a very useless one, but losing him means more than a lack of 1 character; this broke some of the bridges of the story to grow and feel the plot itself, so at the end, we didn't have a real end and less the true end, that could have given the anime a second season. 
 
>Third and last, real situations/flags/gags changed by Fan Service. 
 
My recommendation, if you don't have nothing to see or maybe you want something to distract you, this could help. On contrary, if you seek for a good story, the anime is not my recommendation, play the VN if you can.

          
 
       Helpful This was an anime that anyone who watched the first 2 episodes would have expected to be bad. I, for example, did not have high hopes. My girlfriend and I decided to watch it weekly as she was very excited about it and after the second episode, I wanted stop. At that point there was nothing overtly impressive about the show other than maybe the art, of which I felt at the time was wasted on a story like this. I whined to her about how the artistic world(island) it took place in looked so stunning, and it was wasted on this random anime. If I were to have rated this anime after the first two episodes, I probably would of given it a 4. 
 
But, having finished the whole thing(to meet my special other's demands), I have to say, I have no regrets. I can even go back to the first two episodes and enjoy them now. This anime is genuinely good, it won't seem it at first, but once the story picks up, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The concept is actually very interesting and unique, the art is fantastic, and the story, while a little predictable, is very compelling. If you are out of ""MUST WATCH"" animes at the moment, I fullheartedly recommend this one.

The sound had nothing wrong. It fused with it vey well especially when they are in a dog fight! The voice actress and actor had a nice voice. It's very clear.The sound of the sea breeze and the wind is quite spot on when putting on earphones which is quite good. 
 
Design and graphics: 
A lot of kawai school girls with their newly designed outfit for competition and it's quite catchy XD.Graphics are impressive of the waves and the character's expression of how serious they are during competition so there's nothing wrong with it.

Not that it is entirely bad, I have enjoyed watching it, but if someone asked me what I think about it, “lame” would be a perfect word. 
 
Lameness begins with storyline. It is the most generic dystopian future storyline that you could think of. 
Mankind has split into groups of two: elite, who live in ultra sterile futuristic Eden, and working class who live in the wasteland. 
 
While I think it is accurate vision of the future or even depiction of the present day (we already are divided by where we live, where we eat, relax, etc), I can’t help but find it boring. 
Boredom begins because now we have very clear distinction of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. I wish we would see this movie from one side only. Like, if we only saw elite, bad guys and good guys could shown opposite and thus a chance for a nice plot twist. 
 
However it is not the case and everything is as predictable as it gets. You know exactly what is going to happen in the end. Maybe not the details, but on the large scale, everything is clear from the very start. 
 
Characters are also really lame. I couldn’t care less about any of them, except maybe some secondary guys who are way more sympathetic than the main guys! 
Main characters are blank, uninspired, generic and boring. 
 
Music is … I don’t remember it. It is there, but always somewhere in the background. 
 
However there are some positive things I can say about this one: wasteland is really cool, more time and character development in there could have created nice Mad Max atmosphere. 
 
Eden invasion was a tribute to Death Star invasion and I always love references and tributes. Too bad I don’t really like Star Wars. 
 
Other than that, it is an mediocre sci-fi movie with nice animation, boring characters and decent story line. 
 
Some extra points for me wishing to look at the sky more often after watching this.

       Helpful First and foremost, do not expect an action movie, as this movie is more a drama with action scenes here and there. 
 
As a disclaimer, I'd like to say this is my first time reviewing a movie/anime, and I watched the movie dubbed cuz I didn't want to bother myself with reading subtitles. 
 
The setting is pretty straightforward, a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where resources are waning away, and society is split between 2 classes: the elite dictatorship-like rule (the politics of the society is not explored) and the ""diggers"" who as the name suggest, make sure the elite living in the city ""Ecoban"" are getting the resources they need. 
The story shoots off explaining exactly that. A machine failure occurs, and the manager asks the officer to halt all work so the workers will not be harmed. As the officer (non-surprisingly) refuses, the manager threatens with a strike, following the officer kicking him and shooting him for his non-compliance. 
 
Characters 6 
The Characters are pretty basic. A  caring though badass protagonist, the security force is brutal, and there's always that one kind-hearted  officer among them. The diggers are the stereotypical ""Ghetto""  people, though they are not very explored. Workers, rioters and criminals, as one would expect from a ghetto full of downtrodden people. 
The protagonist is pretty developed and his character is revealed pretty quickly, though the characters around him have development that pretty fits an hour long movie. 
I wouldn't say they are too interesting, they are just there to keep the story going. 
 
Story 7-8 
As for the story itself, I'd give it a 6-ish. It's a basic story of rebellion against an elite. What I very liked about it is the pacing and how they build it to come to the climax. For an action movie (which it is not) the pacing is slow, but for a drama it is fitting very well, which is why I give it a 7-8. This is where the characters' purpose comes in, as they themselves are not all amazing, but they give the story a good ""flow"" 
 
Graphics 10 
Nothing to say. Great application of CGI with animation, this movie is beautiful. 
 
Soundtrack 9 
The sound design of the movie is great. The scenes aren't packed with ambient sounds to compliment the setting, but keep it natural. The music is employed very well to deliver the mood shown in the scenes.  
In the English dub some of the voice-acting is pretty mediocre. The protagonists is well depicted, as some other characters, but overall it is not that great. 
Overall it's a 9 for me regarding soundtrack. 
 
To sum it all up, it is a great movie in my eyes if you want a chill afternoon or before bed movie. I loved it and do recommend to try it out. 
 
It's an overall 8.5 for me.

Manjiro makes a living helping the people of the troubled capital city, but behind the scenes, he also works in secret to take back precious belongings stolen from the people by unjust political powers and conspiratorial menaces. The people call him ""Get-backer Roman."" 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Historical', 'Fantasy']","The story takes place in Kyoto in the late 19th century. Manjiro has two faces—during the day, he works as a helper for people in Kyoto, but he also acts in secret to return people's property that has been stolen from corrupt men in power. As the retriever ""Roman"", Manjiro is getting involved in a nationwide conspiracy.
","When I first read about Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman I was excited at the thought of a new show based on the works of Lupin the Third creator, Monkey Punch.  Then I saw that it was based off of a Pachinko game and my expectations immediately soured.  By reading a synopsis one might even think that this show would be a Lupin ripoff, what with the main character Roman also being a descendent of a known thief, however, that doesn't turn out to be the case either. 
 
Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman tells the story of a man named Roman who goes by Manjiro in order to hide his identity while working as a helper in 19th century Kyoto.  Yes, that's his occupation.  He helps people.  As you can probably guess, this leaves both he and his sister struggling to make a living.  By night, however, Roman behaves like Robin Hood and steals from the wealthy to give it to the poor (and never taking any money for himself, despite him also being very poor.)  He also has a magic suit that turns him into a sentai hero and a team that aids him, made up of his sister, a priestess, a perverted old man and a German who makes zombies.  If that sounds like a big jumble, well, it is.  To make things more confusing, though, the story isn't even remotely concerned with him being a thief outside of the first few episodes, as the story tries it's hand at questionable political intrigue headed up by a laughable main villain. 
 
That being said, the story does actually get more interesting later on, which somewhat makes up for the inconsistent comedy of the first few episodes.  There are even some fairly decent dramatic moments every now and again.  All in all, the story is a very mixed bag, with a final episode that is completely out of place because of the clumsily used anachronisms on display.  Still, there's more going on plot-wise than it would appear, although the standalone episodes can grate a bit. 
 
As far as the art goes, it isn't really anything special.  The characters all have that distinctive Monkey Punch style, but they aren't particularly good-looking.  It's obvious that the show's art was done on a small budget as it looks more like a year-round Toei show than a thirteen episode series probably should.  It's not offensively bad-looking or anything, it's all just bland outside of the character designs.  Still, the animation isn't terrible and the show is artistically consistent at the very least.  Worth special mention, however, is Roman's sister's dog.  This dog is drawn in a way that seems like the responsible artists weren't entirely sure what dogs actually looked like.  Its eyes are too human and it doesn't appear to have teeth, nor does it move like a dog, which is quite creepy. 
 
Sound-wise the show fairs much better.  The cast is headed up by vets like Nakai Kazuya and Kitamura Eri, who bring both Roman and his sister Koharu to life effectively.  Also worth mentioning is Uchida Maaya, who does an excellent job as the courtesan Okuni.  The rest of the cast is also very good, with a lot of strong performances across the board, although some Engrish singing that pops up later in the series sounds strange to say the least.  The music isn't particularly memorable, either, but it gets the job done adequately enough. 
 
The character's themselves aren't particularly impressive, either.  Roman is your standard hero who always wants to help and/or save every one simply because he's a friend of justice, although he does have a surprising (considering the nature of the show) bit of character development.  His sister Koharu spends most of her screen-time complaining to her brother because of his lack of income and gambling, so she doesn't really do much.  There's a priestess named Kanade who helps Roman out, although she doesn't really have much too her.  She's mostly there to act like a ninja and get ogled by an old genre stand-by; the perverted old man.  The old man, Gennai, can mostly be described as ""stock"", as he acts kooky and constantly stares at Koharu and Kanade.  He also builds various machines, vehicles, and robots, because this is anime and it needs robots for some reason.  The last member of Roman's team is a German scientist named Dr. Hans who makes zombies who also help the team out.  He seems to be there simply for a weird factor and he speaks Japanese very strangely because he's foreign.  The main cast is rounded out by a mysterious law enforcement agent named Magoichi, and the courtesan Okuni, who gets the most character development.  She also seems a lot like a famous comic book character, whom you'll immediately think of as there are some extreme similarities between the two.  Overall, the character's aren't terrible, but they aren't particularly likeable either, although at the same time, they don't grate. 
 
Despite the shows shortcomings, it's pretty watchable.  You won't ever be on the edge of your seat or anything, but there are definitely worse shows to watch.  I'd say that the best way to sum the show up would be, ""light, yet forgettable.""  The show lacks a consistent tone, jumping from comedy, to drama, to action, to confusing alternate history.  The climax is also pretty bewilderingly stupid, along with the main bad guy's motivation making literally no sense whatsoever.  If you really like shows set in pre-Industrialized Japan with a lot of anachronistic technology, you might get some enjoyment out of Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman, but your time is probably better spent elsewhere, unless you really want to hear Nakai Kazuya do something other than a tough guy or Uchida Maaya showing her impressive range.

          
 
       Helpful One of the things about the Crack Fic Genre is that it can be touch and go on how successful the work is at pushing ones willing suspense of disbelief. Many times the work takes the believability issues to far and instead ends up grating on the nerves. This particular Anime though actually doesn't push to far and the stretching of believability is used well for comedic effect. This is what drew me into Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman in the first episode as well as the historical references and it remained through the entire series. 
 
They style used also fits the genre well, not to mention the music. What really makes this series though is the characters. Each has a very distinct personality that is blown over the top and exaggerated, and yet I couldn't help but falling in love with them, not to mention they didn't grate on my nerves. I also like how despite the fact the plot has an over all comedic tone to it, underneath there is a darker theme running. The connections between the characters relationship wise is also interesting as well.  
 
One thing is for sure, I at first expected this to be a much longer series and was surprised to find out that it was as short as it was. On one side the series wasn't dragged out making it so that I got bored with the repetitiveness, but the funny thing is towards the end it got less repetitive and less formulate. In the long run it made for a fun laugh and an enjoyable ride.

          
 
       Helpful Bueno, was there a time when you're watching some show and saw something that was similar from what you've watched from other shows. Or, do you have no idea that there maybe some scene that were plagiarize, well, this anime was simply what it is, in fact the Chinese have a term for that which they call it ""  chop suey"" literally means mix together, and this anime was a mixture of various scene and spin offs from other shows or anime all loosely combined to form a sort of ""Lupin III"" like thing. The plot was nice, but the execution was bad, it was enjoyable at first but it goes downhill from episode 3 to the ending. But what I like about this anime was its retro opening theme and a few of fanservices that come along, and that as good as it gets... for me, that is. So here are my ratings for each category: 
 
Story: good #7 
 
Like I said the story plot was good, but the execution is bad. 
 
Art: fair # 6 
 
I did mentioned about the few fanservices that comes with the show right? But I also like Otsu's illustration both in a kimono and in a catsuit.  
 
Sound: fair #6 
 
I don't have anything to say, but I do like this anime's opening theme, it basically combines retro with jazz. 
 
Character: poor #3 
 
Safe to say that director, Hirofumi Ogura did utilize the characters properly, in fact the characters themselves have very chaotic roles.  
 
Overall: pathetic #1 
 
Bueno, what can I say, this anime was a total ""SNAFU,"" if only director Hirofumi Ogura try to make this anime as a good  ""Lupin III"" spin off, then it would have been worth watching.

(Source: AniDB)","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Thousands of years ago, the people of the planet Campbell decided to leave their planet and seek out new worlds to inhabit. One group, led by the scientist Oreana, landed on Earth, but was delayed from their mission. In the early 21st century, Oreana's group reawakens and begins their plan to conquer the Earth. The only effective defense against the Campbellians' giant bio-mechanical slave beasts is the super-electromagnetic robot, Combattler V and its pilots.
The entire series follows the then-standard monster-of-the-week format, with the first season featuring Garuda sending various mecha to defeat Combattler V. His tactics range from brute force to cunningness and taking hostages. He even duels Hyouma in a sword fight with their feet chained together; though just as Hyouma is about to kill him, he is saved by Oreana. As the series moves on, his trust for Oreana lessens. Garuda eventually discovers that he is in fact a cyborg, and uncovers a robot specifically designed for him. In the final episode of the first season, he defeats Oreana, and duels Combattler V, which eventually leads to his defeat.
The second season features Empress Janelor and her generals Dungele and Warchimedes. The way the second season is structured is quite similar to that of the first, but involves more serious plot points such as the taking of hostages and plots to kill the team. Eventually, the entire base of the Campbellian empress is deployed, and only through the help of the airborne Nanbara Connection Base is Combattler V able to destroy it. However, Janelor manages to deploy an ""Earth Bomb"" which is supposed to destroy the Earth. Notably, the team is not dispirited, but are quite calm and instead happy for having the chance to fight to protect Earth. Just as it looks as though Earth will be destroyed, the ""true"" leader of the Campbellians, Deus, riding in a golden wagon, informs the team of the coup d'etat at Campbell, and stops the bomb seconds before it burrows into the core of the Earth.
","Choudenji Robo Combattler V, older brother to the slightly more popular Voltes V, and featured multiple times in the Super Robot Wars franchise. 
 
I'll start off with the pretty blunt statement, that this show is rather basic no matter how you look at it. It isn't groundbreaking, its very similar to Voltes V, and isn't too thrilling in any particular department. 
Heck, both the mech and the pilots seem like clones of Voltes V's own in many aspects. 
 
But it has one thing going for it. Its fun to watch. In that charismatic way Super Robot series are. That no matter how repetitive the series is, no matter how bland the villains or heroes are, you always want to cheer them on as they fight the monster of the week, and finish them off with the finishing blow, CHOUDENJI SPIIIIIN. Its in this Super Robot kind of excitement that keeps me returning episode after episode to watch Garuda and the Campbellians resurrect a new monster and attempt to ""finally take down Combattler!"" 
 
Its fun, it enjoyable, most certainly retro, and will make you feel like you're 10 years old again. From the hotshot speed demon Hyouma, gun loving ace Juuzou, token girl member Chizuru, obese Daisaku, and kid genius Kosuke, they each have episodes devoted to their own characters. And to be honest, I think these episodes are probably some of the most well done in the show, since they actually put a lot of background into the individual pilots. These episodes also help keep it from being straight ""Monster of the Week"" all in a row, by helping spice it up a bit. Not to mention Garuda, who suddenly turns from the spoiled prince into a complex villain of conflicting values later on. 
 
Now, halfway through the series, it reaches the climax of the entire story. I'm not naming anything, but it really reaches the meat of the story, and then for the second half changes completely and goes back to how it was for the first half, but with different cast of villains. This really hurt its story, since all the work they put into making the spectacular half point went to waste with the new villains. 
 
Overall, if you enjoy catchy theme songs, absurd weapons (C'mon, who doesn't love the Electromagnetic Yo-yo?), stereotypical villains, and are a sucker for Super Robots, then this is right up your alley. Otherwise, you may find it looking out of date, boring, and just downright childish. Thats alright, but when it comes to Combattler, it holds much more nostalgia and entertainment than first meets the eye.

Lupin III infiltrates this group, hoping to steal the treasure their leader keeps hidden. There he lays eyes on the beautiful, bewitching woman who has the leader enthralled. This is the story of how fashionable female thief Fujiko Mine first met Lupin III, the greatest thief of his generation. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Samurai', 'Seinen']",none,"I'm conflicted over this anime. For starters, it's an excellent take on Lupin III with beautiful art and a darker storyline, and had an interesting crew consisting of a SHAFT/Gainax freelancer, a KyoAni art director, Dai Sato and Shinichi Watanabe.  
 
On the other hand, it has a messy and pretentious story that kinda killed the ""mystique appeal"" of Fujiko Mine, added some unnecessary characters and is cluttered with bad writing by one of the biggest hacks in anime (And yes, i'm talking about Mari Okada). 
 
The story of this Lupin III series is all about Fujiko Mine, and how she became to be that one hot chick you see in every Lupin III anime from the past 4 decades. You also see her trying to rob things and steal stuff but who cares. 
 
It's basically  Lupin III meets ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego"" with a sprinkle of Black Rock Shooter. 
 
The story is quite a mess. The first 5 episodes have that sense of humour of the typical Lupin III story. And that's fine. 
 
But then, they just have to add that fucking annoying and unnecessary ""DEEP"" crap and turn Fujiko into an Asuka clone. And i'm not talking of making Fujiko a tsundere. I'm talking about them turning Fujiko into a post-mental breakdown suffering of a woman. And yes, i hated that part. Why? 
 
Because it's unnecessary and pretty killed the character for me. Fujiko was made to be a mysterious figure of lust and envy, and to add something that's the opposite of the two pretty much killed that. I don't want to know about her past. I want to see her as the sex bomb figure of tension that she is. 
 
Also, the worst thing about the story are the flashbacks of Fujiko's childhood. It's messy and gives away nothing that would make understand her. It's just padding at its worst and i hated that. 
 
I understand the need to go dark. Hell, i loved Casino Royale and Batman Begins for offering a gritty take on their respective franchises. But you don't make it to a point where you kill the appeal of the character. It's one reason the Star Wars Prequels don't work. You don't try and be edgy to the point of butchering what makes the characters likable. 
 
And all of these can pretty much be blamed on Mari Okada. You can tell that all the ""Deep & Dark"" flashback trauma crap is handled by her. Hell, episode 11 has her shit all over it. And i fucking hated it. It reminds me of everything i hated about Black Rock Shooter. Who gave this woman more work? We kicked Shyamalan hard for butchering The Last Airbender and Akiva Goldman got cockpunched for Batman & Robin, and yet she's getting away with this?  
 
And besides Fujiko III, you see the return of the well-loved Arsene Lupin, the samurai wonder Goemon, the sharp-eyed Jugem and the bumbling Interpol agent Zenigata. And they added another main character named Oscar who's Zenigata's assistant and obviously gay for the Inspector. And to me, he's pretty pointless because he brings nothing to the story, and he makes me ask ""Is this franchise really desperate of a new following that they need to add a character made for a fujoshi fanbse?"" Seriously, he's just there for the fabulous. 
 
But those are the bad parts, so now, here's the good parts! 
 
The art is excellent.It feels like moving palettes rather than animation and has an excellent colour scheme of sorts. It's clearly influenced by Western animation and it's more colourful than the other stories in Lupin III, which is a contrast to the dark storyline. 
 
The sound's nice. In terms of music, it's clearly the jazzy orchestra type of music you'd expect from a Shinichi Watanabe production. It's nice and i enjoyed the score as it reminds me of music by Anton Karas. I'm surprised that the score wasn't composed by Yoko Kanno, because it feels like one. And thus, i think the composer did an excellent creating a score influenced by Yoko Kanno. 
 
And the voice acting's pretty nice as you have the original seiyuus for Lupin and Jigen(Kanichi Kurita and Kiyoshi Kobayashi), whereas Fujiko is now voiced by the talented Miyuki Sawashiro while Goemon is voiced by the excellent Daisuke Namikawa. The legendary Kouichi Yamadera now voices Zenigata and Oscar is voiced by Yuki Kaji. All of them provides excellent voice acting and i'm impressed the most by Sawashiro as she is able to weigh in and sound as good as her predecessor, Eiko Masuyama. 
 
All of these good points provide a counter-balance to the ridiculously terrible storyline. You have all of these elements of music and animation that brings more to the anime than the story itself. And surprisingly, the Lupin and Jigen scenes managed to be more enjoyable than the Fujiko scene and that is also a good point about this series. 
 
Overall, Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna is a conflicted series with a flawed story, but makes up for it with the music, animation and giving space to Lupin, Jigen and Goemon. If you're a Lupin III fan and its core, then you will like this. But if you haven't seen any of the Lupin III series before, then go watch the original series alongside Castle of Cagliostro and maybe one of the other OVAs like Fujiko's Unlucky Days which is also similar to this anime.

       Helpful The Woman Called Fujiko Mine is certainly not standard Lupin III fare. Rather than the comical and over the top antics you would expect of Lupin and his group as they steal and outwit Zenigata, the humor here is more subdued and the series has a darker, more serious and mature feel to it. Fujiko finds herself the main attraction of this series as the first half to this series is prominently focused on her tackling different thefts while encountering Lupin, Goemon and Jigen individually and the second half features the four being caught up in the activity of a mysterious organization that Fujiko appears to have past ties with. The series appears set up as a prequel of sorts considering Jigen and Lupin don't know about one another and team up until later in the show, as well as Goemon hardly interacting with the two in this series. The four do maintain their memorable character traits in this series, though Fujiko tends to get nude quite often in this series and Zenigata is more of a traditional hard-boiled detective in this series than his usual bumbling, Lupin-obsessed comic relief provided in earlier iterations of the franchise. Zenigata also carries in toll a new character in the form of a young assistant named Oscar who is an occasional nuisance in Fujiko's thefts as he tries to apprehend her and has his back story fleshed out in later episodes. 
 
While the first half of this series is standard Lupin III fare, while more prominently focused on Fujiko, the highlight for the series for me comes in the form of its second half which features a more linear storyline when said mysterious organization comes into play. The group have their identities concealed in bird masks and apparently have some type of mysterious past connection with Fujiko. This particular story element is quite effective in messing with one's perceptions of what you assume is going on with Lupin and his group, especially as more details on the organization's illicit activities come to light and come to learn that not all is what it would seem on the surface. I won't spoil the major elements of this plot, but all I will say is that the ending comes across as quite the surprising shocker yet makes sense once you put together the elements of the organization revealed from earlier episodes. The only rough element to this new storyline was the unclear resolution of the fates of Zenigata and Oscar when they become entangled in the mess involving the organization. 
 
The animation style to The Woman Called Fujiko Mine sticks out quite a bit as well compared to past Lupin III works. Anyone who seen Redline may notice similarities in the drawing styles used for scenery and character designs here in this series. This isn't a coincidence as two of the major figures behind making Redline, Sayo Yamamoto and Takeshi Koike, contribute their talents in the unique animation style used for The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. Scenery and character designs are drawn with a pastel-like feel as color tones are quite subdued and there is frequent use of pattern-like designs used to blend in with a number of scenery and character designs. The character designs are well-detailed and the memorable designs of Lupin characters are retained here, all the way down to Lupin's green dress coat worn during the original first series from the early 1970s. Action scenes are well-animated featuring fluid movement in many instances and have great choreography coming from gunplay and even the swordplay used by Goemon. 
 
Overall, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine made for perhaps the best offering I've seen from the Lupin III franchise thus far. It still retains the basic elements of the franchise's premise and characters while creating a more mature series in its prominent focus on Fujiko's exploits and its dark, mind-bending second half when focusing on Fujiko's connections with the mentioned organization. The series certainly won't be for everyone if they are expecting the typical comical antics of the Lupin III franchise. But if you are looking for something different with the franchise, The Woman Named Fujiko Mine should be a worthwhile gem for you.

In order to fight against them, a navy group called Azure Lane has formed. They were successful in stopping the attack from Siren for a moment using warships. The different ideals from the people who formed it have shown. The story is about girls fighting the strong enemies that they've never faced before while dealing with the trouble in each camp.  
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Military', 'Historical']","The start of the game features an anthropomorphic recreation of the Battle of the Denmark Strait, where the personification of famed British battlecruiser HMS Hood is sunk by characters representing the German forces. The game features an eponymous military alliance, the ""Azur Lane"", formed by the nations of Eagle Union (United States), Royal Navy (United Kingdom), Sakura Empire (Empire of Japan) and Iron Blood (Nazi Germany). The alliance split in two because of an alien intervention, with the Iron Blood and Sakura Empire forming the opposing ""Crimson Axis"" faction. Using technology provided by the aliens called as ""Sirens"", the Crimson Axis invades the Azur Lane's territories. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the Pacific War. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the Battle of Midway, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, and the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign.
","Ok, let's be real. If you play the game, you're gonna love it.  
If you don't, it's better to stay away. 
 
For those who play the game, it's a great anime adaptation for your ships, their character has been adapted very well, even in the absence of a commander. Plus, you finally get to figure out how ship rigging works.  
 
If you don't play the game.... well, it's an anime about a bunch of girls with extra fan service shooting each other with ship equipment. If you're into seeing girls fool around for 20 minutes, go right ahead. If not, you'll find the anime sort of stale. 
 
Soooo, tldr: Do you play the game? Watch it. No? Don't. 
 
As for me, I play the game too much, instead of writing this review I could be grinding 3-4 again.

          
 
       Helpful Azur Lane is weird, not because of what Azur Lane is about (heck, you couldn’t be more anime if you tried), but for what it is. An adaptation of a popular mobile game that has good production values. Normally, stuff like this are usually cash grabs to capitalize on how popular the mobile game is. But it felt like Bibury Animation studios wanted to create a fun spectacle. So far at least, that has been the case. There is a sense of enjoyment in this show with cute but badass girls using Battleships as weapons fighting each other while skimming across the sea in what is essentially America and Britain vs Germany and Japan.  
 
That being said, the show does have flaws to it that may hold the show back by the end. Starting off, the characters. Now my problem is not the characters themselves as some of them I do like. My problem is that there is SO MANY OF THEM. When you are trying to adapt a game with so many characters, then it can get overwhelming and you just struggle to remember the names unless you are already invested into the game. It is a trap that similar adaptations would fall into and this is no exception. I get it, you don’t want to leave characters out, but you are just unleashing a wave of them all at once to the viewer so it can get overwhelming and it affects character development and investment, even the ones the show is really trying to focus on when it has to share screentime with every other character.  
 
The story isn’t exactly anything of note but it does do its job. Beings known as Sirens invaded Earth and took control of the seas. In response, a group called Azur Lane created anthropomorphic ships to fight back. They succeed and now they are at war with each other as the four major camps split into two sides. Not America (Eagle Union) and not Britain (Royal Navy) fight together as not Germany (Iron Blood) and not Japan (Sakura Empire) start using Siren technology. So war begins. A simple story that gets the job done of setting the scene for some battles between the two sides. Nothing particularly wrong with that. But it also rather bare bones as it is simply good vs evil with a tiny bit of grey area to it that feels somewhat predictable from a mile away.  
 
But I have to give credit where credit is due because the animation and sound is just great. The show looks and sounds goods to give the fight scenes some extra flair to it. It’s fun to watch seeing these girls battle it out in interesting and creative ways. It lets the fighting do the talking when it comes to telling a narrative which I think it does well. The show is clearly trying to anchor itself as being a fun watch and let the fight scenes do the talking, which is perfectly fine if you want to get people to enjoy the action. That being said, I noticed some of the characters looked off from a long distance as some body parts looked disproportionate to each other. I didn’t see it a lot of the time but I did catch my eye on some scenes that were the case.  
 
Now, my main worry with show moving forward though is that how long can this show hold up with that mindset of letting the fight scenes do the talking. To abbreviate a quote from my review on Sirius, “High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before its story and characters have to help carry the show.” I worry that Azur lane will fall under this as the show goes on as the story and characters will need to hold up its own weight. It does seem like that is the case though as the narratives between our main leads Enterprise, Javelin and Laffey are interesting to say the least and could lead to some interesting moments. But it might struggle later on as the large cast will need to get their own share of screentime, even some that are more significant than others. As for now, I am enjoying watching this series from a spectacle standpoint as the animation and sounds make the show enjoyable to watch but the large cast of characters and rather simple story leaves me worrying that this show could simply be a show that burns out too quickly before reaching its final episode.  
 
First Impression: 
Story: 5/10 
Bare bones but does its job at setting the scene.  
Characters: 5/10  
An overwhelming amount of characters that lack development and investment affects the score but some of them are interesting enough to be intrigued.  
Animation: 8.5/10 
Looks good and animates well to make the action enjoyable.  
Sound: 8/10 
Good soundtrack and soundbytes add to the scenes well with an enjoyable opening to boot.  
My Personal Enjoyment: 7/10 
I am enjoying watching this show as pure, action entertainment but I worry about the story and characters and if it gets worse from here.  
 
Overall Score: 6.7/10 Recommendation: Consider it 


          
 
       Helpful I play this game and at first I enjoyed the series, but since Ep6 I noticed there were a lot of bad animations in the first halve of the episode. Also some characters were made really bad in some scenes especially the less important scenes. When entreprise is in the scene, everything is ok, but not in one small scene.  
 
I wrote this just to get the frustration off of me when seeing the characters I have beeing playing with since my early days in the game. 
 
Else, I just want to say that the battle scenes are nice, but after ep3 it isn't realistic anymore 
*spoiler* Ships fighting in a city? *spoiler* 
thats why I gave the story a lower score.  
 
Although there are some bad things about the anime, I like the music and I always look forward to it to see a new episode with some more characters from the game. I just love to hear Laffey, Akashi or unicorn. There voice actors just fit in to the personallity of the these shipgirls.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Music', 'School']",none,"If you haven’t been living under a rock you’ve probably heard of Love Live!. It’s one of the most popular anime in Japan and for good reason: it has idols and yuri, a great art style, and a story that perfectly caters to the otaku fandom. It’s not quite as popular among a younger female audience as it is among an older male audience, but Sunrise already has Aikatsu for young girls so Love Live! is essentially the late night version of that. This anime has a lot of mixed opinions which is reasonable since anyone outside of the targeted audience isn’t going to see the appeal, but there are enough people in the targeted audience that it’s a perfect anime for a lot of people. The very fact that it is so popular can also be a draw for some people since it has a lot of good memes, fan art, and other media that is all translated for the most part. I will talk about the story first. This is a show about girls who become idols to save their school. It’s really quite similar to Girls und Panzer in that regard, but with the opposite reaction from the teachers. Honoka is confident that becoming idols would save their school while everyone else is skeptical, and rightfully so. After all, not only is not reasonable to expect to become popular simply from trying something you see other people getting popular from, as anyone who has tried created any kind of entertainment would know, but even if they did become popular that doesn’t exactly guarantee that their school would be along for the ride as well. Despite how improbable that would be, these are our protagonists and Sunrise isn’t going to show us some random idol group who failed to do what they sought to do. That would be boring. Naturally this is a success story and considering the way it’s set up this isn’t even really a spoiler. What is a spoiler is the opening theme song animation since it shows all nine of them dancing together which is the entire plot of the first season. It’s a cast building so it starts with an incomplete cast and collects them as they go along so it’s a spoiler which girls end up in the group. My next topic will be the art. The art looks very shiny and sort of 3D like which makes it perfect to make accurate anime figures of but it isn’t so 3D that it would give the cringy 3D CGI effect. There was certainly a lot of CGI used in this anime, especially in the dance scenes, but while the dance scenes themselves don’t look the best the rest of it looks very pretty. It’s too detailed to be drawn by hand but they clearly didn’t just leave everything up to the computers. When you ignore the hair and eye colours as well as the hair styles their faces are all very similar, but they do have some things to make them distinct. One important part of the character arcs of two characters who I won’t name for sake of avoiding spoilers is gaining weight and then having to lose that weight, which wouldn’t have been as nice to watch if the character designs weren’t so good. The problem with their weight was the fact that they wouldn’t be as mobile on stage so the fact that they still looked attractive in their overweight forms wasn’t a problem in my eyes. Not completely art related, but they have a lot of great moments they designed like Nico Nico Nii which this whole review is designed to look like, if you hadn’t noticed. The clothing designs were really well done. The skirts were very much on the short side and Sunrise didn’t have the “idol school” excuse like they did with Aikatsu, but this isn’t exactly unrealistic since most Japanese girls do tend to roll their skirts up. The outfits they use for their performances always fit the song and dance well and are always always very pretty. The music videos that serve to be part of the franchise are also very well drawn and designed, especially the later ones. The next section is the sound, which was definitely one of the anime’s strong points. They hired Pile to play Maki for a reason, as she is a professional singer and has barely done any other voice acting. The songs are catchy and the singing is beautiful. In addition to the theme songs and insert songs being good the background music is also great. The voices are all good. They all fully embody their characters from Rin’s nekomimi tomboy persona to Nico’s eccentric fake cutey personality. The dub’s voice actors are not as good to say the least, but if you actually care about watching this anime to get out of it what you should be coming for then I’ll assume you’re not watching the dub. While the voice acting is obviously not masterpiece quality and the music is fairly standard for the idol genre, it is all above average for slice of life anime. I will be talking about the characters next. As an idol anime it naturally has a large cast and since it introduces them one at a time it does give them all appropriate development despite not being super long. This does a lot better of a job characterizing all of its characters than The iDOLM@STER does despite being the same length and having around as big of a cast. All of the characters have distinct and interesting personalities and it doesn’t feel like they’re just exposition dumping their personalities on the viewers. They’re shown in natural situations and are given the time to develop properly. Despite the fact that the anime wasn’t that long, by the end of it you do get to really feel for the characters, provided you have the correct taste to enjoy it. Obviously as idols they aren’t allowed to have hetero love, but we still do see some of the other kind which is beautiful. A lot of the characters have good chemistry together. Even less important characters like Honoka’s younger sister and her friend are good characters despite not getting enough screen time to be as interesting as the main characters. The characters each cater to their own fans which both part of the reason why it’s so popular and also part of the reason why people argue so much about who the best one is. Best girl is subjective in any series, but in this anime they are all equally well developed characters but are made for different people so it’s even more subjective than usual. I’m sure you’ll find at least one character who you really like from the main characters, which is one of the benefits of there being nine of them and them all being very different. As much as everything sort of contributes to enjoyment, it can come from sources other than the previous four so it gets its own category. I got a lot of enjoyment from everything the show had to offer. I watched it on Crunchyroll without a membership so having watch through two minutes of commercials every episode slightly hindered my enjoyment of it in that way, but that isn’t the anime’s fault. Thankfully I saw this anime earlier on and didn’t have the well poisoned for me. A lot of people say bad things about this anime, which is allowed under free speech, but it still is something that can ruin anime for people since you might go in looking for things to hate. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime when I watched it and nothing about it bored me in any way. A lot of my enjoyment of the franchise doesn’t come from the anime itself and instead from the manga, the songs, and the fanart, but those I all enjoyed a lot more because I saw the anime. Fanbases can affect how much I like an anime and although some of the fans of this do go a bit too far overall they’re good people and it feels nice to be part of something bigger. I’m glad at least one anime about cute girls doing cute things has this devoted of a fanbase. In conclusion I thought this was a really good anime. It certainly deserves its popularity and even if the biggest mark of success for the creators was making it making it very accessible for the otaku community to latch onto I’d consider that to be good enough. Objectively or subjectively it’s obviously doing its job well and for that I congratulate it. I wouldn’t consider it to be the best anime I’ve seen or close to it, but it was certainly one of the most enjoyable. Whether if you like music anime, if you’re already into the idol genre, or just like to argue with other people about who the best girl in an anime is this is a great choice. 


          
 
       Helpful Woah, Love Live? What am I doing in an Idol anime?  
Well, I was just curious about why do these kind of 'Idol anime' is very popular in Japan. And I think now I know why. 
 
Story: (10) 
The Story is about Kousaka Honoka, a 2nd year student of Otonokizaka Academy, which is about to close down by the end of the First Year's graduation. So, our MC here is trying to figure out how to stop the closure of the School, and by what? By being an Idol of course.  
 
I'm not a big fan of 'Music' anime, but this one is AWESOME. Not by the Songs, no... it's the story and the lovable character that keep me hooked until the 2nd Season of this show.  
 
Art: (9) 
Who cares about Art, really. Except if it's like Mars of Destruction (shivers). The characters are hand-drawn like any other anime, but when they hit the dance floor, they turned into CG.  
 
That's probably one reason why I give the art 9, the CG. It's not smooth, if it's smoother, it would be an eye-candy. (I think.) 
 
Sound: (10) 
I like the songs in this anime. My favorite, Is the OP: ""Bokura wa ima no naka de"". Others are also good, like ""Snow Halation"" or ""START: DASH!!"" 
 
Character: (9) 
Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Hanayo, Rin, Maki, Nico, Nozomi, and Eri. Those are the Nine main characters of this anime, yes NINE.  
 
Loveable? Check. Cute? Check. Tsundere? Check. Carefree? Check. Shy? Check. All the members of Muse will make your heart melt. 
 
Could've been better if there's at least one male character, though. 
 
Enjoyment: (9) 
Overall, I enjoy this series, it kept me hooked until the 2nd Season. If you're into Idol, this is for you. Comedy? Also for you. Slice of Life? Here you go.  


          
 
       Helpful Love Live School Idol Project was my, like many others, introduction to the world of idol anime. In many ways, it shines as a perfect gateway into the genre, it's got a bright, innocent, lighthearted style which eases the viewers into a very harmless, fun experience. There are some very apparently blunders which are made, which are extremely apparent even in episode 1. Even with these extremely eye-grabbing mistakes, the show remains fun and harmless which is exactly what it aimed to achieve in the first place. 
 
Honestly, there isn't really anything to be said about the story. Honoka is an ordinary girl who lives an ordinary student life. This is until the start of her second year, where the news that the school's application numbers are dropping at an alarming rate, causing the school to be shut down. In order to prevent this and to protect her everyday school life, Honoka gets the idea to become a school idol in order to raise her school's popularity and save the school from shutting down! The show follows this fairly simple plot very well, there's a clear goal as the plot progresses through every episode, it keeps a constant and fairly quick pace throughout it's 13 episodes, there isn't really any filler and every episode feels as though it has a purpose.  
 
The art style is bright, fun, cute, and full of color. There isn't really anything else to be said about it.  
 
Animation wise, there aren't really any flaws for 95% of the show, where it really starts to fall apart (and this is this biggest complaint that I have with the show), is in the dance sequences. Now, the use of CG in anime normally never really goes that well, but in Love Live, it's REALLY bad. From the first time it's used at the end of the first episode, it immediately catches your eye. It looks stiff, the models just look... wrong. Everything about the dance sequences just are not a pleasant accompaniment to the songs that back them. It's extremely noticeable just how much the CG takes you out of it when they find the need to switch from the CG to the standard 2D characters doing whatever back to the CG. When half of the major appeal of the show, the dance sequences, are a pain to watch, it really affects the viewers overall enjoyment of the show.  
 
Luckily, the songs are absolutely wonderful! To this day I find myself humming some of the songs sung in this show because they are just so catchy and fun. The opening and ending songs are also extremely enjoyable, the ending song changes singer for each member of the main cast which is a really nice and easy way to let the audience identify who's singing during the main idol songs where they sing as a group. Honestly, the songs in this show are absolutely phenomenal, easily the biggest reason as to why I liked my watch through so much.  
The background soundtrack is also enjoyable, it's very playful and really helps the show maintain it's extremely lighthearted mood throughout the length of every episode.  
 
In terms of the characters, I found myself only really focusing on three or four of them as my favorites and pushing the rest onto the plate of side characters. This isn't entirely my fault as the show very clearly pushes some of the group members to be ""main-main"" characters and others to be ""side-main"" characters. My issue is that some characters are set up in their introductory episodes to be characters that will stand out and play an important role throughout the show and then they just don't. At least in season 1, they only really develop on 5 characters: Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Eri and Maki. Niko is also developed a fair amount, but the other 3 don't really serve any real purpose to the show, at least in my opinion. They aren't ""bad"" characters for sure, but they aren't exactly memorable.   
 
Overall, I enjoyed my watch of Love Live School Idol Project Season 1 (that's a mouthful), Aside from the CG during the dance scenes I don't really have any complaints to give. The music is the shining star for sure, I love every song that they sing, the characters are enjoyable and they all have their own quirks that play off of each other. The art style is fairly average but it's nothing to complain about and the same goes for the story, it's all just harmless fun.  
 
Love Live SIP Season 1 delivers a completely harmless fun ride of cute girls doing cute things to save their school, it serves extremely catchy songs that'll be stuck in your head til the day you die and a very enjoyable experience for anyone to enjoy. I would suggest this to anybody who is looking for a first idol anime. Once you get past the blaring issues with CG, it's really a wonderful introduction into the genre. It's nonstop fun and I enjoyed it the whole way through, I highly recommend anyone to check it out. 
 
Thanks for reading!

9,486,20,7.536813689,A group of people living together,Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World,"Kino, a 15-year-old traveler, forms a bond with Hermes, a talking motorcycle. Together, they wander the lands and venture through various countries and places, despite having no clear idea of what to expect. After all, life is a journey filled with the unknown.  
 
Throughout their journeys, they encounter different kinds of customs, from the morally gray to tragic and fascinating. They also meet many people: some who live to work, some who live to make others happy, and some who live to chase their dreams. Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives.  
 
It is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world. They do not attempt to change or influence the places they visit, despite how absurd these values would appear. That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that ""the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is."" 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Psychological', 'Slice of Life']","In Kino's Journey, the protagonist, Kino, accompanied by a talking motorcycle named Hermes, travels through a mystical world of many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place, while leaving time to explore new lands. Kino says in The Land of Visible Pain that this principle is probably a lie, specifically noting ""if I stay any longer, I'm afraid I will settle down."" The recurring theme of the anime and novels is described by the phrase, ""The world is not beautiful, therefore it is."" Kino's Journey explores what the anime director Ryūtarō Nakamura described as ""a radical sense of 'beauty,'"" and brutality, loneliness, nonsense, oppression and tragedy are often juxtaposed against compassion and a fairy-tale atmosphere.
For protection and hunting, Kino carries a .44 single-action revolver (called ""the Cannon"", based on a Colt Walker) that uses liquid explosives in place of gunpowder and a .22 automatic pistol (named ""the Woodsman"", based on a Colt Woodsman). Later in Kino's adventures in the novels, Kino also uses a pump-action shotgun (based on a Winchester M1897) and a semi-automatic sniper rifle (called ""the Flute"", based on an M14 rifle), along with a variety of other tools, including knives. In the anime, Kino is shown to carry no fewer than five knives, including one which can fire .22 bullets from its hilt. Kino is an unusually quick draw and practices every day before dawn.
Technology in this world exists, sometimes to the level of science fiction, although anachronisms are common (for example, the same land that has talking robots also appears to have phonographs, yet simultaneously the world has only begun to develop heavier-than-air flight). The level of technology also varies from country to country. The world is not heavily magical (the only ""magical"" elements include land that moves, talking vehicles, and a talking dog), although it has a certain fairy-tale quality.
","The world is not beautiful. Therefore it is.  
 
This anime doesn't appeal to all Anime fans and it can be quit boring and difficult to watch if you are not into stuff like Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, literature and even poetry. 
 
Kino's journey is about a girl travelling across a mystical world and spending three days in each of the countries with a talking motorcycle named Hermes 
Between countries Kino and Hermes discuss life and human nature on the road and Almost every place seems to be stuck in a time period somewhere between 1920 and 1960, and in a world where WWII never 
This can be confusing. *  
However Each episode of Kino can stand on it's own, even when it alludes heavily to earlier stories, all the episodes seem to have no real order. Many of them are shown simply as a series of flashbacks, while others are obviously earlier in her life even though they are at the end of the series.   
 
 
My only problem with this anime is  the main character ""kino""  
she's not interesting at all you cant care about her 
There is no emotions whatsoever. It is as if she is a robot.. She has no personality or Facial Expressions, disgustingly overconfident for a  young girl  
she has the body of a 10 year old ! yet she dodge bullets like its nothing and beat everyone that stand in her way 
I care so deeply about characters in anime and i was disappointed.  
 
overall  
This deep exploration of the meaning of life and human nature may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, however i think its still enjoyable   
I would describe Kino's Journey as contemplative rather than normative. I.e. it poses questions instead of giving answers.   
 


          
 
       Helpful In my opinion, this is a very interesting series and a world one loves to get lost in. 
 
It is about a girl and a motorbike, traveling a world where travelers seem to be a rare phenomenon. She encounters the strangest people, customs and situations, not to mention the beautiful environments she finds herself in; who wouldn't dream about such a life? 
 
First of all the main character, Kino. She is a frail little girl but has a great power and stillness over her. She is strong-willed and easily stays calm in any situation. She is in control but not by forcing things, her attitude is more like wait-and-see and go with the flow. Yet, she is very interested and asks lots of questions. She is open to anyone she meets, is kind-hearted and compassionate, but her experience with different kinds of people makes her careful. She's excellent in combat and if the situation asks for it, she doesn't hesitate to use her arms. 
 
Hermes, her motorbike, speaks and is a great companion for Kino, as Kino is for him. He has a freshness over him and asks all kinds of questions like a curious child. When something is broken, he just tells Kino he needs that part repaired, which is very handy. 
 
One of the peculiar things about this series is that it is filled with little details which, if you were to start thinking about it, you could not really wrap your mind around. For example the countries Kino and Hermes travel to, usually appear to consist of just one town and a bit of land surrounding it, while the whole feel to it when Kino and Hermes are there, would suggest that it was a vast country. Another example is that one country seems to exist in pre-industrial times, while a few countries further there is a highly advanced civilization. Then of course the speaking motorbike, that goes everywhere with Kino, even up the stairs into the bedroom.  
All of this makes it a surreal world, but not too surreal. It's all just not really possible,  but yet gets easily accepted and appreciated.  
 
The series also makes the watcher think about the somewhat deeper subjects of life. One reason Kino travels is to gain a deeper understanding of life, people and herself. Human nature and the nature of the construct itself are touched. She meets people who see the world as a stage and the people as merely players and she meets an enlightened wise man, who later denies that he is.  
 
Alltogether an unmissable gem for people who love an intelligent, cozy story on the many aspects of life!

          
 
       Helpful It’s pretty weird how I struggled to have this anime series, but didn’t give a sh!t about it for three months. Luckily, I had to feed Le?la’s need of Anime and watching stuff, so I remembered the 13-episodes Anime lying quietly somewhere… 
 
Which isn’t weird, however, the fact that I got completely hooked on this tale of tales, a simple non-stop journey with a human-Lain like hero?n and a speaking Motorcycle. This anime is a Must-Watch, whether you like surrealism, philosophy and stuff or not. I feel I could tell Kino’s trips for children in bed, people who wait or any quiet person sitting near and who doesn’t give a sh!t about what I may do or say. 
 
When it comes to anime/manga, I usually choose what I want to read/watch: I don’t have time or money to waste on fanservice/commercial/ecchi/hentai/clichés material. So, if I am to watch something, it ought to be original and outstanding…Kino no Tabi had the original layout, the outstanding description. Besides, she reminded me of Lain and she had a Motorcycle: God knows how these two details may make me cheer up for Bush while he’s not even in the campaign for presidence u_u… 
 
The scenario (meaning the story and the way the main characters react to the outside world) was very intuitive: it made me feel like it was written without even thinking. Yet, it’s highly philosophical and discussing ethics in the way I find ethics should be discussed. Kino is constantly confrontated with her own beliefs and disbeliefs:although she may be compassionate, she doesn’t fall from the path she’s drawn to herself and I highly appreciated this about her. Thus, she may be brought to make hard choices without regreting it after. She doesn’t waste time on showing on feelings or defending a sake. She’s just a traveler, a sightseer that wants “to live consciously“. Hermers the motorrad is a smart trick in the scenario: with his annoying questions, he pushes Kino to reveal some of her thoughts and reasons of acting such this or that to the watchers. He’s also a way to discover a long-time relationship along with someone as Kino. The supporting characters are just well-written for the stories they live. This shows my point of view about the smart and well-written scenario. 
 
The Animation focuses more on the landscape than the characters, but it gives such a bright effect. In addition to this, the action is quick and well-done. The soundtrack matches perfectely the atmosphere of the series and there’s nothing more that I like than the ending credits. 
 
Kino No Tabi is a beautiful and philosophical collection of tales, which deals with society issues in a subtil way. It’s a nice opportunity to rebound with humanity, to stop looking at the world in the white/dark glasses and to feel more human. 
 
I loved these series and I think they’ll last on my lap like SE Lain.

When the activist group requests both doctors’ collaboration, Black Jack finds himself caught in a spiral of life, death and treason while trying to save his patients' lives and avoid the breaking of a biological war that could destroy humanity. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Drama'],"Most of the stories involve Black Jack doing some good deed, for which he rarely gets recognition—often curing the poor and destitute for free, or teaching the arrogant a lesson in humility. They sometimes end with a good, humane person enduring hardship, often unavoidable death, to save others.
","The Two Doctors of Darkness focuses on Black Jack competing medically with his arch nemesis Dr. Kiriko (from the older original Black Jack OVAS) while also trying to find a cure for a disease that could end the world.  Rock, a character from many other Tezuka works, such as Metropolis, brings gun fights and action to the movie to make the plot a mix of medical mystery, evils of corporations, and the meanings of life and death. 
 
Compared to the parent story (Black Jack (TV) series), the plot seems a little out of place since it is focuses heavily on the aftermath of war and military experiments along with Black Jack struggling with hopelessness of being unable to help his patients. The tone better matches the original older OVAS than the lighthearted TV series. 
 
Overall, this movie is decent and certainly entertaining if you like Black Jack, but don't expect a masterpiece going into it.  I think this movie is more for those who enjoy the ethical dilemmas and darker tone of the older series than those watching this as a sequel to Black Jack (TV).

The survivors took refuge in the Tokyo Empire, which remained mostly stable during the period despite losing some of its landmass. The Tokyo Emperor Raffles I establishes the faith of the Holy Sol Temple as it and Haijima Industries developed the perpetual thermal energy plant Amaterasu to power the country.
In Year 198 of Tokyo's Solar Era, special fire brigades called the Fire Force fight increasing incidents of spontaneous human combustion where human beings are turned into living infernos called ""Infernals"". While the Infernals are first generation cases of spontaneous human combustion, with more powerful horned variations known as Demons, later generations possess pyrokinesis while retaining human form.

","People expect every anime to have stories as epic as Full Metal Alchemist, be as thought provoking as Ghost In The Shell, have emotions running as deep as Clannad, with dialogue as sharp as the Monogatari Series and humor as side-splitting as Gintama, and if they don't, they're ready to bury an anime before the first season is even over. 
 
99 percent of animes will never be classics. (Though it would be nice if they were.) But, since most never will be good enough to rank among the top 50 on MAL, the question is: ""Are they entertaining?"". And as far as Enen no Shouboutai goes, the answer is a resounding ""YES"". Do not be put off by the top comments. The show is VERY entertaining. 
 
To be fair, the show does have pacing issues. Things move very quickly, sometimes too quickly. For example: The heroes infiltrate a particular location undercover looking for a culprit, and they expose them lightning fast. Some villains have an instant change of heart. But, these are small mistakes that won't ruin the entertainment value of what's happening on screen for most viewers. 
 
The show also introduced a very MINOR problem in the scheme of things with the introduction of Tamaki Kotatsu. A character whose main identity centers around her tripping and falling into to Ecchi situations. And yes, it is absolutely silly to create a character who is a walking: ""MC Accidentally opens the shower door while the girl is naked"" cliche, but it's not nearly that big of a deal. She's a mostly tertiary character, and is the only character in the anime who is heavily directed towards that kind of cliche. I think the anger over this character and trope, is because in the anime there was a key fight scene that was ruined when they decided to integrate this ""lucky lecher"" gimmick of hers into the fight. I will admit, it was really bad, and really hurt the moment. But, one can't down an entire entertaining anime because of a single bad decision. (Which was really, really bad.) 
 
But, outside of these two issues, the anime is wildly entertaining. Shinra is one of the best fighters I've seen in years. So good, it makes me wonder how it is Sanji from One Piece could be fighting with the same style for 20 years and they never make his fights as exciting as these? The animation is beautiful and the world being crafted in this anime is intriguing. I don't understand why some are saying the story makes no sense, as the story makes very clear sense. It's not even a complicated story. A group of fanatics are working to destroy everything and the heroes are working to stop them. (Simplified to not spoil anything). Most of the characters are interesting, most of the jokes are funny, there is an air of mystery to it, and most importantly, it's not boring. 
 
Is it at the level of a Gintama meets Hunter X Hunter 2011? No. But, then again, Gintama's first few episodes weren't even all that funny and HxH's first episodes looked like a cheap Naruto rip-off. Which is why you have to give animes time to develop. Because you never know if animes with a rough start can turn into something legendary over time. And in truth, this anime isn't even having a rough start, it's a good anime, with a couple of small flaws that some are blowing WAY out of proportion. 
 
Don't let that deter you from watching this anime. It is a good one. It's certainly a lot better than most of the anime coming out in recent seasons.

          
 
       Helpful Fire force is a story about people with fiery hearts fighting fire with fire. Set in a world where people spontaneously combust and turn into mindless burning zombies the Fire Force is responsible for controlling the damage caused by these “infernos”. Many people in this world are bestowed upon by Solomon the ability to control fire. After watching the first two episodes I really thought I would be able to enjoy this, but shortly afterwards the enjoyment I found in the bombastic nature of the first two episodes was burnt and tossed into oblivion. 
 
This is probably the worst directed and worst framed show to come out this year. Riddled with sudden cuts, weird framing, stupid fanservice and soulless jokes and characters every bit of potential that the show held was thrown into the nether. Plot elements are pulled out of the author’s ass at very inappropriate times with characters making a sudden appearance and then disappearing just as quickly. Characters are brought into the show and thrown away for the duration of 5-6 episodes until they’re needed again to exposit about the world or the plot.  
 
The characters are, quite frankly, shite.  
 
“Gone are the days when authors wrote personalities and traits and then implemented those traits and associated mannerisms onto the avatar affiliated with the personality in question thus birthing an actual character instead of lazily creating an empty husk decorated with cliché.” – Douchebag Chocolat 
 
The above quote perfectly describes the characters in this show. Instead of giving the characters a personality, they’re provided with certain traits and stupid mannerisms in order to deceive the audience into thinking that each character is somehow different than the next. Unfortunately, except maybe two or three every other character is basically the same. Even the protagonist, Shinra, has a certain habit of “smiling in the face of danger because his face muscles tense up”. There’s another guy who calls himself a knight just because his name is Arthur and he wields a sword. Seriously, this guy is so obsessed with the idea of becoming a knight that his power will literally increase if he even thinks that he’s riding a horse and has a duty to protect someone. The cat girl, Tamaki’s only purpose in life seems to be to get her boobs or ass in someone’s face “accidently” and then to call them a pervert. Iris almost does nothing but blush, the lieutenant is always grumpy and scaring his subordinates. There’s also Maki who can only utter the phrase, “Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops” even when no one has addressed her as such.   
 
The characters don’t have much drive to do anything. Only Shinra and the commander of the 8th division are given any motivation as to why they do what they do. As for the other characters’ motivations and goals, the show usually gives us a half-assed backstory and is done with it. Most female characters like the dark-skinned girl, or the cat girl are used for fanservice. At one time the show almost tuned into a harem as every girl at whom Shinra even looked at started to fall for him.  
 
Personally, I don’t care about the characters, except Joker, he was pretty cool, but it’s a shame that he only gets about 2 seconds of screen time in the whole show. I like the Joker cause he’s cool, not because he’s a well-constructed character. He’s brought in to tell Shinra about the main events that concern the plot and then he disappears.   
 
Almost forgot, there’s also Shinra’s brother, Sho, who was separated from Shinra at a very young age and now he’s a bad, bad guy working as the Evangelist to bring about a third impact and Shinra must pilot th-… oh, wait, wrong anime.  
 
The comedy is… there. The “comedy” usually consists of - a girl slipping out of her clothes for no apparent reason; Shinra and Arthur threatening to kill each other; a girl showing her tits or ass; Arthur claiming to be a knight but being ignored and a girl being molested. All these three situations are used to provide “comic relief”. The comedy also includes Maki shouting about someone calling her a Gorilla Cyclops. This joke was funny the first time, but after a 100 times, it became pretty annoying. 
 
Watching the first episode, I remember thinking to myself “Man, this show is sure going to have some fire fights”, but only the first episode has any good fights. The fights that occur after the first episode are so badly choreographed that neither you, nor the characters can figure out what’s happening. I, in most fights, had no idea as to the spatial relations between the characters who were fighting. One scene they’re having a stare down, the next scene they fly towards each other, the next scene we see Shinra’s feet and then the fight is settled. After that the camera focuses on someone’s face for a bit too long and then abruptly cuts to another fight happening somewhere in the vicinity. 
 
I never gave directors the respect they deserved for properly framing the characters until I watched this show. The camera either lingers on a particular subject for too long, or abruptly cuts to some other subject too quickly. This weird camera work usually happens after someone cracks a joke or when someone pisses someone off and was probably intended for us, the audience, to realize the awkwardness the characters were put in; but all it did for me was make me aware of the fact that I wanted to fast forward through the episode. 
 
Not every fight is awkwardly animated. Some of the fights are really good, like Benimaru, the strongest fire bender vs a demon; Shinra vs the red-haired guy from the 1st division; Shinra vs a demon, but starting from the middle of the show the fights became pretty hard to follow. 
 
The music didn’t appeal to me, but that’s subjective. I did like the first opening and the first ending, the second OP and ED were horrible. The music was tone deaf at times and sometimes the choice of music didn’t fit the scene it was being used for. 
 
Should you watch Fire Force? I’ll leave that judgeme(n)t up t(o) you. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Let me take you back to 2003. Atsushi Ookubo, creator of Fire Force, is making waves with Soul Eater, a manga that would go on for 10 successful years - sparking an anime adaptation and a spin-off series. 
 
Soul Eater was a stand-out shounen that excelled in not only having a fascinating universe, but also characters that were compelling by having...well, personalities. And while Soul Eater did have characters with wacky quirks - most notably Death the Kid's OCD, used as the butt of many jokes - they weren't the epicenter of every character's existence. 
 
2 years after Soul Eater, Ookubo started Fire Force. And in almost every way, it feels like he has de-evolved as a storyteller. Characters in Fire Force are defined by singular traits, and you're bashed over the head with them constantly. Female characters especially, in the form of unfunny and blatant fanservice. Villains are comically evil mustache-twirling, monologue-spewing characters that are so blatant you can point them out the first time you see them. 
 
There is little to no nuance in Fire Force. It has moments where you start thinking ""wow, maybe this will actually get good now!"", and then it falls right back into its tired, repetitive devices. And it's a shame - because there's no question that Studio David went all out with the action animation in Fire Force. But no matter how elaborately animated the fight sequences may be, it can't save Fire Force from barely scraping the surface of mediocrity. 
 
I don't want to bash on Fire Force entirely - it's not a trainwreck. It is awkward, stilted and has weak convictions. But it does have moments of genuine tension, character growth and curious lore. Fleeting as they may be, they are there. So let's start with the good. 
 
THE GOOD: 
The Asakusa arc takes place in the middle of the anime, and it is by far the strongest arc so far. Why is it so much more satisfying than anything else that happens in the series? Because it advances the plot in meaningful ways, and the ways in which it does it are EARNED. Characters do things for believable reasons, and conflicts are resolved in sensible ways that give strength to the plot. I thought the anime did a 180 for the most part during this arc, and had high hopes for what came after. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 
 
The fighting animation is fantastic. It is also complimented by the sound effects used to add impact to the fire-based fighting. Altogether, it's easily some of the best choreographed and heart-pumping sakuga out there. The characters of Fire Force shine their brightest when they are fighting. Mostly because they dialogue is so weak, but hey - you get what you can take. 
 
The universe and lore of Fire Force is pretty interesting - when you get some. There's clearly something sinister on a cosmic level that's going on in Fire Force that slowly gets revealed as time goes on. And i'm sure there will be more of that in the 2nd season. 
 
Unfortunately, that's about it for the good. 
 
THE BAD: 
The direction outside of the fighting scenes is weirdly robotic and disjointed. Shots are flat, uninteresting and tonally confusing. Conversations are punctuated with a lot of awkward silence, still shots are held for too long, and you're often left wondering if there was supposed to be a punchline. It's worth noting that a lot of David Pro have come from Shaft, where many worked on the Monogatari series. While this is pure speculation, I can't help but wonder if the decision to use the same directorial stylings of Monogatari on Fire Force was due to this, because you can definitely make some parallels here. Unfortunately, for a shounen, it really doesn't work - especially when we get to the next bad thing: the humor. 
 
Comedy is important in shounen. It can help sometimes to break up serious moments or sadness with a little bit of humor. But it's also easy to overdo it. Fire Force is CONSTANTLY overdoing it. I get the feeling Ookubo might find his jokes a lot funnier than they actually are - and he uses the same ones over and over. As mentioned earlier, a lot of characters have a singular quirk that is shoved in your face over and over. One of the worst ones is easily Tamaki's. Her character is constantly shoved aside for a single joke that is played out to excess - her clothes are constantly falling off and she always finds herself being accidentally groped by the MC Shinra in the most impossible situations. Now, this would be fine if you were making a brainless ecchi fanservice show - but Fire Force wants you to take it seriously quite often. So it's tonally bizarre when at one moment there is death, tragedy and destruction, then suddenly some girl is squeaking while her bra and panties magically pop off and her boobs are in some guy's face. This kind of stuff happens more often than it really should, and for me almost none of the humor landed. 
 
On the subject of Tamaki, I have to unfortunately give a knock to the female characters of Fire Force. It's not like Soul Eater wasn't full of fanservice, but at least it had an incredible female lead by the name of Maka Albarn, who wasn't a constant source of cheap sexual gags. Fire Force seems to treat every female character as a certain type of fetish - like strong girls? There's Maki. like scantily clad ones? There's Tamaki. Like femdom? There's Hibana. Like the innocent type? There's Iris. Outside of maybe 2 or 3 scenes, these characters are CONSTANTLY cornered into their corner of pandering to something so juvenile that it's honestly just sad - especially considering that they (with the exception of Iris) are incredibly powerful fighters that deserved better. 
 
Not only that, but the way some of these characters are treated ranges from disappointing to downright disturbing. Two examples that come to mind are Hibana's ""turn"" to join the 8th Company during her fight with Shinra. Shinra does a little talk no jutsu, punches her in the face, and just like that, she completely changes her mind about her life's ambitions AND as an added bonus falls madly in love with Shinra. It's the first arc in the series and really takes a lot of the wind out of your sails, because it's supposed to be the climax of the arc and it falls totally flat. The second one is when Tamaki finds out someone she idolized is actually an evil person. That evil person proceeds to literally beat the shit out of her while she cries and does absolutely nothing to defend herself, despite being entirely capable. It's uncomfortable to watch and comes off as weird fetishy torture porn. 
 
The male characters are not much better, just that their one-note quirks are inherently not sexual. Shinra is the main character. You see, he's a hero, so he has to say that all the time - just in case you forget. Arthur fancies himself a knight, and so he has a lot of jokes about being a knight. When he feels like a knight, he fights good. When he doesn't, he fights bad. To be fair, the male characters can be decidedly more well-rounded than the female characters, because they actually take the time to give them some backstory. So there's that. 
 
Finally, the villains range from comically evil to downright incompetent. I'm gonna have to give ""dumbest villain of the year"" award to none other than Giovanni - a man with a plague mask who mostly just stands around talking - who managed to incapacitate his cult's #1 target, then proceeds to leave him alone in a forest with no guards instead of taking him somewhere where he couldn't escape. Then, of course, he escapes, after Hibana finds him somehow - and proceeds to get kicked in the face while he is busy talking about how evil he is elsewhere. 
 
At the end of the day, a lot of these plot contrivances can all be chalked up to one thing - lazy writing. I don't know why Fire Force feels like such a huge step backwards from Soul Eater. There's a lot of reasons to speculate, but it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, Fire Force is what it is - the most baseline of shounen action, coupled with awkward humor, bizarre scene direction and stunted characters. For every moment you're pumping your fists, you get ten where you're rolling your eyes or raising an eyebrow in bemusement. All in all, it's kind of exhausting to sit through. 
 
Should you watch Fire Force? Maybe if you've got nothing better to do. It struggles to even elevate itself to mediocrity. And in a genre as over-saturated as shounen, a lot of viewers are looking for something better. And there's plenty better out there than this - including the author's previous work.

This is my review of Beet the vandel buster. The anime series covers what id like to call the Grunide saga in the manga. The story itself is not new at all its a generic shonen type story, that does not mean its bad it just means that its not something that will blow your mind away.  
 
Story- fair (6),  
 
The art during the main story is okay, its good enough to convey the plot, however sometimes character faces and bodies seem off. The filler episodes at the end show this blemish. 
 
Art- fair (6) 
 
One thing i can gladly say that is great about this anime is the sound more importantly the back ground music, the music is fully composed and beautifully orchestrated. The only thing not making it outstanding is that the music is somewhat overused and the opening and ending themes are horrible.  
 
Sound- great (9) 
 
The characters are run of the mill shonen, you got the hero,the love interest, the one for the fan-girls and the obvious fan service character. What i like though is that Beet is not entirely an idiot like other shonen characters, though he has his moments he acts like any 15 year old would and actually becomes serious when he needs to, really the only time he is an idiot is during the filler. The Jiiku warriors are characters not in the manga, and they are decent as well, i totally believed them to be full characters before i found out they were not in the manga. The vandels or ''bad guys'' are not just crazy evil people, they have emotions and let the viewer actually care, for the most part. 
 
Character- good (7) 
 
Now if you're in to shonen anime you will like this, if you want something deep you may not, but don't count it out, some parts of the anime are really intense and the anime is directed intelligently. 
 
Enjoyment- good (7) 
 
Overall this anime does not bring much new to the table of shonen but it it is still a good anime to check out, it wont change your view of life but you will enjoy this anime. I wish i could say the same for the sequel.  
 
OVERALL- GOOD (7)

Not much to stay regarding this battle shounen. It has simple concept, world and characters but it's simplicity is what made it fun to watch. It's about adventurers killing demons, gaining strength and levels. Enemies have star levels, hunters a.k.a busters gain levels from doing various thing. in a sense it gave a feeling of mmorpg. Party up, level skills, get exp, get levels, get money. It was a nice touch. 
 
The main characters main goal is to pretty much, cleanse the world. Main characters consist of 3 people. Beet the ""dumb"" yet straightforward boy with ability fo maintain multiple weapons. (which was nice concept, haven't seen many Anime where character manages multiple different type of weapons), then we got Poala the girl who gets angry easily and has to maintain Beet all the time. The violent tsuntsun. 3rd guy shows up later but to avoid spoiling all I can say regarding him that he is the intelligence type'ish. 
 
I did really enjoy music and soundtrack in this one. Well was fun and pleasant to listen to. 
 
Overall the anime was straightforward battle shounen. It seems one of those anime that you normally won't find. I personally popped onto this one because saw in the ""Recent Friend Updates"", where someone added it into plantowatch. But yeah, at start I wondered whenever give this anime 6 or 7, but considering it's age and how quickly I finished it, It's good to say that I enjoyed it a fair share. 
 
And for the end I can comment regarding ""age rating"". It's apparently for children, yet stuff did die there obviously and some in a sense in a quite bad way. So a bit odd rating decision.

          
 
       Helpful There was just something about Beet that didn’t work. While there were plenty of cool bits and interesting characters (as well as a world setup I thought to be quite novel) it just didn’t seem to gel for me. Perhaps it was the sheer scope of the story and the (correct) feeling one gets that it’s just not going to be fully addressed. By the end of the first series (52 episodes) we've only really seen the coming together of four out of what looks to be a five man team and the series cuts off right in the middle. But apart from that there's something that just doesn’t work for me, something that I find rather hard to put my finger on. This is still worth a watch, because if it works for you there’s plenty there and even if it isn’t it may be worth watching the first five or so episodes just for the novelty value of the world setup and the Vandel designs. I'm hoping that the sequel to this (Beet the Vandel Buster: Excellion) will manage to draw out and sustain the high points of the series.

","Let me state first that i had a great expectations of 2nd season of this anime. The prequel provided great introduction to the world and left the story at fairly interesting point. That is why i don't fully understand this continuation. The 2nd season fails as a sequel up to a point that it could be even called a side story. No, maybe a GIANT filler fits it better.  
All ideas and setups that made the 1st that much interesting are basically abandoned in this season. An entirely different set of allies and enemies. No more experience points and guilds, no ranks, no more adventures either. Out a freaking blue, due to some ""forced"" circumstances, the whole team forgets about their dreams and goals and decides to grow roots in one place for the whole 25 episodes. For those that expected some follow up of the main story it's a big disappointment.  
Having that much in mind - Excellion became boring. This season defines the average. It doesn't leave a bad taste but definitely wouldn't feel like watch it again.

So what even happened? I did enjoy the first season a lot. Whilst this one just bored me to death and thus dropped. The whole season (the whole 13 episodes I watched) felt as a filler season. Basically plot about Beet and his team crashing into city and camping there for the rest of the anime. Random boring villains get sent to attack the city and Beet team defends. Also the main enemy is also quite boring. I quickly skipped to the last episodes to see whats going on and yeah...indeed it's all about the warden. 
 
Point being, fights were boring, villains and characters felt useless. And the whole Beet training the tengeki was also quite a boring presentation. 
 
I'm not sure what happened here, but one thing for sure. In comparison of the first season, the second one is utter letdown and boredom.

First of all, The first season, The first season wasn't really that great It was Average/Mediocre for me. 
Mostly because at that time there were other school Idols anime which dominated the genre of School idol. But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point. 
 
It's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the μ's and want to perform at Love live, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it. 
 
The first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way. 
Sunrise has made a big chance in every part. 
 
This season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode. 
 
The story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal. 
Now that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and μ's story 
 
Like any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED. 
The music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with ""Snow Halation"" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment. 
 
The visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??). 
The CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched. 
 
Love live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks. 
Like i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season. 
 
Like any other anime It has come to it's end, the μ's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the μ's!

In life, people encounter different forms of happiness. Some people find it in the places they visit. Others discover it in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. And yet others still find it in the bonds of everlasting friendship. It's with this last part in mind that Love Live! School Idol Project 2 ""sets the stage."" When it comes to a feeling of togetherness, no other show comes close. 
 
STORY 
 
Love Live! 2 begins where the first left off. That is to say, the girls of Muse discover that a second Love Live is being hosted, and it is their goal to achieve their dream of conquering the ultimate School Idol prize. 
 
LL2's main focus is in its idols, singing, and dancing. And for the majority of the show, this focus is executed very well. The show's highlights are definitely the compositions that the girls sing and dance to. Many of the songs deal with the problems and feelings they are experiencing at that time. Whether it is about a sense of love or feeling the need to be the group they've always been, the songs do a wonderful job of capitalizing on the shows overall themes. 
 
With that said, what LL2 does better than LL1 is that it forgoes the misplaced melodrama. Instead, LL2 captures these beautiful emotional moments that leave the viewer both incredibly happy and extremely sad. I found myself getting towards the tears and burning throat when watching particular scenes, because after viewing the girls for so many episodes, their plight and their overwhelming love for one another really started to get to me. It's not something on the level of Clannad: After Story, but it is definitely hard not to get somewhat emotional over what is occurring. 
 
When the show isn't making you feel so down, it sticks to its method of comedy quite nicely. The show does a nice balance of character gags, jokes, and reactions that show-off the cute girls being cute. With the comedy, the show also delves more into its characters. It forms characterization for those that needed it and expanded upon those that already had it. I enjoyed this approach more, since it allowed me to see different sides to the girls than them just being cute. 
 
My teeny-tiny gripe with the story is in the ending. Not being shown anything afterwards, but if they somehow retcon what they did, it kind of defeats the purpose of the scenarios and events prior to it. I hope this isn't the case, but the way things are left off, I am led to believe that this is so. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Once again, LL2 does a fine job in the animation department. One of their best talents is in their facial expressions. They usually use more frames than needed (this is a good thing!), making their face movements more detailed than in other shows. The same can also be said for their general body movements as well. The show is not afraid to go all out in terms of animation. 
 
The same quality is again found in the dancing portions as well. I was a fan of the mix of CG and 2D from LL1, and I was a fan of the technique here as well. 
 
The art style itself is again rather plain, and the character designs are not terribly unique, but it's not something that should turn anyone off. One thing I found to have increased was the use of lighting. It seemed to have more of a presence this time around, such as with sunsets, night-time locations, and general sunny daytime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
LL2 features the same nine characters that it did in LL1, and the whole cast is quite likable. As with LL1, I'll focus on three (different) girls to talk about. 
 
Eli started off being the student council president and was rather stalwart in her ways in dealing with keeping the school open. But after joining Muse, she learns to not only integrate herself with others but also on how to have fun. She used to be rather strict and unforgiving, but the girls have her learn that sometimes just being with others can make your day that much brighter. She is one of the eldest in the group, and therefore one of the more mature and beautiful, so her character was always nice to see. 
 
""Nico-Nico-Ni!"" When you probably read this phrase, I hope you re-read it and performed its accompanying hand gestures! Nico is the girl who is both quite prideful but at the same time very sensitive to the things around her. She wasn't quick to accept that there were others just like her, but she realizes this season that the girls are not only their to further their own dreams but to further Nico's as well. Nico, over the course of the series, grows up from being a rather difficult to approach character to an understanding and caring one. It just took a few ""Nico-Nico-Ni's!"" to get there. 
 
Finally, one of my favorite characters from the show is Umi. Umi is serious, determined, and yet shy in certain situations. She looks out for everyone too, especially Honoka. While watching the show, she had some of the best reactions alongside Honoka. Plus, she's able to switch from being quite angry to severely cute in the blink of an eye. Muse literally couldn't have started without her and I'm glad that her character was as good as it is. 
 
Once again, LL2 does a nice job of displacing the screen-time among the entire cast. Nobody ever feels left out, and those that actually seemed to get less screen-time than usual actually got quite a bit more. None of the characters are to die for, but I still like them all the same. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP and the ED for LL2 follow the same pattern as the first season. That is, the OP is a School Idol song that is there to get you ""in the mood"" for the show while the ED is there to demonstrate the skills of the singers. I didn't enjoy these songs as much as LL1, but can still appreciate the work put into them. 
 
The soundtrack's most important elements are once again the rest of the School Idol tracks. My favorite is probably ""Snow Halation,"" but all of them were performed quite nicely and were amazing to listen to. I also thought the inclusion of the first OP was rather clever and a joy to hear once more. 
 
As a little aside, I feel like it is best to listen to all of the School Idol songs with the appropriate dance animations. Otherwise, I don't think you would get the full experience out of it. This is more of a personal feeling than a fact, so take it with a grain of salt. 
 
The voice acting is also wonderfully done by the whole cast once again. Each of the girls sings and acts their heart out, and I really couldn't ask for more than what we got. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
To be honest, I've never seen another idol show before this one. Going into this season, I knew what to expect: lots of laughs, great singing, and pretty darn good animation. What I didn't expect was the previously mentioned emotions that the show was able to elicit from me. I really like it when a show is able to make me feel enough to care about what is happening on-screen, and the show was able to accomplish this. 
 
I'm one of those dudes who likes to watch the cute girls do cute things. Honoka's infectious smile, Rin's cat-like way of talking, and Hanayo's pleas for help constantly put a smile on my face. One of my favorite moments from the show was their reenactment of each other's personalities. It was always funny to see them joke around with each other in these ways because the show does it so well. 
 
Most importantly, Love Live! School Idol Project Season Two does more than just making you feel happy, watching cute girls, or containing lots of singing and dancing. It leaves you with a sense of wanting more, and I truly hope to see the girls of Muse make their much needed return. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Good, both funny and emotional but with an unclear ending 
 
Animation: Good, art style is plain with nice dancing/non-dancing animation 
 
Characters: Good, more of the girls of Muse 
 
Sound: Great, OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs all performed exceptionally 
 
Enjoyment: Great, cute girls, dancing, and singing, who would have thought 
 
Final Score: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
The second season of Love Live is... kinda meh, at least, compared to the first one. 
 
It started out with the same story quality as the first one. It has moments of interesting character development, while also having moments where the plot feels slightly contrived. A few times, characters seem to speak up to give them screen time or to steer the story in the 'right' direction, even if it's somewhat out of character. This particular point seems very prominent, either because I expected more or that's the way it really is. Anyway, no real disappointments here except in episode 9. 
 
Even though things seemed to be going fine, disaster befell the protagonists. Faced with overwhelming adversity, they still chose to press on helplessly. There was no hope. 
 
Suddenly, everything was okay. People had helped them even when, logically, their efforts would have been fruitless. Seriously, they could could surely try but it should not have been possible. 
 
It felt to me that they, the writers, wanted to up the stakes exceeding the previous season then realised they couldn't solve it realistically. 
It was still enjoyable though, plus, the last few episodes was what sold me on the previous season so I figured there was still hope. Episode 11 was headed in a hopeful direction with heartfelt moments. 
 
Episode 12 was okay up until the rather contrived ending with the overt intention to make people tear. Felt forced and didn't work. After what seemed to be a finale, episode 13 seemed to be to tie up all loose ends on a positive, if somewhat sad, note. Unfortunately, it was dragged out with several scenes and character actions meant to evoke sadness, but felt too forced to do so. 
 
Overall, it started okay and sometimes good at first, but the ending, among other things, was a letdown. 
7/10

Each character has their own unique vehicle, story and reason for entering the F-Zero Grand Prix, but the most well known character is Captain Falcon. The winner of the Grand Prix receives a huge sum of prize money, but many pilots have been lost pursuing it.The F-Zero games are derived from the 20th and 21st century Formula One races and the fictitious F-Max Grand Prix races from the 24th century. The games portray races in the future as having come under the influence of wealthy ex-space merchants. They thought that a fast and violent race would be an effective way to get people to gamble, so the ex-merchants established the F-Zero Execution Project. The F-Zero Grand Prix dates to the 26th century, and is still sponsored by the wealthy elite who originally organized the Execution Project for those events. These races feature the most technologically advanced racing machines, competing in numerous circuits of fast-paced action. It is known for its wild fans, and usually eccentric competitors. Winners of the Grand Prix receive large sums of money, as well as a great deal of prestige throughout the universe.The F-Zero games are primarily set on a futuristic Earth in the 26th century, although some games take place much earlier and some circuits have been set on different planets. F-Zero X defined the F-Max Grand Prix as the precursor to the F-Zero races which took place during the 24th century. According to the American version of F-Zero GX, the greatest driver in the F-Max Grand Prix was Sterling LaVaughn; a statement that would lead to inconsistencies in the sequence of events of F-Zero's storyline.
F-Zero begins in the year 2560 where the human race's countless encounters with alien life forms throughout the universe greatly expanded Earth's social framework resulting in trade, technology transfer, and cultural interchange are carried out on an interplanetary basis. An association of wealthy space merchants created the ""F-Zero Grand Prix"", in an attempt to add some excitement to their opulent lifestyles. When the first race was held, people were angered at the brutality of the competition, due to the various obstacles and traps along the raceway. As time passed, however, they became accustomed to these dangers, and even began to demand more excitement and danger in the races. Winning the F-Zero championship soon became the highest claim to fame in the universe. This period of time is called the ""old-school"" F-Zero days where the rules seemed non-existent in F-Zero X.F-Zero X's storyline starts after the seven-year suspension of Grand Prix races due to the Horrific Grand Finale. The game explains the ""Horrific Grand Finale"" was a violent and fiery accident that burnt fourteen drivers to death, including Sterling LaVaughn during the old days of F-Zero. A racer named Super Arrow escaped unscathed as the only survivor. No racing was allowed by the Federation after the crash; despite the F-Zero racing prohibition, the sport went underground where many racers went to hone their skills in secret. The crash ushered in the establishment of the ""F-Zero Racing Academy"", after a speech, by Super Arrow to the Federation Congress, which helped to lift the ban. The fictional competition was brought back with the rules and regulations revised.F-Zero: Maximum Velocity takes place twenty-five years after the SNES title in the year 2585. Players race against the descendants of the original F-Zero racers. Maximum Velocity is considered a reboot continuity to the rest of the home console titles since the game has made no indication of the safety revisions carried forth after the huge accident, in fact it states just like the original F-Zero game, the extreme danger involved when participating in those races.
F-Zero GX does not mention the Grand Finale event, but instead the game states Sterling LaVaughn was racing during the F-Max era and the F-Zero Grand Prix was suspended four years ago. This game states the character Mighty Gazelle was injured in the huge accident four years ago. The Nintendo 64 game mentions that Mighty Gazelle's accident and the accident that suspended the Grand Prix were two separate events.F-Zero: GP Legend is set in a different continuity and begins in the year 2201. It was continued with F-Zero Climax. These games feature some different incarnations of Captain Falcon, Zoda, and other characters.

Many video games have been lauded for their brilliant plots. The minimalist storytelling, yet heavy symbolism of Shadow of the Colossus, which says so little in dialogue, yet evokes so much emotion. The knee slapping satire of the first Bioshock against Randian Objectivism. The astounding amount of lore, world building, and background that went into the Elder Scrolls games, or Mass Effect. The lovable characters, excellent action, and vibrant imagination of the Final Fantasy games (well some of them). Then there is F-Zero. It was a decent racing game on the SNES. Why did it get an anime? Who the fuck knows?! 
 
Of all the oldschool video games to receive anime adaptations, I perhaps find this one the most baffling of all. Captain Falcon is a blast to play in Smash bros, but he isn't a character worth actually writing about, let alone watching. He isn't likeable in any way. He isn't interesting. He doesn't have a single character trait that makes me give a shit about watching something with him in it. This anime is also brought to us by 4kids Entertainment, so you can just guess what kind of QUALITY voice acting and brilliant Westernization you can look forward to. 
 
Here is the question you are probably asking: ""Why did I rate this as high as a 3?"" The reason is that after 51 boring, tedious, horrible fucking episodes this anime goes out with one of the most delicious crescendos in the history of animation. In classical music you have examples like the final segment of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, The fourth movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the beginning of Act 3 of Wagner's opera Die Walkure. In anime, you have Captain Falcon leaping out of a car traveling at light speed, screaming FARUKAN PANCHU, and punching a cheesy looking villain so fucking hard that it destroys a large portion of the God damned GALAXY! Absolutely brilliant. A single tear of pure joy slid down my cheek while taking in such a magnanimous segment of animated glory!

          
 
       Helpful Well, first review, don't expect anything wonderful from this. 
 
F-Zero: The Legend of Falcon is an alternate version of the mainline F-Zero video games in which I'm a fan. 
 
The Story is not entirely focused in the series mascot, our greatest bombastic hero Captain Falcon, but he's a key character of the events too. Instead, it focuses on the adventures of Ryu Suzaku, a man with a feud against a Criminal for a very, very long time, but that's only a little bit part of the series that I don't tell more, but also focuses on the other racers as well, while deviating things, some of the characters got better, ESPECIALLY Samurai Goroh and Black Shadow. 
 
The art and drawing is decent for early 2000's standards, but the maximum detail is in the cars, especially in the races, which is the central attractive of the anime series (Same as the games.), the use of CGI was decent. 
 
The soundtrack for the series is basically many tracks of the game in an epic format, a very strong point for being a throwback for the games, for example, Mute City, Big Blue, etc. 
 
I enjoyed the series so far, in fact, the finale became notorious for a Smash Bros. reference. 
 
I recommend the anime generally for fans of racing series and retro stuff, but also fellow F-Zero fans, too even if the protagonist is different.

          
 
       Helpful Let me be clear, I am a hardcore F-Zero fan. This anime is loosely based on the CHARACTERS of F-Zero instead of the story of F-Zero. Why? Because F-Zero never really had a plot. It took the series 13 years to give the characters back story. And what a back story they got. From superheros to supervillians, bounty hunters to intergalactic fed-ex employees to a disgruntled ex taxi driver using his cab as a racer. given these new intensive backstories, combined with the hardcore action and raw speed of the games, an F-Zero anime sounded like a great idea. 
 
       Where F-Zero GP Legend falls flat the most is story and the characters  in the anime. Ryu/Rick seems to have a pretty bad case of the Gary Stu syndrome early on, until you realize that he is useless. In fact, most of the characters are useless except for Captain Falcon. Jack Levin, a pop idol and member of a secret police force dedicated to shutting down the activities of several supervillians at all costs, gets his car jacked by some nobody that repaints it pink with flowers and enters the F-Zero race RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SECRET POLICE FORCE, WHO KNOW THAT THE CAR IS LEVIN'S. What do they do? They confront her before the race, she doesn't care, races, loses the race, gets cornered, and escapes, leaving the car behind. Most if not all the non-human racers form the games are reduced to petty goons regardless of backstory. all the characters seem about as deep as a puddle 3 sunny days after a storm. 
 
       This anime should have had a strong point in action and animation due to the natural sense of speed the games offered, but the mediocre animation never allows the pace anything faster than a brisk walk. Once, Ryu/Rick completely screws the pooch, and rolls his craft at MACH 2. Instead of the fiery crash I was expecting, the Dragon Bird sort of bounced upside down for a little bit and slid to a stop after cutting several times to an interior shot of a constipated looking Ryu/Rick. The sum total of the damage was a scratch that may or may not have been there. 
 
       I enjoyed this anime up until episode 17 or so, when the hilariously Engrish fansub I was watching suddenly became entirely incomprehensible so I switched to an English dub. This was a mistake. The dub I had chosen was the Stonestream dub, a fan made dub of ear-sodomy. after switching back to a sub that was of much better quality, I soon found the only source of  enjoyment was gone and I was forced to find another. I found this in the BGM. Compared to the rest of the anime, the BGM is a tasteful well done re-imagining of the source material. The original tunes from the games are remixed slightly. I recognized Fire Field, Mute City, Big Blue, and a few others. but these are really not enough since the rest of the SFX sounds laughably generic. 
  
        Overall, I really wanted this anime to be good, but it just isn't. I was so much better at F-Zero than making friends growing up. I was excited when I heard of this anime. but instead of the tasteful tribute of a beloved childhood friend, I got a gibbering oaf doing a puppet show with crayoned in cardboard cutouts.

","You know, if this was done by another studio, I would have dropped this show in an instant. Since this was made by Kyoto Animation and I admit, I'm a big KyoAni fag.....I mean fan, I decided to watch all 13 episodes. After 13 weeks of watching this show, I'd like to send a personal note to the studio and it's going to say something like this: 
 
""What in God's name happened to you KyoAni?!!""  
 
 
[Story]: (2/10) 
""You can't believe everything you see, or can't see, for that matter."" 
Phantoms, beings that blur the line between illusion and reality, wander around right under the noses of unsuspecting humans. Their origins are mysterious and few can see them. That is, until a research facility bombing spreads a virus that gave ""birth"" to what we now know as ""Phantoms"". Humans with special powers are given the task of sealing the trouble-making Phantoms. 
 
Honestly, when I first read the synopsis, I thought KyoAni would finally produce a dark and serious anime. But alas, Phantom World teaches me to never hope for a serious and dark story from Kyoto Animation. I just gotta accept the fact that the last dark and serious story that I'll ever get from that studio is ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" which remains to be their best work the studio has ever done. 
 
Welp, time to review the story.....Wait a minute? Reviewing Phantom World's story? What story? The synopsis led me to believe that Phantom world will at least have an exciting story but this show doesn't even have a single ounce of story. Phantom World is basically an episodic show. Each episode, a Phantom stirs trouble and Haruhiro and the girls (or one of the girls alone Haruhiro) will take down the Phantom and save the day. That's what literally happened in Ep. 1 - 11. The first half of the series are just a bunch of character introductions. We get to see their personalities, their abilities and what you should expect from these characters. In the second half, it's pretty much what I said above. Phantom causes trouble and the characters take down the Phantoms.  
 
From Ep. 12-13, we finally get a mini story arc that was actually serious and has an actual antagonist explaining why he/she is doing whatever the hell he/she is doing to the city and it got something to do with the synopsis' first paragraph. The short story arc was actually pretty good. It had an actual story, even though the story was short and the characters were suddenly serious and not annoying, Hell, even Ruru wasn't annoying. Too bad this wasn't enough to save the show.  
 
There is an explanation as to why the majority of the series was like a slice-of-life and Ep 12 suddenly introduced a serious story. Appearantly, it isn't until Volume 2 where the story turns dark and serious and majority of the show is adapted from Volume 1 which explains the slice-of-life aspect of the series. If this was a 2 cour series then Phantom World would turn out a lot better.  
 
Ranting aside, I did enjoy the show. How did I enjoy this show you ask? Simple, I switched my perspective when I realized that Phantom World will not have a story arc and will instead, be a random episodic show. Since I also watch a lot of slice of life shows, I looked at this show from a SoL viewpoint and I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected. The comedy aspect is there and the characters are surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This show was basically a time-killer for me. A show where I can turn my brain off and relax.

As usual, Kyoto Animation produces one of the best animation in the industry. Great art, Great character designs, the lighting is amazing, the background is well-drawn, and the animation is very smooth and consistent. Just think of Hibike Euphonium except the character's faces aren't blushing all the time.

[Sound]: (10/10) 
The soundtrack was simply amazing!! Kyoto Animation did a shitty job on Phantom World's ""non-existent"" storyline but on the other hand, they did an outstanding job on the show's Battle scene's OST.  Especially that battle theme that plays when the characters are about to do their special moves. I wish I could post a video where the battle theme is playing because explaining it won't do justice to the show's soundtrack. Now the OP and ED theme song(s) 
 
The OP theme song is ""Naked Dive"" by SCREEN mode and the ED theme song is ""Junshin Always"" by Azusa Tadokoro. Ever since I heard the OP theme song, I've been listening to it non-spot because it's catchy as hell and there was that one scene in the OP Animation where the loli was dancing while holding her teddy bear in the cutest way possible. I'm not a lolicon but I have to admit, the loli dancing caught my.........heart. I also love the ED theme song because it's catchy and the singer's voice is beautiful.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Characters]: (6.5/10) 
Haha, man..KyoAni managed to put every cliched and cute characters that you could ever think of in a single show. There's a generic male protagonist, a big-boobed senpai, a flat chested girl, a girl who has trouble socializing, a fu**king loli, an annoying fairy and a friendly/helpful teacher. The only logical reason why you and I watched this show in the first place (and somehow enjoyed it) is the characters. All the girls are cute, they all have a set of unique and cliched personalities that we have all seen before a million times but for whatever reason, we just keep coming back because we enjoy seeing these personalities (if they're done right) and the characters are hilarious when they're all together. Now, my thoughts on the main characters.  
 
First up, we have ""Mai Kawakami"" or what I'd like to call her ""Mayonnaise-sama"". I wouldn't be surprised if we get a mouse pad with a picture of Mai and her boobs used as a wrist support to satisfy all those horny Japanese males. Like her breasts are big as hell so you'll be seeing them bouncing all the time throughout the show even if you try to avoid looking. If you want to learn ""Boob Physics 101"", do watch the ""Limbo scene"" at the first episode because I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Her appearance aside, she's a complete tsundere and she does get a bit of character development at the late latter half of the show. Also, to no surprise, she gains feelings for the protagonist, though she didn't gain feelings for him randomly. A cute big-boobed tsundere = 100% ""pure"" waifu material.  
 
Next up, we have ""Reina Izumi"". A flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food but for whatever reason, she just doesn't gain any weight. Her ability is to literally suck up the Phantoms and that explains why she eats an abundance amount of food. Reina-chan is actually my most favourite character in the series simply because she's a flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food.  
 
Then there's ""Koito Minase"" or what I'd like to call her ""Headphone-chan"". Headphone-chan is basically one of those emo girls who brushes off other people and prefers to not socialize. Honestly, she's the most boring character in the series and if you prefer anti-social girl types then you found her.  
 
Then there's ""Kurumi"", a loli that serves no goddamn purpose in the show whatsoever. I mean, why does she, an elementary schooler, hang around with a bunch of high school students? What purpose does she serve within the group or the show? Honestly, I feel like her only purpose in the show is to satisfy the pedophiles and to back up what I just said, Kurumi is an anime-original character and she does not exist in the LN's.........Yep..... 
Well, that and to show us that she ain't a ""useless"" kid. She has that ""Albrecht(o)"" bear that fights alongside her and also to make her even more cuter. Nah, I lied..she's a useless kid.  
 
Lastly, there's the protagonist Haruhiko and that fairy girl that hangs around him all the time ""Ruru"". Haruhiko is like the weakest protagonist I've ever seen. The only time that he's ever strong is if he has that booklet or that final fight scene at the end of the series. Did I also tell you that he's also a generic protagonist? Oh right, I already did.. Ruru, on the other hand, is a likable character for me. Some, if not most, people might find her annoying but not me. I find her hilarious and there was that one episode in the late 2nd half that made her somewhat of a better character. 
 
In the first half, each episode was dedicated to Haruhiko and at least one of the female characters. For example, Haruhiko and Mai and the next episode, it's Haruhiko and Reina and etc. This basically gave the show a chance to give them a bit of character development. It's not much though. It's just basics like you learn why Koito is an anti-social or why Reina is acting the way she is. The 2nd half also developed Haruhiko and Mai's character but again, not that much.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10) 
Even though the story was pretty much non-existent, I still enjoyed the show. Phantom World was more of a ""turn your brain off"" kind of anime for me and also a time killer. I just didn't take it seriously and at the end, I wasn't as mad at the show as I was expecting to be. 
______________________________________________________________ 
[VERDICT] 
""Myriad Colors Phantom World"" may have been an enjoyable anime to me but I'm disappointed to say that this is now Kyoto Animation's worst anime ever. The story was basically non-existent and the only aspect this show has its going is it's characters and the animation/soundtracks. Though, the characters will vary because not everyone will enjoy the characters like I did. If you look at this show from a slice-of-life point of view then you might enjoy this series. However, if you're expecting a serious story similar to the synopsis then it's better if you skip this show.      
 
[OVERALL]: (6.8/10) 
 
 
Pros: 
+Enjoyable series when you look at it from a slice-of-life point of view 
+Outstanding Animation 
+Amazing Soundtrack + Great OP and ED theme songs 
+All of the character may be cliched as hell but they're still enjoyable to watch 
 
Cons: 
-Non-Existent Storyline 
-A lot of Fanservice scenes and that Limbo Scene 
-Too Much Mai Boobs 
-Kurumi serves no purpose in the show other than to satisfy the pedophiles 
-A bit of character development but there's not a lot 


          
 
       Helpful Musaigen no Phantom World is an anime that is both highly overrated and highly underrated. Wait a minute though, how can that be? Aren't those mutually exclusive? Not at all. To understand what is going on here, we must delve into some basic history of Kyo-ani. 
 
  For the past few years, Kyoani has been keeping this pattern of shows that feature cute girls with some supernatural elements thrown into a fairly straightforward story plus an overall lighthearted atmosphere. Amagi Brilliant Park, Kyoukai no Kanata, and to a lesser degree Chuunibyou are examples of this trend. And now comes Musaigen to add to this growing pile. 
 
  The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism. The characters in Musaigan all feel somewhat...familiar. Very familiar. ""Didn't we see this character in that other show Kyoani did two years ago?"" familiar. Musaigen is also very episodic, which is something anime fans probably didn't want. The result is a lot of people love to hate this show. It gets put up on a spike and hailed around as proof that Kyoani is done for. They have nothing left. Problem with this mentality is it just isn't true. It's hating a show for reasons that have to do with other shows by the same studio, which doesn't really tell you much about the quality of Musaigen as a stand alone work.  
 
  On the flip side, rabid Kyoani fans who love everything they do absolutely gobble it up like it's another masterpiece. Musaigen is decent, but a masterpiece it is certainly not. The story is enjoyable and the characters are entertaining, but it's also very forgettable. The last couple of episodes of Musaigen was the only thing that made the show stand out from the rest. The only key ingredient that makes the show worth watching over others from the same season is the higher standard of art and animation quality that Kyoani generally aims for.  
 
 The reality here is if Musaigen and Amagi switched air dates, they would probably switch critical reception as well. People would be hating on Amagi for being a clone of Musaigen. Musaigen, for all its troubles, isn't actually that bad. 
 
 If you can look past the controversy and just judge Phantom World for what it is and not what you want it to be, it's a good weekend watch. Just don't expect anything seriously deep or amazing. Go into this show with realistic expectations and it's fairly enjoyable.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Well, I enjoyed this! 
Visually very appealing, you kinda get to like all the characters, it is a fun watch if you don't expect much! 
 
Story is mediocre and the world building is a bit confusing at times. (like why is everything pixelated in the first episode? It didn't happen again...so what's the point showing this?) 
The characters are likeable, but don't progress really... Ruru-chan, the tiny Djini thinggets some development though. 
 
Art and Sound are pretty good. That's KyoAni for you. What I expected. 
 
The Enjoyment was there! I kinda wanted to know more about the world and wanted the characters to develop....but it didn't happen. MC just explained the world a bit with some scientific stuff....seemed interesting at first but there was no point actually. 
But the characters are fun to watch anyway. Though, they happen to be a bit lifeless. KyoAni could bring up some good stuff with it though. (with MCs mum for example. There were the standard ""childhood in the past"" episodes....buuuut, yeah....that's it. They just were there. They should have sold the idea for it to Shaft. Pretty sure they would have made something good with it. 
 
 
All in all it seemed like the creators had many ideasand wanted to buld in as much as they could. They only had 13 episodes though and missed priorities that way.  
That's how it felt for me. 
But was fun while it lasted.

9,1694,28,7.3121012,A group of people living together,iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia,"107 years ago, the Moon was destroyed in a massive cataclysm that shattered Earth's former satellite into 81 quintillion tons of orbital debris. However, thanks to super-science, the Earth itself was saved and today no one really thinks much about that century-past disaster. Which is why when teenage Haruka Amami auditions for something called the Idolmaster Project, she THINKS she's trying out to be a singing idol. Instead, Haruka finds herself at a secret school run by the Mondenkind Agency, living with a group of other girls who have also been selected as candidates to pilot an iDOL - an advanced robot specifically designed to intercept falling chunks of moon rock. Except, the people who run the Mondenkind Agency aren't exactly knights in shining armor. And then there's the question of whether the iDOLs are really JUST robots. Because from almost the first moment, Haruka starts to feel emotions resonating from within the iDOL called Imber.  
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Idolmaster: Xenoglossia centers around mecha and re-imagines the ten prospective idols from The Idolmaster as fighter pilots of those robots, with eight of them also posing as students. The large robots are called Immortal Defender of Legatee (IDOL) and their pilots are called Idolmasters. IDOL pilots have to be girls, and they have to be chosen by the IDOL itself. The Moon was destroyed 107 years prior to the beginning of the story in an event called Lost Artemis. This event caused numerous fragments to fall onto the Earth, which killed about one quarter of the Earth's total population. The remaining fragments of the Moon which orbit around the Earth are called Kompeito or Confeito. Once a fragment falls onto Earth, it is called a Drop. If the Drop is big, resulting in a moderate threat to the Earth, then it will be called Mint Drop or Lemon Drop according to sizes. Humans found a special silicon on Earth, probably from fallen Drops, and started research to turn that silicon into IDOL cores, of which there are five. The IDOLs are named after Lunar maria.
Haruka Amami, initially unsure of herself, passes an audition to be a singing idol and she is sent to Tokyo to start a career in the entertainment. She does not know that the agency that recruited her is actually a front for a big task force called Mondenkind which uses the IDOLS to save the Earth from falling fragmented pieces of the Moon. Mondenkind's job is to handle any Drop that is bigger than Lemon–class. While the other countries of the world have missiles to handle Drops, Japan is currently the only country which uses IDOLs to destroy Drops. Yukiho Hagiwara and Iori Minase, who also want to be idols, are also taken into the same task force.
","To tell the truth, I was not expecting much from this anime at all. Judging by all of the reviews and comments that I have seen floating around on the internet, I was prepared for a trainwreck. However I was pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong. 
 
Xenoglossia's plot is ridiculous, to under-exaggerate. Add robots punching meteors together with Girl x Robot romance, and plot twists thrown left and right, and you get Xenoglossia. However, for a good part of the show - until just a little over half way - we have a story better categorised as a 'slice of life'. Rather, as a 'slice of a mecha pilot's life'. For some people, this may be seen as an euphemism for 'slow', but I digress. These episodes were used extremely well for building up character relationships and personalities. After this 'slow' beginning is the point where the action really starts, and we begin the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Viewers who survive until the end of the series will be rewarded with one of the best endings to ever grace anime. (Disclaimer - the previous sentence is subjective.) 
 
Not having watched many mecha series before, my opinion on the art of the mecha may reek of inexperience, so I will just say that ""I did not dislike it"". Existing iDOLM@STER fans may be discomforted by the huge difference in character design initially, compared to the original designs, as was I. However the character designs have gradually grown onto me, and I can say that I have even come to like them. Other than that the animation is fluid, and there certainly are not many noticeable animation mistakes, as expected from Sunrise. 
 
The background music is merely 'there'; not overwhelming, nor was it lacking. Voice acting was top notch, and never annoying or unnatural. The OPs and EDs were very catchy. I always enjoy the intro of EDs being played just before the ED animation sequence begins. Xenoglossia did this in every episode, if I am not mistaken, so it receives a bonus in this category for this. 
 
Now we come to the best part of this anime. Remember that slow first half of the series? This is why it was seemingly slow: it is packed full of character development. It is only because half of the series is dedicated to introducing and building the characters that I was so attached to them. This is the first show I have watched where I was affected so deeply by the characters. Truly, my feelings reflected those of the characters - Haruka especially - and my heart was heavy when the characters were depressed. I could even understand Imber's feelings, who did not have a single line of dialogue throughout the entire show. It only through the continued exposure to the characters and their antics that we can notice these changes in character throughout the series. Because of this, every decision each character makes is clearly supported by their motivations. Coincidentally, this was the show which helped me fully understand the phrase 'character development'. 
 
As you may deduce, I enjoyed this series immensely, and I could not bear to see that counter on MAL gradually rise to reach '26'. As I have said in the beginning, I had expected this show to be a trainwreck. But to my surprise, when I had finished this show, I felt very empty inside. This has only ever happened once before, when I finished K-On!!, which I loved at the time. I did not feel like starting up another series, or watching anime, for that matter, which only ever happens when I finish series that I grow very attached to. 
 
So, what prompted me to write this review? Xenoglossia is so tremendously underrated that it depresses me. A score of 6.85 (at the time of this review) is usually reserved for very terrible anime. I am not saying that Xenoglossia is a masterpiece, but it definitely does not deserve such a low score. This score is easily explained though. 
 
A reason for this is that there is not much in the way of action in this anime at all, for an anime which is categorised as 'mecha' and 'action'. Most of the action during the earlier half of this anime consists of robots punching meteors in space. It is only nearing the end of the series that there is any considerable amount of mecha action. 
 
Xenoglossia is truly an exciting ride of emotions. It is a series that I will always look back on fondly, remembering the surprise I had when I could not let it go.

          
 
       Helpful STORY: Well, there's not much to say except it was your basic fare. There are some hidden secrets and such, and many of the people are connected in some way. However, while there isn't a problem with this formula, it was executed terribly. Most of the &quot;revelations&quot; weren't surprising, and when you expected something great, it couldn't have been any further from it.  
 
For a mecha anime, there was a surprising lack of action throughout the whole series until the end. When there was action, it was extremely boring. It's almost as if they were saving their budget for the end, and as a result, the ending significantly better than the rest. But still, this is not saying much. There were definitely some plot holes*, or at least events that should not have even happened if the characters had a fraction of a brain. 
 
Oh, and look out for some episodes (not that I recommend watching it) that basically mirror NGE and musical ideals that parallel RahXephon somewhat. It just seems to be an extremely bad mashup of other mecha anime. 
 
ART: I did like the designs of the mecha, especially when shown up close. Overall, the art was done quite well, and so was the animation -- again, it looked quite good for the last couple of episodes. There also weren't that many reused scenes (probably due to the lack of a significant amount of action). In fact, the only one I can't think of off the top of my head is the launch sequence. 
 
SOUND: I won't go into this too much. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't excellent. However, along with the animation, it was one of the better aspects. Plus, you should not be basing a watch on sound when there are more imperative qualities that are lacking. 
 
CHARACTER: This is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. I couldn't even count all the time I was left entirely disgusted with the amount of angst that all of the pilots had. Just when you think they became a better person and learned that important lesson, they regress back to exactly where they started. Talk about frustrating.  
 
And of course, the relationship between Master and Idol was portrayed ridiculously. The main character, Haruka, said multiple times that she loved her Idol. She even called it her boyfriend. I am not making this up. No matter how many times they said that the Idols might have something equivalent to a heart, it's a ****ing robot. Really, it started to get extremely creepy. 
 
OVERALL: I could go on about other faults with it. It's really just an average mecha anime, but they also did some very odd things with it. It just makes one question their thought process when they were making it. You also might be wondering why I finished it -- believe me, I had a hard time. But I just don't like to drop a series for some reason. So even though it was obvious that I don't like it, it wasn't bad enough to where I had to drop it. I definitely thought about it more than once; thank God it started to get better eventually (although it took around 18 episodes). 
 
 
*PLOT HOLE; HUGE SPOILER: For example, why could Chihaya pilot Imber near the end all of a sudden when he was supposed to be so finicky?

          
 
       Helpful I'm using up my first review for this show... 
I am someone who enjoys all sorts of shows with idols involved, and as a fan AND player of IDOLM@STER, I wanted to give Xenolgossia a try. First of all I don't normally watch mecha, so my knowledge about them is minimal, to the point I can count with my hands and still have fingers left of the amount of shows that have them I have seen.  
When you jump into XENOGLOSSIA as an IDOLMASTER fan, you are prepared for the consequences. Aside from Haruka (which doesn't saves herself too much either, but it is the most intact character) all the character personalities are TWISTED, in the meaning that they aren't what you normally see on the franchise. Do you know Makoto? the one that strives to become girlier and wants to be an IDOL? She is DARN SEXY but very mean towards everyone, she only cares about missions and her big  sister complex. Ami? DOCILE AND QUIET (wut) she is as energetic as her sister, but Xenoglossia didn't care, and made her to be a quiet (yet very helpful) girl. Yukiho? Not afraid of men anymore, still quiet, not so much change until later in the show. Chihaya? Well, not that she isn't like that, but they gave her plot, she is old and very dark as a person, even more than before, and I can go on and on about how the chars sucked... but there's a trick for this 
 
The only way you can really enjoy this anime is to forget that this even has IDOLM@STER characters. Forget it, and you'll get your run of the mill EVA wannabe show. Realizing this sooner would had prevented the amounts of time the impressions I had on certain characters crumbled into tiny bits. 
 
The story becomes good by the episode , but is still not good enough. If you are an IDOLM@STER fan, avoid this anime by all means. If you want to be tortured and suffer for the sake of supporting the franchise (like I myself thought was doing) do so prepared by reading the warnings above.

A shocking betrayal and a battle that risks all of their lives. After this revelation, they will never be the same again.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","The series begins by introducing childhood friends with quite a strong and close friendship: Syaoran, a young archaeologist who is investigating a ruin within the Kingdom of Clow, and Sakura, princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king Clow Reed. When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins, her spirit takes on the form of a pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions. As she descends into a catatonic near death state, Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch, Yūko Ichihara, to whom he begs for help to save Sakura. Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish: Kurogane, a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to allow him to learn what true strength is; and Fai D. Flowright, a magician who wishes to never return to his home world, Celes to avoid his king, Ashura-ō. In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions, Yūko demands that each pay with that they value most: Kurogane offers his sword Ginryū; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura's memories that involve him. Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura's feathers. After obtaining the first feathers, Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories. During their adventures, the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives. As they travel, they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them.
During their journey in Tokyo, the group discovers that Syaoran is in reality a clone imbued with half the heart of the original Syaoran. Several years ago, Fei-Wang Reed, the wizard who caused Sakura to lose her memories, took the original Syaoran prisoner and created the clone to collect Sakura's feathers. Shortly after the original Syaoran breaks free of Fei-Wang's hold, the clone loses his heart and becomes an emotionless puppet that follows Fei-Wang's will, betraying the group. The original Syaoran joins in the group's journey with Sakura wishing to save the clone. Foreseeing a future in which Fai kills the original Syaoran forced by Fei-Wang's curse, Sakura gets stabbed in his place, but at the same time splits her body and soul, sending each to different worlds, Seresu and the Dream World, respectively. In the Dream World, the Syaoran clone destroys Sakura's soul when trying to get the feathers. Before her soul perishes, Sakura reveals that she too is a clone of the original Sakura who was also taken prisoner by Fei-Wang. Fei-Wang then takes Sakura's body to use its stored power. The group departs to rescue the two Sakuras learning from Yūko that Fei-Wang is in an alternate dimension from the Kingdom of Clow. Such parallel dimension is the result of Syaoran's wish to save the original Sakura from Fei-Wang's curse years ago. In order to grant his wish, Syaoran became Fei-Wang's prisoner and Yūko's assistant, Kimihiro Watanuki, was used to replace Syaoran within his original world's history.
The group battles Fei-Wang who destroys the Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and strength of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn in the past to live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other, as well as their shared real name, Tsubasa, as they hope to meet again.
","Let me start off by saying I am among a minority of critics that feels the Anime series is a work of misunderstood genius and I'm probably the only one who's tired of the Bee Train haterz because OCD CLAMP fans can't stand anything that's different from the Manga.  That's not to say I don't recognize the flaws in Bee Train's TV anime series, but nothing is with out it's flaws.   With Tokyo Revelations being picked up by Production I.G from BEE TRAIN I wasn't sure what to really expect. 
 
That being said I've always been a long Tsubasa fan more so because I've enjoyed the story telling by CLAMP.   Tokyo Revelations I had mixed feelings going into, on the one hand I was delighted to see another anime adaption, on the other hand I wasn't particularly  looking forward to Production I.G's  new Gothic style.  But still I wanted to see if Tokyo was worth the hype and for the most part it is. 
 
Tokyo was very strange, dark and an extreme departure from the campy and brighter anime series broadcasted by NHK sure enough to please the OCD CLAMP fans. 
 
I want to talk about Nanase (or Aghea) Okawa's writing, which I found to be exceptional quality for her.   Mostly I've known Okawa's screenwriting skills for my guilty pleasure series Cardcaptor Sakura.  Okawa brought out the strong writing that really attracted me to Tsubasa and held me as I read the Manga.  I haven't read since the end of the Ashura Arc (having already seen the Dangerous Race I didn't really want to read it again) anyway Okawa probably brought out the strongest story telling so far of any Tsubasa anime adaption, which something the series writer, Hiroyuki Kawasaki, couldn't quite accomplish  but still managed in spirit.    
 
The dramatic and somber story telling was done in a very stylistic way that I wasn't expecting really.   The writing was action packed and dramatic with out being dark and mopey like other pseudo-Goth animes like Boogiepop or Serial Experiments Lain.   This also includes giving the much left out Sakura more of a central role and a pretty kick-ass story arc later, whereas in all earlier volumes of the manga and anime she has been the classical damsel in distress.  The awakening of the Clones was beyond strange yes, and even a little confusing but again Okawa wrote that in a sense that it was almost like watching a thriller as opposed to a fantasy. 
 
A highly unusual departure and downright scary it blew me away, it was intense and highly packed full emotion.   Overall you may be blown aback unless you just simply like this stuff to begin with.   
 
The new art and character designs is to be expected with a new studio taking over the production, as such I'm not a fan of the psudo-Gothic style of anime, so naturally, I can't say I particularly liked Yoko Kikuchi's new designs.  I did not care for the new animation style, I do want to say that director Shunsuke Tada was at least able to keep it balanced.  He didn't allow it to become overly saturated with blacks and shadows and dull unexpressive character designs and animation as most directors in this style do.   He allowed enough darkness to show a different style and allowed the tone and mood to be set to get us in the new world and not hit us over the head with it.  Tada has an easy style that is again often missed by most in this kind of Genre so my hat is off to him for keeping a relatively easy story line, and decent animation style.   But he dropped the ball in the Music Department overall. 
 
Music wise you'll notice 98% of the music is from the TV series slightly altered.  It's almost appalling that a production company of  I.G's status can't make a slightly more original, original soundtrack.  I'm certainly glad they have been keeping Yuki Kajiura on as Composer since she was previously brought in under Koichi Mashimo's direction.   Whether simply Kajiura was too busy to write new material I don't know but this is one of the reason I find Koichi Mashimo and his company Bee Train to be above the par with most.   All I can say is if you are looking forward to another potentially great score, you'll be rather disappointed as I probably heard 5 new musical pieces including the opening theme and closing theme.  It's almost silly people have complained about repetitive music in the TV series when it's equally obvious in this OAV Series. 
 
However, the opening theme song Synchronicity once again shows off the immense talent Yui Makino has especially when she's working with Kajiura and Maaya Sakamoto delivers a pleasant and well crafted ending theme.  Both Kajiura and Sakamoto are talented writers, and both can do wonders if they are given the chance.   
 
With the up and coming OAD's I really hope Tada get's his act together and starts having Kajiura write some newer compositions.   OAV or no OAV if you have a sequel make some new music, if BEE TRAIN could do it for their small 4 OAV series .hack//Liminality, surely a company like Production I.G can do it too.  (especially the way CLAMP fans have been making IG into a Mecca). 
 
Overall Revelations is worthy of a checkout and a full watch.  How much, is up to you.   I am happy to say it wasn't a waste of my time and I will look forward anything new I.G. brings to the Tsubasa Universe.

— Kurt Vonnegut, ""Eight Rules for Writing Fiction"" 
 
Many might have wondered why Bee Train and NHK failed to adapt the glorious game-changing story arc that is Tokyo in the Tsubasa TV series. But even if you didn't look it up on TVTropes the reason behind this, it's not difficult to tell why NHK (producer of the fluffy and romantic Cardcaptor Sakura) refused to adapt the arc... after you have watched this OVA series. Disclaimer for the faint of heart: Tokyo Revelations is brutal, visually and emotionally. 
 
""The Tokyo Arc"" features probably the most important character development in the entire story thus far, and it also surpasses all prior arcs in quality. Most impressive of all is its deconstruction of itself and the cliche of ""band of adventurers conveniently tagged along by companions with the proper skills and resources"" found in countless adventure stories. It also answers the question of what would happen if Sakura deprives a country of a feather that's an important power source to its citizens, a question that some viewers like myself have probably pondered prior to the Tokyo arc, I'm sure. 
 
Understandably, NHK refused to adapt such a radical story arc that literally changes certain characters entirely - some of whom literally becoming unrecognizable from their prior self. After their refusal to compromise, CLAMP proceeded to disown the anime and terminate their business partnership with NHK and Bee Train as the artists felt the anime had trod down a path that's vastly different from what they had in mind following the Recort arc. And what CLAMP had in mind was not to continue on some merry journey having light laughs while teaching platitudes for the kiddies and offering gratuitous fanservice. Instead, what we have here are some very cruel character development that's true to Vonnegut's advice: Sakura is no longer a naive Mary-Sue, Fai ironically falls into deeper despair than right before Tokyo (when he had become more cheerful), Kurogane finally learns important information regarding his mother, and Syaoran... oh, poor Syaoran. If you thought Syaoran had it bad before in regards to Sakura's memory of him... his character is literally destroyed in this OVA. In short, the Tokyo arc is darker, edgier, and far more depressing than anything Tsubasa has dished out before. 
 
The animation team of Production I.G. behind the Tsubasa movie has returned, and with it the more detailed and crisper expressions. Aesthetically, everything has also become more graphic - and this is in spite of the censorship still present within some scenes. Blood is present now, as it should be since several scenes in the arc just don't carry the same emotional impact when you don't witness the grave injuries certain characters suffer. Even the OP theme is darker in tone with its melancholic lyrics and melody, signalling to the audience that from this point on, nothing will be the same ever again. 
 
While far more faithful to the manga than Bee Train has ever been, some content was yet again cut out for either censorship or time-constraint reasons. Being a standalone OVA, it's understandable that they had to cut down certain scenes and exposition that are unnecessary to understand the plot contained in this OVA, specifically Yuko's explanations regarding Fei Wang Reed. That said, along with the censorship still existent in an OVA, it's quite a disappointment they didn't manage to incorporate certain important plot elements in here, including the aforementioned explanation. 
 
But that's a nitpick at best, for Production I.G. has truly stood out with this amazing OVA that carried the same emotional resonance as the manga. The pain and suffering of the characters here (and boy, is there pain...) are beautifully animated in details. Along with its amazing voice work, I believe this is the best way to experience the Tokyo arc first hand as you'll undoubtedly grab for tissues crying along with our struggling heroes.

It was only later that he became the Buddha, also know as the enlighted one "" 
 
Movie missed point.  Well this movie was something on a different level, it was breath taking and unique.  
 
Story: Well at first glance i expected it to be movie only about Buddha and not only his past, which was quite dissapointing. They basically only showed his past and event in that era when there was a lot of slaves trafficking, people living in poverty that had to steal to survive. Also story was very confusing from the beggining to the end and it was more focused on other characters than Buddha itself, or should we call him "" prince "" cause that fits more in this movie, cause they only showed a small glance at the ending about him becoming Buddha and going to search for the answer.Also it was very sad story, and characters struggling through poverty and prince enjoying his life, and he never saw life behind the wealthy life  until somewhere aroung middle of the movie, where he meet Migaila ( minor character ), girl that grow up in poverty.She had a lot of inpact on his view on the world and other poor peoples. 
 
Anyway it was very confusing but interesting story that was also depressive and sad for me, but kinda dissapointing ( and when i said kinda i mean just a little bit ) 
 
Animation: Now this was very good, it was way much better than i expected it to be. You could see how they put effort in every single detail but some scenes were a little bit rushed. 
 
Sound: Well it was good. And also outro song is really nice. 
 
Characters: This is where i felt kinda dissapointed. 
 
Siddharta Gauitama aka "" Budhha "" is good guy from royal family that doesn't really fighting and seeing other people suffer. Pretty much you can describe him as good guy from rich family that isn't looking down on other poor people or people with weak social status.He doesn't care about other peoples opinion that he shouldn't talk to poor and weak people. Also his voice acting was kinda bad if you ask me, i mean you could get guy from the street and he would do it better. 
 
Chapra aka "" Best swordman in kingdom "", "" General "" is the character that was getting attention most of the time.You can describe him as goodbay guy ( really don't know how to describe it, it's unique ) which grow up in a poverty and saw a lot of people dead. There wasn't really much of his feels in this movie except him showing his  love for his mother and reversed. 
 
Tatta  aka "" Guy with mystical power "" he is the character that i didn't really get much, he was basically once time with Chapra, and then Chapra went to become general and that's when all his trails are losing. But he isn't fully without feelings, he showed anger , chillness and i don't really know what much to say about him.. sorry :P 
 
Overall: As i statead in beggining, this movie was capable of so much and confusing story and voice acting kinda bringed it down a little bit. Anyway it's enjoyable and decent movie that can be watched.They will probably show more in sequel to this movie ( Buezuka Osamu no Buddha: Owarinaki Tabi )

This story talks about two boys who were born in different conditions. Chapra, is an ambitious slave. While Siddhartha is an aristocrat. 
 
The movies starts with introducing the main characters; giving the viewer an idea of ??the characters relations to each other, and also tells us about the current setting; which is a cruel world with a never-ending war between two nations; Shudra and Kosala. Also the movie acquaint us with the four-social class system people live with; where the worst of the four were the laborers and the slaves. 
 
Since the other characters only support the story; i'm only going to review these two main characters  who serve as core of this story. 
 
The story begins with Chapra; a slave boy who couldn't bear the cruel life of being a slave. it will start with showing us how Chapra befriended with Tatta. Chapra's journey starts after he made a selfish request from  his friend Tatta to help him in becoming a Kshatriya warrior; to make a better life for himself. And in order to achieve his goal, he goes through a mutually beneficial relationship with one of the well-known Kosalan generals. 
 
The other boy Siddhartha, was born in a royal family. He was a child growing bored of the privileged life of a prince, and forced to learn military tactics and swordsmanship by his father; in order to become his successor. But unlike his father; he despises war, hates violence, and uninterested in glory; which resulted in making him inspired to seek the answers of the purpose of life, to seek a way to end the meaningless wars. 
 
The movie was a bit too rushed at the beginning which was weak, making some of the character's decisions feels like...robotic, non-alive. 
 
The Art/Animation was good overrall. However, I was expecting better animations for a movie. 
 
Sound:  Music wasn't prominent, but wasn't unfitting either. Voice acting was good overral except for young Siddhartha's voice which was like somebody was just reading from a paper without feelings. 
 
Overrall: likeable themes such as the historical setting and good depiction of social issues even though it didn't focus on them that much. The movie was very well done overrall. 


          
 
       Helpful To me, this movie completely misses its (presumed) point. 
 
SYNOPSIS: The creators try to get the viewer feeling nearly as bad about all the suffering in the world as Siddharta/Buddha does, they failed for 2 reasons: 
- rushed simplification 
- the use of a lot of violence to ENTERTAIN the viewers, which (out of complete paradox) contradicts the primary purpose 
 
Being about the life and struggles of Buddha I just expected something completely different.  
 
Before watching it I didn't know that the producers planned it to be the start of a series of films, I also do not know the manga. My expectations were nurtured by two books: 
'Siddhartha' by Hermann Hesse 
+ 
'Old Path - White Clouds' by Thích Nh?t H?nh 
Even with keeping these good books and my perception of Buddha out of mind this first movie is rather weak, misconceived and filled with... yeah, fillers that add nothing to the story of Buddha. 
 
It doesn't go into philosophical depths, which it could at least try (while being about Buddha), but maybe I can free the makers of some of their debts here because most of the philosophising sure is supossed to happen in later phases of Siddharta's life. 
 
By the end of the movie he makes a really strong and hard decision. But the way he asks himself questions about the world and its cruelty doesn't get me convinced about his decision at all (unlike the non-movie Siddharta - which is, by the way, annoyingly called SHIddharta throughout the movie) 
His unsettlement seems rushed and WAAAAY too simplified to me. 
 
Also, I feel like the movie character Siddhartha directs his questions/views just too much on the material world (war/sickness/dying) and too less on the suffering of mind+soul. 
With all the violence in this movie the producers couldn't have aimed for an 'all-family' audience and therefore its depth, its philosophising could and SHOULD be more profound. 
 
As I said above the side-stories don't add depth or entertainment to the story. One can clearly see why the creators included them into the movie: to give us a clue about the sorrows Siddharta is feeling, but because of their simplification and stereotypy that just didn't work out at all. 
 
The art and music is pretty solid. What you'd expect from a Tezuka adaption: strong, sometimes even a little too loud colours, not even ONE more pencil or brush stroke than necessary to depict a character and solid animation (only with lots of animals and warriors in the picture the animation was somewhat jerking). 
 
All in all...... a HUGE bummer! (that didn't get me interested in a continuation) 
5/10

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Harem', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Mecha']","Kurou Daijuuji is a poor detective living in Arkham City. One day, he receives a request from Ruri Hadou of Hadou Financial Group to search for a magic book. While he initially refuses, Ruri offers him a large sum of money upon completion of her request, which leads Kurou to accept. As Kurou searches for the book, he unexpectedly runs into Al, a pretty girl that is actually a powerful grimoire. They forge a contract with each other, bestowing Kurou with powerful magic. Soon afterwards, Al also activates Demonbane, a deus machina owned by the Hadou Financial Group, to combat the mechanical menace from the Black Lodge, beginning the war between the Hadou Financial Group and the Black Lodge.
Demonbane takes place primarily in a region resembling the Lovecraft Country common to several of the Mythos stories, including Herbert West-Reanimator and The Shadow Over Innsmouth. The majority of the plot is confined to Arkham City, the home and headquarters of the Hadou Financial Group as well as the location of the Miskatonic University.  Arkham City is also the territory of a criminal organization known as the Black Lodge, which has access to an array of giant mecha as well as a number of powerful sorcerers that make it difficult for law enforcement to effectively combat.  A separate portion of the story is set in the coastal town of Innsmouth and one of the climactic battles takes place over the sunken city of R'lyeh.  The town of Dunwich is also referenced.
In the space above Earth, the Deus Machina Aeon clashes with another unknown machine but due to its lack of a ""master"" it is defeated and crashes on the surface of the planet.  Meanwhile, a starving Kurou Daijūji attempts to acquire food from a local church run by Sister Leica, a nun that he has known since he first moved to the city several years prior to the events of the story.  The next day, Kurou is approached by Ruri Hadou, the current head of the Hadou Financial Group and her butler, Winfield.  Ruri offers Kurou a job, citing his familiarity with the occult through his studies at the Miskatonic University: to procure a grimoire.  Unable to refuse the generous pay she is offering, Kurou agrees and begins searching immediately.
The search for an authentic grimoire is fruitless, until Kurou happens upon a previously unknown bookstore with several powerful books.  Unfortunately he is turned away by the store's owner, Nya, who cryptically states that a far more powerful grimoire is meant for him.  This prediction is later proven true when a mysterious girl falls out of the sky onto him, subsequently introduced as Al-Azif, the physical manifestation of the Necronomicon, one of the most powerful grimoires in existence.  Kurou is then attacked by her pursuers, the Black Lodge, under the command of the mad scientist Doctor West and forced by circumstances to enter into a contract with the grimoire.  Doctor West retreats, only to return in one of his giant Destroyer Robots.  Kurou escapes with the aid of Metatron, a masked hero that wages a one-man war against the Black Lodge, and stumbles upon an underground hangar containing an imitation Deus Machina, Demonbane.  After commandeering the mech amidst the protests of its owner, Ruri, Kurou and Al-Azif (or Al, for short) are able to defeat the Destroyer Robot.
Although initially incensed at the prospect of someone outside the Hadou family piloting Demonbane, Ruri agrees to employ Kurou as the Deus Machina's pilot.  Al wants to begin instructing him in the use of sorcery immediately, but before he has a chance to prepare, Kurou is attacked by the leader of the Black Lodge, Master Therion.  Kurou is immediately overpowered but his use of Demonbane forces Therion to reveal his own grimoire: the Pnakotic Manuscripts, also known as Etheldreda.  Therion spares Kurou's life, claiming that Kurou is the only individual who can alleviate his boredom, and vanishes.  Kurou then begins training in sorcery while simultaneously searching for and recapturing pages that Al has lost.  These pages eventually take on a life of their own and threaten the population, forcing him to subdue them physically before Al can reconstitute herself.  Kurou's interference in the Black Lodge's operations causes Master Therion to send two of his elite Anticross sorcerers, Titus and Tiberius, to attack the Hadou headquarters directly. Doctor West also repeatedly attempts to make up for his failure to capture the Necronomicon, assisted by a self-aware gynoid of his own creation named Elsa.  In one incident, West and Elsa are able to steal the pages relating to the Scimitar of Barzai and use them to create a copy of Demonbane that is subsequently defeated.
The story then moves to the coastal town of Innsmouth where Ruri has brought Kurou, Al, the Demonbane support team, and Leica on a beach holiday.  Sensing the presence of evil on an island off the coast, Kurou and Al begin investigating, accompanied by the rest of the group.  On the way they are attacked by Deep Ones and separated but each of the group is able to make their way to the island individually where they discover the inhabitants of Innsmouth, all Deep Ones themselves, performing a ritual to revive their god, Dagon. Overseeing them is another of the Anticross, Vespasianus, along with another powerful grimoire, the R'lyeh Text.  The ritual fails but Dagon is revived in an incomplete, bestial state.  The monster is only defeated when Demonbane channels the raw power of the Great Old One Cthugha, which nearly kills Kurou.  Kurou is later able to acquire Al's pages concerning another Great Old One, Ithaqua, and obtains a pair of handguns that serve as conduits for their power from a mysterious individual known to the Black Lodge as the Tyrant.
In the meantime, it is revealed that both the Necronomicon and the Tyrant are essential to a major Black Lodge undertaking, the C Project, but Master Therion appears unconcerned by the fact that his underlings have had no success in capturing either of them.  He placates the Anticross by explaining that he can use the Pnakotic Manuscripts in place of the Necronomicon and himself in place of the Tyrant but they remain unconvinced and plot rebellion behind his back.  Finally, when the stars are right, the Black Lodge begins a ritual that raises their secret headquarters, the Illusionary Heart Mother, into the sky.  They then reveal their full plan, using the R'lyeh Text to summon and bind another of the Great Old Ones: Cthulhu.  Using an army of Destroyer Robots and the wave of insanity that accompanies the summoning, the Black Lodge lays waste to Arkham City.  The Anticross betray Master Therion at the climax of the battle, seemingly destroying him along with Etheldreda, while Doctor West defects, disgusted by the perceived misuse of his technology.  While Demonbane is able to drive off the Destroyer Robots, the Illusionary Heart Mother is able to teleport away, the Anticross having gained control over Cthulhu through a series of emergency measures.
The Hadou Group is able to locate the missing fortress at 47°9′S 126°43′W and mobilises a multinational taskforce through its connections to begin an attack.  While they engage Cthulhu's forces in the sea, Demonbane is able to penetrate the fortress' defences and defeat the remaining Anticross.  Master Therion then reveals himself, reborn as a result of his unique parentage; his father is the Outer God Yog-Sothoth and the true purpose of the C Project was to sacrifice Cthulhu as the catalyst of a ritual to summon it.  Yog-Sothoth, the Gate and the Key, would then act as a portal through which the Outer Gods could then invade the physical universe. Therion challenges Kurou to follow him through the gate and, after saying his goodbyes, Kurou accepts.  Demonbane then battles Therion's Deus Machina, Liber Legis, throughout time and space leading to a clash between the most powerful weapon in each mech's possession: the Shining Trapezohedron.  Liber Legis is defeated but Al is finally able to access the totality of her sealed knowledge and discovers the identity of the one who orchestrated all of the story's events: Nya, also known as the Outer God Nyarlathotep. Kurou and Al battle the god and defeat it, preventing the destruction of reality. Nyarlathotep acknowledges its defeat but points out that it can always return with another scheme, leaving Demonbane becalmed in time and space.
","Although I am only on episode 2, I thought I would give a response on my initial view from these two episodes. It seems that there are negative comments for this anime, but in my view I find it quite fascinating. I do not like the entrance music, but the overall music isn't too bad. Pretty much what happens in this anime is a use of terms in a symbolic way and at the end you can read what each term means. I find it an interesting way to be informed on mythologies that I did not even know about.  
I would not recommend this anime to someone who does not have an interest in mythologies, because you will simply write a review as the ones that have already been posted speaking about how this is simply thrown together and just a  bad anime overall.  
I think it is that they cannot appreciate the interesting way of depicting mythology while at the same time teaching you about the mythology.  
So as a summation, I must say I quite enjoy it so far and I hope you understand what is so interesting about this anime before you watch it. If you do not like history and mythology then I advise you skip this anime because you will not enjoy it. 

          
 
       Helpful Well talking about demonbane, its worth watching... 
Though the music is so bad, artwork and story can make it worth.... 
Because artwork is so good. Every time we encounter the grimories, we feel like the character come alive.... 
And some battle graphics are good.. 
 
Other thing is that i expected a surprising and thrilling battle in the final episode but its not upto the mark, the final episode is little disappointing  to me..... 
 
Overall i suggest u to take a chance and try this if u love machine battles... :)

          
 
       Helpful This anime is a bit too complicated for me. I don't know if it's just because I'm slow or what, but it had so many complicated terms and side stories I can barely catch up.  
 
I did like the concept behind it. It was interesting, talking about grimoires and sorcery and combat, etc. but as I've said it tends to become complicated. The story is good, the execution, not so much. For one thing, there were way too many characters, and some of them popped up out of nowhere, in the middle of the story, making things more complicated. I ended the series without knowing what the woman-with-the-big-jugs' name was. 
 
The relationship between Kurou and Al was kind of bothersome. I know that Al is probably a 1000 year old person, but she looks so young. If I hadn't known her age I would think that she was around 13-15. I'd guess Kurou would be about 20 (since he went to &quot;college&quot;). It's just weird for me to see them so intimate with each other. Oh well.. I guess anything can happen in anime world. 
 
The graphics are great, specially the grimoires. They were all so nicely drawn. The guys weren't bad either, but Kurou's muscle tone kind of bothered me. He doesn't have a large frame, and yet you see muscles bulging out. 
 
The music wasn't bad. Most of the music were very upbeat and had high energy, like the opening song. I think it was something about God and machines. The ending song was a bit depressing, but I like it. I seem to like depressing and nostalgic songs, which makes me want to rethink seeing a therapist, but it's a wonderful song. Sad, but wonderful. 
 
I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it wasn't that bad either. I did finish it, and at the end of the series I kinda understood what it's about (but then again, I'm still not sure).

(Source: MU)","['Comedy', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Since this is based solely on my opinions of the show and I'm not an expert or specialist in the area, I would call this a commentary rather than a review. Also, because it is my first time writing something like this, minor spoilers and misjudgments are expected. 
 
I will begin by stating how I quite enjoyed Denki-Gai no Honya-san. After getting to know about the show and reading a bit about it, I sincerely did not expect much from Denki-Gai. As time went by and episodes kept airing, I began to like it more and more and ended up being a good, short one season anime. 
 
Story - 6 
I believe that the story of Denki-Gai was quite simple. Definitely not the strong point of the show. Although that doesn't mean it was bad. 
What I took from every week's episode was that the story was about the people who worked at the bookstore, how the bookstore itself worked and it gave me a bit of information about the manga industry in Japan. More specifically, about ""doujinshi"", a word I heard a couple of times but had no idea what it actually meant. 
There were also references to other anime which were quite smart and amusing, but the one which takes the cake, in my opinion, (SPOILER ALERT) is the one in the last episode, in which the characters cosplayed other characters from different shows voiced by the same seiyu. It's a shame that I only recognised the simplest one, Kantoku as Kirito from SAO (Matsuoka Yoshitsugu). 
 
Art/Animation - 6 
 
To clarify things, I did not found the animation bad. It was not that good, but in hindsight, I felt that it was appropriate to the anime. 
I won't say/write anything else about it, because I have very few knowledge about anime animation. 
 
Sound - 7 
 
I found the OP and the ED songs enjoyable and quite cheerful. Other than that there was nothing about sound that stood out for me, except for, the (SPOILER ALERT) ""Boys don't hate underwear"" voice. 
 
Characters - 8 
 
With Denki-Gai no Honya-san you don't get a lot of characters overall. What you do get are quite a few characters very relevant (Hio-tan, Umio, Sensei, Kantoku, Fu Girl, Kameko and Sommelier), two not so relevant, which still matter (G-Men and Tsumorin) and finally the rest, which I feel that are only there to make the store look legitimate and provide some extra laughs, for example, the manager. 
My opinion is that the character development is acceptable. You get to know more about the characters' past and you see, in some, them changing a little bit gradually. 
I would just like to add that I kept thinking that Umio was being ignored midway and at the end of the anime, but with the last episode, that ""issue"" was fixed. Also the seiyu for Sommelier should receive an award for best seiyu of 2014 because those lines were just class. XD 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
 
This is where, in my opinion, the show shined. It was so entertaining, I started laughing in the beginning and would only stop after the episode ended. 
Needless to say that was always happy to know it was Thursday and I would be able to see a new episode of Denki-Gai. 
 
All in all, for me, this show was comedic gold. No matter how I was feeling before watching an episode, I always felt much better after watching it. The anime certainly gave me a lot of smiles while it was airing. 
I apologise if the review/commentary is a bit long so... 
 
tl;dr: Great comedy and characters, short and enjoyable anime;  Tomita Takahiro best seiyu 2014 AHAHA.

          
 
       Helpful Denki-gai no Honya-san 
 
 What it’s like to work in a manga store, with heavy slice of life elements, that’s basically what Denki-gai is. It’s super funny, it’s all over the place, it makes very little sense, it’s a ton of great fun. The girls are all really cute, the way everything melds together works so well too. 
 
 Working in Umanohane, we have a nice large cast of characters: Sensei, the manga artist who’s trying to go pro, Fu Girl, a crazy zombie loving girl who loves horror manga and will imagine things in her favor to try and kill “zombies” (she’s really funny), Kameko, the one who takes pictures of all the events that occur, a slightly sad tale for her, but she has fuwa fuwa afro hair and is super cute, Sommelier, the silent one who knows what you like just by looking at you, specializes in ero ero goodness, Hio-tan, the clumsy one who is super embarrassed around the Director and tends to get picked on because of her body shape, Kantoku, or the Director, he loves to take video of things happening and is always a huge tease to everyone in the store, also manages everyone around and lastly Umio, the new kid, super shy, has a huge passion for otaku related things, daikimaru’s, pantzu, waifu’s, you name it, he’s pretty funny. 
 
 So what happens when you work in a manga store, well a lot, you deal with wild customers who are desperate for the latest manga releases, everyone wants the latest ero books, things in the work place are occurring, love is blossoming, tons of things. There are events that happen both in and out of work and as such, that’s what you’re watching in Denki-gai. Yes, it’s very slice of life, yes it’s 100% episodic and yes, it’s laugh out loud funny with what appears to be info on actual work in manga related places, so it’s pretty great! 
 
 I mentioned in my Ninja Nonsense review that I’ve never seen an art style as unique as it before, but here comes Denki-gai and what do you know, it actually has some striking similarities, especially in the way faces and eyes are drawn, so I think that’s pretty cool. Denki-gai utilizes some really cute colors for its’ art and is also very nicely drawn. I think it’s a cute anime to watch. 
 
 OP and ED, like always I have no complaints, I think they’re very cute, fun and upbeat, makes it easy to listen. A lot of great sound effects and BGM too, but the best thing were the seiyuu for sure. The girls, when they get flustered and embarrassed, so unbelievably cute, all the stuttering, all the high pitched voices, all the yelling and running away, all the squeeing when the girls are next to the boys they like, Ahhhhhhhh, I love it all and there is so much of it in Denki-gai, just soooooo goooooood ~, seriously ~ gao gao ~ 
 
 Denki-gai, it’s a good watch, gao gao ~ 

          
 
       Helpful Denki-Gai.  
 
Yes, I didn't know if to watch it or not, at the beginning I wanted to, then I didn't, and it went on like that for a while. 
And I'm happy I watched it at the end. 
 
So, let the review begin! With pros! 
The characters are amazing, I LOVED each and every one of them! They each add to the team and make the experience more enjoyable. They are so unique and funny, I just burst out laughing! 
 
The animation may be a bit childish but that what makes the show even cuter! The music was nice and fun. 
 
So now to the less pleasant part of the review. Cons. 
So each chapter is like a new story, and I dunno about you but like it that the episodes are connected. 
 
Another thing is the anime ended too soon and felt a bit incomplete, but of course that doesn't have to be a con if you like leaving room for imagination, and I do, but to me it still felt that way. 
 
Some romance included, but no making out, for all you who literally pray for kisses. That is somewhat of a con. 
 
And this is something I am not sure if it's a pro or con: 
The show is a bit messy and all over the place. Usually it would be a on, but here it makes the show sweeter, and more related to real life. So make your pick: CON or PRO. 
 
I would recommend this anime for people looking for a cute, silly and funny anime. It is enjoyable and fun to watch. 
But if you are looking for an anime with an actual plot, go fish! 
 
Hope I was helpful!

Story: Not the most original story in the world (also I think it was inspired on Devilman only with a biological focus) but it was pretty good.

Recommended? 50/50. Just decent. 

          
 
       Helpful Bio Hunter is an interesting twist of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Ghost Busters"", starring Akuma, and it really works out well for itself. This was a surprise turnout when considering the mean score of 6/10. I say, don't be fooled, Bio Hunter is nothing to pass up. It's one of the best examples of Madhouse's creativity working wonders in the past, and a reminder to why they are one of the best studios around. 
 
Starting with the sights and sounds, Bio Hunter doesn't wimp-out. For sub-HD video, the entirety of the screen looks crisp with great color-depth and some nice grain. It fooled me, while I was watching it, that it was in high definition. In reality it was only 480p, and that really shows something on the technical side of things. The art style itself is vaguely similar to ""Samurai Champloo"" with a bit of a sensation of realism mixed in. The animation is wonderful and the proportion-work to the characters is near-perfect. For a typical setting, there are plenty of detailed backgrounds and views that are pleasing to see and make the environment even more immersive. The art design is the more impressive aspect to be found, mainly in the detail and the design of the fictitious element at work here. Also, I'm happy to report that the english dubbing in Bio Hunter is one of the best I've listened to. There was no standout bad voice-actor, and the recording material was also very high quality. The sound design, in general, is also striking with a consistent sense of depth and with the great electronic soundtrack it carries. While the electronics are well done, the soundtrack also features some choir vocalized-tracks. The entire soundtrack summarizes with an ominous sensation that really fits the atmosphere and the premise. The budget is masterful in this OVA. 
 
The story and the writing is also noteworthy in its varied uniqueness. Without spoiling too much, the story is about two individuals who secretly work a job that involves them mending possessed humans. The setup is what will end up relating more to ""The Thing"", while the writing and career aspect is what relates more to ""Ghost Busters"". In the anime world, however, how Bio Hunter goes about both of those aspects is quite unique. Bio Hunter almost feels like an early-90's Hollywood movie that could've done well in theater's if it was in live-action (of course it would need a longer length as-well). The writing gives the two main characters some interesting personalities that make them very different in a line of anime characters. Koshigaya is similar to Bill Murray in ""Ghost Busters"" in how he won't take his job too seriously and will have a continually satirical attitude. His friend Komada, on the other hand, is forced to take things more seriously due to his situation, yet has a more respectful, accepting, and shy personality. These characters work well together in creating some dynamic conversation, and the situation they're in aids in keeping interest. Describing that situation might ruin a bit of the experience, which I wouldn't want to do. So, I can say that it may not look too original when placed aside many other possession-combating anime, but the characterizations and the slight infectious facet does bring about a noticeable change to the formula. Even so, I couldn't say that what's being dealt with in that aspect is explained thoroughly in this OVA. However, it's treated thoughtfully by the characters and it ends up making it very forgivable even though I was never bothered by it. 
 
Bio Hunter carries a moderately-western directing-style, and pushes through with an interesting story relating to a career in searching out demons. The visuals and sound are done superbly with good treatment to virtually every aspect. The english dub is a notable part of that as it's certainly one that would be hard to knock on. The characters are all well-done with uncommon personalities done by the considerably clever writing. Character interactions are many times riveting, and the direction is masterful at creating many moments that feel genuinely creepy. Many live-action horrors fail to reach the height of some of the creepier moments in this OVA. I recommend Bio Hunter to everyone as it's not old enough to have a ""dated"" art style and it's not lacking in any aspect. There's even a pinch of romance to settle those who are die-hards for it. Watch Bio Hunter. 
 
P.S. Bio Hunter has embarked on a new quest of anime mustaches, and I'm in full support.

          
 
       Helpful Bio Hunter?is a Madhouse film from the mid 90s based off of a manga by Fujihiko Hosono. Madhouse has a bit of a mixed history with horror themed anime in general. They worked on Blade, which was okay. Death Parade, which was fantastic and Highschool of the Dead, which remains among the worst anime I've ever seen. So, this anime could end up anywhere on the spectrum.? 
 
Story: 
We open with a couple having sex. She seems disinterested and just wants something to eat. Guys, if your partner responds like that, I'm sorry but you need to work on your technique. Maybe communicate a little and find out what they would like you to do. But this nameless dude is an asshole so he doesn't even think of that. Then her body breaks out into little faces and one of them rips his hand off. 
 
We cut to a Professor doing a lecture while one of his students writes flirty messages to him. He and one of his colleagues are called by a bunch of shady looking people and they find the girl from before chained up and covered in little faces. Which renders the opening sex scene entirely pointless. Because everything important about it is reiterated in this scene. It turns out the Professors are involved in fighting against the so-called ""Demon's Virus"" by using medicines and the infection suffered by one of them.? 
 
Here's my first question, if they have medicines that can treat this then why does one of our protagonists have it? They never cover that in the film. They don't even give us a throwaway line about how ""his is too advanced"" or something. We can have an entirely pointless sex scene but we can't cover an important plot detail like that? Are you fucking kidding me? 
 
But the narrative issues don't end there. We have plenty of other things that just aren't cohesive. For example, we spot a group of thugs trying to capture a young girl so they can find out where her grandfather is and, not five minutes later, they run her car off the road in an attempt at killing her. So, if they need her for information why would they do that? And if they don't, then why bother her in the first place when all it does is draw attention to themselves? Did no one proof read this? 
 
Then we have the effort at connecting science with fortune telling. Now, there's a reason most writers use either magical elements or real science but not both because it's difficult to justify magic using science and most people can't pull it off.?Bio Hunter?is a primary example. Particularly when they meet the fortune teller and try to justify his craft as him ""reading genomes"" which is exceptionally stupid. Oh, and our infected scientist has the lamest possible way of detecting other infected. He tears up. You think he gets false positives if his mind wanders and he thinks about something sad? You think the Beast Wars episode Code Of Hero has just popped into his head and left him wondering whether he was tearing up because of that or because of the virus being present in someone else nearby?? 
 
Characters: 
The characters in this are a bit shite just in general. Koshigaya is just kind of a twat. Komada is one of those super angsty characters who we never really see in another mode so it has no impact when he actually has some reason to be upset. He's not as bad as Shinji in that regard. He's a bit more subdued about it, but it's still terrible writing. The antagonist is just evil. 
 
Then we have Sayaka. I want to talk about her a bit because she is indefensibly vapid. This is a character who finds herself in a car that's going over a cliff, wakes up and never really questions why she and the other people are completely unharmed. Or why one of the guys doesn't have a shirt any more. Does she just assume that he was exposed to gamma radiation and transformed? Except instead of the Incredible Hulk he's the Incredible Disappointment. His parents were right the whole time. In all seriousness, this isn't something anyone, even a complete moron, would just accept. You were quite literally tossed off of a cliff in a car that's now a fiery wreck. This is something we need a lengthy scene addressing. You can scrap that pointless sex scene for it.? 
 
Art: 
The film doesn't look good, frankly. A lot of the animation is just lazy, especially when it comes to conversational scenes. They can't even be bothered to put any real effort into syncing the lip movements, when they actually have them, to the dialogue. The action sequences aren't anything great either. They're just generally boring.?3x3 Eyes?looks much more impressive and it started airing four years before this. And strong artwork is usually something that Madhouse works have, even when they're kind of shit, except for the aforementioned Highschool of the Dead?which is overly focused on trying to arouse teenage boys and for this which isn't that bad but is very low effort.? 
 
Sound: 
About the best thing I can say for the film is that they got some capable actors. I know that Seki Toshihiko can be good. I know that Inoue Kazuhiko can be good. I know that Minaguchi Yuko can be good. I've heard them all deliver strong performances. They don't in this. In this they just sound like they don't give a shit. Which I can't really blame them for. I don't think the greatest actors in the world could take this script and sound invested. Amano Masamichi's soundtrack isn't bad. It's just kind of mediocre. Which still makes it the strongest element of the film, sadly.? 
 
Ho-yay: 
There isn't any. Which is fine because what little romance they try to develop is pretty awful.? 
 
Final Thoughts: 
Bio Hunter?is a really bad film The script is a mess. The characters are annoying. Even the artwork, animation and acting are weak. And it's not even executed in such a way that it's at least entertaining to watch just to poke fun at. Ultimately, I give it a 2/10 and I'm tempted to go lower but I don't think it's that horrible.?I still can't recommend it to anyone.

9,2455,34,7.10696515,A group of people living together,Prayers,"It is the year of 2014, Shibuya is independent from Japan, and it becomes an independent nation. It is a town of chaos where only young people are living. The life necessity, such as electricity, water, and food are transported by the pipelines out from the Shibuya. The pipelines are running like cobweb in the sky, the young people in Shibuya looked like bugs trapped in the cobweb. 
 
In this city, there are people called ""Prayers"". They earn money by the battle of music. They turn music into electric signals and inject them into brains, and destroy opponents' mind and bodies each others. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo) 
 
Originally created as 4-episode-OVA, it was canceled after 2 episodes.",['Sci-Fi'],none,"There's often times when one watches a particular show (of any type), where the viewer suddenly realises that what they're watching is either trying too hard to be different, or trying to incorporate too many threads into the plot.  
 
Sadly, Prayers is guilty of both. 
 
Prayers is set in Shibuya in the year 2014. The Japanese Government has segregated Shibuya from the rest of the country, and in retaliation the popluace of Shibuya (which for some reason is mainly youths and young adults), declare their independence form mainland Japan. Unfotunately, an earthquake happens around that time as well, and the area ends up sinking below the rest of the country, effectively putting a wall around Shibuya.  
 
The survivors struggle to make ends meet, and in this somewhat brutal environment the population has found a new form of entertainment - praying (pardon me while I laugh at the failed attempt at irony). 
 
Praying is a form of combat whereby two musicians (or more if they're part fo a band), take to the stage and try to fry each other's brains with their music. 
 
Add to this a mysterious girl with amnesia, an evil corporation, a secret cult, and a musical ""genius"" who won't kill, and you've pretty much got everything covered. 
 
Are you following so far? No? Well neither was I... 
 
The story basically takes the concept of the battle of the bands, and attempts to amp it up (pardon the pun), by adding various other elements to the story, most of which are either redundant, contradictory, or just plain silly. 
 
Art and animation made this almost painful to watch. Some of the backgrounds were nicely drawn and coloured, however the ""action sequences were often nauseating in their confusion. The character designs leave a lot to be desired, as there doesn't appear to be any real thought in their creation. Animation is decent enough on the whole, however it's clear that this is one of those shows which were only made because the studios needed a project to fill a gap in their schedule. 
 
Given that this OVA is supposed to be about music, one would be forgiven for expecting something decent in the sound department. Unfortunately the music is often annoying at best, whilst the effects, and even the seiyuu, are lacklustre. 
 
As this is a 2 episode OVA, it's understandable that the characters receive very little development. However, even this cannot hide the fact that the characters are extremely poor. Tasuku could have been a decent lead, however there is virtually no explanation (aside from a few flashbacks), as to his presence in Shibuya, his musical ability, or why he won't kill. Shoko, on the other hand, is an amnesiac lab rat, so don't expect much from her either. The relationship between the two is hammed up to the nines, with the second episode being overly dramatic when it didn't need to be. Every other character in the OVA will just make you wonder how the hell they fit into the story, or why they're even there in the first place. 
 
Suffice to say, I didn't enjoy this. If I hadn't already watched Dark Myth, then this would have been a contender for worst anime ever. The only saving graces it has are that the creators attempted to be original (and ironic), the basic ""extreme battle of the bands"" concept hasn't been done before (and no, Macross doesn't count), and the fact that it actually had some potential if they'd made a series out of it.  
 
Unfortunately, the OVA fails to answer any questions, and never explains anything. Add to this the fact that everyone from the director on down didn't actually sem to care about the quality of the show in any way, and you're left with an OVA that is better left forgotten.

Against this backdrop, a pair of rival idol groups compete for the coveted ""tiara,"" which represents the number one spot in the ""Idol League.""

It seems the show is a part of promotion of a social game, but it was not. I have no ideas why the villeins wanted to make the heroins lost the competition and even wanted to let them to have no ways to get on the stage. There was no point to do that and it did not explain any thing in the show. It seems the show has total 12 episodes, but in fact, there are only 6 because each episode length 12 minutes. Another 12 minutes would be a variety show hold by those voice actresses of the show, and that was far more horrible. 
 
Over all, this show has not bad character design, but the story is bad. In the warring states period of idol anime, I have no idea why they think they can earn any money by a story with this quality. 3D model in the show is not bad though. I do not like the show, but I will not stop people to watch it because it still better than Idol Incidents. Nothing can be more stupid than that show.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The plot of Happy Lesson is based on five teachers who end up living with a troubled and indifferent orphan and their unusual plan to become mother figures in an effort to make him a productive student. To achieve their plan, they employ various methods, such as science experiments, spiritual cleansing, physical training, and hijinks.
Resembles a harem anime.
","So check this out Happy Lesson is comedy anime but wasnt on my scale for the best anime i've seen but then again theres worse. Basicly the plot is based on 5 teachers who live with an orphan and all try to become his mother and try to make him a better student through different methods. So nothing new right. Seen this in countless anime where a male character lives or are surronded with a bunch of female characters ex. Love Hina.  
 
Main characters are Chitose, the orpahn who moves in the house of his deceased parents. He trys to hide his feelings about his ""mothers"" but every now and then they leak. 
Mutsuki Ichimonji his homeroom teacher and usually cleans and cooks around the house. Shes pressures Chitose to study. At home she wears a maid outfit. 
Kisaragi Ninomai (personal favorite) she is the science teacher. She seems like shes emotionless but loves her son Chitose alot. You see that she experiments alot on Chitose. 
Yayoi Sanzenin is the nurse and priestess but the school doesnt know about that. She has a calm demeanor unless she senses danger and then puts her sword skills to work. 
Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher and is small. She is for the most part is happy and cheerful. Shes usually wears wings because shes into cosplay. 
Satsuki Gokajo is the p.e teacher and is serious about her workouts. Shes loud and agressive but can be sweet. 
And those are the characters you will mostly encounter with the exceptions towards later episodes you will be introduced to Chitose adopted sisters, Minazuki his younger sis and Hazuki his older sis who is a famous singer. You also will be seeing the class rep Fumitsuki who has a crush on Chitose and becomes curious about Chitoses life outside school. Also Kanna Kisaragi childhood friend and develops a crush on him. 
 
As far as originality it doesnt set the bar but then agian not many anime do. You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them. Like really cheesy. For the most part this occurs with every episode. In the end it wasnt on my OMG I gotta watch this list but If you got nothing to do and time to kill watch a couple episodes, you might like it. 

          
 
       Helpful Happy Lesson is about a boy / student who inherits a large house of his parents. He has a sister who's songs and a little sister living with big sister. He is a bit lonely in the house so he let his teachers to live in his house, but there must be a secret because otherwise it can go bad for teachers. 
 
Since the teachers stay with him, they help him to get up in the morning to go to school, cook for him, clean and wash house. He said even at the end of the anime that had it not been for them, he would had dropped out of school and no one would show how it would go with him. 
 
Since teachers are like a mother to him, he calls them ""mother"" and they can always find an excuse to have a party! 
 
At school there is a president, and it is a girl. She is in love with main character in this anime, but it's very difficult for her to tell it to him. He is very cold and dismissive, and she is of course disappointed, but it isn't stoping her. In the end, she finds out he has a secret, and do it mostly to find out. How it ends, I'm not going to tell! 
 
The end should I not tell anything about, but I can tell my opinion about it. Because this was a fun anime, not so tension-filled, but fun, so expect not a big ending. I had no expectations about the end, because the anime was just fun to watch, at least I could not imagine how one would be. Although I failed it was the end still fun and easy. You do not sit back with a lot of questions, and it was actually a very nice way to end an anime on. 
 
So I will not quit rate: 10/10! 
 
The song that big sister song I must say honestly that it was terrible for my taste. My taste, nothing more to say about it. 
 
Grade: 1 / 10 
 
The whole anime's ranking: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful I spotted this anime a few years ago, but since my own mom died around that time, I had to put this off until I could give it a fair shake. 
 
Happy Lesson is about a boy who lost his parents and was sent to an orphanage along with his sisters. Once he entered High School he was allowed to leave the orphanage and live in the house he grew up in. Except this time with 5 of his teachers wanting to become his new mom. 
 
~Story 7/10~ 
The story itself isn't very unique, but I did find some of the elements of the show to be very entertaining and cute. Some of it had comedy and some of it was simply fan service. 
Just be warned, the harem fighting starts almost instantly and it is like being smacked in the face 10 seconds into the show. 
 
Most of the episodes usually cover some basic anime formula elements. There is a Hot Spring episode, two with school festivals, etc... But in the end of the day, nothing really changes and everything is neatly tied back into a bow. 
Each teacher has a dedicated episode that seemed a little ridiculous. 
 
There are a lot of times where I didn't like what was going on because it seemed a little to much like a fantasy show. 
For example, there were robots and exotic animals and super frilly outfits that no teacher would ever be allowed to wear. 
It just seemed a little too much at times. 
 
~Art 8/10~ 
The art is good, the backgrounds are well drawn and you get the usual frilly outfits, and extremely weird hair styles and hair colors. 
The characters are sometimes drawn in a very cute fashion making me want to continue watching the show and favoring certain characters that don't get much time or character development. 
 
~Character 8/10~ 
Since each teacher had a dedicated episode it was a great chance to get lots of character development done. It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons. 
Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine. 
Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional. 
 
~Sound 7/10~ 
As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any. 
The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub. 
It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact. 
 
 
Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious. The romance part of the show pulled at my heart strings, but I am very disappointed in the ending, you'll probably see why.

","I loved watching Izumo very much. As soon as I watched episode 1 I watched the rest in one whole night! :3  The story was on topic, and fit well altogether. The ending was great!! Very detailed background, characters, objects, and powers!! ~o~ This is the best anime I have ever seen so far. I re-watched it twice. The opening song and closing were even the best Japanese songs to me. I enjoy a lot of Japanese songs, but OMG!!!!!!!! Loved this. Takeru 

          
 
       Helpful Izumo: Takeki Tsurugi no Senki is based on a Studio E.Go game  
(which I enjoyed more than the anime). 
 
Story: I found this part a bit lacking in Izumo. There wasn't anything special or unique about the storyline that would make it deserve a higher score. The story was ok. And that was that.  
 
Art: The art was decent, but nonetheless not good enough for it to receive a 7. In some scenes the movement of characters seemed awkward and unrealistic.  
 
Sound: The only thing that I found that was ok in this anime was its sound. The music didn't seem out of place and was fit to the event that was happening, engaging the viewer.  
 
Character: Truly, the character development of the story was fine, except that in only focused on a select of individuals. some characters were left out and made me think &quot;what was he there for anyways?&quot; the behavior of some characters also seemed ambivalent. 
 
Enjoyment: Honestly, I think one would get more enjoyment from playing the game rather than watching the anime version of Izumo. I didn't really get to 'enjoy' the anime since half the time I was trying to figure out why this or that happened.  
 
overall: Overall, I think this series was ok. If you have some spare time on your hands, might as well watch it, since it isn't that terrible, its decent.

          
 
       Helpful It\'s not that bad, actually. I had a decent time watching it. I have no regrets and I do not think I wasted my time by watching it. I just don\'t get why only a few people have watched it. So it\'s relatively new, but I would think that by this time, a lot of people had watched it already. 
 
Good points first. It was very easy on the eyes, and by that I mean the guys were easy on the eyes. All the boys were very good looking, specially Takeru. what a cutie. Everything was considerably well drawn - the backgrounds, the people (very kawaii girls, specially Sakuya) everything.The music was also great. I love the opening and ending themes, and I thought the background music was very nice. It really fit the mood of the scene. 
 
Here\'s something worth mentioning. The reason why people may not like it too much is because it resembles a lot of themes we have seen in previous series we have watched. The story here is that a group of kids are transported into a different world (Ne world). Two of these kids, Takeru and Takeshi, are caught in the crossfire and are forced to battle it out with each other. Apparently, they both carry one - half of the soul of this very imprtant guy named Susanou, so the future of the Ne world depends on them. Sounds a lot like Fushigi Yuugi/Kyou kara maou doesn\'t it? It even features the Shiseijyu aka the four holy beasts. Need I say more? 
 
Now for the parts that I didn\'t like too much - first, the \&quot;horses\&quot;. They look a lot like Jar Jar Binks on steroids. Second, yellow blood. I know they\'re supposed to be \&quot;evil spirits\&quot; but why can\'t they use purple or green blood that\'s more common and easier to stomach (at least for me)? Third, what\'s with Minakata\'s short skirt? He\'s a guy, and I don\'t need to see his girly legs. Finally, I am not a fan of the Takeshi - Himiko love team. It\'s just to weird. If Himiko\'s supposed to be like a priestess or God or something, shouldn\'t she be celibate? 
 
Those are just minor problems, so I still think that it\'s a pretty good anime. It might not be good enough for some people though, specially those with more impeccable taste and are picky with the anime they watch.

-The visuals: It's a good work but nothing special.The background and the sorrounding non-important  people are almost indifferent. 
 
-Sound:not much to say.Tough the opening is well made. 
 
-Characters: The characters are well made and some of them realy original(for example: Justice, who's the best pervert character ever made in my opinion). Almost all of them(maybe exept Najimi the primary heroine) are perverted in some way(yaoi fans to lolicon to masoists almost anything) 
 
-Enjoyment: This is one of the comedies where you must pause sometimes to calm down from your laughter.Not all of the episodes are that great but if you like this kind of comedies then you don't bored for sure. 
 
-Overall: It's a good show but not a must watch perhaps. If you like slapstick comedies and have some time(realy not many just 5-6 normal anime episodes lenght) then give it a try!

          
 
       Helpful If you’re looking for a realistic portrayal of the world of doujin manga then this anime is certainly not the one for you.  But if you want a few hours of mindless light-hearted entertainment then Doujin Work might be right up your alley. 
 
The story is simple and fairly formulaic.  Najimi goes along with her college friend Tsuyuri to a comic market where she is selling her work.  She becomes entranced with how much money can be made by a successful artist and dreams of becoming rich herself and after the market is over decides she will draw her own doujin manga.  As the story unfolds she meets new friends and rivals and tries to improve her ability and become successful.  While the humor and some of the content is perverted at times it is never obscene.  If you are coming into this series expecting a lot of echiiness and fan service you’re going to be disappointed because there is none of it.   
 
Najimi carries the show well and is a very likable leading character.  She’s not the most original character ever drawn but you can’t help rooting for her.  It’s not realistic that someone who is drawing ero-manga would be so embarrassed to do the ""research"" needed to get ideas for her stories but it’s funny anyway.  The rest of the cast is stereotypical as well but like the lead they are all fun in their own way.  The character who really steals the show is Tsuyuri, who with her dry and perverted sense of humor drives the majority of the comedy.  They all have the depth of tissue paper but they still manage to enjoyable. 
 
The artwork and animation is not amazing but I don’t think it’s supposed to be.  I may be wrong but I think the kind of crude and amateurish art was intentional to fit the overall theme of the show.  Even if that is not really the case I think it works perfectly.  There are lots of references to other anime, manga and H-games, I got a few of them but I’m sure others might notice a lot more.  The seiyuu talent had several underused performers amongst the leading characters.  Whether intentional or not I felt this was a perfect fit for the theme of the series.  They were also quite good and it’s good to hear some new voices too.  I felt Momoko Saitou's performance as Tsuyuri was strong and am a bit surprised she’s been in so few shows.  The OP/EN theme songs were also cute and very catchy. 
 
Overall I got an enormous amount of entertainment value from Doujin Work.  If you’re in the mood for something light and a bit silly then you should check this series out.  The episodes are short and its well worth the 2-3 hours it took to watch it. 


          
 
       Helpful C'mon say it with me, MO-E! MO-E! MO-E! 
 
Doujin Work is simply as it says. A dojin circle. The story really isn't for you if you don't even know what the word is and wikipedia won't help, bub. If you like loli's, cheap puns, and moe then this is for you. 
 
The story isn't anything novel, but it isn't terrible. You'll find your self guffawing when you see the costumes Justice picks out for Sora. Tsuyuri's stoic personality will make you laugh throughout the story when she tricks Najimi. 
 
The art isn't anything special, but if you're into moe like I am, chances are you'll like it. The art is nice and clean, but just too plain. The characters all look female...if that's not a problem with you then the artwork is average. 
 
Sound? Pretty damn good. The op/ed are pretty good. The voices get annoying though. Hell don't all girls sound like that? Oh, crap I shouldn't have said that. Justice ( Hiroki Yatsumo) actually has a clear voice that makes me feel like the anime is worth it. 
 
The animes personalities are not bad and blend well when it actually makes sense. Nine years of anime ended up not helping me enough for this anime. Most of the characters jokes' just don't make sense/translate well. The dialogue is kinda stale, but like I already said Tsuyuri is very funny with the whole cast. 
 
This is a 7 for me, and give it a shot if you've been around the otaku/dojin scene for a few years. Don't even think about watching if all you've ever heard of is Toonami anime or don't even know what yaoi/yuri is. 
 
One more time guys, MO-E! MO-E! MO-E!

High school students Yuma Okazaki and Hotaru Mizushina are childhood friends. With their respective boyfriends, Takeda and Fujiwara, their lives couldn't be more perfect. From playing in school to going on group dates, it seems nothing can break their bond.  
 
However, during one such group date, Hotaru makes an unexpected move. While Takeda and Fujiwara are distracted, she begins stroking Yuma's thighs. Taken aback by this peculiar action, Yuma awkwardly retreats to the toilets, followed shortly by her aggressor. Now in private, Hotaru forces the innocent Yuma into a locked cubicle and whispers into her ear: ""You'll be more nervous with a boy; I'll help you practice."" 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo Ai']","Yuma and Hotaru have been best friends since childhood. Yuma would protect Hotaru from things such as bullies, and made it her job to look after her. Now, the two are second-year high school students, but Hotaru is anything but innocent. Yuma gets her first boyfriend and is nervous about it, so a more experienced Hotaru suggests a ""dress rehearsal"" to help her out. The helping out later on leads to a deep kiss with Hotaru, who says that Yuma now knows how to kiss a guy. This leaves her thinking about how much better this kiss was than the one she had shared with her boyfriend. As time goes on, Yuma worries that her boyfriend will find out what is going on between her and Hotaru. She also cannot explain these ""strange"" feelings she has when she is with her.
","Do you want to root for an abusive romance just because it's yuri? Do you want to see non-consensual lewd yuri scenes? Do you want to see people cheating and causing others pain? Do you like watching people so unlikeable that even those with the lowest of self-confidence can point to them and remark, ""Well at least I'm not like them."" Then NTR is for you.  
 
Not only is NTR filled with terrible people doing terrible things, but it's also a terrible story filled with terrible characters. First off all of these characters besides the main guy are unlikeable. Yuma is at least meh, but she still does terrible things even though it should be obvious that what she's doing is wrong. Ultimately I view her more as the scapegoat for Hotaru's abuse rather than someone to hate on her own. However, her own ""feelings"" towards Hotaru are so tacked on and poorly done that it makes it hard to like her even with this knowledge. She's tainted by those around her and what the plot decided to do with her. Especially when she started to turn into a controlling douchebag too. It was as if they thought 2 controlling douchebags weren't enough, they needed to have 3 of them. 
 
Fujiwara and Hotaru are the worst of the lot, and it's hard to imagine characters that are worse than these two. Hotaru is a manipulative and abusive dirtbag. She frequently comes onto Yuma under the guise of helping her. Then she molests her without her consent even as Yuma tells her to stop. The show is clearly trying to go with ""Yuma loved her all along so it's ok"", and makes this clear as it develops. But no, that is sexual abuse and it is not ok. Furthermore, the way that Hotaru acts is disgusting. She manipulates Yuma into relying on her for everything. She is trying to be her practice, her outlet, the thing that helps her stand. This is a common abuse tactic as it makes it that much harder for the person to get rid of their abuser. She's trying to make it that she is needed, so that she can't be disposed of, and quite frankly it's disgusting. The way that she tried to plant seeds into her mind that she liked it, the way that she takes advantage of her, and the way that she has no respect for relationships or boundaries. I don't even care that much about the cheating, I care about the main ship is one that's based off an abusive relationship. 
 
And no just because Hotaru is being abused by Fujiwara does not make it ok. In fact, it only trivialized it as it feels so phoned in that it's hard to take seriously. It's clear that they're trying to come up with some sort of excuse for one of their leads to be abusive, but it just doesn't work. You can't just magic away something like that, especially with an obviously evil villain. It looks fake, and like it was all set up just to excuse her. Which again I find disgusting. 
 
Even outside of abuse the two girls basically tell each other that they can't-do / shouldn't do the very exact things that they themselves do. I'm not sure why I would want to watch a bunch of controlling douchebags but here is NTR to provide that.  
 
The sad part is the last guy is actually decent and show what someone should be like in a healthy relationship. However, all he gets to show for it is to be cheated on and lied to. I'm so glad that we get to see the only decent person here suffer. Thanks, NTR. 
 
Did I mention the story? First off its crap. It can't decide between echii fanservice or drama and thusly switches between the two without rhyme or reason. As a friend of mine put it, there's too much drama to just enjoy the echii, and too much echii to distract from the drama. Not that the drama is any good, and personally I find it hard to enjoy echii between scumbags. Even worse is the fact that story ends up stalling. For a good half of the show, it decides to go no where with it, and just leave at the same point. Stalling is terrible and for a show that already has so little to say and do like NTR it just makes it worse. Although admittely every minute that they don't progress means that it's every minute farther away from the yuri couple getting together, which is a benefit although a small one. Not to mention it keeps on cycliDo you want to root for an abusive romance just because it's yuri? Do you want to see non-consensual lewd yuri scenes? Do you want to see people cheating and causing others pain? Do you like watching people so unlikeable that even those with the lowest of self-confidence can point to them and remark, ""Well at least I'm not like them."" Then NTR is for you.  
... 
 
Wait was I somewhere? Sorry about that. But I'm sure you can see how that can be annoying.. 
 
Not to mention it keeps on cycling the same plot ideas over and over again as if it's incapable to come up with new ones, which at this point I'm pretty sure is exactly what happened. 
 
The art is also pretty bad, and the production values are all terrible. I never really payed attention to the sound because these immoral douches drowned out any care I had about the other parts of the show. When a show glorfies a couple based off cheating and abuse it's hard to care about any other part of it. Add to that a story that goes no where and some of the least likeable characters imaginable, you have a recipe for one of the worst anime out there, which NTR is. 

          
 
       Helpful Why do I even watch this in the first place? Is it for Fanservice? For story? 
 
The answer to the question above is pondered by so many people who decide to waste their precious 9 minutes per episode. Maybe everyone who stumbles upon this trash of the season perhaps doesn't realize what they're stepping into. A TOTAL TRASH!. 
 
Here, let me describe my experience for the last five episode. First, there are two couples. ""Yeah, finally some anime where the story starts with the couples already dating!"". Some of you may think like that but wait a minute. The girls start to cheat on their respective boyfriend to......... guess who? To each other! That's right folks. This is a straight-up Yuri from the get-go. OK, maybe you like Yuri and Netorare and then ask, ""Why should I hate this anime. I love Netorare and Yuri"" (If you are one of the people I specify above, please seek some help. you are just in the right place for a help). Then here's another bad thing I notice here. One of the boys is just a straight-up jerk, abusive man. Another one is a straight-up way too nice man. The abusive guy is really into his character (meaning, he's a complete douchebag who will resort to any possible path just to get laid. Even worse, he blackmails the girls into doing a threesome. Rape and violence never go together well) 
 
So, this is a complete failure in my opinion. The story just not suited into anime. it's too short. The story is disgusting (Netorare is not my least favorite genre. It's just when you combine it with Yuri and Torture, it is there where the anime turns into a sickening parade) 
 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
Netorare means Cuckold. Don't know what cuckold means? It basically means cheating from your partner in a sexual manner

          
 
       Helpful Before I begin just know. This Anime is complete trash, it might actually be the worst anime I have ever watched. It had the most hateable characters i've ever seen, they were so badly written and were just awful people in general. The only positive of this show is the Art and Sound, as they're very well done and can't be criticized... Although the story on the other hand, is the worst excuse for a story i've ever seen... it was trying to get the whole friends fall in love thing but it was trying to be too smart and complex but it all together just failed and was a complete mess 
 
This is a pathetic excuse for an Anime and I wish i could rate it 0 as it doesn't even deserve the 1 rating it got

There are enigmatic people who plot to use their power, in conflict with the king`s government, which is also planning to draw them onto their side. Intrigue surrounds Yonna, and now a new agent comes to see her. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"Over the years animation has progressed from the basic ""onion skin"" technique through to cel shaded CG, so it's only natural that the next step would be full 3D animation. It's thanks to companies like Square-Enix, Pixar, Dreamworks, Blue Sky, Toei, and a whole heap of other studios, that 3D animation has evolved rapidly since the turn of the millenium, and while the presence of such movies may still be a rarity in anime, there are some that appear from time to time. 
 
It's just unfortunate that most of them aren't really all that good. 
 
Hanare Toride no Yonna is one of those rare, fully 3D animated movies that, like CENCOROLL and Hoshi no Koe, is almost completely the work of one man (aside from the music andthe voice acting). Conceived, written, directed and animated by Takeuchi Kengo, the movie received mixed reviews upon it's release in April 2006. 
 
The movie is about two siblings who live in a remote castle - Stan and Yonna. Both possesses certain abilities that have caused them to be driven from their original home, and because of the unjust cruelty they have both faced, Stan has become fiercely protective of his younger sister. However, the government believe that Yonna in particular would be a useful asset to them, and send two agents to ""liberate"" her. 
 
One of the problems I've found with ""one man shows"" (i.e. made by one person), is that the plot is often lacking in certain areas, and it's in this area that Yonna really fails to deliver. The main problem is that the story never really covers anything about the powers that Stan and Yonna possess, nor does it explain how they may be useful to the government. In addition to that, the plot has an aimless quality, as if the writer couldn't make up his mind where he wanted the story to go.  
 
Another problem with the plot is the pacing of the story. Yonna is very slow at times, but can switch gears in an instant, and it's this ""stopping and starting"" of the plot that can really throw the viewer off, especially given the lack of detail in the story. 
 
That said, Yonna does look good - on paper anyway. The art and animation has a very Final Fantasy feel to it, especially the character designs. The characters are expressive enough, but have a decidedly odd look about them which makes them look not quite human. While this is acceptable because of the fantasy setting, the pixie-like quality of the characters makes some scenes difficult to take seriously. Character animation is good for the most part, however there are quite a few occasions where the movements look strange, especially during action sequences, while other bits of animation can appear jerky or unreal. 
 
Yonna's biggest plus is the artwork. The castle and surrounding countryside is very well rendered and detailed, with great use of colours, tones and shades, which is more than can be said about the interior of the castle. Visually, Yonna's biggest problem is lighting, and this is especially noticeable in the confines of the castle. 
 
Pretty much the only part of the movie not made directly by Takeuchi is sound. The voice acting isn't bad, however the seiyuu are decidedly wooden in their delivery, something which is especially noticeable during the more emotional moments. The music used throughout the movie is actually rather good. Okazawa Toshio, who also worked on the music for 5cm Per Second and The Place Promised in our Early Days, has done a fine job with the score for Yonna. The only problem is that the music is sometimes at odds with the on-screen action, something which is mainly due to poor choreography rather than Okazawa's musical ability. 
 
The single biggest problem with the movie though, is the characters. As this is only a 33 minute ""movie"", there is understandably going to be a lack of development, however this could have been offset by making the characters more interesting, more real, more approachable. Unfortunately the movie suffers from poor characterisation, and because of this the characters are one dimensional and uninteresting.  
 
To be completely honest, this is a show that can only really be recommended to fans of 3D animation, as there's very little else to it aside from that. A lot can be forgiven given that this is the work of one man, however even this fact can't lift Yonna out of the realms of mediocrity. The audience has no reason to sympathise with either Yonna or Stan, especially as there's very little history given about them, and this plays a major part in whether one likes the movie or not. 
 
This isn't a bad effort though, and the biggest positive about Hanare Toride no Yonna is that it's another example of one man animation at work, and no matter how mediocre the movie may be, it gets a lot of kudos for that reason. 
 
And now I'm off to watch a fifty foot woman fight aliens :)

          
 
       Helpful Hanare Toride no Yonna is a CGI film from CoMix Wave Films. You may remember them from Hoshi wo ou Kodomo & Byousoku 5 Centimeter. This film was released in 2006. So, how does it hold up compared to the other CoMix Wave Films productions I've seen? Let's check it out and see.  
 
Story: 
 
We open with a brother and sister going about their daily lives. Then a strange boy comes by, sees the sister and scarpers. We cut to an indeterminate amount of time later when the siblings are living together in a fortress without anyone else nearby and a young man is trying to break in and it might seem like I'm skipping crucial plot details, but that's exactly how the information is presented to us.  
 
Therein lies the first major flaw of the series. The story is all over the place. While you do eventually gather why the siblings are on their own, it gets thrown at you far later than it should be and in a stilted exposition dump. Which is a general problem with the dialogue, actually. Nothing sounds natural. The pacing is also pretty bad with the story rushing through things that need more time and wasting time on random scenes where Yonna interacts with little imps.  
 
Characters: 
 
The biggest issue with the characters in this film is that their motivations are vague, ill-defined and don't really make that much sense. Stan's motivation seems to be wanting what's best for his sister, which would make sense, but he also doesn't seem to give a shit what she thinks or has to say. Yonna has a vague “wanting more” motivation but she somehow needs someone else to taker her away from solitude instead of just talking to her brother. Garuda starts out doing a mission but decides to help Yonna for no adequately explored reason. So, ultimately, you get motivations that are both one-dimensional and nonsensical.  
 
Art: 
 
The art in this looks pretty bad. It's not the first time I've reviewed something with bad CGI animation and I doubt it'll be the last. The big issues are with the movements, which look janky and awkward and with the facial expressions, which largely look like “dull surprise.”  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting and music aren't bad. They aren't good, but there's also not a lot that's wrong with them. About the worst I can say is that Mitsuhashi Kanako & Kenn both under-act a bit.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't much in terms of romance at all.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Hanare Toride no Yonna is a pretty bad film. The story is nonsense. The characters don't have anything to them. The artwork looks terrible and the sound is weak. That being said, it isn't one of the worst things I've ever reviewed. It's mainly just kind of stupid and boring. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Tomorrow I'll continue film festival week with Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt.

Spoilers included, because seriously? Don't waste your time.  
 
Writing/story 
Kid and older brother are ostracized because they apparently have magic powers. A span of time passes, and some other kid comes to free the sister. Why? No freakin clue. That's what he was told to do, and by god, this kid takes his role as lacky seriously.  
 
We know this kid is sent to free the girl from the tower (and why was a kid sent to free the princess in the tower, so to speak?), but aside from a vaguely worded throwaway comment from a throwaway character, there's no indication of their intentions whatsoever. Somewhere near the end, the boy quips that this monarchy, or whoever's employ he's under will have his head for what he'd done, but given that we know he was told to ""Get her out of the tower,"" which he DID, the viewer is left wondering why he'd be wanted for capture after fulfilling his mission. 
 
I also question using the older brother as the villain. I got more of a protective vibe from him in the beginning, which contrasted sharply with his presentation later. Shared none of the same traits, and for that, they might as well have used some ogre or something with no personality at all.  
 
Rating:3 
We got the bare bones, I guess. Pretty cookie-cutter.  
 
Music 
They recycled what felt like the same five tracks over and over again which would have been fine had the score held any merit of worth to begin with. In particular, one of the tracks sounded like it was ripped straight from a Final Fantasy battle sequence, which would have worked fine had it been in a video game to begin with, but it just felt out of place.  
 
Score: 3 
Music seemed design to annoy or elicit as many eye-rolling melodramatic moments as possible.  
 
Art 
Character designs weren't endearing, and the quality of the CG itself was low. The girl chooses one point in the story to summon a particularly demonic creature while she's moping around in her room, which struck me as odd, not to mention out of place considering the otherwise almost childish setting and characters.  
 
Score: 3 
Yeah, I'm sure it took a long time but dayum. Well.. The hair looked nice. And the characters did too, as long as they weren't talking.  
 
Enjoyment 
If you keep looking at the timer every thirty seconds, you're not enjoying yourself.  
 
Score: Make it END, GOD 
 
In the end, maybe it would have done fine as a video game, but otherwise I highly reccomend steering clear. I didn't enjoy it in the least.  
 
Overall: 3, and that's being generous.

People who live in Kawasaki become a hero, and beat an enemy who steals near from the time-stopped world to the evolving town Kawasaki. 
 
(Source: Official website)","['Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']",none,"[Insert generic first review sentence here] 
 
Anyways, let me get started with this review! To be honest I haven't watched an ONA before so I figured that Double Circle would be my first. I was coming in with all of these high hopes and I realize now that was a big mistake. 
 
The first episode introduces the ""colour-coded"" individuals and gives some background to the story. Asagi (Gray hair), Emu (Green), Nanoha (Yellow), Akane (Red) & Tama (Purple) are all part of the ""Smart Community Project"" in which they aim to improve/evolve technology and make it more accessible.  
 
I gave the story a 4 because of just how incredibly random it is. How it can go from school, to planning a surprise party, to fighting a sludgy black ""thing"" that steals the energy from everything it touches called Niirobi, to changing into super-powered mecha suits and still grab your attention is beyond me. 
 
The one fight scene dragged onto the second episode and then it ended abruptly. Just no. 
 
The next thing that I'd like to say is that the characters literally have no personality at all but if I had to say that they did, they're pretty generic: Asagi - Likes to get things done/Mr. Popular?, Nanoha - Geek/Brains of the group, Akane - Boss that runs this s#@!, Emu - Lazy. I purposely left out Tama, as she has an interesting back-story surrounding Niibiro and her homeland (she's an alien).  
 
Action animations such as this that have no story whatsoever completely throw me off. I enjoyed it somewhat because of the art and the mechs but they get old pretty quickly. I'm not interested enough in this to watch every single episode. To put it bluntly it's terrible, not to mention that one episode gets put out every month. If the story was memorable then maybe I'd understand but that's not the case at all. 
 
There are so many better things to watch, I'd say this is a waste of 6 minutes. 


          
 
       Helpful Double circle is in the same class as shorts like the next A-class, in as far as it's an advertisement for something that the creator has done or is planning to do. They're a tiny section of the market in the west, however it's something that needs to be said in the preamble as it's something that should always be kept in mind. 
 
Story: 6/10 
 
The story is simple, a loose connection of shorts with the overarching theme of making a better city. It's not ""great"", but there is something there that kept my interest for the entire time I was watching. It left me wanting more, which is a shame as that's not likely to happen at all. For what's there, it'd get a above average, if not for the fact that the time of each episode didn't let the plot points flourish well enough to be satisfying. 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
Graphically, the show is gorgeous. The lines are crisp, the character designs are unique yet with clear personality in with what they wear, and even down to the mech suits. That being said, however, the 3D elements for the most part are somewhat jarring, in the same way that watching Kemono Friends for the first time can be somewhat jarring at the start. 
 
Unfortunately, they stay jarring when it's mixed with the more traditional style, due to the overall length of the series, and at the very end the fully 3d section looks, frankly, disappointing. A shame considering the ideas behind the show, however they're in line with other mid level 3d ""walk through"" of concept design work at that scale. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
The music is great, the end theme is enjoyable, but the sound effects and voice acting could use some more work. Each hit has the slightest amount of impact, and the few times that they had the right impact, it was too late to add anything as the fight was already over. Not only that, but the characters don't add enough emotion into the script, leaving it more as a thing that's there. That said, they all mesh together well, there wasn't a moment I had trouble hearing a character talk, and when the music is needed to, it turns itself up to 10.5.  
 
Character: 6/10 
 
The Characterisation is, unfortunately, bog standard. There is the slightest hint of depth to each character, and the plot about why the bad guy is like they are bumps it up that ever so slight bit. They're not bad, just bland, and what they have that makes them unique isn't explored well enough to be notable. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
 
Double Circle is good - for what's there at least. Whether intentional or not, it stays long enough to keep the fun from the action, and the small slices of life nice and fresh, however it's lack of time it could play with makes it leave something in your mouth that you can't quite nail down. 
 
Effectiveness: 3/10 
 
You won't normally find an effectiveness rating, however for a show that's trying to sell you on something, in this case an idea, it's something I like to have. 
 
It doesn't sell what it is well. The overall idea seems to be a proposal to make Kawasaki into a smart, green city. The main plot has characters that are trying to take away from the beauty and effectiveness of the city, with the heroes having to stop them. They're not trying to stop the progress itself, just make what's already there dull and drab. 
 
With no hint within the show itself about it being a proposal other than the very final credits showing a short 3d render of ideas for Kawasaki streets, to the fact that one of the main buildings in the show is a toshiba city block, it doesn't really find it's footing in selling you on the idea of a green city, and instead it feels ""wrong"".  
 
Overall: 7/10 
 
Double Circle isn't bad, and the overall length of it means it's a great little time waster if nothing else. It gives more of a taste of great ideas that will sadly not get picked up on any further, however that might be for the best. If you're bored, give it a shot, and if you don't enjoy it, at least it's not too long of a time spent on it.

Fortunately for the human world there are groups dedicated to destroying them. A brooding and mysterious girl named Saya is the best teropterid slayer there is, and now, in 1960s Japan, she is sent to a U. S. army base which may be infested... 
 
(Source: ANN) 
","['Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","The story is set in 1966. Its main protagonist is a girl named Saya, who hunts bat-like vampiric creatures called Chiropterans. Saya is introduced on a subway train, where she assassinates a man in a suit. Her American contacts or handlers arrive. One of them, David, begins to brief Saya on another mission, while the other, Louis, discovers that the man Saya has just killed was probably not a Chiropteran.
Saya's next mission begins at the American Yokota Air Base, which is active in the buildup to the Vietnam War. At least one Chiropteran has managed to infiltrate the air base, and it is only a matter of time before they feed again, go into hibernation, and become untraceable. Saya is to pose as a school girl, infiltrate the high school adjacent to the base, and then track and kill the Chiropterans.
At the school, Saya runs into a meek nurse, Amino Makiho, on the eve of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and wounding Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be Chiropterans. Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third Chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The Chiropterans trap them inside and attack.
David delivers a new sword, and Saya uses it to kill Sharon. The final Chiropteran then decides to flee, attempting to stow away on a departing cargo plane. David and Saya give chase and she manages to strike the Chiropteran and mortally wound it. She then stands over the dying creature and lets some of her blood trickles into its mouth. Louis arrives and recovers Makiho before the local police reach her.
Afterward, Makiho is seen in an interview with government officials who question her about the night's events. However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the Chiropterans has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word ""VAMPIRE"". Makiho then returns to the school, where she narrates that she never really discovered the full truth behind Saya and the Chiropterans, and wonders if she's still out there fighting them.

Story 
Bland. Does not build on tension. Only found one or two scenes to have light scares. Action focused not as focused on character build. 
 
Art 
animation/art fine. The dark touch applied to the art works well with the light horror concept. 
 
Sound: a small annoyance with language change out but once you understand the plot it has to be that way. 
 
character: limited to all players. The only player that i felt had a good character profile is the witness. The witness mind you was a semi minor character. 
 
Ending remark: Light based horror flick on vampires. Blood portrayal was not realistic which kind of destroyed the mood. Characters decisions made in the film were somewhat perplexing. If you don't care as much on plot and want a cheap thrill check it out.

          
 
       Helpful The most boring movie I ever watched in a while.  
 
Art: Fucking SHIT. Every girl has fuckhuge lips, Saya is ugly as shit (so are all the other characters), the ugly 3DCG shows through.  
 
Animation: There was what, 2 seconds of actual animation in this? And it was wobbly as fuck too.  
 
Choreography: Shit. Saya is the slowest motherfucker alive when it comes to killing Chiropterans. She literally just walked up to the two vampires whilst they were staring at her. Just. Fucking. Walking. Wow how fucking intense!  
 
Conclusion: What a fucking borefest. Another reason to hate 3DCG. 

          
 
       Helpful Blood: The Last Vampire- just given the title, this movie carries with it the expectations, anticipations, and cultural osmosis of many years of cinema, anime, and literature from the vein of the blood sucking creature for which it's named. Everyone has heard of the mystical vampire- and we have had a cultural fascination with them for nearly 200 years- since John Polidori's ""The Vampyre"" was released. There's something enthralling about the sanguineous, and its association with the occult, something we just can't get enough of.  
 
In 2000, Production IG went out on a limb and produced an anime original story about a vampire who fights and kills insane, frenetic, bloodthirsty beasts called Teropterids. Nearly invulnerable, impervious to bullets, crushing, and concussive forces, the Teropterids are a formidable foe that can only be killed by one means: the blood of a vampire. The story takes place on halloween, 1966, in a US Air Force base in Japan and the high school for the kids living there. What happens on this night is something they'll never forget... unless they're told to, that is.  
 
The animation for this movie is near exceptional. Easily one of the better animations of the late 90s and early 00s, rivaling FLCL in quality- and as an original, did not benefit from the budgets that many contemporaries had. It has some of the best usage of 3D CGI Production IG's ever done, even better than in the Ghost in the Shell series, and the characters move with great fluidity and detail. Everything is very crisp and smooth, and the dark, subdued palette of blacks, grays, and red give it a sort of neo-noir feel.  
 
What's even more fascinating about this incarnation of Blood is the audio. 
This movie is unique in several ways- definitely a first out of many anime I've ever seen- in that it has dual audio. This movie was never originally fully in Japanese, nor an English dubbed original. It was something of an experiment to feature both Japanese and American characters who spoke their respective languages (and for a handful, both)- and an experiment that works to great success. The voice acting is handled very well, and it's not just Japanese VA phoning in some bad engrish, nor is it American VA taking a stab at Japanese phonology.  
It's a true dual effort- with Japanese people voicing their language, and Americans doing theirs. As an anime watcher, I've long wanted to see a show where the voices were handled this way. It's utterly silly to think that an anime can take place in a country like Germany or England and every NON ethnic Japanese speak perfectly inflected Japanese. Blood: The Last Vampire takes a very sophisticated approach to this issue, and benefits greatly from it, while making it a rare and unusual example of the medium. 
 
The story and characterization are sadly lacking in this, though. Where Blood+ had 50 episodes to build up characters and motives, in Blood: The Last Vampire, we're thrown immediately into the action. The movie is only 45 minutes long, but there's some real tension in the story, and some great action with the appropriate gore to match the crimson tone it sets for itself. At the same time, the motives and origins are muddled, and there's a distinct lack of a central antagonist. The characters themselves names' are recycled in Blood+, but this story has no bearing on either it, nor Blood C. 
(The reader may be aware of the series Blood+ or Blood C- which are related, but this was the original version before the manga was written, which would then be adapted into the popular Blood+). It serves best as a standalone bloody action romp involving some familiar but different characters.  
 
Blood: The Last Vampire has a lot to offer in a little package- excellent animation that's held up very well, a mindless but fun action plot, and some very unusual, but well executed, voice acting. For anyone that's seen Blood+ and wants a little more, one can't go wrong with this.

Wonder Momo was originally an arcade game released in 1987. A fairly simplistic (by today's standards) side-scrolling beat 'em up game, featuring a transforming, hoop-wielding heroine.

The story was all over the place. A lot of the scenes are fan service. The characters were random. The art was all over the place - no consistency. The character outfits and weapons were terrible. This story seems like it was written by a 14 yo.  


          
 
       Helpful Utterly horrible. There is literally no feature of this anime that does not suck: bad art (which looks like something out of a 70s Hanna-Barbera Super Friends spin-off), bad animation (it's choppy and stilted), bad sound effects (the Boss Monster at the end is *literally* some guy going ""Rawr""), bad voice acting (the allegedly teenage heroine sounds like a 35-year-old prostitute with a mouthful of gum), and a story that is not merely unoriginal, but also just plain stupid. 
 
And I don't mean normal ""unbelievable"" stupid, or the kind of ""silly"" stupid that's actually sort of funny. I mean serious, hardcore, brain-damage-inducing STUPID -- the kind of stupid that makes you just stare at the screen blankly, wondering whether it's a joke, because you can't believe it could possibly BE so stupid. 
 
It was SO bad that it actually made me angry. I want those seven minutes of my life back. 
 
If you're reading this page trying to figure out whether this anime is worth watching, please heed my warning: Do NOT waste your time on this garbage. You will only regret it.

          
 
       Helpful Wow.  
 
This anime might just be the best piece of art I was ever able to witness within my whole lifetime. 
 
The first episode immediatly starts the show by presenting its great concept. We witness our main heroine, Momoko, gaining supernatural powers. She may not understand these fully at first, but quickly, her great character development leads to her learning how to live with said powers and fight of dangerous foes, whilst finding new allies - she may not expect at first glance. 
 
The most outstanding aspect of this wonderful experience is not its fantastic animation or its majestic, epic and boner-causing soundtrack, which easily surpass the ones shown to us in great works like ""Pupa"" or ""Mars of destruction"" - but simply its exceptional story, characters and criticism of our society. 
 
To give you some further insight on said criticism, not only does Momokos stupidity greatly criticise the general lack of educational possibilites in our society and the lack of appreciation these sad individuals get, but it also shows to us, that maybe our praised intellect is not the only value we should consider, as even individuals we may consider ""stupid"" often enlighten our petty existence through their actions. This greatly depicts the ways in which struggles can be overcome not intelligence, but simply by moral choices, a strong will and a philosophical nature 
 
While this alone would be a simply outstanding piece of social criticism, there are examples even more euphoric. Some of these would be the lack of acceptance our younger generation has towards getting advice by those older and wiser than them. This is presented in an astounding manner, as the characters get visibly more powerful through learning from the elders. Another concept that perhaps even more interesting, it goes as far as criticising the basic capitalistic system we have established in our society through someone as simply as Oreo-cookies symbolizing the hostile points of interest. 
 
To conclude, Wonder Momo simply is one of greatest achievments of mankind. It is thrilling, it is dark, while also containing light hearted moments to balance out the great amount of thinking it demands from the viewer. To end this review, I simply ask of you: watch this skillfully created phantasmagoria of philosophy as it is worthy a score of 10/10. Philosophy intensifies.

We each wanted to see something different so it was decided to try this one out after randomly scrollin around the anime list and clicking a random link to a random series, this ONE was the ONE (if u watch the first minute or so of the series u'll understand the reference... GIVE THE SERIES A SHOT!!). Me and my friends just shot it down immediatly laughing at it as some sort of joke of a series (because of the OP!). Well its not at all. And im very glad that I came around to this anime again tonight. After rereading the synopsis again and the only review that was on the page I realized I couldnt not watch it just because of the OP.  
 
The story is interesting to say the least not too many series like this at all. I wish someone would make a recommendation!!!  if i had to compare it to something IT may HAVE  to be  &quot;THE SIMPSONS&quot;! The humor is very similare and I love them both. Hilarious they both are but Hanada shounen-shi has the deep theme to it about the after life and thats what makes it dare i say... &quot;BETTER&quot;. 
 
The art is perfect for the series. And I love the faces the characters make in pinches and trouble : ) 
  
AS I said the OP was a Do not enter sign but if u listen to it and get the lyrics and watch a bit of the seriesthen  it does fit. Still the backstreet boys for an anime is... different 
 
The charcters may be the best thing about this series!!! Yes. Ichiro the main character is a cussin potty mouth with a trouble making side but also a kind hearted side. Ichiro helps the dead and calls his sister names. Ichiro is a dirty filthy kid and I cant get enough of that. What u'll also see from him is however a bit &quot;exposing&quot; HAHAH&quot;  
 
I am kicking off my winter break with this series and I am enjoying it to the fullest!!!! Hard to stop watching and get some sleep! 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful For some reason, Hanada Shounen-shi is a very under-watched slice of life series. 
 
This is a spoiler free review. 
 
*Story* 
 
The premise is basically about a boy who acquires the ability to see ghosts and he helps these ghosts he comes across finish their unfinished business in their past lives. And I'd be lying if I said this hasn't been done before. However, it does lead to some interesting stories that the boy gets involved in with the ghosts past lives. The stories even have a bit of continuity to them with recurring characters and the like, but they are pretty random for the most part. They usually are story arcs that last 2 or 3 episodes. Although this is a comedy/slice of life anime so you shouldn't really expect much of a storyline. 
 
Anyway, the stories always start out with a comedic tone and eventually become very sad the more the boy gets involved in the ghost's past life. The stories probably could've used a little more conflict to it's advantage, but then again, conflict is what other slice of life series take for granted and they fall in to forced drama and other such nonsense. This is something that never really occurs here. So you gotta give it credit for that. And it does indeed remain interesting and entertaining with little to no conflict throughout the entire series. Now that is awesome! 
 
In addition, in each story arc there's always some interesting turn of events or twist which extends the story, and you most likely won't see them coming and it's generally done very well. 
 
The story occasionally also involves the boy's school life and such things in which the ghosts are not the focus. Which is a pretty good way to avoid being repetitive and it works. 
 
The thing that kinda bothered me about the story is that the supernatural aspect probably could've been handled better and with more consistency. For example, it is established that the boy can't touch the ghosts, and then in a different circumstance he can touch them for some reason. Another example is that at some point, the boy can literally jump outside of his own body and become a ghost temporarily just for the sake of a particular story arc he stumbled in to. Without really explaining when or how he learned to do that. So that felt pretty contrived. 
 
As for how the story concludes… I'd be lying if I said I was completely satisfied with it. I'm not spoiling anything, but the ending was sort of cute and it fits fine with the series. But it's also quite simple and it didn't resolve that much. 
Let's just leave it at that. 
 
 
*Characters* 
 
The characters are pretty damn funny and they are a lot of fun to watch. Their personalities are established very well even though they are very simple in nature, like the easygoing drunk dad, the sister that always gets in to fights with the MC, the tomboy, the sissy boy etc'. 
 
The main character is a naughty brat named Ichiro who likes being naughty and doing naughty boyish things. He's kinda like Shin Chan (if you're familiar with him) but surprisingly he's a lot more mature, likable and relatable. Because unlike Shin Chan, he's not always naughty just for the sake of being naughty. And he is often scolded by his mother for his behavior because of misunderstandings. He even matures and gets smarter throughout the series, so the character development is there. It's not really done in a very subtle way and nowhere is that more apparent than in the last few episodes. But, overall it was done very well and I don't have complaints about it. I really liked it. 
 
The complaints I have are mostly with the side characters. I noticed the series goes out of it's way to give us detailed backstories of the ghosts Ichiro comes across, who basically come out of nowhere (which is great), and yet hardly tell us anything about the characters that are right in front of us in pretty much every episode. And who I'm referring to is Ichiro's family. Sure they have a lot of screen time, but they're never focused on appropriately or fleshed out very well, they're just there. And these were pretty interesting characters that had some potential (especially his sister) so that was kind of a waste. 
 
So what it comes down to is that the MC is generally well developed all the characters are a lot of fun, even though the secondary characters lack development and focus. The ghosts Ichiro comes across often have very touching/sad stories that will likely make you both laugh and cry. So know that at least on an emotional level this series works great thanks to the ghosts and their life stories. 
 
*Art* 
 
The artwork is overall really good. Though people are probably turned off by it, because it looks simple and it doesn't have overly cute girls and such. But the fact is that the animation is great, despite what the characters look like. The backgrounds are very detailed and the directing is quite obviously, well above average. It's directed by the same guy who directed 'Monster' and it's by studio Madhouse who usually have very good animation, and this series is no exception to the rule despite just being a simple easygoing slice of life anime. 
 
*Sound* 
 
The opening and ending are by the Backstreet boys… Lol, bet you didn't see that coming. I'm no fan, but they do help create an atmosphere. I never even considered skipping the op or the ed while watching this series..  
And together with the very nice and calm ost it has, it works.  
 
I don't know Japanese, but the voice acting is great, with funny voices. Though I must say it was kinda distracting to hear voice actors from One Piece in this series (I heard Franky, Luffy and Ussop's voices in this, lol). 
 
*Enjoyment* 
  
It works very well as a tear jerking comedy. You'd most likely laugh, cry and have a lot of fun. Though the humor is a little toilety and the show might feel kinda cheesy at times. I personally enjoyed it a lot though. 
 
*Overall* 7/10 
 
It's really good, But it could've been great with only some little fixes like focusing more on the secondary characters, handling the supernatural element better and an ending that is a little more solid. 
Besides that, this anime is really good and it's definitely worth watching if you like slice of life/comedy anime.

","Aesthetically, it is fine - animation is somewhat detailed and mostly decent. 
 
The main problem is that it's one long series of alcohol reviews with only a little bit of a story tagged around the (far too much) drinking, all of which is rather meh. 
 
The characters could have been interesting in a better series, but at the moment, you don't really know them - and most likely couldn't really care about them either.  There are some comedy moments, but it doesn't really forgive the fact that it's just one long advert for booze. 
 
It's quite a forgettable and missable program - probably only worth watching if you are bored, drunk or both - there is nothing to draw you in (unless you like in-depth drink reviews).  

          
 
       Helpful This anime is something weird. It doesn’t have any developing plot, but rather focuses on alcohol and atmosphere.  
The story is pretty poor, the characters have their backgrounds, but you won’t see any plot development through the series.  
The art style is really nice, as well as the animation. Special creadit to people who worked on colors — they create a chill atmosphere that fit the anime’s mood.  
The opening and ending didn’t seem really good, but they are decent as well as the voice acting.  
The characters are nothing special and that’s the point. They are the most average people that you could find in Tokyo, and they have only one thing in common — love for alcohol. In fact, alcohol is probably the mc here.  
Overall enjoyment depends on how much you like alcohol itself. If you are a fan of it — you would probably like the anime, maybe even get some tips. If you aren’t interested in the theme — no point in watching this, you’ll get bored.  
Overall this anime isn’t that interesting, but if you don’t have anything good to watch — this won’t be the worst pick.

Well, what do I have to say about an anime that encourages you to drink to solve or celebrate everything and anything? (If you are over 18/20, of course) 
This Anime has a story about 4 women living in a shared house in Tokyo and how they drink for everything that happens. 
 
Michiru Matsuki: A woman extremely worried to fit the standards of Tokyo; Seems to be the main character in the story; 
 
Makoto Kiriyama: The most sober character in the entire anime; Nao's younger sister. 
 
Nao Kiriyama: The most drunk character in the entire anime; Makoto's older sister. 
 
Kae Midorikawa: An extremely cute and gentle character most of the time; She is the one who usually tries to impose order before joining the mess. 
 
This Anime is literally about drinks, so if you do not like culinary animes, you'd better look for another Anime to watch. The characters are very funny and drunk, and it is very explicit how much they are loving the drink lol. 
 
This Anime does not have an incredible super mega hyper story, but it does what it promises; an anime about 4 women, drinks and Tokyo XD

","While this show put the elemental motif's usage to its full potential, that's where everything that's good about this show stopped for me. 
 
I've never disliked an action anime before that accurately satisfies all the criteria and things I loved about anime until I watched this show. 
 
There's nothing interesting or likeable going on in this show at all.  
 
Everything in this show is just standard generic drivel. 
 
You have a generic male lead, who's still in K-12 school, meets a girl, discovers his inner abilities, female lead gets captured, guy goes to save him. 
 
But what makes that dislikeable is that the male lead saving the female lead is all that goes on FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW. 
 
And it's just...idk. There's too much to say and I don't care enough to go on. 
 
So yeah, if you're looking for an anime to rival the Big Three, protip: don't watch this one. You will be sorely disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful Tokyo Underground feels like a lot of other shonen action series from around this point in time. You have a guy with short hair, average height, decent fighter, spirited, and a good heart. You also have the sweet maiden character who is completely useless or the tough but not really tomboyish girl. This one has both. 
 
Tokyo underground has all these things in common and more but it falls short in a few things making it actually lesser than a lot of the others. First of all in our main character. Even though he is supposed to be such a good fighter he never uses any of those skills after he gets his power. In fact the only thing he EVER does is an air slash. It's the only attack he knows or uses and besides the rare occasion that he uses the wind to cushion a fall or guard it's the only time he ever uses his wind. They act like he gets stronger by the end but because it's still the same attack you can't see this besides the fact that his wind can now apparently blow back stronger opponents. But at no point during the series does he show any growth or change in the slightest. The rest of the cast isn't much better. Chelsea has more variety in her attacks but she never changes or gets stronger either. The nerdy kid gets a gun but uses it maybe 4 or 5 times throughout the entire series. I could go on but we'd be here all day. 
 
This leads to the second problem which is all the fights are fairly boring. Rumina just dodges attacks until he can launch his wind slash, Chealsea is a little cooler since she punches things but they aren't very impressive either, and the Nerd is just dead weight. Also none of the enemies put up a really impressive fight. The fights are done poorly and the enemies are almost all defeated with the heroes half trying. No one ever really seems to truly push them to their limit and thus there is no fear of them losing or excitement in watching it. 
 
The third problem with this series is the pacing. The plot has a habit of slowing down at points for the sake of establishing characters, plot points, etc and that's good but then it seems to speed through to the next slow point making things feel rushed especially near the end. Leading up to the last few episodes is a talk of the Obligatory fight tournament arc of shonen. Well they spend a few episodes gathering members and preparing for the tournament....which we never really see. All but one or two matches are just glanced over and then the tournament doesn't even finish in the end for spoiler reasons. I swear they spent more time talking about and preparing for this thing than they spent actually doing it. Because of this the pacing just feels choppy and unfocused a lot. 
 
Overall it's not a bad series exactly but it's only average at best and there are so many other shonen that at least do a better job with the characters, fighting, and pacing.

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed this series but lets face the reality this has already done before, and better  so don't expect much, this is an average story about the adventure of a more or less average boy pushed forward by his feelings (I'm talking about love) to fight against all the obstacles. 
 
Actually the story isn't so bad but I get the feeling I've saw the same things happend to a boy inside the cockpit of a huge robot, welding a sword or following a dangerous path seeking revenge. 
 
Sound effects didn't grab my attention, and some parts of the plot aren't very convincing. May be the worst part are the supporting caracters because they are  too swallow with many cliches.  
 
So go ahead and spend good time; there is a small dose of humor, cuteness, courage, despair as the main character grows stronger, and defeats overconfident and too talkative enemies (yeah monologues really heat up fighting scenes).

This is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.
","Real Drive depicts a series of episodic and storyline-driven cases where a group of cyber divers are tasked with diving into the cybernetic network known as the Metal when delving into any cybernetic-related cases. Throughout the series, each case tends to vary from the mundane to the serious which can involve anything from Minamo's school life to more serious cases that require physical work from Souta and Holon. It also serves to explore various implementations of how the Metal can affect the lives of the island residents for legitimate and illegal activity, in the same vain the Ghost in the Shell franchise explores how the lines between being human or machine are blurred with the cyborg members of Section 9. Essentially, Shirow Masamune is the creator of this series and his heavy dabbling into sci-fi and philosophical elements are all over this series. 
 
Yet for as nicely told as Real Drive's story elements are, it still suffers similar weaknesses as Ghost in the Shell in that Masamune gets too immersed into dabbling into his story and themes at the expense of developing the characters of his work. This is especially apparent with the more mundane stories that Real Drive often explores compared to Ghost in the Shell, as Real Drive doesn't take the time to thoroughly explore and develop its characters. While getting some background exploration, the characters mostly exist in advancing the plots for each case explored and Minami makes for a rather weak protagonist as she mostly contributes little to the advancement of the anime's plot beyond the series showing off her naiveté. 
 
On the visual end, Real Drive is above average for a 2008 anime sporting clean details, realistic character designs, and gorgeous scenic shots. Animation is quite fluid for the most part without loss of detail and offers some variety in what the series can show off that include fighting scenes, net-diving into the Metal, roller skating, and swimming. 
 
Overall, I suppose you could think of Real Drive as a somewhat lighter and more mundane take on Ghost in the Shell as it dabbles into somewhat similar themes as Ghost in the Shell with man's relationship with technology and how it affects us in various aspects. The limited character exploration does hamper the series somewhat and is more apparent than Ghost in the Shell. Still if you crave another sci-fi title dabbling into philosophical themes like Shirow Masamune's classic cyberpunk series, Real Drive offers an engaging and more mundane focus on such storytelling. 

          
 
       Helpful 	Okay, so after having just completed the whole anime series and seeing that, of the people who wrote reviews, nobody had seen the entire thing prior to writing them. I have decided to write this! Please be aware, this review details the nature of the various elements of the anime, it does not specifically reference any parts of the anime. I don't think describing an anime is called spoiling, or is it? If so, I apologize, please tell me how to better censor myself in the future. 
 
Without further ado, the review: 
 
	This is really one of those Anime that goes into extensive detail to get the audience to understand the world of Masamune Shirow. True to the other series that he has created, his limitless imagination and creation of technology surfaces once again; this time we are introduced to the concept of ""The Metal"". Throughout the Anime, the audience sees the roles which such futuristic pieces of technology play in the daily lives of the anime's characters. By being able to 'experience' the applications of Masamune Shirow's fictional technology through the characters, we gain better insight to the anime as a whole.  
 
	The story carefully unfolds as each of the episodes draws to conclusion, the accumulated knowledge which the audience receives is key in appreciating such a masterpiece. In other words, it is really a good idea to pay attention to what is going on in the anime so you don't get lost later! I'd like to emphasize that the story unfolds with time, unlike many action-based fast-paced anime of today. People should not be quick to judge the quality of the anime based on the first episode or even the first few episodes. At first it may not appear to be following any particular storyline but as I said, it all comes with time. 
 
	Unlike Ghost in the Shell, which can be called a predecessor of this anime, the environment is very vividly colored. However, all of the characters, objects, and buildings are uniquely designed. All of this gives the anime a sort-of exotic or 'new' feel. The art of the anime also presents the mood, and as such the audience is left with a less serious atmosphere than that of Ghost in the Shell. CG rendering is used sparingly and only as needed, akin to more 'traditional' animation. It feels as if more work is put into doing animation than CG nowadays. I guess, I'm a fan of crisper and detailed images, but the slight blurriness of the background allows the audience to not be overloaded with images. I am referencing Ghost in the Shell because it is the only other Masamune Shirow work that I have seen. There are also some almost psychedelic colors and patterns, in ""the Metal"" to contrast the bright, paradise-like environment of the Real Drive world. 
 
	Perhaps one unique quality, in this anime, which can be noticed immediately are the characters. The characters are generally a bit on the chubbier side, which is fine, considering, in reality, how many people are actually as thin as characters portrayed in many anime. This contributes to the believability of the anime as a whole. After all, not all anime have to conform to the typical, aesthetic pleasing, character design in order to be considered good. Perhaps it can be said that the characters behave true to their appearances, e.g. behavior. Each of the main characters undergo varying levels of  development and thus each character is unique and brings forth their own contributions to the story. 
 
	At first glance, the music in this anime is quite different from the OP/ED themes. In fact, they appear contradictory of each other. The OP/ED are kind of like hard rock while the BGM fits smoothly and refreshingly into the art and with the characters of the anime. Much of the upbeat music in the anime had been synthesized with a computer, perhaps has to do with the fact of being futuristic. However, some less upbeat tracks are simple and use few instruments such as the piano, glockenspiel, violin. All of these tracks suit the changing moods in the anime. Getting back to the OP/ED themes, though they contrast the BGM, I don't believe they are bad decisions. They aren't bad to listen to either and hey, if you're bored they're a good wake-me-up, ha ha ha. One thing about the OP/ED of this anime is that they are shorter than the usual OP/ED, instead of being around 1:30, they're only around 1:15. This makes for less interruption I suppose, I definitely did not mind them being shorter. They also make each episode a smaller filesize and such benefits people with less storage. 
 
	The journey from the beginning to the end of the anime was well paced and advanced accordingly. There wasn't ever a feeling that there was no story left or too much story at the end. Perhaps though, being a more evenly-paced anime would cause some viewers to get bored really fast. Even more-so when not even all the subs were out. Having fine details yet needing to wait for weeks until the next episode, definitely does not help to tie the anime together as a whole. I suppose it is more suitable to watch it all the way through over a shorter period of time. 
 
Though the first impression is often the lasting, the careful planning involved in introducing the anime's world in detail to the audience, makes me give a: 
8/10 for Story. 
 
Detailed and colorful are words that come to mind when recalling the world of Real Drive. Sharpness and blurriness are used appropriately to soften or heighten the anime's vivid colors. The uniqueness of the infrastructure, environment and characters design in the anime get it a: 
9/10 for Art. 
 
All of the music is crisp and cleanly composed and fits well the changing environment and moods of the anime. You can listen to the OST on its own and it would still sound good, preferably on 5.1 surround sound please!  
9/10 for Sound. 
 
The characters are uniquely designed and should be accepted for that fact; it should not deter the audience's perception of the character as an individual . As well, as individuals and groups, undergo substantial development and growth throughout the anime. This makes them seem more believable, real even. 
9/10 for Character. 
 
Each of the individual elements (such as the ones above) of this anime were tied together well, everything was place somewhere for a reason. 
8/10 for Enjoyment! 
 
As with many others, this anime started off a little on bland in my mind though, slowly but surely, I began to appreciate all of its fine details. True uniqueness is very difficult to accomplish when dozens of anime are broadcast throughout japan every season but, I will remember this as something truly different from the rest. 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Edit: After reconsideration, I have lowered Character to 9 because not all of them really, noticeably, develop over time.

          
 
       Helpful Story 
Real Drive is tough to write a review for. As promising as this series is, it has a major downfall: it can't find its balance. The 1st and 2nd episodes are a great start, giving you all of this information and an interesting and slightly mysterious lead in Haru. I found myself immediately wanting to know more about the Artificial Island these characters inhabit, and, most of all, about what exactly happened 50 years ago to Haru. While the main character may be Haru, this series really switches the focus up after the 4th ep. After that, it becomes Minamo's show until a little past the half way mark, becoming a really drab slice of life with the story left on the back burner. Once it hits that later part of the series, though, it ramps up and you start to get a story again. It's a real shame that the entire series isn't like that, because those last few episodes were really fantastic. 
 
Art 
The first thing you notice about this series is how crisp the colors are. The animations for the ocean are particularly beautiful, as they should be when the sea is the focus of this series. The near future setting allows this series to retain a sort of familiarity while being entirely alien at the same time. Many people complain that most of the characters look fat, but by the time you finish this, not only will you not notice it, you probably won't care. The characters themselves are animated well, but its nothing really special. The underwater facility is absolutely gorgeous to look at, like the majority of the background, and you'll probably be paying more attention to them than the characters. The Metal, while an interesting concept, often looks light years behind the rest of the animation standard, with a lot of its CGI looking clunky in comparison.  
 
Sound 
The music is give or take. Some of the more orchestral stuff sounds like it could have come from a Hollywood movie, while other things sound about as boring as elevator music. The OP is decent, but the ED is annoying, and I ended up skipping it every time just to get it over with. The sound effects are spot on, and the V/Os are solid.  
 
Character 
The other supporting characters often had good foils, even if you learn little to nothing about anyone's past except for Minamo and Haru. Since the show focuses more on Minamo than anyone else, when you do get an episode or two that stars someone else, it's a real relief. All of the characters do their jobs perfectly, but none of them are very memorable.  
 
Enjoyment 
I went into this mainly because I love Shirow, and came out with mixed feelings. Its an interesting series, and some of the things it brings up deserve discussion, but there was just too much filler to make this great.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","The story is set in 1969, a period of time in which Japan is experiencing intense economic and social development after the end of World War II in 1945. Unbeknownst to humans, alien/interdimensional beings have emerged with plans to take over the world by sending numerous agents to wreak havoc in cities, turning people into robotic minions. They are referred to as ""Invaders"" (インベーダー, Invēdā).
In an attempt to confront the Invaders and defend the planet, an elite but highly secret organization of peace-keepers called the Alien Exterminating Global Intercept System (more commonly known as A.E.G.I.S.), was set up with special funding from the government. They rely on the ability of ""Gate Keepers"", who have the power to open dimensional ""gates"" of a paranormal energy that give them their superpowers. These superpowers are the only weapons that have any effect on Invaders.
Although A.E.G.I.S. has branches around the world, the series focuses on the Far East division in Japan. The headquarters of the Far East branch of A.E.G.I.S. lies beneath Tategami High School, a facade created by the organization to mask the active recruitment of new Gate Keepers. Since many of the candidates were High School students, the location allowed the agents to be enrolled in school and be available for a mission at a moment's notice.

       Helpful Truth be told, for the first times I&rsquo;ve watched it I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully appreciate it. I&rsquo;m glad I decided to re-watch Gate Keepers once again, because it&rsquo;s definitely worth it. 
 
The plot of Gate Keepers can be compared to old school anime, probably because the story is set in the 1960s. The only difference is that Gate Keepers has the feel of contemporary anime &ndash; it&rsquo;s set in the 60s, but it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like it is. It&rsquo;s really exciting and fun to watch. Some historical references were actually incorporated into the story, such as the moon landing, the world expo and maybe even hippies. 
 
Another aspect I like about it is the comedy. I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t realize it was so funny, but that&rsquo;s probably because most of the comedy came from Reiko and Bancho &ndash; the 2 characters I USED to hate. All of the characters are actually very likable. My other favorites are Megane and Fei, because they&rsquo;re both so adorable. I still like Kaoru and Shun though (Shun&rsquo;s hot!) 
 
As expected of Gonzo, the animation is really impressive. I love the character design except for Reiko&rsquo;s because she seems different compared to the other characters. They all have beautifully drawn eyes though &ndash; I especially like how the eyes look when they use their gate powers. The CG wasn&rsquo;t as sophisticated and smooth as I want it to be, but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. There were repeated scenes and usually I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a sign of laziness, but it&rsquo;s minimal. 
 
Some of my favorite seiyuus are actually in Gate Keepers. One of them is Takahiro Sakurai. I always seem to like his characters (especially Cloud Strife from Advent Children!). The other is Tomokazu Seki. I just think he&rsquo;s a really talented VA. Other seiyuus I want to note are Chinami Nishimura (Fei) and Etsuko Kozakura (Megane). They really made Fei and Megane really cute and adorable. I just love it when Fei goes &ldquo;Ayaya!&rdquo;. 
 
The music was great as well. Like the story, the music reminds me of old school anime as well (specially the mecha ones) except they&rsquo;re more updated. I really love how the opening theme was made &ndash; it really describes the plot so well. Sometimes you can catch the characters quoting some of the lyrics. The ending theme wasn&rsquo;t bad either. Yumi Matsuzawa did a great job in performing both songs. 
 
Just to finish this review, I&rsquo;m going to reaffirm my first point by saying Gate Keepers is definitely a must watch. I&rsquo;m going to try the OVA and see if it&rsquo;s as good as the series.

          
 
       Helpful For buying all the DVD's on a whim since Rightstuf had seven volumes for only $2, I am genuinely surprised by how great this show is. I really enjoyed this a lot. 
 
As for the story it has comedic moments sprinkled throughout each episode and I feel like they generally mix very well with the situations at hand. There's also a decent amount of actually incredible scenes that look fantastic and have great sound design; I love the sound of when they open a gate to use their abilities and then scream ""GATE OPEN!"" and even though it's essentially the same thing every time it feels different depending of what's going on and everything else and how the audio is mixed. It makes a lot of scenes feel really epic and I'd rewind and watch the sequence again because it seemed so cool however it doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be cool or anything like that (at least not to me) and I feel like that's why comes off really good and really kept me engaged with the show and wanting to continue watching. 
 
The art and animation is pretty consistent throughout the whole show and how good the CGI is really took me by surprise. There was only one episode with a purple CG helicopter that was super bad but other than they did a heck of a job considering this was from the year 2000. 
 
My favorite character was definitely Ikusawa, Ruriko or Rurippe as the nickname given to her by Ukiya, Shun which you will hear most of the time. Kawasumi, Ayako does a fantastic job voicing her and I love when she yells, perfect tone in comedic moments and intense moment and everything in-between. I also really liked Mei and how she'd say ""Gate Open"" and her powers in Chinese most of the time. Reiko seemed to be a little too much of an air-head but she still seemed to get some good moments and she cares for everyone and not just Ukiya. Kaoru to me felt too pushy to assert herself onto her Senpai Ukiya but I didn't dislike her and she does get some great moments to shine throughout the series. I like how she transformers to use her powers by just whooshing off her normal clothes with her tracksuit underneath. The only character I didn't like so much was Megumi which is kinda backwards for me since I generally really like the quiet ones with glasses. The different tensions with her still had impacts on the story and wasn't meaningless even though she wasn't very nice or anything. Finally for our main character Ukiya, Shun I'd say he's actually likable. He does share some typical traits that you'd expect from a main character but there's also more to him. He also has a couple really good character arcs that he goes through and you get to see him struggle. 
 
If you happen to stumble across this show I highly recommend it, especially if you can still get the DVD's for super cheap like I was able to. As for re-watching, I definitely will eventually and I still have the sequel OVA series to watch too which I will watch next out of the countless DVD's and Blu-Rays that I have. I would've liked to see an HD remaster with PCM audio if they did it correctly/still had the original master but I'm not too concerned since the DVD's still scale nicely. I'd say the average score for this show is an accurate assessment of how it's score should be but I just had such a blast watching this and it felt really refreshing. Anyways, hope my review will be insightful for somebody!

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']","Aqua and Aria take place in the early 24th century, starting in 2301 AD, in the city of Neo-Venezia (ネオ?ヴェネツィア Neo Venetsia, literally ""New Venice"") on the planet Aqua (アクア Akua, formerly Mars, sometimes stylized as 火星（アクア） in the manga with the base text for ""Mars"" serving as a gloss), which was renamed after being terraformed into a habitable planet covered in oceans around 150 years beforehand. Neo-Venezia, based on Venice in both architecture and atmosphere, is a harbor city of narrow canals instead of streets, traveled by unmotorized gondolas.At the start of Aqua, a young woman named Akari arrives from Manhome  [sic] (マンホーム Manhōmu, formerly Earth, sometimes stylized as 地球（マンホーム） with the base text for ""Earth"" serving as a gloss) to become a trainee gondolier with Aria Company, one of the three most prestigious water-guide companies in the city. Her dream is to become an Undine, a gondolier who acts as a tour guide (see Terms below). As she trains, Akari befriends her mentor Alicia, trainees and seniors from rival companies—Aika, Alice, Akira, and Athena—and others in Neo-Venezia. Aqua covers Akari's arrival on Aqua and her early training as a Pair or apprentice. Aria continues her training as a Single, or journeyman, culminating in the graduation of her, Aika, and Alice as full Prima Undines.
Each chapter is a slice of life episode of Akari's exploration of the worlds of gondoliers, Neo-Venezia, and Aqua itself. Amano frequently uses several pages of lush art to depict an environment, showing the wonder of both everyday activities as well as one-of-a-kind events. It has been described by reviewers as very similar in tone and effect to Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō.
","I've been aware for quite awhile now that ARIA has been one of the top anime titles of this site. 
But I always found myself putting off watching it. Admittedly, I was a bit unenthusiastic after reading the synopses... 
 
And then I finally got around to watch it and simply fell in love with it. 
 
I gave it full marks for everything, but if I had to point out what I liked the most.. 
Then it would be the characters, of course. Excluding moe-points, they really are wonderful and lovable folks and by the end of the show, you really feel connected to them. 
The sounds and music were perfect. The opening, the ending, the insert songs.. Amazing. I could listen to the tracks all day.  
The story was specially captivating. It has been pointed out that each episode is almost self containing, but it still builds upon the previous episodes to really involve the viewers emotionally. At least that's how it felt like for me. But more importantly, each episode features something that is sure to grab your interest.(Heck, these people could do the most mundane things and I bet I'd still be hooked). Whether the episode was focusing on the day-to-day things on Aqua, or on the extraordinary aspects like Cait Sith, or the wonderful people, it never ceased to amaze me. 
The art was good enough for me to want to be there! All I could wish for now is for them to re-release this in HD and watch it on a 42"" flat panel. 
 
So needless to say, I enjoyed it very much and its right up there among my favorites. 
For those people, who are still putting off this series because of fear that it would be boring, drop the prejudice and pick this up. You definitely wont regret it.

          
 
       Helpful Aria is for me the greatest folklore tale of anime, this is absolutely relaxing and the characters fit great for that concept. 
You'll find sometimes huge creature like Cath Sith, more swag than Spartacus, this guy make yours ovaries crackles until the end. I love the fact that series looks like to Galaxy 999, there's train flying in the sky after all. 
The female cast is amazing, Akari is really moe sweetheart, she's the most interesting after Alice in my opinion. All characters has her defined personalities and projects ondines training. 
The palette color is the best part, according to a Neo Venezia, your eyes will be dazzled by that creativity of this new world. 
But wait to see Aria the Origination for the evolution of all these elements.

          
 
       Helpful Aria: The Animation was a slice-of-life anime where the characters were introduced, the music was introduced, and the setting of Neo-Venezia was introduced. The writing for the first season was not particularly good, with the dialogue being somewhat lackluster and the stories being very simple. That first season would get a 7-8/10 from me.  
 
Aria The Natural is a clear step up from the first season. The art, animation, and sound/music don't improve at all, but that's alright: it's easy to fall in love with the music in Aria. The simplistic dialogue does not improve much either. But the writing overall in season 2 is clearly better than that of season 1. No, it's not perfect in the sense that everything the episode does contributes to the underlying message, but the storytelling through events is strong enough for each episode to present a meaningful case towards its moral insight (a clear improvement from the first season, where I thought a lot of episodes were quite silly). There were even a couple of episodes here and there where the writing truly shines. In those episodes, I was utterly amazed at how intelligent, insightful, and beautifully tied together they were. 
 
Aria the Natural is a story (or combination of stories?) that teach you to love the world you live in. It's an anime full of insight, and an anime easy to fall in love with. I wholeheartedly recommend this series.

Yuuto Suou gets more than he bargained for when he joins his childhood friend Mitsuki Shimoya in testing out an urban legend. When he uses his phone to take a picture of himself with the local shrine's divine mirror, he is whisked off into another world—one heavily steeped in the lore of the old Norse myths. 
 
Using his knowledge gained from school and from his solar-powered smartphone, he has the chance to bring the Wolf Clan, the same people who cared for him, to prominence, all while earning the adoration of a group of magic-wielding warrior maidens known as the Einherjar. 
 
(Source: J-Novel Club)","['Fantasy', 'Harem']","Yuuto Suoh is a fourteen-year-old second-year junior high student who is knowledgeable about urban legends. One night, in his quest to discover if the urban legend of the local Tsukimiya Shrine was true, he irreversibly discovered that the legend was not a sham. Forcibly separated from his childhood friend and love of his life, Mitsuki Shimoya, Yuuto appeared in another world with heavy similarities to Norse mythology (while doing research on the world, he discovered that the ""other world"" wasn't truly another world but was an Earth in the distant past, specifically, 2000-1300 BC, the Late Bronze Age). In his quest for survival, Yuuto inadvertently rose to become the patriarch of the Wolf Clan, the family that had taken him in upon his summoning, by using the modern knowledge provided to him by his smartphone that he had unwittingly brought with him to the other world. Despite winning the affections of multiple Einherjars, magic-wielding warrior maidens, Yuuto has but one goal: to return to the side of his childhood friend and one true love (although this does not stop the other girls from trying to win him over).
","This could've been a very good series given more time to develop the characters and the story more. If this was split into 2-3 seasons, probably could've made a decent anime.  
 
Even after feeling that the whole story was being rushed in the first 11 episodes, they take it one step further in the 12th episode by completely skipping conflict and advancing the MC's romance with the girl back home from a childhood friend (with hints of love) to them becoming spouses. Even though it was an obvious love, they couldn't have made this romance seem more pointless.  
 
Any questions about how the conflicts between the clans ended their fights is completely disregarded when the final episode rolls around. Almost as if it never happened in the first place.  
 
TL;DR The romance is thrown out the window and all of the action is disregarded by the final ep (even though it was pretty disappointing to begin with).  
 
Maybe something to watch if you're looking to waste your time watching mediocre harems, but don't watch the final episode it takes the whole anime from an ""ok"" watch to a ""wow i really just watched the whole thing"" kinda anime.

          
 
       Helpful Sin entrar en muchos detalles sobre la historia en sí, el inicio es sumamente confuso ya que te hace pensar que debe haber una precuela que no viste o que estás viendo la segunda temporada así sin más... dejando de lado este detalle la historia se desarrolla muy rápido en un inicio, conforme avanza la historia mejora e incluso llega a meter tramas que podrían ser explotadas. 
 
Lo mejor de este anime es sin duda la animación y el sonido, pero los personajes son demasiado cliché (aunque en lo personal a mi no me desagrada ese aspecto), si quieres pasar el rato viendo algo entretenido podría ser un anime aceptable. 
 
El principal problema: el final. Podría usar un sin fin de adjetivos negativos para describirlo, pero es más sencillo calificarlo simplemente como pésimo. Acaban la historia de tajo, dejan muchas cuestiones de la trama al aire y carece de sentido alguno. Una lástima.

          
 
       Helpful An anime without a INTRODUCTION and a CLIMAX is found to fail!! 
I would just get to the point since there is no use in even trying to write something positive about this anime: WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU PRODUCERS THINKING RELEASING SUCH A WASTE OF SPACE ANIME WHICH JUST BURNS OUR VALUABLE TIME!!! You wanna know whats wrong with it? Then here are the glorious details: 
1) The story line is shitty since it skips over too many arch's and details which is necessary for the development of the story. You want examples? here answer some questions:- How and when does Falecia and the others see Mitsuki's pics. When does Mutsuki comes to know about them? How does the Panther clans witch knows to elevate the spell cast on the Yuuto? How does he defeat stainthor and panther clan on his return? What was the reaction of the girls meeting mutsuki?.........and the shit show goes on..... 
2) I felt the character was a homo!!!!! seriously, no kidding. True Love and devotion is one thing but having such a personality for a main character just pisses you off each moment you look at it. 
3)Its unbearable for the watchers to make head or tails out of the story when there are no true emotions which can be felt. Frankly it felt like a lame excuse for an anime.... 
4) Even the LN cover has better portrait of the MC than he has in the anime. I mean were you guys seriously high and stoned when you created this anime? Doesn't the budget you are wasting and energy you are spending on a lost cause doesn't concern you a bit? Does the sense of profit doesn't occur to you guys? 
The ONLY GOOD THING was its graphics and character design for the female characters(the mc and other males look jackass) but that doesn't save the entire anime. 
We International viewers decide which manga and LN to buy only after watching the anime so do you seriously expect me and the others to crack our back accounts and spend the green bucks on this? Hell No.... 
THIS ANIME WAS A MISTAKE TO EVEN BEGIN WITH!!

9,1083,52,6.56277593,A group of people living together,Human Crossing,"Though seemingly unconnected, the characters in HUMAN CROSSING all have something in common. They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']",none,"Human Crossing is a very bizarre anime 
 
The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it 
 
I know these things are subjective but Human Crossing's biggest flaw is believability . The show tried incredibly hard to give messages of hope but most episodes come across as very pretentious and totally unrealistic 
 
Additionally while I don't have a problem with predictability you will probably be able to tell what will happen 5 minutes in to most episodes and the conclusions are usually cliche or leave you scratching your head ... 
 
The animation is sub par , there is hardly any music but I thought the voice acting was good 
 
The show to me is definitely worth a watch if you have the patience . I'm sure that at least 2-3 episodes will be worth it for you but you will most likely have to suffer through at least 10 episodes that range from meh to bad . 
 
4/10 Decent :) 
 


          
 
       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

Meanwhile, Deoxys, a Pokemon from space, has reappeared, putting a barrier around the city and kidnapping people. Rayquaza, a Pokemon that lives in the atmosphere, comes to fight it. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Kids', 'Fantasy']","A mysterious meteorite is hurtling towards the earth. During its entry into the atmosphere, it almost wounds Rayquaza, a sky guardian living in the ozone layer. The meteorite crashes into a polar zone, revealing two egg-shaped objects. The purple egg regenerates into a Deoxys and picks up the green egg. Rayquaza descends from the ozone layer to fight the invader (believing it to be an enemy). A battle ensues, destroying a nearby research site and traumatizing a young boy Tory (Tou'i), scared by a stampede of Spheal, Sealeo, and Walrein. Deoxys engages Rayquaza and the two take turns delivering devastating blows to each other, but the fight draws to a conclusion when Rayquaza surprises the alien Pokémon and fires a point blank Hyper Beam at it. Deoxys' body is destroyed, leaving only the purple crystal in its chest that falls into the sea, while some researchers take a similar green crystal that it found with them to Hoenn. Beneath the sea, the injured Deoxys regenerates and waits.
Four years later, Ash, May, Brock, and Max travel to LaRousse City, where block robots patrol the area. There they meet Tory, who has since become afraid of Pokémon and a loner. Deoxys, which has fully healed, leaves to find the green crystal which Tory's parents are testing in a lab.
In the Battle Tower, Ash mistakes Tory for a Pokémon Trainer and they battle against Rafe and Sid, with Tory using Ash's Torkoal. However, Tory does not know how to handle Ash's Torkoal and they lose. Tory runs away, stopping to save a Minun which was trapped in a trash can. Later, Ash meets Tory's parents and they have fun until they see a mysterious purple aurora, signaling the return of Deoxys.
When Deoxys begins to remove the city's inhabitants to search for the green crystal using copies of itself, it is up to Ash, Pikachu, and Tory to help it find the crystal. This is complicated by the return of Rayquaza, and the security robots malfunctioning, which forces Deoxys to create a force field that disables the city's power. Later, Rayquaza manages to break through the force field. Deoxys and Rayquaza then continue to battle, causing havoc in the city. The green crystal is regenerated when Pikachu and Minun and Plusle charge the power generator in the lab. As the fight continues, Deoxys tackles Rayquaza into the floor. It prepares to finish off Rayquaza, but the green Deoxys arrives, fully regenerated, with perfect timing and quickly transforms into its Defense Forme, saving Rayquaza from the attack. The city is filled with blocks of robots when the chief robot becomes hostile, which overwhelm Rayquaza. The twin Deoxys form shields that protect Rayquaza. Seeing that the two Pokémon are willing to protect it in face of this new threat, Rayquaza begins firing Hyper Beams upon the thousands of robots.
Ash and Tory work together and ultimately manage to shut off the malfunctioning robots by disabling the chief robot, freeing the twin Deoxys and Rayquaza. Tory falls off the towers of robots trying to save Plusle and Minun, but is saved by the green Deoxys. Rayquaza, recognizing that the Deoxys aren't enemies, flies away peacefully, and the Deoxys form green and purple auroras in the sky as a goodbye to their friends, leaving to an unknown destination. Ash states that wherever they are going, at least they would always have each other. Tory, who has gotten over his fear of Pokémon, agrees and later bids Ash and the others farewell at the train station with his new friends, Plusle and Minun, on his shoulders. Ash and his friends continue on their journey through the Hoenn region.
","Don't call it a comeback! But this was the best movie since the third. 
 
The storyline took a while to get going and was mostly an excuse to do fun stuff in Vancouver. But when it did get going, it was excellent, more sci-fi than fantasy and all for the better. In particular, it reminded me a lot of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and given that I really liked that movie this made me happy. 
 
There was nice comic relief throughout and the action scenes, while not QUITE as good as some other movies, were great and intense. 
 
Above all though was the FANTASTIC animation. The backgrounds, and whole atmosphere of the city was extremely well done, not quite as good as Alto Mare but pre close. Pretty much every scene was lovely, and the direction was excellent. The first 10 minutes, in particular, were amazing, and like the beginning of the first movie didn't feel like Pokemon at all, but was better for it. From a pure animation perspective, it was only behind the first and fifth movies, and that says a lot. 
 
Once again, a great movie. Anyone who likes Pokemon and sci-fi should love this.

          
 
       Helpful This film, no, masterpiece deserves more than just a round of applause my friends; for it is one of the greatest movies in this long line of epic tales. 
The story begins when Ash, May, Max and Brock journey to LaRousse. 
This magical city is really cool! There are numerous flying robots that patrol and regulate the city and they are super kawaii desu~ 
The story continues when Ash stumbles upon a pokemon contest, now this is where the movie really shines; the battle scenes! 
The sound, the animation and the pokemon truly come together to put on magnificent shows of flashy fight scenes, the choreography is amazing and animation top notch! 
Later, as Deoxys is born, the story becomes more intrigueing as the city is overrun and taken over by said Pokemon.  
Suddenly munchlax evolves, and they all lived happily ever after.

          
 
       Helpful One of the best Pokémon movies I've seen so far. 
 
The plot is pretty good, although sometimes not executed in sharpest possible detail (in movies/tv shows directed to kids, they usually jump around a bit to skip anything that might lose the viewer's focus). Altogether, the story was good and touching just the right way, and not hurried for the sake of progress. 
 
This is one of the rare times when the new side-characters in the movie weren't disappointing; they were well made and introduced, and you actually cared about what happened to them. They became something other than meaningless faces tagging along for the action; they were part of the team. 
 
Team Rocket made their mandatory appearance, but I don't think they contributed too much to the plot in general. And I don't think they were supposed to, either; they were just familiar faces you could recognize in the flow of the movie. 
 
There was also a Pokémon Munchlax that had a small role to play, and it was quite cleverly introduced to the movie. You don't need to do much to gain a certain level of affection. 
 
A good, enjoyable movie although it started to get a little dull near the end. No matter. An entertaining movie for all Pokémon fans.

The witty dialogue accentuates the animation and sometimes slips into manzai-style humor.
","FULL DISCLOSURE: This is a repaste of my review of the first season, since the series is so short I reviewed both together. The differences are at the bottom. I have not read the original 4-koma. I strongly recommend watching this as it is really short and enjoyable. 
 
ART+ANIMATION: 
It’s a 4-koma based anime, so the art won’t be amazing. That being said, everything looks purposeful and there are no outstanding omissions. There are moments within the story with strongly different art / animation to match the situational comedy and they all work well. 
 
The animation is standard-issue for this genre. However, there is one episode that uses its own dreary feeling animation style for a character development flashback - I think its use was well-suited. There are even a few scenes where the animation functions well as a metaphor for the situation. 
 
Nothing worth mentioning about sound or music. As is the norm, the music merely fits the moods. 
 
STORY: 
The story is about a mid-20’s couple consisting of a nerdy guy and a ‘normal’ girl. Thankfully, the husband’s nerdiness for the most part only influences his personality so that it doesn’t get too old too quickly. It’s very episodic with the general contents of each episode not having much effect on the others, but there is also a lot of continuous building of the plot.  
 
Of course most of the episodes are about their antics or daily life activities, no surprise there. What’s new at least to me is that the situations are much more interesting than the plethora of middle-/high-school student SOL, thanks to the mid-20’s couple. Being in that stage of life, many of the situations are relatable to me personally. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
The character design in a SOL 4-koma is very basic, but I like the faces and expressions. Definitely moe-style but here it’s not a bad thing.  
 
As fitting for a 4-koma, many of the supporting characters exist only to suit a certain running gag or two, but nothing is too overdone. There are some other good, normal interactions within them and the main characters. 
 
Despite being episodic, there is some real character development going on, and some of it really hits home hard. Both husband and wife have real life problems, and you learn that the wife is not nearly as normal as you were earlier led to believe. 
 
Kugimiya Rie is a voice actor in the show (not too often) – I like her in case you can’t tell. Aaanyways… the voice acting is well-fitting to the characters, so no bad marks there. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
There are some pretty good jokes and references included, and the way some of them are portrayed in such a mundane setting makes it even more entertaining. Of course, some references fly right over my head either since I’m not Japanese or familiar with many of the reference material, but thankfully I don’t feel too left out.  
 
Despite the episodes only lasting three minutes each, they are not sped way up to fit everything which was the right decision for the content and mood. Having a show of this format include some pretty serious character development was a welcome surprise. 
 
OVERALL: 
Great short story with some good character development. The humor is right up my alley. The art is nothing special but the focus is more on the main characters than anything else. 
 
COMPARED WITH 1ST SEASON: 
Humor is just as good, but the story turns more episodic with a general focus on the couple becoming ready for parenthood. Feels more somber, first season was better. 
 
TL;DR: 
Cute, funny, with some deeper, young couple topics. Watch it. 


          
 
       Helpful Basically everything that I said about the first season rings about the same for this season, as its more or less the same as last season, but with different antics and such going down. However theres a lot less screentime with the titular husband dude, so that kinda bogs things down a bit. Either way this anime is still pretty good, and the episodes are still all under 5 minutes, which is good if you want to just watch shit to watch shit. Also the baby that was so important during the last episode of the first season is nowhere to be seen until the last episode of this season, so rip that baby being a story device. If I were to finally describe this anime, this anime's description would be ""this anime is so great, that i would reccomend this anime to everyone"", so thats what this anime would be. = this anime. 9/10.

       Helpful This heart-warming series about an otaku's amazing marriage to a mostly-ordinary girl continues into season 2. Like the first season, the majority of the show is composed of 4-koma like short events, which are often humorous. The show doesn't exploit the discovery in the last episode of season 1 as much as I thought it would. Regardless, it does a great job of continuing the feel-good relationship-based atmosphere of the first season. As usual, the first season is mandatory as there isn't any character exposition. 
 
Animation: 
Expect the same as the first season, not really the prettiest thing out there but it does the job. Like the first season, expect the subject matter to be a bit on the mature side- including quite a few dirty jokes. 
 
Sound: 
Also very similar to the first season, the show has a nice ED and average BGM. The voice talent is very good for something this short. 
 
Story: 
What really matters in marriage? Is it okay that other people say that it won't work? How do you get through a bad argument? The show gives some playful insight into life after marriage, as well as some of the characters' pasts previous to their vows. The overall message is very positive, and it feels like an attempt to get more Japanese folks to marry and also the next step. 
 
As with the previous season, expect episodic episodes each with its own theme. There isn't much in terms of episode dependency so don't worry too much about spreading it across multiple viewings. There isn't as cute of an ending surprise as the first season, unfortunately. 
 
Character: 
There's some nice episodes that focus on character flashbacks, expanding on how they met and other meaningful events in their past. Their relationship is already very well established compared to, well, every other show out there, so don't expect too much dynamic progression. Still, there definitely is great chemistry here. 
 
Value: 
The entertainment to viewing-time ratio is very good, if you liked the first season there's no reason not to pick this up.

She tricks her grandfather, ponders for hours over how to spend her allowance, and hates sitting next to ugly boys. She talks, feels and lives just as real kids do.

Looking at the art style and quickly finding out it's school story about small children, and that it didn't heavily feature crudeness or violence, I thought for sure that I would be bored out of my mind. 
 
I was wrong. 
 
I watched this movie during my breaks at work and was thoroughly engrossed in everything Maruko set out to do. I recalled my own hope and desire to do really well at simple things at school and failing at them miserably. It made me remember the friendships that I had.  
 
The ""flatness"" of some of the characters' personality was acceptable because, as a kid, I only really made the effort to know a few people really well. It made their portrayal more believable. The flamboyant one, the ugly clown, the suck-up, the orderly teacher wannabe.  
 
The movie did a great job of reminding me that childhood may seem easier as an adult, but for the kids living it it's just as serious and important to them that their lives go well. The ending isn't tragic in the usual sense, and though it is predictable it is very well set up and it was hard to avoid feeling for everyone involved. 
 
I'd recommend this movie to anyone who looks back on childhood with a little bit of longing. The art style may seem simple but it is surprisingly well-acted, both through voice and animation. They are obviously exaggerations of third-graders, but it is nevertheless believable.

Story: 7 
The story in Mekakucity Actors is rather simplistic but there are a few twists and turns that are unexpected. It startes out with Shintaro Kisagari who is sitting in his room while surfing the web. You will find out he is a NEET who hasn't been outside for 2 years. You will soon find out there is a girl on his computer, like a digital girl. Her name is Ene. She is messing with Kisagari's computer and breaks his keyboard. Due to this event he has to go outside to buy a new keyboard, and that is when things are starting to get weird (You will find out about the rest when you watch the show).

       Helpful I have been a fan of vocaloid for several years. I have also been a fan of shaft, and i believe this affected my high enjoyment. Im going to write what i like and dislile in those categories, trying to avoid spoilers. 
 
Plot: You had to wait a while for the plot, but since all the episodes are built around kagerou projects-videos/songs, the plot felt kind of forced, as it started rather late. If there was just one more episode, it would honestly be much better, and get 10/10 by me. 
 
Characters: Just plain awesome characters. They captured them from the songs very well. 
 
Overall: I believe you should listen to all the songs before watching this.

          
 
       Helpful Mekakucity Actors was an anime which I started watching with high expectations and expecting to enjoy, since my best friend had been talking a lot about it in a very positive manner. In fact, I watched it because of her, which may or may not be a very good thing. 
 
The story of Mekakucity Actors was, as I believe most people know, based upon an anthology of vocaloid songs. I think that this is already a very fresh, new adaptation, since most anime are based off light novels, manga, visual novels, etc. 
However, this new concept doesn’t seem to be a very good one. I have heard, on a number of different sites (including MAL) that it is hard to understand if you haven’t read the manga (I think?), you will find it confusing. I’m going to verify that. 
As someone who had neither listened to the songs, nor read the manga beforehand, I’ve got to say that this is possible the most confusing storyline I have encountered so far.  
For starters, the layout of the episode is all wrong - they still have a vitally important story elements after the ending theme. As someone who prefers to skip to the next episode rather than sitting for another two minutes listening to the ending theme (unless I absolutely love it), I almost missed it.  
That aside, the story is very disjointed. Flashbacks come and go without warning, so it often took me a few moments to realise that I had just watched a flashback, after having wondered why a certain event is going on at that moment. This contributed to the overall confusing aspect of this anime. 
The story element also managed, somehow, to be incredibly slow-paced yet rushed, sometimes simultaneously. At the tenth episode, I was still wondering when the real action was going to start. It did in episode 12, but was so confusing that I didn’t value it at all.  
In truth, the storyline didn’t meet my expectations at all. I was foolishly thinking that their red eye powers would come into use more than twice. I don’t think Seto’s powers came into play even once.  
At first, I liked the fact that every episode concentrated on a different character, but I think that in the end, it pulled away from the actual storyline, as well as took away screen time from a considerably large amount of characters (Hibiya especially).  
Had the series been executed more intelligently, perhaps even with more episodes, I am sure that it would have been a lot let confusing and much more enjoyable. The first few episodes were understandable, but the last few, notably, were incredibly rushed and even more confusing. Story gets a ‘4’.  
 
The art element was very mediocre. Usually, scenery is a saving grace for most anime - not for this one, though. This was quite obviously a low budget anime, and so the art was not as enjoyable as it should have been. Characters were also affected. Their art was nothing special, and some traits were very strange, such as the tear ducts, or the often absence of pupils, changing eye colours (not including red eyes), and the very annoying background people. The producers hadn’t even bothered to give them traits, so all they were were gray figures. However, at the end of the day, I drew both Ene and Ayano, so it wasn’t all that bad.  
The colour themes in particular were quite depressing and badly chosen. Often, there were colour themes, such as yellow, and as a result, the sky, sea and ground were yellow. In one of the episodes, the sky was red, in another, there were a whole bunch of tombstones, all black. Other times, elements, including characters, were simply white with black outlines. These were mainly scenery elements, but Marry appears to have white-white skin, which just looks weird. Features were also very ‘straight’ in a sense - instead of curves, there were straight lines and angles a lot of the time. Apart from a few characters, I did not enjoy the art.  
The animation also wasn’t very good. Whilst it wasn’t extremes such as things passing through body parts, every time a character was running, it looked as if they were jogging on the spot, unless the viewpoint was from the sky.  
I also give the art a ‘5’, since they put so little effort into it.  
 
There was a fair bit of music, presumably since the whole series was based of a series of songs. Personally, the songs weren’t my favourites, but some of them, like ‘Ayano’s Happiness Theory’ and ‘Kisaragi Attention’ grew on me after I had heard them a couple of times.  
My personal tastes aside, there was a good amount of music. At times, I found that the music was unfitting. And sometimes, it broke the silence only to make the ensuing silence all the more obvious. Similarly to the storyline, it wasn’t executed in the best way possible. 
I really enjoyed the voice acting, though, and found that the voices were very fitting to the characters.  
I think sound deserves a '6.5'. 
 
I quite enjoyed the range of characters. Some of them were a little stereotypical, but all in all they were different, and likeable characters who had their own traits.  
In line with the storyline, focusing each episode on a different character affected them both positively and negatively. Certain characters appeared all throughout the anime and got very good character development, such as Ene and Momo, others gave a wrong first impression of being notable characters before being forgotten in the shadows, such as Shintarou and Hibiya. I honestly wondered what Shintarou was doing in the anime (except for getting us to discover Ene’s existence), and thought that perhaps Hibiya had been forgotten. Needless to say, this created a huge imbalance between the development of the characters.  
Since there were a few good characters which made up for the badly presented ones, I give this element a ‘6’. 
 
Despite getting confused at times during the first 7 episodes, I still found the anime enjoyable and watched several episodes back to back, despite the anime having little to none OMG factor[1]. As the quality of the story line plummeted and the anime got more an more confusing, I started enjoying it less and less. I did not force myself to watch this, yet I did not find it all that enjoyable.  
I give enjoyment a ‘4.5’.  
 
Overall, this anime was poorly executed. As a result, the storyline was extremely confusing, the art was very mediocre, there were major imbalances between the characters and I did not enjoy it as much as I should have. I would warn all viewers that they may be disappointed, and I was very much so.

9,492,57,6.495174736,A group of people living together,Armitage III: Dual-Matrix,"A few years after they first met, Naomi Armitage and Ross Syllabus have started a family. Despite their normal lives, they must keep their identities a secret because many people believe that Robots do not deserve equal status with humans. Ross has an opportunity to abolish these ideas on Earth through a vote, but organizations in the shadows are working so that it doesn't happen. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mecha']","
","Takes place several years after the OVAS (not the Poly-Matrix movie), Naomi and Ross are living together in St.Lowell with their daughter Yoki. However, Naomi discovers that someone is trying to resurrect the ""Thirds"" project and Naomi travels to Earth to find out why. On Earth, she discovers that a man named Demetrio wants Armitage to revive the Thirds and to use them as their servants for mankind. she refuses and obviously, all hell breaks lose again. Now Naomi must save Ross and Yoki from the organization, destroy the ""Thirds"" project and get back to their home by all means necessary.  
 
The story in this movie focuses more on the heroine Naomi. It focuses on the 2 sides of her; One that she is a Third type fighting machine and the second is that she is a loving mother who will risk her life to save her child from any danger she faces. The relationship with Naomi and Yoki is very hearfelt and you can clearly see that she cares for her own daughter,  even if Naomi is a robot. Ross is still good but he has little to do in this movie and he's only useful in the last hours of the movie where he is protecting Yoki from a bunch of Thirds prototype robots that love to kill and for some reason, they can't stop laughing. The villain in this movie was boring as shit here and he's there to be an evil stereotype guy with no purpose whatsoever. Even the side-characters are as boring as ever in this movie and have barely to do in the story, minus that clown looking guy that helps Armitage (forgot the name). 
 
The animation is improved in this movie for the better or worst. For the good about this animation is that it looks more slick and stylish than the first and the colors are greatly improved. For the bad part is that the animation company AIC had a low budget for this project and they used incredibly cheap CG animation that looks terrible and doesn't even fit with the 2D art style but I can't blame them. The English voice-acting is improved tremendously and Juliette Lewis performance as Naomi Armitage is badass, cool and most of all, heartwarming and she did a bang job at her role. Hank Wilspank's performance as Ross is a greater improvement over Sutherland's and while it isn't perfect, at least he gives more energy to his role than what Sutherland did in the first movie.  
 
While not as good as the original, Dual Matrix offers enough depth and charm that it hardly matters if the sequel is better or not. If you're a fan of the OVAS or the movie, then I recommend this to you but don't expect this to be the perfect sequel that makes the original look bad cause it's not. It's only a solid and fun movie.

          
 
       Helpful Armitage III Dual Matrix 
 
With a futuristic theme and a lot of sci-fi Armitage III Dual Matrix is a must for those who like science fiction and robots. You'll get the classic Matrix style action, high tech battles and a very interesting environment. 
 
Though a few details are left shrouded in mystery, a lot of character development does go on, making it a worth-while movie. 
 
It does have the classic and often overused theme of a robot becoming very much like a human, but it's not sappy about it in the least. While some search for the logic that explains an event proving that humanity, which is not the common &quot;I have feelings too&quot; claim but a different kind of event, others can't help it but to be amazed by the mystery. To say anything else would spoil it, so just watch it for yourself and enjoy a great sci-fi movie.

          
 
       Helpful Armitage III Dual Matrix 
 
Dual Matrix feels very much like one step forward and two steps back compared to the original OVA. While on the technical side it's a large improvement I don't think there's any more fun to be had here than with the OVA. 
 
Art/animation: I'd say this is where most of the drastic improvements took place with visual style of the anime becoming a lot more consistent. From the way the world looks to characters themselves it feels much more solid and defined. On its own it is not that amazing either since it's just a bog standard sci-fi affair with tightly packed skyscrapers and lots of metal and electronics everywhere. However it's still a decent looker, less jank than in the predecessor and better shot composition on average as well as cool color schemes here in there that are more in line with what you'd expect from cyberpunk. The gore aspect is gone by the way so you expected exploding hands and oceans of blood like in the OVA then you'll have to kill that murderboner for now. 
 
Story: Things somehow have gotten worse and I'm not talking about the events of the movie. The writing in the original show wasn't much to look at either and I can't exactly call that one self-aware but at least they didn't shove it in your face that much. Not the case with Dual Matrix. It feels as if someone on the team thought they've really got something going there and they put a lot more focus on making sure you understand how complex this whole conflict is. In reality it hardly is. I put so much effort to get invested into the story and soak up everything they feed out to the viewer but it's hardly worth it. To begin with we're working with wooden characters that feel less than one dimensional, like hell, I can't even see what Armitage is supposed to be, at times she's a cute mom robot that goes out at night to protect her kind from injustice and takes it all with a great sense of duty and responsibility, other times you see her casually play with people that try to kill her and smirks at the danger ahead. It's a combination of this ally of justice and battle hungry battle robot that's doesn't make sense and is never elaborated upon. When you have a such clash of personality you can't just leave it out like it doesn't matter cause it doesn't fit. To me it just seems like at certain moments the action sensibilities take over and instead of crafting a proper story with characters you can care for they thought ""what would happen in a badass action movie"" and tried to replicate it without much success. Another moment that made me think this was when Armitage jumps through a window, scans what's ahead of her and we see a whole bunch of armed robots. The way it's presented you'd expect a cool, fast paced action scene to flow from here but instead she just shoots two robots out of a billion and runs through gunfire to elevator and just leaves, ok, cool, that's some badass action you got there. But at least we get to see Armitage fight the same two clones over and over for like half an hour, that couldn't have been shortened in favor of some variety. So yeah, characters suck. Especially the main villain cause it's just a guy who was in the first part for like 4 minutes and doesn't get any development at all. It's just a mess, it would take twice the runtime of the movie to go over each individual element and explain why it's so bad. 
 
Music: Minor improvement over the original. Even though it's a infinitely more cheesy it's also a lot more fitting to the occasion this time around. That's about it, despite it all it's not memorable in any way and just crosses the line of serviceable. 
 
Directing: Not much of an improvement in this category either. I'll commend that they finally started kinda caring about color direction in a sci-fi title, flow of action is a lot more coherent and shots on average are composed better but it's still a mess when it comes to pacing and how much time needs to be spent on something important vs shots of characters looking at things. 
 
Fun factor: Unless you're some hardcore Armitage fan just pass it by. It's a meh action flick and it's an even more underwhelming sci-fi movie. Your time would be better spent watching one of the countless sci-fi titles that executes everything better.

","When I was a kid I used to fantasies about being all alone in a still and quiet world. To just walk around in it and explore without disruption, gave kid me the chills and the feelings of excitement and calm at the same time. I don?t know where that fantasy originated from, maybe a book I read, but it stayed with me for a long time. So, naturally, I was very intrigued when reading the synopsis Kokkoku (Moment by Moment). An anime that bases in this frozen world concept, count me in! But did it evoke the same feeling my childhood fantasies? I will get down to that now.  
  
Kokkoku take the concept still and quiet world and go all the way with it. The normal but a bit dysfunctional family Yukawa, are suddenly forced to use their magical heirloom to save two of the family members by stop time and enter what is called Stasis. Unlike me, they don?t feel excitement and calm when entering this quiet and still world. Which is completely understandable, because they are not alone. Other people also seemingly have the power walk around in frozen time, and monster-like creatures called Heralds are lurking around. And in this still and frozen world, a cat and mouse game for life and death take its place. 
 
This was absolutely an interesting premise (at least to me for obvious reasons). But its just that, what I wrote in the section above is a pretty good summarize of all that happens in these 12-episodes long story. It does have its little twists, like some of the characters has powers, and of the mysteries of this world is explored. That was the highlights. Otherwise its pretty straight forward, family tries to save their family members and get out of Stasis alive, and a secret society that have their own agenda. It was absolutely refreshing several ways; 1) the main characters are not a group of high school students, but a normal family. 2) the concept of a frozen reality is not a concept used 3 times every season. 3) The only real fanservice is in the ending song. All plus in my book. But even do refreshing in many ways, it still kind of missed “it”, to really pull me in and looking forward to it. I can?t really put my finger on what, I just found myself mildly interested in the story.  
 
The characters are just as the story kind of fresh and lovely under used. Useless overweight unemployed dad? Check. Sake loving grandfather? Check. NEET older brother in his late 20?s? Check. The voice of reason little sister? Check. Together they were realistically portrayed as dysfunctional family. I think that made up a fresh group of main characters in an anime, as far the family theme goes. But were they super interesting? Njaaaa… Not really, just fresh in anime, at least to me. They weren?t thought provoking, nor very memorable.  
 
Kokkoku is the work of the newly founded Geno Studio, and the art animation is absolutely decent. The characters can look a bit sloppy at distance, and nothing astonishing otherwise. Backgrounds often looks good, depict the Japanese suburb nicely.  
 
The VA?s (Japanese) all did their job without any complaints from me. Slow and uninterested voice of NEET brother? Its on spot. Annoying and loud voice of loser dad? Oh yes, they nailed it. Gruffy and hoarse voice of old sake loving grandpa? Yes, indeed. The soundtrack was fine, just as the characters though, not that memorable. The opening is however quite memorable, with a pop-rocky beat. 
  
Did it entertain my as much as my childhood fantasies? Well, sad to say no. Do I regret my time? Absolutely no. Even if it became more of a chore then a pleasure towards the end, the interesting concept and the mildly explored Stasis world was enough to pull me through to the end. The cat and mouse game became e little dragged on as it was the main focus. I would?ve liked a bit more world exploring, such as the complexity of the Stasis world and its inhabitants, the origin of the magical stones and the power it could bestow normal people and so on. That would?ve made this more enjoyable to me. I can recommend Kokkoku to you that can coup with narrow storytelling and slow pace, its not a bad show, its just not a the brightest star in the sky. 


          
 
       Helpful I liked this anime a lot, 
It was my favorite anime of the winter 2018 ongoing anime. 
 
The art style was pretty nice and fit very good with this kind of story. 
The characters where portrayed in a good matter. 
 
At the start of the anime, you are kinda curious about what is going to happen. 
Then, it is starting to get interesting, and you want to see more. 
Eventually you'll be hooked to this anime, since it has this certain vibe. 
Then you realize this anime is almost to its end, and you are starting to feel a little sad. 
 
The story never got boring in my opinion, and was always very interesting. 
This was one of the few anime's that I think had a really good ending!!! 
Normally when an anime ends, I feel a little sad and empty because it's over, but in this case I don't mind, because of the good ending. 
 
Some more story about the world itself could have been told in a spin-off, but that is very unlikely to happen. 
 
I would definitely recommend this anime.

          
 
       Helpful I had never heard of Kokkoku when I watched the first episode, but I was hooked afterwards. Now, here at the end, I definitely enjoyed myself, but I can see it probably isn't for everybody. 
 
Art 3/5 
Well drawn, the action scenes do a good job of communicating the speed and impact of every action, and the cast are all distinctly designed without having to resort to goofy hats or anything. In fact, kudos to the animators for keeping the details of the time stop in mind when lots of small objects are flying or falling. However, it makes extensive use of CGI for several elements - personally, I think it blends well enough with the more traditional animation, but if you strongly dislike it in your anime, its going to annoy you frequently.  
 
Sound 4/5 
Much like the animation, the sound effects do a great job of putting oomph behind the action scenes. Most of the music, when there is any, doesn't stand out too strongly, but I think ""Flashback"" is the best OP of the season - its a great song and the visuals accompanying it are really slick. Like a friend of mine said: ""You gotta respect someone who can turn 'punching a man's heart' into a beat drop."" 
 
Character 3/5 
I think Juri makes for a good main character. She's got some playfulness to her, but she's mostly a serious woman who gets stuff done. Like the show's description says, her response to the yakuza kidnapping her nephew is to grab a knife and get ready to cut some fools. As things progress, she shows little hesitation in getting things done when push comes to shove, but its obvious the situation is wearing away at her and you wonder if she can hold on. 
Her grandpa is cool, and is similarly willing to step up to the occasion in a crisis. The rest of the cast is kind of hit or miss; the brother and father wear on my nerves, and quite a few are just kind of there. 
 
Story 4/5 
The show starts off with a really interesting premise, that being the time stop spell. From episode 2 onwards, it expands on this premise is some interesting directions. Without spoiling anything, let's just say the spell has some rules and exceptions that play heavily into the advancement of the story, but don't feel broken or unnatural. 
That said, I feel like I need to dock points for the ending. Not that its bad -just that they REALLY needed another episode or two to smooth it out. It feels very abrupt. 
 
Enjoyment 4/5 
Kokkoku moves slowly (not because of the time stop, hur hur hur) but I enjoyed the ride all the same. The first episode made me want to see where it was going, each episode ended at the perfect cliffhanger to keep me interested, and in the last third, s*** gets crazy and I wanted to see how it would one-up itself. 
 
Overall 4/5 
Kokkoku feels unique and is a fun experience - the action scenes have some good brutality to them and some of the imagery is hilarious in how bonkers it is. Unfortunately, its pacing is definitely not for everyone and its story has some major rough edges.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy']","
Much of the story is told through flashbacks while Sae Niijima interrogates the protagonist. After the protagonist defends a woman from assault, he is framed for assaulting the man responsible and put on probation, resulting in expulsion from his school. He is sent to Tokyo to stay with family friend Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must be rehabilitated to avoid future ruin and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads him into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. The protagonist meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their ""Treasure,"" the emotional root of their behavior and desires, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. The protagonist assumes the codename Joker and, together with Morgana and his friends Ryuji and Ann, reforms Kamoshida.
The group forms the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city, slowly learning of a broader conspiracy to influence the hearts of Tokyo. They are joined along the way by Yusuke Kitagawa, whom they help to reform his corrupt teacher Madarame; Sae's sister Makoto, who is initially assigned to spy on them but joins after being blackmailed by criminal boss Kaneshiro; Sojiro's adopted daughter Futaba, who sunk into a depressed state after the conspiracy murdered her mother and redirected the blame to her using a forged suicide note; and Haru Okumura, who rebels against her billionaire father's attempts to control her life and his mistreatment of his employees. As the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the public's attention and the police, including Sae and Akechi. The Phantom Thieves' popularity plummets after they are framed for causing Haru's father to go into a fatal mental shutdown by a black-masked assassin, who was mentioned by other targets. Pursuing the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who convinces them to change Sae's heart.
After infiltrating Sae's Palace, Joker is captured by the police. Akechi is revealed to be the assassin and attempts to kill Joker, but the Phantom Thieves have already discovered his betrayal and use the Metaverse to fake Joker's death. Aided by Sae and Sojiro, the Phantom Thieves go undercover and deduce the conspiracy's leader to be politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles from his path toward becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as being the one who framed and pressed charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself as Shido's illegitimate son and plans to get revenge on Shido for abandoning him and his late mother. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to ultimately defeat Shido. Despite Shido's arrest and confession, the public's opinion of him remains primarily unchanged, and Shido may be released through the manipulation of his allies. The Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos, the Palace of everyone's hearts, to steal the Treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy.
The Phantom Thieves are ejected from Mementos by the Treasure itself and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and integrate into Lavenza, their proper form. Lavenza reveals the Igor that Joker has been seeing in the Velvet Room until this point is actually Yaldabaoth, the God of Control, who imprisoned the actual Igor. Yaldabaoth, Mementos's Treasure made sentient, was created from humanity's wish to give up control and be free from suffering. Through a wager made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see the influence of their actions on society while steering the wager in his favor. Joker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fights him. Joker's confidants rally the support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona, Satanael, to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, Joker turns himself in to the police for Shido to be prosecuted. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.
","As a person who started with Persona 1 on the Playstation One, I have been a major Shin Megami Tensei fan since. I hold it as a series dear to my heart. The series is a Japanese Role Playing game that follows its themes around demonic entities and mythology. Persona is a sub-series of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise that pretty much is just that but with a high school setting. In recent entries there have been the additions of social links and dating. The series has only recently gained a larger following as it's been very niche for quite some time until Persona 3 and Persona 4. It is still pretty niche but now with the advent of Persona 5 many newcomers are flocking to the series to experience the greatness of the Persona series for the first time. The series just keeps growing year by year.  
 
Now the ride to Persona 5 has been a tough and almost excruciating one. The game has been delayed a plethora of times thus giving off many red flags. All you Persona fans were aware of some of the crazy stuff that was going on with the game's release date. That, however, is a completely separate topic.  What I want to discuss today is the single episode 24 minute animated short for Persona 5. First things first, I'd like to state that the short is very good. Honestly it's not enough to keep you occupied until the game is released(especially for us who are waiting on the release outside of Japan) but what I love about it is that it gives Persona 5 a more ""Shin Megami Tensei"" feel. That is, the modern Persona games are generally more lighthearted than the mainline Shin Megami Tensei games. Persona 1 and Persona 2 play very similarly to the early Shin Megami Tensei games on the NES and SNES. Heck, Persona 1 and 2 are related to a game named Shin Megami Tensei: If which is a spin-off of the original Shin Megami Tensei games. The newer Persona games are more cheery and not as dark as the early Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games. So when I see this I get pumped because I did not want another Persona 4 clone. Persona 4 is my least favorite in the series. I love the game but the other entries are just better in my opinion. The mood and tone that the short gave off were the selling point for me. It felt darker and more gloomy. A feeling Persona 3 and 4 did not give me.  
 
Now let's talk about the quality of the actual story and characters. It's very hard to say anything as this is just a 24 minute short and it's a standalone episode. The writing overall was done well. They really did a good job at trying to give fans an idea of what Persona 5 will be about.  All perspectives for each character were earned rightfully.  Plus Morgana is pretty cute... :D 
 
The art and animation are very good. Very stylish approach and beautiful color palette. Honestly I give a lot of flack on the animation/art in newer anime and I have to say that is just gloriously animated. Everything about the animation is great. The battle scene in the short was also awesome and perhaps the peak of the animation. It was honestly the best looking piece of motion in the short. 
 
This music is just... wonderful! Jazz on crack is what I would describe it as. Persona and SMT games generally have good music but this is just fantastic. Really fits the mood well, even the gloomy portions which is strange to say but they manage to balance it out quite evenly. 
 
Overall, your enjoyment of this anime does not matter if you are a fan of the games or not. The animation, art style, and the music alone is just enough to sit down and watch this. It's just so jazzy and fashionable. And for those of you who are fans I highly recommend checking this out. This won't spoil for the game. If anything, it'll actually give you a glimpse of what the game will be like. September 15 for Japan and Valentine's Day for the Worldwide release. So if you are lonely and don't have a Valentine's you'll have this game to service you. :D

          
 
       Helpful As always Shoji Meguro has done a wonderful job composing. With his music playing, during well-directed - yet lacklusterly animated - scenes, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Even if you aren't interested in Persona, I'd suggest to just watch this for that fight scene. 
This special doesn't serve as much more than an introduction for a videogame - Persona 5, as you might have guessed - and logically we don't get a deep, nor resolved plot (we only see a short subplot). While the setting and themes are really interesting, the story (of the special) isn't much new. However, within 24 minutes it does a good job establishing the characters - again, without too much depth. 
 
It definitely did what it was supposed to do: hype me up for Persona 5, which is coming out on February 14th in the west. The only lover I need, is whatever character the Lovers arcana will be assigned to.

          
 
       Helpful Well seeing the fact that I am big ass Persona fan and it is the only game I am hyped for besides Pokemon Sun and Moon, I decided to review the special. This is covering the anime for the new 5th installment (not counting Golden, FES, Persona 3 portable and the other spinoffs) in the Persona franchise which I love almost as much as I do Pokemon 
 
For those that don't know this is basically the special to showcase the gist of the new Persona 5 game WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL BUY! 
 
.....Kidding Kidding. I'm kidding don't take it seriously....Well don't take 30% seriously.....Moving On! 
 
anyway back on point this is basically showing what the new group of protagonist in the Persona series will be doing in the game and honestly it alright. It's nothing stellar or groundbreaking, but it is worth a watch if you want to get more hyped. 
 
The story is alright but nothing great. It's is really just showing the kinda of stuff that will likely go on in the game and was just made to showcase it. The animation and character designs are pretty good for a special and the sound is alright. Characters were....alright but they'll likely be better in the game next year. 
 
Honestly I enjoyed this a lot. It got me more hyped for the game then I was before and I was pretty f'ing hyped. Anyway it's a worth a watch, hopefully any body that reads this reviews decides to watch and hopefully enjoys it. I also hope they make an anime series or do the movies with this thing when the game is released like they did with Persona 3 and Persona 4. 
 
With that being said I am out people. Peace

They only have one point in common, simply that each of them need a large amount of money for their individual circumstances. And to get the large monetary award, they must play in the game despite their very own lives being at stake.
","Bus Gamer was made by the same author of the well known Saiyuki series. Thus you can expect handsome men and fun battles, which the anime does provide.  
 
Toki Mishiba, Nobuto Nakajyo and Kazuo Saitou, three strangers in need of a large sum of money, form a team in an underground corporate sponsored street fight. The goal is to steal a disk containing secret information from the opposing team, while protecting their own disk. 
 
The team has its variety in fighting styles and motivation. Each character is shrouded in mystery and the short series slowly reveals hints of why this mismatched trio so desperately needs cash to the point of risking their lives in an illegal street fight. 
 
To say anything about the characters would spoil the series, however, the series itself only scratches the surface of those potentially interesting characters. My only complaint is that it feels very much unfinished with only hints of their past being revealed and their main rival hardly getting started on the chase.  
 
Though the series does show enough to let us get a taste of what it's like and leave us wanting more. So if you don't mind being left with the feeling of lack of closure, check this out and you'll at least enjoy what little is available.

       Helpful I just wanted to put this down.  I think this anime brings something new to the table(from what I understand), wether it be good or bad.  I like that it took me out of the typical anime feeling, I get when watching most animes.  You really don't have to absorb that much information to get it.  I like that it skips most of the bullshit that tends to get reptitive in animes.  Also if you watch anime alot or know alot of stories, or imaginative, or w/e I believe this anime was made so you use your knowledge to fill in the blanks. 
 
Story:  I like the story.  I would say the story is presented in a poem form as opposed to a novel, for the lack of episodes.  Their is still a story to this anime.  Six indivduals are put together inside an arena, and it is a three on three battle, and the winners get cash.  That part isn't really innovative, but the setting they are in and situations they have are kind of.  So that is why I gave it what I did.

","With the popularity of the isekai genre, new entries need to either a gimmick or a slight change to the isekai recipe to get a bump up from ""ugh another isekai"" to ""hey this isekai might be alright"" status. With the protagonist being falsely accused of rape, humiliated and given no respect whatsoever the rise of the shield hero showed promise but unfortunately became another Isekai.  
 
Story 
 
We follow Naofumi, a hero who doesn't the respesct he deserve because he wields a shield, which is understandable it's a shield. His heroic exploits include owning slaves and clever use of his shield to defeat foes. You might be wondering how can you defeat your enemy with nothing but a shield? First of all great question, Secondly, Naofumi uses a shield like it's never been used before. I mean that literally he use a shield to burn some of his foes.  
 
As you can guess the story is not as good as it can be. Reminders that Naofumi is a good guy are always delivered in vague lessons of virtue and are always questionable. 
 
 
Art 
If turn the volume off, the only reminder left to to remind you that your watching the rise of the shield hero is the character design. The only commendation I have for the art is the background art. 
 
Sound 
Kevin Penkin does it again. with really good soundtrack. To be honest he was the reason I watched this show. I was tempted to listen to the show instead of watching. 
 
The rise of the shield hero was a disappointing anime. There was so much more they could've done with the whole disgraced hero gimmick. Instead they went with your usual isekai crap dominating the anime landscape.    


          
 
       Helpful I honestly wanted to like it but just couldn't. 
 
The first two episodes had potential. the show is set up as a hero being forced to play the villain in order to succeed in a world that has some unknown grudge against him but the show never took off from there. The hero never fully embraced the edgy ""anti-hero"" status initially promised and spent nearly every episode wallowing in angst while helping villagers through unimpressive tasks. Most importantly, the combat scenes are underwhelming, especially compared to the quality of those in other shows currently airing. Save yourself the pain and re-watch overlord  instead.

          
 
       Helpful The only thing I hate about Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari is that I have to wait a week for each episode. Goddammit. 
 
I haven't watched many isekai anime; in fact the only good one I've seen until now has been No S2 No Life So Fuck My Life. But boy, am I glad to see a new anime challenge the traditional isekai tropes... Naofumi the protagonist, as the vilified Hero is brilliantly written, and all the bs he has to put up with is something one can empathize with, especially with the current social situation being as it is. What with the whole #metoo movement which has now turned into a witch hunt and outrage culture, Tate no Yuusha really drives home the point. The way he acts is quite porbably the way I myself would, if I was put in an identical position. 
 
Art style seems mainstream fare for me, although that in no way demeans it; but I wouldn't say it's god-tier either. Same with the background music, in my opinion. They are both serviceable, but it's no One Punch Man or Mob Psycho 100 where we're watching the show both for the antics of the characters AND the incredible art style. 
 
I'm loving how the relationship has been developing between Naofumi and his ""slave"" Raphthalia at present; can't wait to see what the anime does with it. Yeah, this anime has slavery in it. Some fodder material for SJWs who enjoy talking shit without grasping the full facts. I hope there is more controversy over the show, cuz controversy would in turn drive up the anime's popularity, and I'd love for Tate no Yuusha to be watched even more.

Now, the anime adaptation by Asread: *Read the entire MAL synopsis* 
 
Hmm...seems a bit different eh? Whatever it is, the story doesn't make the series more interesting, and while it is true for most card game adapted anime out there (Yugioh at least tried and it as an amazing childhood show for me), this show just made the story exposition throw out the window almost apparently and went in its own incomprehensible direction. That is not the vexing part, not just yet. 
 
The characters, be it of the faction they are part of the series, aren't very appealing at all, and that has been the constant ever since the opening of this show. Let's take the MC Kamina Chihiro for example. Voiced by the ever popular KajiKaji, this is another wasted talent of his part here, because this is one of the times of which his voice-acting doesn't really match well to the unimpressive cast of characters, whom are always at his throats. The list of character VAs are again impressive, but similar with KajiKaji's situation, they absolutely trolled this show to bits. 
 
Speaking of the MC, his goal of alliance between good vs. evil becomes a stepping stone for him to transform to the Lord of Vermilion (which ends up killing people anyways). If you need a show that kills its characters faster than it should, this is the perfect trash for you.  
 
The production quality is absolutely perfectly horrendous to the point of being watchable until your eyes close and burn at the insanely boredom-filled execution it does. I have never trusted in Asread to perform another quality show, and 2016's Big Order just is an experience that while similar to this, I'd much rather you watch Mirai Nikki (made by the same studio, only leaps and bounds better). Not to say that I'm a fan in the first place, but I'd question you: ""Why the hell are you watching this?"" 
 
If there was anything to go by for this series, it's the music, and it's hopelessly the EXACT same circumstance to sell the show. The OST from May'n and JUNNA are good, but I'd question the same intent as the rest of the show. I thought that with Mahoutsukai no Yome's OP lineup, it was yet again another 100% perfect replication where May'n's songs are lost-substance average-sounding and JUNNA's the better of the two. 
 
I'm glad that many of you heeded my advice, and right now I'm telling you: This is another bestest shovelware from the worst season of the year, and I'm officially done with this shitshow. Thank the Heavens this abomination is over...

          
 
       Helpful For a quick review of this anime: Don't watch it.  
 
The story may seem even a tad bit interesting at first but it hardly takes any time to realize that it is horrible. The characters are very dull with many character cliches, deus ex machina moments, and overall bad writing. The animation/art definitely isn't the worst out there, but it definitely isn't very good. They outline the backstory of each character poorly and don't give us any backstory at all for other characters. The only reason I watched this really is because I was around 4 episodes in and wanted to finish it for completionist sake, otherwise  would have dropped it. 

          
 
       Helpful Story: 4/10  
The story started out very promising. You start off with an action packed fight scene, showing a previous ""play,"" where you then go to the current play. You start to look out for the important characters, but from there it really just goes down hill. The story felt like it was all over the place, where you would end one episode and suddenly you were at a totally different scene. 
 
*Spoiler*  
One of the episodes ended with a fight scene at the school, and then the next episode it started up with the team, with members you ""technically"" didn't know were part of the church, destroying these historical sites.  
*End Spoiler*  
 
Scenes like this really created a disjointed scene making it overly confusing as to what had happened in between scene jumps. The story itself also seemed lacking in substance. It kept talking about how the past was the end all be all. Your fate can't be changed, but we never understood what the previous fate really was. We saw one whole scene, and all other previous fates weren't even mentioned until the last 2 episodes.  
 
The only interesting thing about this anime was the morally ambiguous sides. This anime, unlike others, didn't present a good or bad side. They presented teams that had their own reasoning behind their actions. This allowed you to choose a side where as most anime predetermine your ""favorite"" team.  
 
Art: 5/10  
There is nothing really spectacular or notable about the artwork. Very average, but not terrible.  
 
Sound: 5/10  
Similarly to art, there was nothing truly awesome or notable about the sound. I did find that in the dub, the characters voices didn't really suit some of their characters. I felt like there could have been better choices.  
 
Character: 4/10  
There is very little character development. Chihiro got the most development and even that, for almost 10 episodes straight, they hinted at the same thing over and over. If they hadn't kicked the poor dead horse so many times, it would have been an earned reveal. It even lead Kakihara, to being a babbling nuisance. He kept harping on Chihiro, blaming him for everything and it was to the point that this interesting character, became annoying and you kind of wanted him to die. As for the others, they got little or no growth. We don't get to explore their powers, we only explored Chihiro. Most of the characters just appeared with no explanation as to who they were or what they could do. We just knew that they were 10xs weaker than Chihiro and would probably just be killed out.  
 
Enjoyment: 4/10  
I did enjoy exploring this anime. I kept looking forward to new episodes to see if there was anything really redeeming about it, but there wasn't. I honestly thought this anime would turn out to just reset time and un-screw everything up. I did truly enjoy figuring out who to side for since both sides had their faults, but other than that, nothing really stood out.  
 
Overall: 5/10  
It was just a poor anime. The story could have had so much potential, but assuming do to little budget, there anime's run was short. It felt like to fit the entire plot in 12 measly episodes, they had to rush the plot along. Leaving a lot of things disjointed and not enough to time to explain anything or even provide character development. There was just so much to digest in this anime, that this series is not suited for a 12 episode season.  
 
Recommendation: I still recommend watching this anime, see what you think. It was still a fun few hours of my life, but I definitely would not go back and re-watch this.

Can Coil discover the truths behind the mysterious viruses and corruption, and if they can, at what cost? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","The year is 2026, and it has been 11 years since the ""Den-noh Megane"" (cyber glasses), a wearable computer in the form of glasses that uses AR technology, became widespread throughout the world. The glasses allow information from the Den-noh world to be superimposed on and manipulated in the real world.
There are pets and tools that use Den-noh technology, and the telephone and Internet are used through Den-noh Megane. Children could no longer remember the time when they could see the world without looking through glasses.
Just before her last summer vacation in elementary school, Yuko Okonogi, a.k.a. Yasako, moves from Kanazawa City, the capital of the prefecture, to Daikoku City, a provincial city with an ancient capital lined with historic shrines and temples, but also equipped with the latest electronic infrastructure.
There she meets another Yuko, Yuko Amasawa, a.k.a. Isako, who has the same name and is the same age but is in contrast to her. 
At her new school, Yasako meets a group of children with rich personalities and experiences a series of strange events that occur in the Den-noh space.
Yasako's new classmates, Fumie, Daichi, and Haraken, belong to the Children's Detective Bureau run by her grandmother, and as she investigates urban legends about dangerous beings in Den-noh space with them, she learns that one of their friends may have died because of her pursuit of that being.

They can also make phone calls by using gestures, or use their glasses as a PC by projecting holographic images of monitors and keyboards into the air to control them. They can also listen to sound through futuristic ear monitors embedded in the vines of their glasses.
Den-noh space
It is often referred to simply as ""space,"" in which the Den-noh materials exists, and the world in the work is a ubiquitous society using it. It is also used for fully automatic control of transportation, and is greatly involved in the daily lives of people who do not use glasses. It is provided by Megamass, and in Daikoku City, it is managed by Daikoku City Hall as an administrative service under the jurisdiction of the Postal Bureau. For this reason, Megamass employees are seconded to the city hall.

It can only live in old space or inside the body of a Den-noh creature. Isako hunts special forms of illegals in the hope of collecting valuable Meta-Bugs.
Nulls
A mysterious humanoid Den-noh creature that is said to be the oldest Illegal. They exist in countless numbers on ""the other side"" and come to the real world through the ""passage"".

Meta-Bugs
A mysterious Den-noh Materials that looks like a gemstone. It tends to occur in spatial distortions, and is thought to be the result of spatial bugs that have solidified.Since it can only be mined in Daikoku City, it is unofficially considered a specialty of the city. Most of them are useless bugs, but very rarely they have useful features that contain information such as sounds and images, and from their unique properties they can be refined into items or Meta-Tags by skilled craftsmen. Because of this, they sometimes fetch high prices and are used as virtual currency for trading Den-noh items only among children. The unit of currency in illegal stores on the Internet is ""meta,"" and 1 meta = 1 yen. However, as Searchmatons delete damaged or corrupted spaces from one side to the other, the scarcity value is gradually increasing.

Code Reactor (暗号炉, Angō-ro)
A structure that is directly connected to imago and can read Code Formula directly from thoughts. By embedding it in a Den-noh body, the Code Formula's features can be used freely and continuously, but it also has dangerous side effects such as damaging the human body and nerves.
""Old Space"" (「古い空間」, ""Furui Kūkan"")
An unstable old version of the Den-noh space, first created and still left in the city. However, it is gradually expanding for some reason in Daikoku City. This is where Den-noh fog, the Illegals, and Meta-Bugs come from.
""The Other Side"" (「あっち」, ""Acchi"")
It is a place rumored in children's urban legends that Kira-Bug and Michiko come from. According to the legend, some children have gone to ""the other side"" in their dreams by sleeping with their Den-noh glasses on. The true identity is a medical Den-noh space created by Coils, the developer of the Den-noh glasses, using Imago, and abandoned by Megamass, which took over the business after Coils' bankruptcy, in order to cover up something. Unlike the Den-noh space, it is an isolated virtual space that is not linked to the real world, so in order to enter it, one must separate their consciousness from their body and become a Den-noh body. This is when the Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs.

","An abnormally mature anime for its cast. 
 
I will start my review with what is in my opinion the main theme in this series. You have to pursue reality at all cost even if it is sometime quite harsh. The majority of the cast fall into the illusion of that virtual reality depicted in this series. I will go into more details later on. 
 
The story is all about growing up from your childhood and being confronted with reality for the majority of the cast. It tells the story of a young girl and her young sister that arrive in a new city where augmented reality is completely established. In fact, augmented reality is all around town and is making a complete network trough everything. The glasses that connect your brain to the network make possible for you to see the different things that exist only in the virtual side of the city. Things like virtual animal, hacking, false walls or even invisible walls are completely common. 
 
The first part of the anime will only present the different aspect of the city and will give the initial basic background of the different character and their interactions. It will slowly build upon these interactions to something much more interesting and deep than what you may think with the four or five first episodes. 
 
The second part will be about the different difficult pasts of the entire cast and their pursuit of different illusions they have. This part of the show even goes through some terrifying moments for a general quite dramatic atmosphere. Telling more than that would be spoiler. 
 
The art and visual effect inside this anime are remarkable, the virtual side of the city really comes to life and you can easily understand why the children start to believe that these virtual things are as real as the normal world. There's a brilliant use of distortions when some of the virtual things are bugs created by a low maintenance rate. These distortions are also absent when the object has been updated properly. That means you can easily identify a threat to the safety of the children when you see the distorted objects because these objects are borderline always quite dangerous. That is also why some parts of this series are spooky. 
 
The different actors are quite good and credible for making you believe that there are indeed children in the show while there's actually none. The sound effects are always effective and the soundtrack is always in line with what goes on screen. Even the lyrics in the opening section of the show are actually so valid that they are a small spoiler by themselves. 
 
The character all have quite a steep learning curve about accepting their past and present. In the lapse of half a year, they started as people that only wants to escape reality to people that have come full circle with themselves and their past. Traumatic accident and different secrets regarding the new technology present in the city truly make them the only people that can and actually want to find the truth about what has happened in the last years.  
 
All characters go through much development in the course of the show, but five characters go through a lot more than the others. Daichi and his rival seem like a total imbecile, but will be way more than it seems for about half the show. Yasako will, of course, being the main character, have a lot of development, actually way more than one may think. Isako seems selfish, but is actually quite caring. Haraken seem to be quite the normal boy, but knows certain things that will make a lot happening by the end of the show. These three all pursue illusion in the form of memories of a dead someone that have been imprinted inside the network. 
They will of course have to accept these death has been reality instead of relying on that false memory imprint. 
 
My personal enjoyments toward this show comes from the fact that I never think how far the subject of augmented reality could go before watching this series. I learned a lot about how this could be real later on. I also like the mature themes present in that story and I actually liked the fact that the series pretty much put a big middle finger to all those that were thinking that this show will be gentle and relax all the way through. 
 
In conclusion, I recommend this flick for fans of sci-fi and fantasy and also to fans of serious story that have a lot to tell.  


          
 
       Helpful Remember when you were a child? You and your friends were playing, talking about different urban legends and stories. Imagine this situation but add to it another layer of reality. That is Dennou Coil. That and much much more.  
 
Dennou Coil starts in a pretty unforgivable manner. You are thrown into a world of near future where people can access virtual reality via special glasses. This VR is connected to everyday life and exists as another layer of reality. There are virtual pets, lasers, big funny looking antiviruses called Satchii and much more. And there is something else. Something perhaps more sinister hiding inside this space.  
 
The story slowly builds up. Stakes become higher, and as the mysteries begin to get solved you are left with your jaw on the floor.  I have no idea how creators of this anime accomplished task of having incredibly smart and somewhat complex script, which encompasses themes of loss, grief, obsession, humanity, reality, love and hate while still being a kids show.  
 
The characters are relatable, funny and quirky. Each of them has their flaws and each of them has their goals. No character exists only to move plot forward or be a cliché role player. 
 
Production is great. Even though the series slightly suffers from bland colour pallet it is intentional and meaningful. The animation itself is very soft. The way some characters act and move reminded me of works of Hayao Miyazaki. My only problem with the production are the character designs (especially their noses, they kinda look like monkeys)   but that’s purely subjective and won’t really affect the overall score.  
The music is noticeable in a good way. Playful tones during comedy scenes mix well with violins during serious scenes, creating good contrast. Some anime tend to overblow the playfulness or seriousness but Dennou Coil creates a good mix.  
Voice acting is good. One of the characters sounds older than she should but I understand why it is the case so I can overlook it.  
 
As for enjoyment I had a blast. The main storyline is excellently structured. Few of the episodes from the middle of series could be considered as “filler” since they don’t really add much to the main plot line but these episodes in on itself are very well written and serve as simple exploration of deep themes . Once again I must praise the way writers handled such things in understandable and meaningful manner. There is one half recap episode but I think I can forgive the show for that one.  
 
Overall this is an excellent anime that works for kids and adults alike. The story is simple enough that a child could understand it but complex enough that an adult would be interested. It teaches valuable lessons, is funny, smart, scary at times, and overall enjoyable. According to rumors, it also has best dog in anime.  


          
 
       Helpful The series was very slow and child-like in the very beginning...but about halfway through it was CRAZY AWESOME! The plot thickened with every episode and the cliffhangers were outrageous. The animation is beautiful, and it captures science fiction in a very realistic perspective, as opposed to the usual sci-fi that just has stylized robots and space ships. The character development is interesting, but really the show is all about how creepy the technology is. I can honestly say I am thoroughly impressed with Denno Coil. NOT what I expected at all.

Encounters with people staying at Haruno's parents' boardinghouse encourage her to step forward to her dream.",['Slice of Life'],"The story follows a young girl named Haruno Shiozaki and her friends who enjoy motorcycles and one day meet a curious motorcyclist named Cynthia.
","I realize that this anime is sponsored by Honda Motors. However, I could have really done without the bashing of bicycles and their riders as being childish and immature; yet that's how this Anime opened. It was really hard for me to get through the rest of the story after the opening scene as it left me in such a dreadful state. 
 
Much later, I made myself watch through the rest of the anime. I discovered that it was merely an advert for Honda's motorcycles and scooters.  
 
To compare this anime to ""art"" you'll see that this only comes off as an ad.  
As an advertisement, this anime is merely watchable yet not quite entertaining or engaging. 
 
The characters are as shallow as their dilemmas. The ""moral of the story"" is as weak as it is obvious. 
 
I can't blame Honda for this; the entire motor industry is having a hard time right now. Car ownership rates decreasing. Today's kids are not as interested in getting their driver's licence as the kids of 10 or 20 years ago were. Sales of automobiles are on the decrease in Europe, North America and in Japan. Today's young people would like to live close to their work, would rather play on their smart phones while someone else drives (ie take public transit) than to be trapped driving in an hour, or longer, commute while strapped down in chair and listening to inane traffic reports on the radio. So this ad (anime) tries to sell the ""excitement of adventure"" for Honda's motorized two products, while bashing pedal bicycles in an attempt to make their own product look more appealing than a bicycle as the vehicle of choice for doing the exact same thing. 
 
And you can feel the desperation of the industry in having to make this tripe. And you'd have to be equally desperate to watch it. 
 
If you have too much time to kill, if you hate bicycles, or if you really love motorcycles and scooters; if you want to see what a desperate industry does to try to save itself from forces beyond its control, or if you're plainly in need of something to watch and this happens to be within reach then you may enjoy this. However, if you don't need more propaganda in your life then you are better off avoiding this. 


          
 
       Helpful ""One Off"" is a very simple story. It's all about overcoming the obstacle of negative thinking, things that you may think are impossible can actually be more easily attainable when you are working towards that goal and thinking positively. If anything, you will feel better. 
Nothing good comes from negative thinking except for just that, more negative thinking. 
 
This is your basic slice of life story with mopeds, motorcycles, the eagerness to travel, and Honda (yes, the vehicle company) as the main subjects. With one of the best directors when it comes to slice of life works, Junichi Sato.  
 
It's not original, but does anyone really expect that when it comes to slice of life stories? I like it, it's executed well, has a great atmosphere, and is fun to watch if you like slice of life stories. 
 
The art is excellent, very much up to standards here. 
 
The music is very well done, the opening by RoundTable is always a nice touch in an anime, and the ending and insert songs are pretty catchy as well. 
The seiyuu act their characters with great enthusiasm. 
 
There's not much character here, but the little that there is, serves well enough for the story and execution. 
For a slice of life series, there's actually a small bit of ecchi in this show, and that is the role of Cynthia (You'll see when you watch it). 
 
--- 
 
I enjoyed this short series more than I expected. 
 
One Off serves as a feel good slice of life story that is as short as a motorcycle or moped ride to a convenience store. 
It's very well done, and if there was more, I would watch it.

          
 
       Helpful One Off was subbed yesterday and I already watched it 3 times. You may think that this anime must be pure awesome because I watched it 3 times in a day, but not exactly that. I just enjoyed it a lot.  
 
 
That said, One Off is still pretty amazing anime for such a short series. The story is about these 5 girls, which names I don't know doing slice of life stuff, and they like motorbikes. The blue-haired girl is funny as hell. She has cutelittlefangs and she is master of the trope, google it if you don't know. Surpasses Tsuru-chan from Suzumiya Haruhi series, meaning blue-haired is hyperactive and propably has adhd, but I like her because she is funny and cute, and has blue hairs. 
 
Girl with big tits is pretty much like blue-haired girl. She is damn funny, but has big tits instead of adhd. She would be pretty memorable character even if she had only small tits. I mean she is like Kaeda from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Kaeda always says part of her dialog in English which is also well-placed and makes it pretty hilarious. Big titted girl does the same as Kaeda and they have same voice actor so no wonder, and she can pronounce English well, so no awkward engrish here. Kaeda also has nice tits, btw, if you were wondering.  
 
Rest of the characters aren't really all that memorable nor notable, I would still hug them all though. Someone but effort on their design as well. I mean e.g. one of them wears glasses so it's easy tell them apart and all. Pretty sure most of them are at least bi-curious so shoujo ai fans should enjoy them as well. They are also friends till the end of world and even further so it's pretty interesting to follow them doing their stuff and to see what kinda persons they are.  
 
One Off also surpasses Code Geass in terms of advertising. Pretty sure everyone knows about Pizza Hut and C.C's pizza obsession and stuff like that. As I mentioned before, these girls like motorbikes. We have CBR and Monkey here and maybe some others I didn't notice. So you guessed it propably, this is worshipping Honda like no other anime. We even have guy who wears a cap with Honda text on it and things like that. Brilliant, really.  
 
There is also story in this anime but I don't really know what it is about. One of these character want to go see the world or something and she is shy and likes big titted girl's CBR, and they ride together near the end. One other of the character have some special spot where she likes to be alone, but big titted girl comes there with her CBR and finds her special spot. The character get little development just like that I guess. 
 
 
One Off is nowhere near the best anime ever made, but it doesn't try be like that either. It's pure slice of life comedy which you may or may not enjoy. I watched this somewhere around 3-4am and laughed around half of the 30 minutes long double-episode. For me this was really fun and entertaining watch and made me happy. I found pretty much everything in this to be hilarious. I don't know will you find this enjoyable but I advice to give it a try.

Hello there you beautiful f@cks,my name is Dion and i will be your guide through this painful journey.......That is unless you're offended by every single thing so..Sorry! 
 
Now if my rating didn't give you a hint then here's one and don't say i didn't warn you...It's utter rubbish this anime.That's it..Oh you want more? 
 
Ok then..I hated Binchou-tan,simple as that..And when i hate an anime i will show it just like i will equally show it when i love an anime. 
 
And maybe i'm wrong-though i highly doubt it-and this anime is the best Japan has to offer in terms of entertainment.And it is if i'm honest,if you are a 4yr old or an adult who likes to fondle children...""But Dion i'm an adult and i find children disgusting and still i liked this one cause *insert generic moe-loving quote here*"" 
 
And that there is the exact problem with this anime.I dare you to read any review about this anime,the only thing people say about it is that it's cute and heartwarming and moe and kawai and it has chibi sexed up kids.Which only helps solidifying my case even more. 
 
Don't believe me?Then why don't you do this?Go watch the 1st episode and come back and tell me i'm wrong.That this anime is full of meaning and has hidden messages and shit.It barely has any dialogues in it and most of it comes from the narrator..Apart from that there's no story whatsoever it's just a chibi little kid going about her bussiness at the mountains,collecting food and that's about it..Now granted there are some characters being introduced later on but even with these additions the anime barely shows signs of life,by which i mean that if i were a pedophile i'd very much love the fact that they fall on their faces and show some skin.. 
 
So the story is vacant and dull and animationwise it has nothing to show apart from chibi cute characters and overall subpar animation that can destroy your eyes like you poured bleach in them.So what about the characters AS characters.. 
 
Well i did not like them at all either.They were as one dimensional as they could be with only one gimmick that would be used until the very bitter end.And speaking of bitter ends the only development that occured was on the last episode and i couldn't give a rat's ass about it. 
 
So yeah,if you're into cute episodic anime with no substance whatsoever then this is the anime for you..If you're like me though and you like your anime with some HP sauce and some ACTUAL content then why not try something else and not bother with this one at all eh? 


          
 
       Helpful Binchou-tan is the story of a little girl who lives in the mountains alone and travels down to the nearby town for work. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this anime when I first came across it, but now that I've finished the last episodes I'm surprised to say that I may have found and anime worthy of knocking a title from my top ten list.  
 
But who gets the boot!? I'll have to think about that later, for now, on with the review! ? 
 
Story 10/10 
 
The stories follow a simple slice of life narrative with the main character working through life on her own, obtaining money for food by getting jobs from a job board in town, when she's not doing that she's playing with her friends.  
 
Watching the interactions between her and the other girls was very enjoyable and learning about the others was interesting.  
 
Though the story does take a bit of a sad turn once we start learning about Binchou's past. If I had any complaints it would be that I wish we'd learned about her past bit more before the anime ended. (??︵??) 
 
Art 10/10 
 
Wonderfully detailed backgrounds contrasting with their simplistic characters designs.  
 
The scenery in this anime is the big ticket for why I gave it a ten out of ten. For as cute as the girls can be, if the backgrounds matched them I'm afraid the score would be much lower. That being said though, the characters still fit in with their environments.  
 
The animators clearly knew how good their scenery was with all the establishing shots in the first couple of episodes. With backgrounds this good you have to show it off! They were breathtaking.  
 
It was like looking at a living painting. (??ヮ?)?*:??? 
 
Sound 10/10 
 
The background music did wonders for establishing tone. I don't tend to actually notice background music that often but caught my ear quite well.  
 
As for the opening and ending song... They weren't the best, but they were still nice.  
 
Enjoyment 9000/10 
 
I watched one episode after the other. I couldn't stop. Now I'm sad it's over.  
That's how it is with most good anime, beautiful like a snowflake yet gone so soon!  
 
OUR PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW! (゜▼゜＊）

Thank you for reading my review. 

          
 
       Helpful For those of you looking to relieve those slice-of-life blues afterAria finished, then look no further than Binchou-tan. 
 
The series began life as began as a manga by Ekusa Takahito before being adapted for anime in 2006. The story is set in the town of Minabe in the Wakayama Prefecture (located in the Kansai region), and the series pays homage to the area in a number of aspects, the most prominent being the names of the characters. The titular character, and indeed many of the other characters, are named for different types of charcoal, with Binchou-tan being named after binchotan, a form of white charcoal that the Wakayma region is famous for producing. 
 
This connection has added to the popularity of the series throughout Japan, so much so that Binchou-tan is now the official mascot of the Kishu-Binchotan Promotion Museum, which is run by Minabegawa Forestry Society. 
 
The story is very simple. A little girl named Binchou-tan lives alone in a run-down cottage in the forest outside of town. Life is hard but she takes each day as it comes, works hard at various odd jobs, and tries not to let her spirits flag. 
 
Unusually, each episode in the series is split into two individual stories, so over the course of half an hour the viewer is shown two chapters in Binchou-tan's life. Surprisingly, this works rather well, especially as this is purely a slice of life show. Over the course of the series the viewer is given a taste of Binchou-tan's life, and whilst the general tone is very much an upbeat one, the show isn't afraid to give the old heartstrings a good hard yank (you have been warned). 
 
The artwork throughout the series is actually very good. The backgrounds and settings are extremely well done, from the rustic setting in the town, to the lush greenery of the forest. A lot of attention has gone into scenery, and because of this the area in which the show is set has a vibrancy that is rare in anime. 
 
Characters are also well done, relatively speaking of course. There is a penchant for labelling the characters in the show as &quot;lolis&quot;, however this is a gross misconception, especially given the sexual connotation attached to that word. Binchou-tan and her friends are designed very much like chibis, however there is a distinctive innocence about each of the characters which is readily apparent just from their look. Binchou-tan herself could be a postergirl for &quot;kawaii&quot;. 
 
One thing that may confuse some viewers is the log on Binchoutan's head. This is actually a piece of charcoal, although it's never really clear if this is the type of charcoal for which she is named. She is not unique in this repect either, as some of the  other characters also make reference to the charcoal industry in both name and hair adornment. 
 
The sound quality throughout the series is very good. The various effects and background noises are well used, with no effects overwhelming the audience at any time. The voice actors are also good, and manage to give each character a certain innocent quality which is reflective of their design and personality. 
 
The one element that really stands out about the show, aside from the scenery that is, is the music. I can't actually recall a single moment that was bereft of music of some sort. The various orchestral scores are very much in keeping with the tone of the series, serving to enhance the atmosphere in any given scene. In addition to this, the OP is a very melodic track which I found to be quite fitting for the show as a whole, whilst the ED is a very upbeat track about Binchou-tan herself. 
 
The characters are extremely, almost tooth-achingly, cute. This isn't just in terms of their design, but also their personalities. Each of the characters has a unique personality, and whilst there are some nods in the direction of stereotype, these are often offset in some  way (Ren-tan, for example, fits the &quot;silent girl&quot; mould, however she is also very playful, and not above a little teasing). 
 
The one thing that belies the generally cheery tone of the series is the fact that Binchou-tan herself is rather a tragic figure. She is upbeat, hard working, and more than a little shy. She is also extremely lonely, something which the show highlights in several ways. However, she has a certain air that attracts the other girls to her, and as the show progresses we see some very subtle changes in her personality. 
 
Unfortunately, the other characters don't develop as much as Binchou-tan does, however this can be forgiven because of the length of the series and the fact that each episode is enjoyable in some way. 
 
Now many people will automatically write off this series simply because of the fact that Binchou-tan is so damn cute. This, together with the colourful backgrounds, often makes people believe that this is purely a kids series. However, such thinking means you'll miss out on what is actually a very enjoyable show.  
 
The main appeal of the series is that it is almost purely slice of life. The setting and episodic format may not initially be appealing to many, however it truly is worth giving it a chance. The characters, the scenery, the various days in Binchou-tan's life, are all wonderfully realised, and whilst I may be a terminal Aria fan, I will freely admit that this series is very, very close to it in many respects. 
 
In all honesty, I would recommend this series to anyone who simply wants to watch something nice for a change. There's no romance, no real drama, no big fights, and no gondolas (there are ducks and birds however), but don't be fooled into thinking that there isn't anything for you to watch. This is an extremely enjoyable series, and the length of each episode means that, whilst you can easily finish the whole show in one sitting, you'll probably find yourself spreading the series out over the course of a few days (just to make it last longer). 
 
I now have two shows which I can truly call relaxing.

9,21771,67,6.330984936,A group of people living together,Romantica Clock,"Three episodes aired on TV as part of the Ribon x Oha Suta specials.  
 
Akane: She's beautiful and popular, lively and full of vitality; Aoi: Looks like a small animal but is actually very clever. Who knew that these two very different people were actually... twin siblings?!  
 
(Source: MU)  
 
Note: Episodes were made available on the official stream few days before the official broadcast.",['Shoujo'],none,"So, Romantica Clock is another one of those new 'anime shorts' that have been coming out lately. Even then, there's a fine line between what Romantica Clock is and the other anime shorts. Romantica Clock lasts for an astounding 4 minutes and 30 seconds, all episodes combined. At the end of each episode, it shows volumes of the manga this anime short was adapted from. Any way you look at it, it's an advertisement. With that in mind, does it even make sense to judge it by normal anime standards? I don't know any other way to judge it using MAL's arbitrary score system, so I'll completely avoid mentioning it in this review. 
 
There is no real narrative here. It's very much a character-driven story, but to sum it up: It's about the relationship between Akane and her twin brother, who she perceives as better than her in every way. She aims to become better than her brother and aim even higher in life than him, initially out of jealousy, but she's now using it as an excuse to interact more with her brother and establish a stable relationship that they once had. I'm really digging deep here, and that's about as far as the narrative goes. As you can see, it's not anything ground-breaking and the premise is rather cliche. Throw this in with the rest of the Shoujo anime.  
 
This premise might be interesting if both Akane and her brother were interesting characters, but they're really quite bland. Especially her brother, who is merely a stereotype that we've seen from every anime ever. The guy who speaks with an emotionless tone but actually experiences a plethora of emotions, though he has trouble getting this across. Akane is the generic, cheery girl who is an airhead most of the time. What about those characters sounds interesting? By themselves, there's nothing. Presumably, the interactions between the two are the highlight of the characters, then? No, not really. The characters are just dull, bland and utterly generic. 
 
The art and sound are serviceable; nothing to write home about, but nothing that might provoke profuse bleeding of the eyes or ears. Simply mediocre. 
 
I got no enjoyment out of this whatsoever, but if the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a watch. If you have 5 minutes to throw away, why not throw it away for Romantica Clock? Of course, you'll end up having to read the manga if it actually intrigues you and if you're not the type of person who likes manga, just give it a miss. Romantica Clock fails to even hit mediocrity, after all.

          
 
       Helpful Before everybody gets their otaku panties in a twist about this ""show,"" and how incredibly short and uneventful it may be, go read the manga. This mini-series has basically compiled itself to be a very short add to the manga while still giving the audience teasers to what the series is about, but clearly the manga elaborates on these details and gives the reader much more background to the characters and plot to the story. So don't see this as an anime ""series,"" see it as a teaser trailer to the manga series. If you're interested in what you see but wish there was more to it, go read the manga. If you find this ""mini-series"" annoying but are wondering ""What the hell man?!"", go read the manga. If you just like cute stories, go read the manga. The manga is enjoyable, and well put together. In the first chapter you get a lot of background story to the characters and a better understanding of what the story is going to be trying to accomplish. It's a good read. So don't knock the teaser trailer until you've read a few chapters of the manga.

I am rating this as what it was meant to be and that is a trailer I'm assuming from other reviews. It did have the advertisement vibe to it yet it wasn't satisfying. There should be only 1 episode if its going to be a trailer, not 3 episodes that viewers have to chase around to see what this is going to be about. You'll probably understand more about the manga just by reading the summary.

9,39523,68,6.330493667,A group of people living together,Choujin Koukousei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyuu de Ikinuku you desu!,"Seven Japanese high school students enjoy international renown for their remarkable talents.

","Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching High school Prodigies have it easy even in another world and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.  
 
Based off a popular light novel of the same name Choujin Koukousei tachi wa Isekai demo yoyuu de Ikinuku you desu which is more popularly known by its English title of High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world is a fantasy-themed anime that gives us the rather unique opportunity to see what will happen, if one day a plane that carried seven of the world’s top geniuses who are all masters of their respective fields despite their young age were to one day vanish from their world and be transported to a parallel world that was suffering from the same problems and crisis that they had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. Seeing the same problems that the seven had worked so hard to deal with back in their world once more manifest itself in this new world and once more cause suffering and pain to the people of this world the seven resolved to do what must be done to save the people from this world and in doing so transcend from being mere geniuses to saviours of a world as they make use of their collected intellect and use wisdom and technology to bring down an oppressive regime and in doing so deliver to the people a world where everyone is free and can perform whatever role that they so desire. A country where it’s the people that decide on where the country should be heading and not the arrogant lords and emperors that sit on the throne.  
 
Fantasy-themed series within the anime industry can be said to be one of the most popular ones within it due to the ease of which worlds can be fashioned and expanded upon by its creators and this is even more so within the vaunted Isekai genre that had experienced a massive surge in popularity in recent years. While the concept of Isekai itself is pretty standard as settings go what served to differentiate High school prodigies in my eyes and what served to draw my eye to it was the fact that unlike the standard series that made use of only one mc that was transported to the parallel world in the case of High school prodigies there are seven of them all of which had unique skills, quirks and personalities that made them all unique. In addition unlike most common Isekai series that tend to have overall goals that centre on individual matters that focus on the individual struggles of its characters High schools is the exception in that its cast, for the most part, operate as a single entity that operates in concert with one another to go about the task of inducing change on a global scale through not just displays of physical strength but also through introduction of new tech advancements that give the people, not just a better but also a fairer and more organized society to live in but also the weapons that they need to preserve their new way of life. This combination of not just entering a parallel world but also serving to repay those that have helped them by using their unique talents to change the world and overturn the cruel and oppressive regime that rules them and replace it with one that treats its people fairly and freely was what served to draw me to the series and convince me to watch it to the very end a decision that I felt was justly rewarded here.  
 
The overall story for the series follows the life of Tsukasa Mikogami and his six friends who despite their young age and only being in high school have as a result of both their intelligence and their own unique skills in their respective fields have enabled them to not only ascend the rungs of society within their own worlds but also create many great changes within their home timeline that’s served to improve the lives of many within their world. After being mysteriously transported to parallel world that for all intents and purposes was one that appeared to be one that was within the time period known as the medieval period Tsukasa and his friends find that not only had they been transported to another world entirely but that this world while certainly beautiful and full of interesting races that are both welcoming and generous in temperament was one that was ruled by a cruel and oppressive empire who instead of treating its people with respect, kindness and equality instead treated them with cruelty and silencing any detractors with the threat of capital punishment. While finding themselves in an entirely new world was a novel experience for Tsukasa and his friends the fact that this new world was one that was ruled by the same type of regime and whose people were oppressed by the same type of people that Tsukasa and his friends had worked so hard to displace in their efforts to change their world was something that created a sense of fury within their hearts. When the empire in both its arrogance as well as in its desire to avenge its humiliation at the hands of Tsukasa and his friends who had not only defied the empire’s standing orders to help demi-humans but also go about modernising them struck out and captured one of their own to both the villagers and Tsukasa and his friends this was the last straw and served to create a catalyst that began Tsukasa and his friends journey to go about changing the world and sweep aside the trash that had ruled for far too long within this world and finally bring salvation to the people of this new world.  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Aico Incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy that despite being only of a young age is already actively serving his country as its youngest PM to date Tsukasa from initial appearances is shown to be a calm, composed and responsible person by nature and is someone that can be seen to prefer to solve problems via diplomacy rather than with action and as a result was someone that was seen to be held in high regard by both his countrymen and politicians around the world earning him the title The world’s Top Politician. However despite boasting such a formidable reputation, Tsukasa was seen to be someone that rather than being overconfident and vain in his attitude was rather the opposite in that he was a quiet person by nature that made great use of not just his intellect but also his logical nature to divine the best path forward towards his goals while taking great care to ensure that such goals were ones that were realistic a skill that few within Tsukasa’s chosen field can hope to achieve. While a quiet person and someone that can be difficult to read by others Tsukasa was someone that was seen to have two traits that served to define him as both a person and as the PM of Japan in that unlike many of his field Tsukasa was someone that had both an immense sense of responsibility to both his friends and to his allies as well as surprisingly strong sense of justice as well traits that I felt while reflecting well of his role as a leader as a country also serve to reflect the kind of person that Tsukasa really was which was someone that will do his utmost to preserve peace and protect his friends and allies while still trying his utmost to maintain his core values of justice and responsibility a struggle that I really admired about him.  
 
As the series goes on and Tsukasa’s personality is gradually expanded upon his personality gradually starts to change as a result of the events that he and his friends helped shape. In the beginning of the series Tsukasa while noted to be someone that advocated peace, understanding and cooperation through the showing of kindness towards others was someone that can be said to be rather too logical in that he often didn’t take into account the emotional bonds that can result from their actions and the potential effects that this can have on both he and his friends and the allies that he had resolved to help a matter that is brought to the head during the height of the series first arc when a dear friend of theirs was kidnapped by the empire. While certainly an uncomfortable revelation for Tsukasa it can be seen that this revelation that while logic and being realistic about situations was an excellent skill to have it will be even so if this is paired with an understanding towards the desires and wishes of the people that you wish to protect was something that served to have a profound impact on Tsukasa as a person. While still retaining his quiet nature Tsukasa after this revelation was shown to have become more understanding of the feelings and wishes of others and more willing to consult with others on their own opinions rather than going for the most logical option that he would have done so in the past.  
 
In line with Tsukasa’s incorporation of emotions and taking the feelings of others into his equations was the reveal of what can be said to be the main driving force behind Tsukasa’s true struggle within the series which is the reform of the world. As a result of both Tsukasa’s core nature as well as his beliefs in what the people of any given land should have it can be seen that Tsukasa was someone that viewed the needs and desires of a lands people to be of paramount importance and was someone that believed that any land should be one where a ruler rules with both fairness and dignity and treats his subjects with both the respect that they deserve and more importantly be given the freedom and choice to live their lives the way that they want. As a result of this Tsukasa, more than any of the seven was shown to be dismayed by the fact that rather than doing this the empire instead rules through fear and oppression terms that were anathema to Tsukasa on a fundamental level and doing well in creating the groundwork for his goal on changing this warped world. While largely borne out of his desire to pay back his allies and friends for all the help that they had provided to him it can be said that unlike the empire Tsukasa while certainly the driving force behind it was not trying to create a world that will have him as the ruler but rather in line with his beliefs was instead trying to create one where the happiness of the people through equality was the priority and one where rather than having centralised control was one where the self-determination of the people was most important which is best shown in Tsukasa’s preference to let his subordinates handle things despite having the ability to do so himself. As a character, I felt that Tsukasa was a well designed and developed character that can be said to represent the ideal image of what a politician should be like being both a fair and honest person that treated his friends and allies with respect and at the same time being both intelligent, far-sighted and cunning in equal measure adept at creating grand and multi-layered plans as well as anticipating and thwarting the enemies own plans before they can even commence. While shown to be and acknowledged by his friends to be the leader within the team it can be said that he’s also the foundation that serves to support the team and keep them honest and in line with their shared goal of helping the people of this land.   
 
Ringo Oohoshi   
 
Ringo Oohoshi portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sao and Accel world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses and one of the seven heroes that have come to this world. A teenage girl that despite her young age is widely known as one of the world’s foremost inventors on account of both Ringo’s ability to not just visualise what is needed for a given situation based on local environments and resource requirements but also her ability to create tech that’s as deadly to the enemy as it can be useful to her allies. From initial appearances, Ringo is shown to be a quiet, calm and intelligent girl who while finding it difficult to talk easily with others is shown to a friendly, kind and caring person who tries her utmost to help her friends. While certainly gifted with great intelligence Ringo is someone that is shown to have little if any arrogance unlike many of her fellows and indeed is someone that works hard and tries to be useful to both her friends and allies something that is aided greatly by her ability to plan ahead. As a character Ringo through easy to overlook is someone that can be said to be just as important as any of her fellow geniuses for it is her intelligence that enabled not just Tsukasa and his fellow geniuses but also the members of the territories that they liberate to not just enjoy a higher quality of life but also have the means to not only defend themselves from aggressors but also fight them on close to even terms. Whether it’s the metal tools that enabled the villagers to farm more effectively, the power stations that served to give them their first taste of what comfort actually is, the rail gun and shields that enabled the villagers to storm the local lords castle to save their friend or the defence's that warded off Gustav’s assault it is to Ringo’s intelligence and her strong desire to help that the seven was so successful in their move to liberate and change the world.  
 
While each of the seven can be said to have been affected by the charisma that Tsukasa exhibits in his personality it can be said that of them Ringo is perhaps the one that was most affected by this as to Ringo Tsukasa while a very dear friend and ally is also someone that Ringo views as her savior due to the impact that his help provided her when her family situation got complicated when she was in high school. This while keeping her from developing standard levels of depression as can be expected from such dramas also served to allow Ringo to realise that there are many others throughout the world that require the unique skills that she has managed to gain in order to improve their lives a motivation that went on to become her sole source of motivation of wanting to help others no matter the task and requirement assigned. Arguably one of the more prominent traits of Ringo is no doubt her own creation which her AI Bearrabbit. While itself an excellent showcase of Ringo’s skills as an inventor Bearrabbit also provided an opportunity for the reveal of Ringo’s own inner feelings as unlike Ringo it was not restricted in its display of emotions and feelings something that I felt added a small window that allowed us to see the kind of feelings that she may be feeling as a result of events happening around her.  
 
Aoi  
 
Aoi Ichijou portrayed by new seiyuu Sayaka Kaneko is one of the main characters of the series and one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses that have come to save the new world in which they find themselves in. A teenage girl that despite her young age is shown to possess both the skill and figure of a veteran athlete but unlike standard athlete’s Aoi’s talent is something that is not used in competitions of prestige but rather on a field that requires all of her skills and reflexes that will enable her to triumph over her opponents this field being no other than a battlefield. For unlike normal athletes Aoi’s genius lay in her ability as a swordswoman and is rightly famed worldwide for her skill with the blade that can allow her to take on entire platoons at a time when needed. However, beneath these claims from initial appearances, Aoi is seen to be a girl that’s kind, positive, friendly and loyal to both her friends and to those that have earned her trust. While shown to be extremely skilled with the sword Aoi was also shown to be someone that can be said to have both the attitude and beliefs of the ancient samurai both in terms of her strong sense of honor and her strong sense of justice and was a strong believer in the fact that no matter how powerful one is their first responsibility is to protect the innocent from harm traits that I felt really suited Aoi. As a character, while Aoi is less skilled in leadership and planning that Tsukasa or at inventing tech as Ringo was Aoi was someone that was shown to be the perfect defender as her skill with the sword while considerable was also paired with Aoi’s strong desire to protect the innocent a combination that proved not just to be a potent one but also proved to be a perfect counter to the first serious threat that the seven faced within the world. At the same time with regards to Aoi, I was also particularly impressed by Aoi’s rather unique way of speaking as she makes use of a very formal method of speaking that I felt paired well with her focus as a swordswoman that’s based off the ancient Samurai.  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi portrayed by new seiyuu Natsumi Hioka is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the seven geniuses that came to this world with Tsukasa to save it. A teenage girl who despite her young age is known widely among the world not just for her cute catchphrases but also for her prowess as a journalist for Shinobu is known throughout the world as the world’s top journalist that’s capable of gathering info on any subject and target within the world due to both her skills as a reporter as well as her ability to seemingly materialise out of nowhere to provide both timely info and advice an ability reminiscent of the ancient shinobi something that I felt matched well with Shinobu given her skill set. From her initial appearances, Shinobu is seen to be a positive, curious and surprisingly energetic person that’s shown to have boundless levels of energy and approaches her role as a spy/journalist with great enthusiasm. While most people that are transported to a parallel world may be dazed somewhat by the unique circumstances to which they find themselves in Shinobu was not just able to take things in stride but also be able to assume her new role as a spy in this new world relatively quickly showing not just her fast-thinking nature but also her confidence in her own skills for she was able to easily convert them to suit her newfound station.  
 
While her positive and often overly enthusiastic approach to her work may give the impression that she was a rash person it can be seen that rather the opposite is true for Shinobu was someone that was not just intelligent but also a calm and perceptive person that was well versed at not just determining the best sources of intel within a given area or situation but also able to perceive minute irregularities within an area as shown during her infiltration of Gustav’s home territory. While the members of the seven can be said to be one that operates as a unit Shinobu true to her mannerisms as a shinobi was someone that was seen to prefer to operate solo when on the field not because she was averse to being with the others but because she determined that by being alone she was able to get more things done faster while still remaining a potent source of info for her friends a result that is shown well within the series in the amount of detailed info that she was able to provide the team that allowed them to neutralise many of the enemy’s attacks. As a character, I felt that Shinobu was an interesting one as while her role as a journalist/shinobi was one that presented her with arguably the most danger she was able to not just take these in stride by masking it with her positive and teasing nature but also help secure many notable victories that aided her fellows. This contrast between her base nature and her vital but dangerous role within the story I felt suited her perfectly and served to make her one of my favourites.  
 
AMV  
 
In terms of animation, I felt that the individual character designs for both the seven and the people that they encountered within the new world were both well designed and showed some great variety. While the designs for the seven did well to reflect their chosen fields within their former world the character designs for the people reflected not just their social class but also their relationships with the rulers of the world on a social level. However while effective at their given role I felt that the main highlight of the series animation was on the tech advancement that the seven embarked on within the series with it doing particularly well in showing the various advancements that have been introduced whether they were advanced tools that aided the people in their lives or weapons tech that allowed the people to defend their newfound freedom from the nobility. In terms of locations and terrain variety while the series did feature a good mix of locations in which the seven began their social uprising that was paired with some unique quirks with notable examples being the lords castle that represented both oppression and retribution and Gustav’s town that represented false promises  I felt that the locations featured were rather too standard and I felt that a greater variety of locations could have been used that would have allowed more expansion into the world’s social class. In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hajimete no Kakumei that was performed by Dialogue and Dear my distance by the popular up and coming seiyuu singer Akari Kitou. The former I felt gave the impression of both an unforgettable adventure to a new world with friends that will not only allow them to meet dangerous beasts but also encounter the same conditions in which all of them trained so hard to help eliminate as well as an opportunity to not just save but also help change the very social fabric of the new world by working together with not just themselves but with their newfound allies as well. In the case of the latter, I felt that in terms of feelings it provoked one of both finalities and of bonds that have been both formed and strengthened as a result of the adventures that had been shared together.  
 
In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. While this series like most animes these days featured a core cast of both veterans and new seiyuu’s I felt that due to the character roles within the series that many of the new faces were not just given an excellent opportunity to show the rewards of their labours but also get the opportunity to learn from the many veterans within the cast. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi, Rina Hidaka, Sayaka Kaneko, and Natsumi Hioka all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Tsukasa, Ringo, Aoi and Shinobu respectively. Natsumi’s portrayal of Shinobu in particular I felt deserve special praise as I felt that her unique voice paired especially well with Shinobu’s ninja and cat-like mannerisms.  
 
Overall conclusion  
 
In overall High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the more interesting anime’s that aired this season. Its main strong points, in my opinion, was its unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed core cast, excellent voice acting and its focus on using multi-vector strategies so as to deal with the trials that the team comes across within the series.  
 
The overall story and premise of the series in my opinion was one of the main highlights of the series and was one that I felt made excellent use of both the Isekai genre as a whole as well as the unique premise that comes from taking seven geniuses from the modern world and transporting them to a parallel one that was not just leagues behind them in terms of tech level but also is one that is battling the same kind of problems that the seven had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. As a genre the Isekai is perhaps one of the most popular ones within the anime industry due largely to its ease of use by both authors and animation studios but whereas the most common formula for such a series is to make use of the solo hero story type that follows the rise of a hero as they change the world with the support of their friends in the case of high schools it is different. What made High school prodigies different in my eyes was the fact that unlike its counterparts within the genre High school prodigies did not feature just one hero as its main character but rather it actually had seven people each while powerful in their own right and masters of their own respective fields were nonetheless confronted with both a task that was beyond their skills as one person but also one that required them to work with their friends in order to invoke a change that they all so wish to desire within the new world in which they find themselves in. While itself an almost impossible task I felt that the method in which the series overall story took to allow the team to instill change within the series was an excellent one that while making use of each of the seven’s unique skill sets to push back the corrupt nobility that held power within the world also did well to reflect that social advancement is not just about pushing evildoers back but also about giving the people both the power and knowledge that they have lacked to not only live their lives the way in which they desire but also have the means to defend what is precious to them as well. In this, I was particularly impressed with the fact that while Tsukasa and his friends sought to change the very social fabric of the world through both the promotion of democracy, fair rights and powerful tools and knowledge that served to improve the quality of life of its people it was done in a way that feels natural in terms of world consistently due largely to the fact that this advancement is done so via the introduction of a new religion that promotes this in the form of the seven-star faith that amusingly enough has Akatsuki as its god. While serving as an effective method in which to spread its teachings among the people of the land I felt that this also served well to show that while the seven’s skills made them formidable opponents for their enemies whether on a social, economic or military level even they cannot hope to change the world without the help of the people of this world and reinforcing the series overall theme that whether it’s the seven or their friends and allies that they are all working together to tear down the unfairness that has been plaguing this world and making it hell for those that call it home.  
 
Overall High school Prodigies I felt was an interesting anime that featured as its main strong points a unique premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting that was paired with some rather interesting themes that are rarely found within anime’s that served to make it one of the more interesting ones this season. However, I felt that its lack of an effective central villain that could match wits and intelligence with Tsukasa and the seven made the seven’s victories rather too easy with the magic knight Gustav providing an effective but brief trial for the seven to overcome while his fellow general within the empire while certainly more cunning and intelligent than Gustav was appeared too late within the series to have much of an impact on the overall story . At the same time while the seven were more or less represented equally within the series I felt that not all of them were expanded enough to make them effective characters with Akatsuki and Keine being the best examples of this. I for one would have liked to see the kind of effects that Keine a renowned doctor within the modern world would have had on the healthcare and medical infrastructure of this new world. Overall as a final score, I would say that High School prodigies easily deserve a score of 8/10.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the worst anime ever made. This also might be the worst piece of entertainment I have witnessed in 17 years of my life. Take in mind, I've seen half a season of 甜蜜暴击, I've seen Commonplace to World's Strongest (fucking today actually), I've seen School Days. Yet none of those colossal turds were as lazy, pandering, and fucking SHITE as this. This is the fucking lowest common denominator of entertainment, and if you think this is good or competent on any level I don't even want to talk to you. I would rather castrate myself with a rusty, dull butter knife than sit through this atrocious garbage again. So what makes this anime so fucking awful? ?? 
 
The premise: I'm sick and tired of Isekai. Isekai has given us some of the worst anime and content on the face of this Earth. It's given us Sword Art Online, aka Sexual Assault Online. It's given us the likes of Isekai Cheat Magician. I have nothing but pure and utter contempt for this genre. Obviously, with this piece of cancer, the premise is the SAME FUCKING THING. A group of elite highschoolers are transported to another world, and they're OP. The end. Actually, let's address that. These highschoolers are apparently ""tHe WoRlD's BeSt"". In what fucking world are the elites of the world all Japanese Highschoolers? One of them, is the world's ""Best Politician"". What the fuck does that even mean. There's no such thing as the ""best politician"". Politics is fucking subjective, you WHORES. There's always gonna be people who hate you, no matter how competent, caring, or logical you are. That's why Trump got elected, so don't fucking give me this ""Best Politician"" shit. The world’s “Best Magician” is a fucking kid. He can make the Eiffel Tower disappear with a wave of his wand. THAT’S NOT HOW MAGIC WORKS. MAGIC IS BASED ON FUCKING TRICKING THE AUDIENCE’S PERCEPTION. WHEN THERE’S FUCKING MORE THAN ONE AUDIENCE THEN THEY’LL BE SEEING THINGS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE. So he’s not a magician, but a fucking wizard? He can also make his head levitate? So let’s pretend if you were these characters, who entered another world. Would your first goal be: a. to get the fuck out of there, b. to look for clues on how you got there in the first place, or c. go around doing things for no reason and that doesn’t benefit you at all, such as making fucking mayonnaise. If you chose option c, congrats, YOU’RE FUCKING STUPID. Obviously, these characters chose just to do that. Actually, let’s address that too.  
 
The Characters: all the characters are razor thin. They’re so thin I could slice my wrist open with them. I can summarize every single one of them with less than three words and it’ll be a comprehensive description. Cat Ninja. Politician guy. Rich guy. Samurai Girl. Elf Bimbo. Furry Bimbo. Short dick. Adolf Hitler. Need I go on? Aside from not making sense at all, these characters are just boring. None of them have any personality beyond their stereotypical caricatures. There aren’t any nuances to their personality, or anything remotely interesting. They’re a bunch of walking clichés. Fuck me.  
 
The animation: the animation is garbage. There’s no real depth or anything visually appealing at all in this fucking anime. The laziness is apparent in the animation. It looks like shit! Obviously they decided to include some details for the sake of fan service, such as the Elf Bimbo’s bare nipples that are basically visible through her bra-less blouse. Yeah, didn’t that make you hard? No? Is it because it’s tame as fuck? Aside from useless fan-service, this anime has no attention to detail. All the character designs are one-dimensional, unoriginal, and boring, much like the characters themselves. The animation for the fight scenes are animated so horribly you’d swear it was done in Scratch. What else is there to say?  
 
The Writing: the writing is absolutely atrocious on all accounts. It is the most boring, lazy, stupid shit I’ve ever seen. Half the anime is just characters talking to each other, and providing exposition. If you cut those useless scenes out each episode will be less than 5 minutes long. We’re provided so much fucking information in the first episode, I thought I was gonna have a seizure. Oh wait, that’s because of the sheer fucking idiocy of this heaping pile of shit. Nevermind. The story is something that’s been done a million times, but fuck ‘em, who needs originality amirite? On top of that, none of the character interactions or dialogue are the very least interesting. It’s mostly just fucking bullshit. Although this is supposed to be a comedy, I didn’t laugh even once, not even in an unintentionally hilarious scene. I was too busy screaming. Even in a complete piece of shit like Commonplace to World’s Strong",4
9,13161,69,6.326946476,A group of people living together,Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica,"About thirty years prior to the start of  Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica , a number of selected people from Earth were summoned to other worlds with only about half of them being able to return. One of the young people chosen was Akatsuki Ousawa, who was sent to Alayzard to defeat the Dark Lord Garius, which he did, before returning to his original world. Some of the successful chosen ones brought back little trinkets as souvenirs. Akatsuki, on the other hand, went a different route—he brought back the defeated Dark Lord's daughter, Miu, who is now posing as his long lost little sister! 
 
Upon returning, Akatsuki and Miu are forced to join a special school called BABEL where they must train to one day master the powers they gained in Alayzard, in hopes that they will one day be able to serve mankind. Will Akatsuki and Miu be able to keep her true identity a secret or will their plan to live peaceful lives together go up in flames?","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']","The story follows a world where several young men and women regularly find themselves spirited away to a world of sword and magic called Alayzard (アレイザード, Areizādo). Those who survive and return are typically gifted with magic abilities. An international training organization named Babel protects these young returnees and trains them in the use of their power. A wayward hero named Akatsuki has come back to his world, along with a beautiful girl called Miu who is the daughter of the Last Dark Lord, whom he defeated in battle.
","The show basically has its good aspects and bad aspects. The bad aspects would definitely be that the animation and sound were mediocre, the voice acting however was good. For an anime in 2012, and an action anime at that, the animation could have been MUCH better....more colorful, better fluid movements of the characters and so on, instead, it looked pretty much like a ""normal anime"" from 2006, especially when you compare the fact that 2006 brought out some good graphical animes (if i remember correctly). Another ridiculous aspect of the show was the nudity....the sheer amount of nudity was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. Even the fanservice and ecchi scenes were overkill, yet at times important. I mean I get Akatsuki building character and relationships based on his EXTREME YET COOL pervertedness,  but the nude scenes were not necessary for any of them. 
 
Thing is though, despite the fact that the animation and sound sucked, the story was REALLY DEEP. It was INSANELY INTERESTING, whereby there is not only room for a prequel; but a sequel is ALMOST A MUST. I mean the reason this show MAY get a bad score by other reviewers is simply for the fact that ""IT ENDED WAY TOO EARLY FOR ANY RECOGNITION"". Its basically like watching one piece or naruto and ending it in the first 13 episodes.....with ONLY that much it basically crap. I'm pretty sure that if this show continued, more people would see the worth of it; its story gives room for a BUNCH of arcs while centering around the main plot of well....real earth with its superpowered organizations. All in all, the story has a 10 point (out of 10) potential, which 12 episodes alone CAN NEVER BRING OUT. So despite the fact that the 12 episodes were NOT THAT GREAT, the potential WAS EPIC. That attributes to the high score that I gave this show. 
 
In terms of characters, well the class president was interesting, so was the lesbian though she wasn't THAT interesting, MIU was a typical idiot when she was ready but other than that there was potential for her, and the vice president was okay I guess, though she was USUALLY annoying throughout. The blonde hair guy (can't remember his name) was REALLY COOL and mysterious, and I really wanted to see more of him. AND THEN THERE'S AKATSUKI........two words ""EPIC BADASS"". ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE LEVEL this guy was EPIC; in fighting he was SUPREME, in planning/strategizing/reading people he was EPIC, in his way to attract people was ALSO EPIC. This is the HERO WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. I mean he is UNPREDICTABLY PREDICTABLE....what I mean by this is YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO WIN IN THE END, BUT HOW HE DOES IT IS LIKE ""DAMN DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING"". He is simply EPIC and FOR him alone, the score for this show went up higher due to ""THE RULE OF COOL"". The ""RULE OF COOL"" states that when a main character is SO BADASS despite the show being.....okay.....the show gets a higher rating (past shows were cowboy bebop and trigun.....they were great shows but were even greater due to the main characters).....that said Hagure Yuusha is definately a WATCH, BUT only a BUY if the series actually continues, because if it does it would be MEMORABLE IF THE STORY IS TOLD RIGHT!

          
 
       Helpful ""Anime was a mistake"" 
-Hayao Miyazaki 
 
Have you ever wanted to know exactly what happens after the hero slays the enemy and saves the day? Well, Studio Arms (Elfen Lied) attempted to tackle this very question with their 2012 adaptation of the light novel, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero. With a rather unique premise as a backbone, I was very curious to see what this series was about. Unfortunately, what followed was a lewd, generic insult to anime fans everywhere, with more breast development than character development. Join me as I chart the fanservice waters and explore one of the worst anime I’ve seen to date. 
 
The story sounds promising from the start. It begins with our conceited, overpowered protagonist Akatsuki leaving a foreign land to which he was summoned to defeat an evil Dark Lord. Instead of taking home a trinket as a souvenir for his efforts, he decides to go a few steps further and kidnap the vanquished Lord’s daughter as his own personal “consolation prize” (first indicator that this dude’s probably an arrogant prick). Once they return to Earth, he and Miu are “forced” to join BABEL, a school focused on extracting and enhancing the skills Akatsuki and others learned during their time in the foreign land of Alayzard. 
 
Now I’ve never really delved into the ecchi genre, so I figured Aesthetica would be a decent place to start, given the cocky nature of the main character. The main problem is that the writers spend an unnecessary amount of time justifying Akatsuki’s lecherous actions, that it amplifies the perverted nature of the show. If he grabs a girl’s breasts, he’s just trying to show her how to make use of cleavage. If he steals a girl’s panties, he’s just trying to prove a point. These moments are so prolific early on that you end up not taking the show seriously. The amount of ecchi moments are plentiful too, with a unique mix of lesbians, random crotch-grabbing and heinous nudity to go around. And some of the scenes I was downright ashamed to watch, including an excerpt involving Akatsuki using his divine powers to cause three girls to pee themselves to prevent one from being embarrassed. I can’t even make this stuff up. I can see why the light novel is so popular around Japan… 
 
Most of the show’s 12 episodes are eaten up exploring the generic cast, and by the time the real story comes into play near the end, Aesthetica has already lost its steam. Any inkling of hope I had for the serious elements to play out were eradicated by the copious amounts of fanservice plaguing the anime’s beginning. The overpowering nature of Akatsuki also eliminates any feeling of drama throughout the series. Much like Sora and Shiro from No Game No Life, the battles are over before they begin, leaving much less opportunity for suspense from a viewer’s perspective. Most efforts at backstories are waived off to promote more ecchi scenes or are truncated due to the series’ short run. Considering it’s been five years since Aesthetica’s release, I don’t see a sequel in the works either, so the five of you out there that actually enjoyed the show can wait with bated breath. 
 
When I first saw Akatsuki, I was delighted. Finally we get a protagonist who isn’t shy around women and doesn’t get caught up in melodramatic inner monologues! But, it only took an episode for him to show his true colors, and before long I despised his presumptuous personality. Egotistical doesn’t even begin to describe him, and you could even go as far as to call him sexually sadistic. Akatsuki is so much better than everyone else in the show that they seem almost irrelevant. Generic iterations of various tropes are scattered throughout Aesthetica, leading the viewers to feel cheapened by the lazy writing. Miu has her fair share of, um well, “development” (aka, tits) but again this is overshadowed by the extraneous amount of time spent on Akatsuki’s perverted acts. The whole show is like some kind of messed up harem where instead of having girls fawning over him, they’re forced onto him against their will. But instead of hating him for what he does, he always finds a loophole excuse or convenience to make it okay. It’s almost as though the writers are saying to their viewers, “It’s okay to grope women as long as you make up a good reason!” Truly disgusting. 
 
The animation is a constant reminder of what Studio ARMS is not known for. It’s one of the same reasons I didn’t care for Elfen Lied. Everyone that’s not a main character is a pain to look at, as the models are a generic wreck. Even the protagonists leave a lot to be desired in the art department. The action scene’s animation was lackluster at best, and had some framing issues. Honestly, the most accurate part of the entire anime is the nudity. Depravity at its finest. The animation in the OP reminded me a bit of the old Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball games with all of the breast bouncing. I should’ve known then to run for the hills. 
 
The music in Aesthetica is reminiscent of something I’d hear in a cheesy DDR ripoff. It’s BAD. It’s almost as though the creators went down a sorted list of cheapest to most expensive when it came to purchasing the musical rights of the tracks here. At least the ecchi-ness helps drown some of it out. The ED is better, but still misses the mark for me. All of these begin to blur together after awhile. On a positive note, the English dub is actually pretty good. It incorporates some better known actors and is casted well. Some of the translations were altered to make them a bit more Westernized, but nothing really detracted from the scenes. 
 
To make a long story short, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is NOT a good show. It’s inexcusably perverted, lacks any character development and has a story that fizzles out faster than a middle school relationship. I guess if you were really bored or just looking for a terrible series to put things into perspective, then this could be a potential option for you. Just make sure you come in without any other expectations than tits. Lots and lots of tits. As always, thanks for reading!

       Helpful I can say this was a great anime. There were gaps and holes and a lot of things i didn't like but i was thoroughly entertained the entire time! First I would like to say I haven't read the novels an all speculation is based solely upon the anime. What I can say from the start is it takes some getting used to knowing that there is this massive back story that we didn't get to see and that there could be enough content for a prequel season however after the fourth episode that stopped bothering me as some things were being explained. I liked that they used flashbacks but didn't completely kill you with them. They were moderate and gave the info they needed to. 
 
The only thing I disliked about the anime was throughout the first half it was almost entirely fan service with only a little action. Sure one would expect it to have ecchi in it but i was expecting much more action. I dove into this anime expecting a lot of action and got a lot of boobs. Not that it is a major complaint since this was however satisfied very quickly after the first few episodes. the anime was a little spotty with the story, a plot never really made itself present. At points it seemed like we were getting glimpses of a plot but in then turned out to be miniscule with the constant revealings of other plot points.  
 
GOD FUCKING DAMN! Akatsuki's badass level is OFF THE CHARTS! I love this character quite a bit. He has amazing power and the author didn't screw up by making him overpowered because in fact the author made him unable to use magic bearing a weakness however he is just so badass that he turned his weakness into a strength. All the other characters are very well thought through although none are as captivating. 
 
They really did kind of force a second season and I really hope we get one! I don't necessarily like reading action light novels because much of it is visual so I hope the anime adaptation carries on. Many things were left lingering and I feel as though this season was barely scratching the surface because the only time a clear plot was in fact introduced was at the very end of the season. They left way too many things lingering but that's because they were probably just following the novels. This anime is well worth watching and I really hope we will get to see a second season.

9,32547,70,6.280328135,A group of people living together,Non Non Biyori Repeat: Hotaru ga Tanoshinda,"Life in rural Asahigaoka moves at its own pace. Devoid of the pleasures and worries of a bustling metropolis, this small village might seem painfully dull at first glance. However, despite living this far from her hometown of Tokyo, Hotaru Ichijou manages to find a group of friends whom she can spend quality time with. No matter whether it's winter, spring, summer, or fall, they make full use of everything the nature around them has to offer. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","The story takes place in the countryside small town village of Asahigaoka, a place lacking many of the conveniences that people from the city are accustomed to. The nearest stores are a few miles away and one of the local schools consists of only five students, each of whom is in a different grade of elementary or middle school. Hotaru Ichijo, a fifth grader from Tokyo, transfers into Asahigaoka Branch School and adjusts to countryside life with her new friends.
","We all know Non Non Biyori is god-tier already so I'll keep this short. 
 
Pros: 
+Hotaru had fun 
+The main theme was remixed to sound all french and shit when they were cooking 
+Candy Store had kitten mittens 
+Hotaru had fun 
 
Cons: 
-Natsumi almost got killed by an old zipper lady in Komari's dream 
-The animation for the flying squirrel gliding over Komari's head was used twice 
-Hotaru couldn't see the squirrel babies in the tree from the ground 
-Pechi's woofs still sound eerily human 
 
To conclude, Non Non Biyori has seen a dramatic decrease in quality ever since they completely fucking forgot about Gu. Gu was a classic season 1 gag and he always brought the laughs with his psychedelic name and deadpan humour.  
G?ring and Himmler, Pinky and the Brain, the Two Ronnies, the Blue Brothers; all respectable comedy duos in their own right, or course, but they can't hold a candle to the chemistry Gu and Renge had and don't you fucking deny it. When you think about Non Non Biyori's setting, the first thing that springs (haha get it) to mind is NATURE, when you think of nature you think about animals and when you think of animals you think of Gu. Gu wasn't just ""any old animal"", it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call him the mascot animal of Non Non Biyori. Apparently the fuckers at Silver Link thought it would be funny to stick him on the cover for the season 2 OST album even though he doesn't even get any fucking scenes- what kind of sick joke is that? But that wasn't enough, because not only does Gu completely vanish from the face of this godforsaken shithole of a planet, but but he's seemingly replaced with the putrid pup that is Pechi. Pechi himself is a rather unassuming little fucker to the untrained eye- but that beast has tricks up his sleeves and If I'm not going to prevent this injustice then who is? That MUTT wasn't even in season 1 and suddenly he waltzes in all confidently with his 5+ minutes of screen-time and his slightly unsettling barking sounds. Disgusting. 
Did you know the name ""Pechi"" translates to ""Rattle"" in English? Well there's no doubt I'm rattled by this disgraceful executive move. I've had it with Silver Link, go back to making Fate Kalewd Prisma Illya season 60 for all I fucking care.

       Helpful We all know Non Non Biyori is god-tier already so I'll keep this short. 
 
Pros: 
+Hotaru had fun 
+The main theme was remixed to sound all french and shit when they were cooking 
+Candy Store had kitten mittens 
+Hotaru had fun 
 
Cons: 
-Natsumi almost got killed by an old zipper lady in Komari's dream 
-The animation for the flying squirrel gliding over Komari's head was used twice 
-Hotaru couldn't see the squirrel babies in the tree from the ground 
-Pechi's woofs still sound eerily human 
 
To conclude, Non Non Biyori has seen a dramatic decrease in quality ever since they completely fucking forgot about Gu. Gu was a classic season 1 gag and he always brought the laughs with his psychedelic name and deadpan humour.

       Helpful Unlike the first ova which was very boring and uninteresting for most of it, this time we get a very relaxing episode with so much enjoyable moments, I felt very relaxed watching this because of how good it was, it was nice seeing the childish and young personality of Hotaru when she was playing around with her dog, I love that version of her very much it's so cute, we also get to see her taking to the Kaede which was nice as well, it was nice watching Renge , Hotaru and Natsumi missing with Komari's dream and of course the final scene with them eating together eating with the flying squirrels was very lovely to watch, now all we have to do is hope for a new season to be made and hope it is as good as the last one. 
 
Overall : 9/10.  
Worth Watching.

Thanks to the curse, one of his arms has become possessed. After finding a sword that has been possessed by the spirit Roxy, he embarks on a quest to unravel the secret of the curse and meets various people who also join his party. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']",none,"This anime is a hidden jem: it's not perfect nor the best anime ever made, but it is worth your time.  
 
First things first: this anime's plot is generic and a bit bad; and it's a shame that the first half of the fist episode is dedicated to set up the plot and introducing characters that are not important until later in the series.  
 
But the shows knows this, so instead of boring you with the same generic plot of ""let's travel and save the world"", the show focuses on traveling though the fantasy world and the character interactions; and only specific episodes are plot ""heavy"", and even in those episodes there are more than enough gags to keep you entertained. Althou, my problem with this approach is that you'll forget why they were travelling in the first place (but you'll have so much fun that you won't care) 
 
Almost every episode is set on a different city/town and focuses on the adventure that the party has on each location. The location themselves are normal (houses with normal people), but the interesing part of them are the adventures the party in the city: maybe they'll have to defeat a monster using the power of a pumpking-god, or maybe they'll do random jobs (like fishing flying piranhas) so to gather money to buy supplies and don't starve to death, or maybe they'll have to help a gunsmith to save his sister because he is alergic to the guns he creates, or maybe one of the party members just scews something up and the all the party has to fix the problem they caused.  
 
But the most important thing about this anime are it's characters and their interactions: all of them are idiots (with good or bad intensions) and they're pissing each other off for the hell of it but, at the end of the day, they can't stay mad because they are all friends that care for each other.  
 
By the way, this show is a comedy. Without spoiling anything, the ""fights"" are not real fights... but, at the same time, they are there so that the conflict is resolved. Also, since the last a cople of seconds, they won't bother you.  
 
A side note; this show handles fanservise in the good way: most women are really hot, but their boobs are not the reason for why they exist.  
 
Its visuals and its sound are good: both of them are deliver a good experience but they are not remarkable enough to point them out. 
 
But maybe you'll read this review and ask yourself ""if this anime has so many problems, why does this guy gives it a good review?"". Basically, because it is that funny! It is hard to review this anime without spoiling anything because the things that heppens in it are hillarious and ridicule!  
 
If you've read this review and you have doubts about watching the show, go to Youtube and watch it's second opening. It doesn't contain any spoiler, it is a short adventure that shows how goofy and hillarious this anime and it's characters are.  
 
I hope you have found this review helpfull. Any type of feedback is welcome (send them by PM). 

          
 
       Helpful I'm probably being too generous giving this 8/10 overall, but I quite liked it. Before watching it, I heard many complaints. The priest's certain ""habit"", some ""Gonzo"" company made it, people said it was boring, and just made negative comments in general. Throughout watching it, I heard several comments about how people hated ""party call"" and a lot of other things. Some of the positive/negative comments people made led me to believe they didn't really understand the show. 
 
This show loosely follows the storyline in Dungeon Fighter Online. The show has many of your favourite NPCs from the game, which is just something fun to see if you've played DFO. GSD definitely looks like he's able to see, Bwanga wasn't in here at all, and there are a bunch of other inaccurate things. 
 
Anyhow... I'd have to say the show starts off horribly. The first part of the first episode is awesome since it involves Roxy and Aganzo. It's interesting since we don't know much about them even from playing DFO, just the little hints that they loved each other from some of the comments on newb equipment and that Aganzo is ""The Grey Slayer"". The show has a pretty serious tone at this point, which is also pretty cool. 
After that, things start to get a little silly and trivial. The show isn't really going in any direction and they're just sort of building up a party. I say the show starts to pick up around episode 5 or 6, by which time the party is assembled and we start to meet some NPCs. Now, in a good anime series, the introduction of a new main character would be an extremely interesting episode. Here, however, it was pretty boring and a bit of a grind to get through.  
 
Baron, the slayer, has been hated and discriminated against ever since he received Kazan's curse. Every normal person wants him dead. He simply wants to find a cure for it and doesn't really blame people for hating him; he just tries to ignore them and leave them be. His character was fine at this point... but then they turned him into a gold hearted hero who goes out of his way to save every single person he can despite how he was treated. It was just very poorly written and had no emotion at all, especially how he gave confidence to a little girl who just lost her parents. She was breaking down, but a thumbs up from Baron was enough to make her cheerful and hoping to meet this great guy again someday since he saved their town. Stupid. He's the main character and he was done the worst... Big mistake. He should've been a bit more badass. 
Capensis, the gunner, is pretty much just comic relief. He complains a lot, hits on women, gets treated like a slave, gets hurt the most, and nobody cares about his wellbeing at all (or even likes him). I found him to be pretty funny. 
Ryunmei, the fighter, was a pretty decent character overall. The show had to sneak in the extremely typical and unfunny joke about a flat-chested girl commenting on her large breasts... However, they actually had a good gag involving her large breasts somewhere in the middle of the series.  
Ixia, the mage, was introduced poorly. She was a total brat who was wanted captured. And our party did capture her. Then scolded her. Then... Then they let her go without resolving anything after she deeply insulted all of them. Guess what? They decide to treat her as a precious comrade out of the blue. They should've done a better job of converting her to the good side... She might as well have remained a spoiled brat since she only joined them because they accepted her, not because she understood that what she did before was wrong. She's a pretty decent character after that, though, and it's kinda fun to see how she gains new familiars/summons. 
 
Just had to get all that out there... Anyhow, the art takes a little getting used to. The animation is pretty average, maybe a little below average since the shading isn't too fancy and the animation is still only at this level. The battles are weak. Capensis takes out all the grunts, Ryunmei and Ixia help out with that and/or pin the boss, Baron finishes the boss off with an aerial attack, a single triple slash, neutral wave sword, or (for the final boss) ashe fork. Better than dragging battles on for 3-10 episodes, though, right? 
 
I found the ending theme to be particularly cool since it's done in a retro pixel art style. 
 
Last, but certainly not least, PARTY CALL~! Some people really hated this about the show, but I think it was my favourite part. This really made the show unique and added a good amount of humour. It's not a kind of humour that everyone an understand or appreciate, though. Some people take it a bit too seriously, but it's clearly a joke in itself. Some say it ruins the mood of battles, but the pep talk itself is funny and it lets them get the battle over and done with. If it weren't for the party call, how would you end an even match? Fight till both sides are totally exhausted, then the good guys use some kind of finishing move. Party call skips straight to the finishing move.  
 
If you like DFO and can find the party calls amusing, then you'll probably like this show as much as I did after you get past the first few episodes.

There's a curious phenomenon occuring in the entertainment industry, one that blurs the line between what you read, watch and play, and while we may all be familiar with the weird, wonderful, and sometimes downright appalling world of the adaptation, in truth the dividing line between the mediums is beginning to fade.  
 
Where am I going with this? Well, in recent years games and gaming, especially on consoles, has moved to the forefront of the entertainment industry, and in order to capitalise on the popularity of a given title various production companies and writers have begun to produce adaptations of games that have proven themselves cash cows. One recent example of this is the latest Hollywood release, ""Prince of Persia"", a movie which clearly signifies Hollywood's desire to make more money cashing in to the current games market, especially after the debacle that was ""Super Mario Brothers"" and the recent glut of superhero affairs.  
 
The problem though, is that game adaptations aren't really the best source material, especially MMO games. 
 
Slap Up Party: Arad Senki (or Slap Up Party: Record of the Arad War), originally began life as a Korean multiplayer fighting game called ""Dungeon & Fighter"" that incorporated certain role playing aspects, however the popularity of the game was such that it quickly expanded to include a more immersive RPG system. Now while the game itself is copmparable to the likes of World of Warcraft, the main problem with any adaptation is that in orderfor it to work, the story would not only have to fit into the game world, but also be accessable enough for those unfamiliar with the title. 
 
Unfortunately, Arad Senki seems to have fallen into the same trap as titles like Ragnarok, Ar Tonelico and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, amongst others. 
 
The story follows a young man named Baron through the land of Arad as he travels from place to place seeking a way to cure his particular affliction, namely a demon arm, which was caused by a curse that affected the land some time before (it's never clear when). Along the way he is accompanied by a small floating spirit named Roxy, and is later joined by several other companions. 
 
Sounds familiar. right? 
 
Like many anime of this kind, this tale oozes shounen sensibilities from almost every pore, from believing in one's friends to never giving up, and everything in between. The problem though, is that the plot has no real direction, and because of this haphazard approach the story proper takes a very long time to get going. However, even with the tale in full flow, there is still not enough substance to make one take the story seriously. Strangely though, this lack of focus and actual storyline doesn't impact one's enjoyment as much as one might think, as there seems to have been some realisation that the platform upon which the entire show stands is full of cracks. That said, these cracks have only really been papered over with a thin veneer of comedy that, in truth, is sometimes a bit hit-and-miss.  
 
The main reason for the lack of focus is the fact that the anime is based on an MMOG, and because of this the writers have had to fit the story into the pre-existing world, something which limits their creativity. On the other hand, if this type of anime is approached correctly, then there is scope for improvement as the game allows for a phenomenal amount of content and ideas that could be adapted.  
 
It's unfortunate then, that this hasn't been realised, however there is something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing (more on this in a bit). 
 
As far as looks go, the series is colourful enough, and the characters are designed reasonably well, however there is a comic element inherent in this that may not be obvious at first. The animation is generally pretty good throughout the show, and because of the nature of the series, Gonzo are able to show off a variety of styles, from comic to fast-paced action, something which serves the anime well come the end. 
 
That said, the show lacks a degree of refinement where the visuals are concerned. While it may be argued that a good portion of the series is stylistically designed to enhance this or that comedy or action scene, the viewer may find that the show has a ""rushed"" feel for the most part. 
 
Sound is also pretty decent throughout Arad Senki, with many of the effects being clear and well choregraphed. The acting is good for the most part, however some of the seiyuu really do ham it up, and in all honesty I can'tbe sure if this is by accident or design, as several scenes actually work better this way. 
 
Arad Senki is generally well served as far as the music goes. The tracks used throughout the show enhance the atmosphere fairly well, however the comedy element means it's difficult to take the action scenes seriously, even with the ubitquitous dramatic music. The show has two OPs, ""Party Play"" by Sakura Nogawa and ""Sokujin no Pandora"" by Nogawa Sakura, both of which are decent J-rock tracks. The first OP is fairly typical with it's visuals, however the second takes a more innovative and humourous approach to golf (that's right, golf). 
 
As for the EDs, ""Hateshinai Sekai"" by YMCK and ""LEVEL∞"" by Akiko Hasegawa, they are both made using music from what sounds like an 8-bit or 16 bit game. Of the two EDs, I have to admit that I do like the comedy Hateshinai Sekai's visuals, which feature the characters in a 16-bit game opening treasures and fighting monsters. 
 
The characters are on of the issues with the series, as there simply isn't any real development given to them, and the little growth that does occur is often formulaic and ""methodical"". None of the characters really stands out in any way, however it's not all bad, as while there is a distinct deficiency in this department, they actually work fairly well when there's comedy about. Rather than focusing on developing the characters, the creators seem to have gone in a completely different direction. Essentially, the characters are treated as nothing more than toys that are wound up and let loose in a given situation, the results of which aren't always successful or effective. 
 
I already mentioned that there's something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing, and that something is the tongue in cheek nature of the show. Where series like Raganrok take themselves far too seriously, Arad Senki has made a concerted effort to add some fun to the mix. While the result isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's enough variation in the anime to keep the viewer interested at the very least. 
 
Okay, so as a straight forward story the show doesn't work all that well, however if one treats Arad Senki as a series of short stories rather than one complete tale, it becomes far more palatable, and that's one of the things that it seems to actually encourage during the early part of the show. Unfortunately, there's only so far a series can go using this format before the viewer needs something more substantial to maintain their interest, and in this department the show doesn't quite deliver. 
 
It's a shame, as the idea of making an MMOG based is a good one provided the effort is put in to make everything work. While Slap Up Party: Arad Senki may not be great, it's actually a lot more enjoyable than the likes of Ragnarok, and although it may not be to everyone's tastes, there are occasional flashes of what this show could have been like. 
 
Still, at least it's not Super Mario Bothers again :)

","It's an disappointment. The story is just plain out bad, you can feel when watching the anime that it's just looking for anything they can do to make it feel entertaining. They drag out unnecessary scenes over the whole episodes. They try to drag out anything to stall time so they can find a story to animate. The animation is bad, it's clean but bad. Poor camera angels mixed with poor animation and you have a dragon ball super fight. Fight scenes have nothing with them except for punching and kamehameha's. fighting choreography is close to none.  I heard that the animators for dragon ball super are new to animation and is just beginning to animate. And you can see how little the creator of dragon balls care about it. Dragon balls used to be a an anime like one punch man, you weren't really there for the story just more for the raw power fights. But it has really gone downhill. If you have watched all the other dragon balls and is wondering if this is worth watching, my answer to you is no. Do not watch it, it will ruin everything you liked about dragon balls 


          
 
       Helpful Does anybody remember when Goku went Super Saiyan for the first time? It was on Namek, the whole arc had been building up Frieza as this impossibly strong monster, the Z Fighters had to fight tooth and nail just to defeat his lackies. The only reason we had to hope that Goku stood a chance was this mysterious term floating around about a ""Super Saiyan."" Unless you were following the manga as it came out, you knew how it was going to go, Goku would go Super Saiyan and beat the alien tyrant in a classic case of good defeats evil. But, that's not how it goes. Sure, Goku unlocks the legendary power and is able to beat Frieza, but it's only after all the Namekians are dead, it was only after Vegeta had gone from unlikable prick to respectable anti-hero only to get unceremoniously pierced through the chest. It was only after Krillin, a character that had been with us since early in the original Dragon Ball, was dead, and as far as we knew at the time, he wasn't coming back. Goku going Super Saiyan wasn't a moment of masculine glory, it's just kind of sad. Even Goku recognizes this, one of his defining characteristics is a love for fighting, but he doesn't even want to finish the fight, Freiza is brought down with his own attack and Goku only finishes him off because he refuses to accept defeat. That's why this moment still resonates with people 30 years later, as many problems Dragon Ball Z had, be it horrible pacing or not aging well in other ways, DBZ at its core had heart and it deserves its place as a classic. 
 
Dragon Ball Super has none of that. Every arc is the exact same; introduce a new rival, Goku gets a new form to fight them with, Goku loses because of some stupid reason like a time limit or he lets his guard down, but everything turns out fine anyway because we know how this is all going to end from the time skip in Z. There's never any tension, there's never any excitement, there's never any character development, all the plot twists feel contrived, the new plot elements are hit or miss, and most of the time it is just boring to watch because while the technology has improved, their animation style hasn't been updated in 3 decades. All in all, this show is a painful waste of time designed to prey on nostalgia for a much better series.

          
 
       Helpful Let's start by re-introducing how I review Animes. First off, no Gamespot/IGN scores. This means 7 DOES NOT mean Average, nor 6 means Bad. That's the usual perspective of a lot of ppl, and has gone quite troublesome when properly reviewing. We'll take MAL's rating system, and round-off the overall score of all 5 elements. Second, I'll be saying as little to no spoilers as much as possible, unless stated otherwise when deemed necessary for a proper review. Third, take everything with a grain of salt. 
 
Dragon Ball Super. A continuation from the classic Dragon Ball series, Z. An extended take on a shounen-genre anime, that uses simple formula, but still works fairly well. I won't take my time reviewing previous Dragon Balls, such as the first and Z, and I will base my review solely on this with little comparison of Z and this as much as possible. 
 
Dragon Ball Super is one of the first few Shounen anime I've watch again in quite some time as I've felt that I've outgrown the genre. But the simple take on the genre, even without much regard on other elements like storytelling, or character development still makes quite some great enjoyment. If there's one thing that proper Shounen animes can get away with, is that plot advancement can be done on the spot, without unnecessary story backtracking, and some Deus Ex Machina can even work on story/character development, without needlessly diminishing enjoyment.  
 
Critical Review: 
 
Story - [6/10] 
A fair rating for a shounen anime. Like I previously said, most shounen animes plot are usually made on spot, and aren't usually connecting major plot devices in previous storylines. There are some exceptions to this obviously, but those are quite uncommon. While DB Super connects a few things from back even as far as the original Dragon Ball, these are not major factors that will affect a lot of things that can become influential to the current story. Most of DB Super's plot are on-the-spot and advances from there taking a few things from the old and re-imagining them to something new. 
 
In anycase, this doesn't mean it's bad, but that also means there's not much depth. Hence why the automatic memes of ""Akira Toriyama's asspulls"" is all true real...in some form atleast. Nevertheless, it's a simple formula that works, and for DB's lengthy run, it works well enough to stand on it's own. And it's this formula that keeps the series alive and well, and most likely it'll keep the series running for a long time...of course there are some things that we don't ever want to mention that has never worked for...(ehem GT). 
 
If there's anything I will like to greatly compliment, it will be the pacing. DB Super has improved it's story pacing quite significantly, and has managed to forward it's plot properly without being too long nor short compared to Z. In the case of Universal Survival Saga of course, a 48 min battle in a course of a lot of episodes is somewhat understandable. Weird, but understandable, considering fights happening mostly at the same time in the course of 20+ episodes however I wished they would've made a more realistic timer than 48 mins. 
 
Art - [7/10] 
To start off, this was a mixed-bag for me honestly. DB Super's art in earlier episodes were...lackluster to say the least. Toei's legendary animation is showing, and the quality was so obvious even in a lot of crucial moments. Even seeing things that were of so low quality that when compared to Dragon Ball Z, it was just an embarrassment. However the quality gradually changes around later episodes, and the style becomes significantly eye-catching in some moments. Of course there are still some scenes where the quality drops which are still present in newer episodes, but these becomes mostly isolated in scenes where high-paced action is taken or where only a few seconds take place. Even so, quality in crucial scenes has become better to the point you'd be wanting for more.  
 
Sound - [9/10] 
I'm a fan of good sound and music. Sound is one thing, where something fits into an action, voice, or anything in the environment. In this case, it's good. I won't say there's anything I noticed bad in particular, because sounds like ambient are usually gone unnoticed in a lot of shows.  
 
(Seiyuu/VA) 
Voice acting is done quite well by everyone, especially the main characters like Goku, Vegeta, even Frieza, etc. They all follow their roles well, and is always in character. Legendary seiyuus like Masako Nozawa who can do multiple characters in one go, I applaud you. (Rest In Peace, Hiromi Tsuru; 1960 - 2017; Voice of Bulma) 
 
(Music) 
Music is also amazing. I'd say Norihito Sumitomo has done well in the series, and a lot of the background music fits well in their respective scenes. From Goku first transforming to SSJG to Ultra Instinct. Classic intense shounen music that fits on almost everything shounen-like. I would even go far as to saying, my favorite music/scene combination in the series so far would have to go to Vegito Blue vs Fused Zamasu. That moment, even though it was just short, was enough to give me goosebumps. Continue on with the great music~ 
 
Character - [7/10] 
Properly delivering character development is somewhat hard in shounen animes without bloating the character themselves. But since the simple plot formula works, as long as they don't stray from this and don't focus for heavy-story elements like what some newer, ambitious animes do(eg. heavy back story of a character), it'll go smoothly. In the case of DB Super, this has been executed well. 
 
Most of the main cast has developed well off from their original selves in their prequels, as well as some previously thought obsolete characters like most of the Z-Fighters have redeemed themselves in the series. Which is why Super's character plot is actually a lot better than Z, because instead of slowly setting aside the old forgotten roster for newer, stronger characters, it has gone it's way back to their roots to make them useful again...atleast most of them(poor Yamcha).  
 
The two main saiyans, Goku and Vegeta retains most of their old personalities. With Goku still the fun dumbstruck as ever, with a heart of gold, and Vegeta with his somewhat ""more Tsun, less dere"" side. Showing bits of their characters making them feel natural rather than forced, their human side despite being incredible forces of nature. While they're the ones mostly shown with their somewhat easygoing side(in terms of a story universe where almost anything can just flat out kill you), these characteristics are also shown to others as well, like Gods of Destruction, some enemies, etc. Making the show feel at pace with the main cast without the latter being too heavy for them to face in a normal conversation. 
 
Setting that aside, the show's use of character self-willpower/guts is heavy. As for all shounen-anime this works very well, and just intensifies the characters themselves. This simple thing, is one of the foundations of the series and most shounen animes. At the very least, self-willpower/guts power is something that's more satisfying to watch in a shounen anime, than ""nakama power"". Of course, this still has tiny bits of that, but atleast it doesn't overblown it to the point it feels...ughhh. 
 
Enjoyment - [10/10] 
I'd be lying if I say I didn't enjoy DB Super. Regardless of its undesirable animation quality in the earlier episodes, or anything remotely bad in some way, it still manages to get me wanting for more. Like I previously said, DB Super is one first mainstream shounen anime again I've watch in quite a while. I'm a person who thinks to himself ""I have superior taste than all those pathetic lowlife and weaboos."", of course we all know that's what we all tell to ourselves. 
 
I've deviated from shounen animes for quite some time, thinking I've outgrown them. Watching a few hero animes like Boku no Hero Academia, OPM, etc. What triggered me to watch DB Super wasn't exactly nostalgia. No, it wasn't nostalgia as a child watching old DB/Z that rekindled my fondness of the series, rather how eye-catching the simple execution of shounen elements in a series like Dragon Ball Super. Being spoiled in facebook by friends, seeing Ultra Instinct scenes, already made me eager to watch it. Apparently, I just realized that there was little to no blood in the series...that's how much I enjoyed it that I completely unnoticed small details like that, but I guess I could say majority of shounen series are somewhat kid-friendly, like Fairy Tail even. 
 
Just seeing someone like Goku push his limits, taunt and fight Godlike beings. Sending shivers down my spine, and remembering memorable things like Vegito saying ""What's wrong? Is this all the power a God has?"" to Goku first achieving Ultra Instinct. It was exciting, just doing simple fighting, using martial arts, and tackle of Godlike beings. It was all intensifying and exciting overall, making me crave for newer episodes to come.  
 
And so... 
 
Overall - [8*/10] *7.8 rounded to 8 
A classic series like Dragon Ball, and Super, proves that a series doesn't necessarily needs to have very heavy story elements and depth, like what a lot of modern series strives to do today to be enjoyed. Sure it'll add to the immersion, but one wrong slip, it can be fatal to the series. The right execution of shounen-elements will provide a long-running series have endless possibilities of enjoyment. 
 
DB Super's use of simple shounen-formula makes it safe from heavy criticism, and also a safe and fun choice for any fan of the shounen genre. It's plain and simple, and it's those reasons why it's good and enjoyable.

9,34522,73,6.252994326,A group of people living together,"Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou","""Wake Up, Girls!"" is the story of growth and friendship of seven girls living in Sendai, Miyagi who form the idol group ""Wake Up, Girls! (WUG)"" and work together to become top idols. 
 
Operating under a small production company in Sendai known as ""Green Leaves Entertainment,"" WUG overcame countless obstacles to beat national idol group ""I-1 club"" at the Idol Festival and win the event. They had suddenly become top idols... but with an idol recession going on, things weren't so easy. The days of steady and honest idol work continued for the girls. 
 
Meanwhile, Sendai-based middle school trio Hayashi Ayumi, Morishima Otome, and Atsugi Itsuka have developed an increasing desire to become idols... 
 
(Source: wikia.com)","['Music', 'Drama']","Green Leaves Entertainment is a tiny production company in Sendai, the biggest city in Japan's northeastern Tohoku region. The agency once managed the careers of magicians, photo idols, fortune-tellers, and other entertainers, but its last remaining client finally quit. With the company on the verge of going out of business and in danger of having zero talent (literally), the president Tange hatches an idea of producing an idol group. On the brash president's orders, the dissatisfied manager Matsuda heads out to scout raw talent.
","Wake up girls is a series that was really low on my ""to watch"" list, and I think this is true for most people. As someone who loves to binge watch everything, I was waiting until the entire franchise finished, and I binge watched it. 
 
My Overall Thought: 
Some cool characters, ok story, good music, bad animation. 
 
Synopsis: 
Just the continuation from the ""beyond the bottom"" (not going to spoil it). However, we are introduced to a group of three girls that wants to become an idol. Job for the WUGs are steadily increasing, and are ready to put out their first album. 
 
 
Story: 
It was neither good or bad. Compared to the previous seasons, it felt lacking, but this is expected. It's hard to have a good story when you already develop your idol's story. The addition of the new 3 girls was refreshing, but it was nowhere close to revamp the story. I think this is why many idol anime end in 2 seasons, and WUG was no different. I don't think you can make another sequel with these characters. To me, this story felt more like the studio saying ""we gave up on WUG and want to create a new story in the future, so let us add some new characters for the future franchise"". 
 
Art: 
If you love watching the artwork (someone like me, especially if you can understand Jpananese and watches anime for the animation), I would not recommend this series. It got worse and worse over time. There were cut scenes that were too long, and I think it had to due with financial problem with WUG production. I think the overall rating would have been 8 if the artwork was better. Last episode was the only redeeming quality (it was really good). 
 
Character: 
I actually quite like the characters, but the character development is poor. We are introduced to some of I1 idol's problem (find out who yourself), and that was quite nice. However, I wish there were more to this. Also, alot of the characters disappeared from the previous seasons. For example, I was wondering what happened to bvex?  
 
Sound: 
Idol anime needs good songs. One thing I really liked about the songs in WUG is that all the songs felt like it was WUG (as they include this in the song). However, I felt that the songs were overused too many times, and it felt stale towards the end. I would rather have one new song being played, than have a repeat of 5-6 songs that WUG has already sung. Especially the last song they sang. I don't understand why the production team though it was a good idea to play the last live song before the actual finale. 
 
Enjoyment: 
It wasn't terrible. If I had my full attention to this anime, then it would have been a much lower score, but its not a bad anime to zone out of. 
 
Overall: 
I gave it a 6. But, this series did have potential. Nicer artwork, more funding, etc. Especially when there were some cuts that were okay for too long.

          
 
       Helpful “Wake Up, Girls!” (WUG) came out in 2014 without much fanfare. While it wasn’t completely unknown to viewers at the time, it was definitely not a show that many paid attention to. Marred by poor production values and a plot that failed to really shine against its competitors, WUG never really managed to be a major player in the idol anime genre.  
 
But nonetheless, it was a remarkable series in its own right. While more popular idol series like “The Idolm@ster” and “Love Live!” gave an idealized version of life as an idol, WUG always had a grounded approach in regards to how it represented its young idols. Life as a young star was not as glamourous as it seemed. It was a life filled with competition, stress, and bottom lines. Producers were not there to help their girls achieve their dreams. They were, for the most part, there to ensure that their stars were profitable and marketable. WUG’s willingness to show this side of the business stood out to me, which is why I have always been on the lookout for WUG-related media. 
 
So how does the “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” (WUGSS) fare? 
 
Not too well. 
 
Firstly, I will admit that I didn’t head into this new season with very high expectations. People who have read my review on the last entry of the series, “Beyond the Bottom,” will note that I had a rather low opinion of the movie. In my opinion, none of the entries that followed the original series were able to capture the feeling that WUG had. And unfortunately, it appears that this series is no different. 
 
I have a fair share of issues with this season, which is why I am not surprised to see that the show has had such low scores on MyAnimeList. 
 
Firstly, I thought it was impossible for the animation for the WUG series to get any worse. As I mentioned before, WUG had a rather poor production values, which I was hoping would be fixed when WUGSS came around. For whatever reason, the new animation team has not only failed to improve the animation quality, but has managed to make the art shoddier than before. One prime example would be the dance and singing sequences which, unsurprisingly, are the crux of any musical idol series. 
 
Rather than utilizing traditional animation for these sequences, we have been given CGI sequences that are ugly as hell. For those of you that have played mobile idol games like “Idolm@ster: Theater Days,” I am about to tell you that your mobile game boasts far better animation than this animation series. I understand that this may seem like I’m exaggerating, but the animation is so damn choppy for the CGI that I was beginning to worry that my monitor was beginning to lag. 
 
When you finally get to the fifth episode (assuming you last that long), you will begin to realize that the animation has devolved to the point that you are literally watching a glorified powerpoint. WUG has taken animation shortcuts before, but never on the scale of WUGSS, which has led me to believe that either the animation team was completely absent that day, or that they somehow ran out of budget and decided to take an Evangelion-esque approach to animation. 
 
If I had to sum up the story, I would say that it is just alright. There are glimpses of the harsh idol industry that was so well-captured in WUG, but those moments are few and far inbetween. Perhaps there’s more to the story, but at the time of this review, I have decided to drop this season at episode 5. I don’t expect the show to get any better in its remaining episodes. I would love to be proven wrong, but as of now, the show is not very good. If anyone reading this review would like to let me know if this show has gotten any better near the end, I would appreciate it if they send me a message sometime. I don’t expect much in any case. 
 
The only real positive thing I have to say would be in regards to the music and voice-acting. As always, the musical talents from the real-life Wake Up, Girls! Have come to bless us again with their catchy and phenomenal tunes. Although not as great as WUG’s opening “7 Girls War,” “7 Senses” is a decent opening song that lives up to its predecessors. It’s a shame that the opening animation is absolutely terrible. 
 
All in all, “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” is an example of sequel that fails to improve upon itself. Its poor animation makes the original look like a masterpiece, while its mediocre and forgettable story prevents it from being anything but missed potential. 
 
I can’t even recommend this to the most dedicated of WUG fans.  
 
I’d stick with the real-life Wake Up, Girls! if I were you.

One day, the dream world is being attacked by something called ""yumekui"" (""dream eater""), and many princes are being attacked by it. The heroine must wake them up to save the dream world, as the princes are unable to wake up due to having their dreams stolen. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"EARLY TL,DR: Do you play 100 sleeping princes (like I do)? You might actually enjoy this anime. Otherwise, be wary. 
 
STORY: 
As usual, it's your typical reverse harem in a fantasy setting. Don't expect anything groundbreaking as they don't really dive into the specifications of the heroine's powers, or the stats and skills of the princes, or the relevance of their typing, or anything that they do in the game. I feel like they could have referenced those more, as it would add at least more to the princes. The arcs are very straightforward and simple, I wish more could be done but given the time frame and the VAST amount of princes in the game, it would be difficult to accommodate. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
Other than Prince Avi and Kihel, the other characters don't really get a chance to grow to a big extent. I was a fan of several of the princes already shown, so I did enjoy the screentime, but them going away in favour of a new arc in a matter of 2 episodes just made me upset and longing to know them better, if that made any sense. 
 
SOUND: 
Didn't really enjoy the OSTs, they were really generic. BUT I do like that they implemented some of the music from the mobile game into the anime. 
 
ART: 
Basically, it's decent. Nothing extraordinary, but nothing I visibly cringed at either. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
Here's the thing- I'm trash for the mobile game. The reason I find myself liking this anime is because I love playing it's game equivalent. If I had not been a fan of the game beforehand and had not been attached to the princes ***CHARACTER NAME SPOILER*** (particularly Avi, Douglas, and Graysia), I would not enjoy this series. 
 
OVERALL: 
Honestly, taking out my own personal enjoyment it'd be around a 5.5-6 for someone who's not familiar with the franchise.  
 
Edit: If you're interested in seeing more of the princes, the shorts you can watch through the game itself give more personality and relationships to the princes- except the heroine princess isn't there.

          
 
       Helpful Basically Senjuushi without the shitty plot twist and it actually has a plot.  
The characters look nice, The animation looks meh, BETTER THAN SENJUUSHUI. And enjoyment is a 2/10. Its one of those animes when they air im like for fuck sake do i really have to watch this? Im not into dropping animes so i want to finish it. It seems like a shitty plot and it has the most cringe english name. Dont even look at the english name you'll instantly regret even comming to this page. 
 
All i can say is, Are you really bored and do you wanna fucking kill yourself? Go this. ( Or when this became a meme like SAO ofc )

          
 
       Helpful (I've never played the game, this review is in the eyes of someone who only watched the anime.) 
 
*Warning: Spoilers* 
 
Dreams are wonderful things. We can make anything fictional into reality in our dreams, we can go from here, to the ends of the universe in our dreams, even if we cannot remember them. 
 
In Yume Oukoku to Nemureru 100-nin no Ouji-sama, they took the dreams-can-be-taken-away-concept and made it into an absolute mess. 
 
This summer, my goal was to watch and rate every single otome game anime adaptation that's ever been made. I've cringed, I've cried, and I've wanted to die. But, no matter how bad any of those animes were, they weren't boring. They had a good concept, just portrayed terribly. But, Yume Oukoku isn't like that. Yume Oukoku is just, well. Boring. Very boring. Hell, they couldn't even stick with the story 50% of the time. (I'll go more into detail about that later.) 
 
Now, let's begin my review on Yume Oukoku. 
 
 
Story: 5/10 
In Yume Oukoku, a young girl (whom we never learn the name of cause they literally just call her Princess.) has found herself transported to another world. She is apparently the ""Princess"" that's supposed to awaken every single one of the boys inside a Royal Ring. Except, they literally only do it once. ""Why are they inside a Royal Ring?! @_@"" You may ask. Around whatever years ago every single prince from every country teamed up to attack the dream-eaters, but they have been sealed away into their royal families ring. From that, it sounds interesting, right? A young girl traveling across the world to save all these princes?! Well. They only save 1 prince, and the rest of the entire show is them traveling across the world helping princes who are supposed to be sealed away. They don't keep up with the story at all, it's boring. Honestly, in my opinion, I'd prefer it for them to go to awaken princes. 
 
Art: 4/10 
Honestly, the art, in the beginning, was really okay, I feel like as the show went on, it got lazier, messier, and awkwarder (is that a word?). When the shots would be from far away, their eyes would be too big, when we were close up their mouths looked out of place, or too big. 
 
Sound: 3/10 
I don't know if the room they were in was echoey, but sometimes the characters sounded really far away from the microphone, even in normal scenes. It was really distracting. 
 
Character: 3/10 
So, we have the normal personality-less female lead, we have the bubbly male lead #1, and we have the edgy male lead #2. The female lead was really annoying. Both male leads were annoying. I only tolerated like a character in this and it was that mermaid dude, he had like 3 lines but still had more personality than the mcs. 
 
Enjoyment: 4/10 
At first, I thought this anime was gonna be cute n cool, oh boy was I wrong. I ended up skipping through 4 episodes cause nothing plot development worthy was happening. Rather than having fun, watching this felt like a chore like I HAD to watch it. I was very, very bored. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
I think this anime had a lot going for it in the beginning, I feel like the team working on this got lazier as each episode passed, like they didn't wanna keep working on it like they were working on it cause they had too. This anime is very uneventful, boring, and cliched. I'd recommend you watch Meiji Tokyo Renka instead of this.

Cмотря первую серию, у меня сложилось впечатление, что идею слямзили с какого нибудь современного убого-флешевского американского мульт сериала, причем который шел относительно недавно на одном из российских каналов. Даж могу припомнить... По ходу его звали ""Бобобой"" или ""Робот-малыш"", как-то так, там тож пацан чисто случайно находит игрушку робота, а этот робот оказывается настоящий!!!!! И они вместе косят мировое зло направо и налево... Я не удивлюсь, если глав злодей окажется какой-нибудь злой профессор в круглый очках =)

       Helpful Okay guys, let's talk about HEROMAN, the current front runner for anime of the goddamned decade. 
 
So one day Stan Lee got up and said ""I bet I can put those crazy Japanese to work!"" 
And so he did. 
 
The result is HEROMAN, a throwback to old comic books, Saturday morning cartoons, teenage superhero shows and the 90's in general with glorious HD Bones animation. This shit is so nostalgic that when the overly elaborate commercial bumpers showed up I literally heard ""Heroman will be right back after these messages!"". This series is also most likely the most American(superior) anime ever produced. Taking place in CENTER CITY, CALIFORNIA, all the architecture, cars, people and etc are distinctly American. Like 30 seconds into the episode you see a traffic pile up, a Hummer, an oil refinery, several American flags, a garbage truck, a black person, a yellow school bus, Stan Lee having coffee, a most likely crime-ridden suburban neighborhood, a cheerleader, Flash Thompson and capitalistic toy commercials. I shed _tears_ when I saw that fucking school bus. 
 
But yeah, basically it's about this kid who's suspiciously similar to Peter Parker. He gets picked on by jocks. One day he fixes up an action figure, the action figure gets struck by lightning and BAM, there's a giant, scowling Captain America knockoff looking at him like ""the hell do you want, kid?"". Then they go save the day after the kid punches his giant wristwatch. This giant guy is the titular HEROMAN, and he basically has one setting: Punch the shit out of stuff. Perfectly fitting for the most American mecha since Megas XLR. 
 
Animation's obviously great. 
Music's great. 
 
The ED for this series is one of the best ever, because I know Stan Lee probably directed it. The whole thing is like a moving American comic book and you see Heroman playing baseball and the drums. It's just awesome as hell. 
 
Then we come to the one flaw, most likely put in there on purpose by bones to get back at Stan Lee for making them do this. The main character, Joey Jones, is probably the girliest male lead in any robot show ever. Noriko and Nono were infinitely more masculine than this kid. Don't know who those people are? Get the hell outta here and watch Gunbuster and Gunbuster 2, and in the mean time cry that you haven't already. But yeah, Joey is a woman. He has a girl's voice, he dresses like a girl, his body structure is like a girl and all of his mannerisms and movements are those of a girl. It's almost creepy to know that this kid is a male. I bet there's a collective terabyte of yaoi featuring him already, and that's just awful.  
But that's only on the outside.  As of two episodes in, Joey is a competent and almost hotblooded hero. No fear, no whining. Hell, the kid runs at the giant cockroach aliens right aside Heroman like a badass. 
 
Oh and his best friend is a cross between Tai Kamiya and Joseph Gribble. That's cool. 
 
Verdict: Get to watching. And also start watching Night Raid, House of Five Leaves and RAINBOW too.

Although Yozora Mikazuki faced a certain incident at the end of summer, the daily life of the Neighbor's Club goes on as usual. A strange nun, members of the student council and other new faces make an appearance, causing Kodaka Hasegawa's life to grow even busier. 
 
While they all enjoy going to the amusement park, playing games, celebrating birthdays, and challenging the ""school festival""—a symbol of the school life normal people live—the relations amongst the members slowly begins to change... 
 
Let the next stage begin, on this unfortunate coming-of-age love comedy!! 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Harem', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","Kodaka Hasegawa, a transfer student to St. Chronica's Academy, has found it difficult to make friends because of his mix of brown-blond hair (inherited from his deceased English mother) and fierce-looking eyes that make him look like a delinquent. One day, he accidentally comes across the equally solitary and very abrasive Yozora Mikazuki as she converses with ""Tomo"", her ""air"" (imaginary) friend. Realizing that they lack social lives and skills, they decide that the best way to improve their situation is to form the Neighbors Club (隣人部, Rinjin-bu), ""an after-school club for people with no friends like themselves"". Other students with various backgrounds join the club: Sena Kashiwazaki is an attractive but arrogant idol who has no female friends and treats the boys as her slaves; Yukimura Kusunoki is an effeminate underclassman who idolizes Kodaka and strives to become manly like him; Rika Shiguma is a genius scientist with a perverted mind; Kobato Hasegawa is Kodaka's little sister who generally cosplays as a vampire; and Maria Takayama, a ten-year-old foul-mouthed nun who serves as the club's advisor. The story follows their adventures as the club tries out various school and outside social activities as practice for making friends.
","It seemed like this anime doesn't have many reviews so I thought I might just add one to its number. And so Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT is... Well it's been a while since I finished it. Sometimes I go to my D drive to fish it out just to watch one episode so I still have fond memories of it and here are my personal thoughts. 
 
Story wise, it has practically none. You probably wouldn't be too hurt watching the anime jumping episodes (I never jump episodes. NEVER. Except with Suzumiya. They saw it coming.) There are small little parts of the story that really got me and it makes me super excited for a sequel. But of course, the story doesn't compare to it comedy (or at least I think that's how they planned it to be). Thoroughly funny for me I must say. 
 
Moving on to the art and sound, where there isn't much to say, it was good. Just good I guess. Art was above average but then again it's pretty new and can't compare to stuff like Kimi ni Todoke. Music was unmemorable. I probably skipped through the songs like most other animes but this anime left hardly any recollections of how it's like. I can only remember some slap bass lines and that's it. Tada. 
 
For characters... Well this can be quite a love hate thing. I've read other reviews saying how they hate Maria sensei who say poop every episode but I'm like... WHAT. I LOVED THAT KID. Her irritating voice kept me smiling and laughing always. She's crazy. And then the main characters are... Well the guy is hard to understand to be honest. Like most of them. You've gotta keep this in mind that hey, they got no friends yo! Not till the formation of the club. Do you know what it's like? I don't >.< Some might call Kodaka a spineless idiot, but I think he's really just genuinely scared and scarred. He's just playing dumb mostly... As for the girls... Again you've gotta try to understand where they are coming from... I love Rika. Period. She works hard, she plays hard and she's smart. And perverted. Bonus there. :D 
 
I enjoyed it. Thoroughly. It was good, but then that's me. But anyway, since you've watched (I'm assuming) the prequel, finish it. Especially if you didn't think it was bad. They wrote it well, that the prequel ends with Taka meeting Sora and that you've gotta catch the sequel to find out what's up. So please do!  
 
Thanks for reading my elaborate review. I'm trying to be really to the point and not poetic like some people. It doesn't serve the people man. Write your poems somewhere else >.< 

          
 
       Helpful Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT. Well, I have seen both seasons of bokusuku and after finishing this one I would say I liked it a lot better than the first season. In this season I think we get a much better understanding of the characters and what the story is all about. In the first season I feel the story was lost and the ""we have to prepare ourselves for the world of friends"" aspect was just an excuse for the writers to make up situations that added no real value to the show's overall theme. Bokusuku NEXT however was, I'm glad to say, much more focussed on both characters and story.  
 
What I keep asking myself as I write this review is -""what would I want to know if I was considering watching this show"", well I guess I would have liked to know that this anime really explores its characters, showing us their flaws and struggles as the show progresses. That it focusses alot more on young love and a fear of love than the first season did. I also thought that bokusuku NEXT was alot funnier than the original too and I put this down once again to the familiarity we gain with the characters.  
 
Lastly I would ask, ""would I recommend this anime?"" 
For slice-of-life lovers I would have to say yes. For comedy lovers, also yes. For people who are just in it for the fan service I would say yes again because it rarely isn't present (also something you may want to keep in mind if you're not comfortable with that stuff), but for any other people, people who like romance or drama or harem, I would say no. This anime, in my opinion isn't really main stream. Its not going to please everybody and not everybody is going to enjoy it. For a final statement I would have to advise that apart from the genres I listed before, comedy, slice-of-life and ecchi, this anime has little else to give. 

          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
When it comes to anime's getting sequel's it always makes me nervous depending on what it does to expand the story, luckily this is one of those sequels that was well worth it. 
 
The story continues with the Neighbours Club endless crusade to make friends and after the incident from the end of last series things have quickly gone back to normal, but more developments are in store for our dysfunctional club members. 
Now the story pretty much expands upon the first season as the club members continue to do activities that will hopefully make them acquire friends in the future and it obviously leads to more disputes and funny outcomes of those disputes, but the tone of this series is a little bit more serious especially when we get closer to the end this series because now the club members have gotten acquainted with each other and know more about each other which this series shows how much the bond between them has grown, that being said it concentrates more on the relations between Kodaka and the girls as they have gotten to the point where they have some form of attraction for him especially Sena and Yozora. 
 
The characters definitely get more development in this series as their relationship has grown so have their feelings for each other. 
Kodaka continues to be the blandish guy, but you see the reason for why he acts the way he is around the girls and why he continuously knocks down their advances on him because all he wants right now is friendship. 
Yozora and Sena continue to be at each other's throats with the pranks and arguments they pull on each other, the first season mainly picked on Sena during the argument, but in this season the tables have turned and whenever Yozora tries to do something to get closer to Kodaka it always blows back into her face which gave the chance for Sena to make her move, you also see that these two have gotten more used to each other as their relations with the other girls improves too. 
The other girls of the group get their own chances too, Kobato and Maria also improve their own relationship while Yukimura continues her journey of being manly. 
Rika actually has a bigger role this season as her technical skills help to create a movie the club was working on and you really see her true self during the final episodes when Kodaka wa avoiding the club for a certain amount of time. 
There is even new characters introduced like Kate who is Maria's older sister, she is more of a tomboy and acts pretty vulgar around Kodaka although despite acting like this she does care for her younger sister even though she won't admit it. 
Aoi Yusa is mainly a supporting character and isn't shown a lot, but she is Sena's rival when it comes to the test scores and hates how smart she is even to the point where she tries to shut the club down which luckily Sena steps in and stops it. 
 
The artstyle is actually a little different compared to the last season and the differences are apparent from some small details like Kodaka's hair has actually changed a little and everything looks smoother too, we also get to see the girls in more different outfits that continue to make them look good too. 
 
The fanservice in this series is also cut down a little bit compared to the last season which is a little disappointing since there are new longer any cheeky nip slips or exposed breasts and it instead goes for the option of using hair or objects to cover up the girls, but it doesn't impact the show a lot to be honest. 
 
The comedy was just as good this season as it was the last one hell I think the pranks on Sena went to new levels as the first episode literally started with Sena having a monstrous hairstyle just because the others said it would improve her character and the fact they were the ones who made her hair look like that in the first place. 
The Romance increased more in this series since the relations between the girls and Kodaka has obviously grown it mainly focuses on Sena and Yozora particularly Sena since it is revealed that she is an even earlier childhood friend of Kodaka's than Yozora was and because of this we see the development in their characters on how much Kodaka has impacted their lives and how much they care for him. 
 
Overall this was a fun second series and maybe there''ll be a third season to close it off hopefully considering the ending for this season, but from what I've heard in the light novels I think it's best to leave it as it is or maybe a Movie to close the story.

During their journey, they find themselves caught up in a conspiracy perpetrated by a mysterious organisation called Shadowlaw, both now face their ultimate challenge and must fight for their lives as they combat the evil M. Bison.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Shounen']",none,"Ahhh, ""Street Fighter II V""... this brings back memories! I watched this series (dubbed) in my ignorant youth when anime, to me, was all about badassery and hot blooded action. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this series: it had ""Street Fighter II"" connections, and the action seemed uber cool, making most western cartoon seem tame in comparison. Despite being vaguely aware of the corny-ness of the dub and the atrocious amount of reused animation, it was everything that anime meant to me at the time.  
 
Now, this trip down memory lane might seem out of place in a review, but (in addition to being self indulgent,) there's actually a point buried within my ramblings: while I now look back and acknowledge that this probably isn't a great anime, it's tricky for me to judge it properly through the rose tinted veil of nostalgia. So with that in mind, time to move on to the meat of the review. 
 
""Street Fighter II V"", unlike ""Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie"", is not a faithful adaptation to the storyline established in the games. In fact, it takes an approach not too dis-similar to that other ""Street Fighter"" movie, you know, that awful live action one featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. No, I don't mean that ""Street Fighter II V"" features Jean-Claude Van Damme (not as far as I know anyway). Nor Kylie Minogue. The two are similar in their treatment of Ryu and Ken - in both they're portrayed as a couple of brats running around causing trouble. Unlike that Van Damme movie though, the two of them (and not Guile) are still the main characters, and the series follows them on their journey to become stronger fighters, and gradually maturing in the process. 
 
Being a purist at heart, I wasn't initally keen on the story deviating so far from the one in the game, but I warmed to it - it ends up as a more sophisticated story than the original, which was only intended to be an excuse to have a brawl. The show's treatment of Street Fighter side characters is also a pleasant break from tradition: instead of just throwing them in cameo scenes, they get a lot more focus and are properly worked into the main story, giving them a greater sense of depth. The roles of these characters deviate somewhat from the original but not without certain similarities: here, Sagat is a former Muay Thai champ wrongfully imprisoned after refusing to cooperate with a crime syndicate; Cammy is a former MI6 agent turned mercenary assassin; Akuma is... well, he still only appears in cameos. Presumably, they couldn't find a role badass enough to suit a guy with flaming red hair and glowing, demonic red eyes. Most of the role alterations in ""Street Fighter II V"" work out pretty well, but inevitably there are some stinkers - Balrog's pretty damn lame, for one... he can't even fight! 
 
Character design wise, there are some puzzling changes - why does Ken have ginger hair, for example - and overall it's a bit of a mixed bag. Ryu and Ken aren't particularly interesting, but at least they get some development. Chun Li is annoyingly like a typical anime school girl, and Bison's psychotic personality is criminally over done - he must have spent over an hour of screen time doing his villainous laugh (which also creases his face up like a hundred year old coffin dodger) and another hour strangling people (to the point where I wanted to strange HIM). He features more towards the later part of the series, and as you probably guessed from my description just now, his scenes kinda dragged.  
 
The problem isn't just with him though - while ""Street Figher II V"" was never what anyone would call fast paced, it slows down terribly towards the end. The episodes are filled up mostly by the characters dicking around, such as Bison laughing, Ken having recurring nightmares, Bison laughing some more, etc. The amount of reused animation and general meandering completely kills off any tension the anime is trying to build up in the climax. It seems likely that by then, the series was desperately trying to stretch its shoe string budget and the over extended story to cover the whole 29 episodes... god knows why they needed so many when the material could barely cover 20. 
 
Some of the fights themselves can be quite good when they're not being prolonged/recycled too much. There are some thrilling moments and the anime makes good use of tricks such as colour inversion to heighten the drama of the fights. One major complaint I have is that the special moves from the games are used sparingly, some of them not at all, and some of the ones that are used are toned down to give the fights a more down to earth feel. It's all very good watching Ryu and Ken learning their hadoukens and dragon punches and whatnot, but the problem is, when you're watching an anime based off a fighting game and you don't see the characters pulling off their signature moves with a certain amount of regularlity, then something feels severely lacking. Perhaps this makes ""Street Figher II V"" more accessible to those who unfamiliar with the game, but it's a bit of a let down to those who are. After all, why else would I be watching this show? For the story?? 
 
It's hard to judge the audio department of ""Street Fighter II V"" fairly because I watched it in dub and the dub is very cheesey. Though it's possible that the original Japanese performances are better, at least some of the cheesiness is contributed by terrible script. In terms of music, the series has a few nice tracks, the most memorable of which is often played when Ryu is gathering up his hadou (some sort of spirit energy) - you know it's good when it can make these half hour training sessions tolerable. For the most part, the background music is handled well, though there were some very dodgy tracks that stuck out. 
 
""Street Fighter II V"" tries to find middle ground between satisfying fans of the game and those who know very little about it, and ends up not doing too well at either. But hey, though it has its share of problems, at least it doesn't suck sh*t like the Van Damme movie. Though I guess that's not saying much...

""There was a Street Fighter anime?"" I thought to myself when my sister had three Street Fighter DVDs in her hands; a Street Fighter movie and the complete first season of Street Fighter II: V. I watched the movie first; it was nothing special, and somewhat boring. A couple of weeks after that I started watching the anime. The theme song and opening was pretty lame... I would have preferred some Jpop or Jrock for the theme song over some sort of rockish song that's trying to be cool... and that opening sequence just went on and on... I was like, ""When does the show start?"".  
So the show started, and almost everyone's personalities were very suiting for their characters. The show had a few funny moments. There were quite a few cool fight scenes, and there was some pretty intense emotion a few times. When they introduced Vega... man, they did him perfectly. Vega and Ken's fight was pretty intense; the way how Vega stabbed his claws right into Ken's foot, and those brutal slashes he marked Ken's body with. I was hoping to see some of the Izuna Drops Vega does in the game, but then again the series used basically any special move as a huge deal. Who would have thought a simple Hadouken would be such an intense move? Anyhow, Vega and Ken's fight... That Shoryuken was beautifully executed. 
My main problem with the show was that they repeated scenes way too much... ESPECIALLY Ryu's practicing Hadou and Chun Li being hypnotised by Vega. Those things really interrupted some important parts of the show, which was very annoying. Overall a great show though, definitely worth watching. 

          
 
       Helpful A simple yet thoroughly addictive piece or work.I watched this a few years back,and have watched quite a few anime since then but few comes across as being anywhere near as entertaining as this is.Ryo and Ken are long time buds.Ken is the son of a rich billionaire father in the USA while ryu live a more humble life in Japan.One day after many years ryu gets a letter from his friend ken asking him to visit him.Ken decides that the two should ''hit the town'' and '' live it up''.While getting into a bar fight over a woman {surprise,surprise !}lol. they get the worst beating of their teenage lifes as their opponent shows them how pitiful their  skills truly are. 
 
They then decide to embark on a journey to travel the world and gain strength by fighting new opponents.Along the way they get themselves into all kind of trouble with gangs,internatinal crime syndicate and bad guys of all kinds. 
 
Now I know what you're thinking this is just another bad guy come,bad guy gets but kick,mindless beat em up right,Wrong .This anime is  fast paced entertainment as the fights scene are just awesome,every move is well choreographed and the sound affects gives the fights a intensity that draws you in. 
 
The characters  whether good are bad have their own unique style and individuality that makes them fun to watch.The cast are very realistic in their attitude and dont act strange or overly cutsey in a quest to come off as original.There is also some nice humour in this anime. 
 
The opening and closeing thems are the same,an energetic rock/techno beat that goes well with the feel of the anime and you'll just love to hear . 
 
The animation is also wel done,having good detail along with good background

On a bit more serious note this is too non-ambitious to get a serious critique. An otaku and his wife live together and try to deal with the differences between an otaku's world and a normie's world. 
 
It's too short, and oftentimes passing from one scene to the next without even a transition is kind of jarring, so maybe a bit more effort into making something more cohesive would help. 
 
No backstories, or little of it, and not much in the way of progression, but still, all I can say is that it's cute and that it deserves more.

       Helpful This is a cute, humorous, and ultimately heart-warming tale about the daily life of an otaku and his normal wife. This show has pretty strong sexually suggestive content so is probably best served to those over 16. It's an extremely short show, following the recently-popular 4-koma based approach with each episode taking three minutes, end credits excluded. Though simplistic in its execution and animation style, the story is pretty nice and the message even more so. Go ahead and give it a try, a sampling will only take you three minutes! 
 
Animation: 
As expected from shows of this length, don't expect the same quality as what you'd get in a full-length show. Backgrounds are grainy and characters are drawn with very simplistic shading. Despite the slightly comic-book based animation, this work is definitely targeted towards a more mature audience. Expect lots of suggestive references and even some tile mosaics. 
 
Sound: 
The show is heavily dialogue drive and uses BGM sparingly. It ends with a fitting and melodic ED as the couple enjoys each other's company in the tub. Surprisingly, the show has strong voice talent as we have Yukari Tamura voicing Kaoru. You even get Rie Kugimiya voicing a supporting character as well. 
 
Story: 
Each episode has a specific theme related to the particular title, but most of them revolve around a fairly ordinary daily event. What supposedly differentiates this show is that the husband is an otaku. All this really means though is that he will occasionally drop references that only anime veterans will understand (and obviously this doesn't include his wife). The story gets a large boost in the last few episodes as the story of how the two met and how much they mean to each other is revealed. 
 
Though short, this is a well executed and engaging story. 
 
Character: 
Both protagonists are pretty well explicated especially considering the length of the show. Expect some pretty good interactions and an especially nice surprise at the very of the show. 
 
Value: 
There have been a lot of short, 4-koma shows of late. This is probably one of the most engaging and interesting one so far. Though I won't go as far as saying that it has an analogous effect on the viewer as Usagi Drop, it is pretty positive nonetheless. Well worth the ~40 minutes to watch.

","You and Me is an anime that I really enjoyed. It was hilarious and had me laughing throughout. For me, it's one of those anime's that I want to watch again and again. It had a simple premise that was executed well. Really well. 
 
Story 
 
The story for You and Me is simplistic. Why? Because it's a coming of age story about 4 (5 later on) friends who have known each other since kindergarten. I feel that the story is told well because it shows us how they went from being really young and naive to old (not really old, only when they're teens) and mature. The story was not unique, but predictable. I do not find this a flaw for the story since I really enjoyed it nonetheless. You might find this a major flaw, but I personally don't. The comedy in the anime was really well done. I thought the bond between the characters helped with the comedy aspect of the story because it shows how close they really are. However, I have one flaw with the story. Well, not really focusing on the story overall but with the first episode. The first episode did not set good first impressions for me. I thought it was slow, dull, and boring. I thought that it would be an anime I would just forget and never watch ever again. I didn't even think I would complete the anime. Luckily, the episodes after episode 1 made up for that, so that's a really good thing. Overall, I really enjoyed the story of this anime. It had a rocky start, but it makes up with the future episodes. 
 
Characters 
 
I am not going to go over every single character and give my opinion on them. Instead, I'm going to go over the characters as a whole. All the characters in the anime were well-rounded. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. For me, it's your typical group of five guys: the smart one, the joyful one, the popular (or semi-popular in this case) one, the hyper one, and the silent yet funny one. This group to me is in no way a flaw for the characters. All of these characters are relatable in some way, which is a really huge plus for me. The supporting characters were great because they all helped the group in one way or another. I don't think there is an antagonist of any kind in the story. Then again, it's not that type of anime where you'll find a bad guy since it mainly focuses on our main five. Overall, the characters, both main and supporting, were great. All of them were well-rounded and really great characters. 
 
Art 
 
The style of this anime is realistic. Obviously, because it's slice of life. The art and animation in this anime were fantastic. But, then again, all of the anime I've watched so far had really great art and animation. That applies to this anime. There is not a moment in this anime where I thought that the art and animation was bad. This type of art style really fit the story because, well, what other kind of art style would it be? Well, actually a couple, but the realistic style fits it perfectly. There were no moments where I thought that the animation was breathtaking or remarkable. This is not a flaw because it isn't that type of anime. It just isn't, in my eyes. I am not sure if this is really a flaw for the anime, but I'm having a hard time trying to find the difference between the twins in the story. Yeah, that might sound really stupid, but it just was. It's understandable though because, well, they're twins. Clothing color was the only way they can get a difference between the two. Overall, I like the art and animation for this anime. There were no breathtaking moments in art and animation, but for me, it's okay for an anime like this. 
 
Sound 
 
I felt that the sound for the characters were very good. All of them sounded appropriate for the character presented. The background music for this anime helped make a scene enjoyable if it's happy and gloomy when it's sad. Not really really sad, just sad. I really liked the intro and ending songs, but it's not something I'll remember forever. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, but it's just something that you won't remember for the rest of your life. It's not that memorable. Overall, I thought that the sound for this anime was very good. 
 
Enjoyment/Conclusion 
 
Did I enjoy this anime? Yes. A lot. Like, a lot a lot. This anime had me laughing throughout. I think that other people will like this anime unless you're not into this type of anime. If you do not like comedy or coming of age stories, then I think this anime is not for you. If I showed this to a person that does not like anime, I honestly think they'll have mixed feelings about it at first because of the first episode. However, once they watch the other episodes, I think they'll really like it. I would re-watch this anime just because it was really funny. Not only specific episodes, but the entire series. Even the first episode. I personally do not like bad starts, but that's just me. You'll probably like the first episode. I didn't, so, yeah. Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and I'll recommend it to anyone, fan of anime or not a fan of anime. This is a really memorable anime that I will remember for quite a while.

What show doesn’t start off slow nowadays only for it to actually become better overtime? Unfortunately many anime viewers are impatient and if they don’t like what they see on episode 1 it’s dropped from their viewing schedule.  A good example for this would be the Fall 2011 series “Kimi to Boku”. It had to deal with the consistent comments of “OMG TEH GAY DO NOT WANT (an exaggeration but still..) and “It’s boring”. Now i can talk in depth about the latter criticism. As a hard-core slice of life fan, even i had the urge to call KtB “boring” after the first two episodes. It was almost too realistic: a group of high school boys doing what high school boys usually do. No mechas, no ecchi, no outlandish premise but an everyday look at a regular group of friends. For most people this is just too mundane to give a watch but if you’re open to a slice of life series or this series is your first slice of life experience then watch till episode 3 and then you can drop this series if it still bores you. The hero who saves the show from total boredom and who also breaths life into these group of mundane characters is the boy with the straw-colored hair: Chizuru Tachibana. Chizuru brings more energy to the show than the entire cast combined and it takes a bit to get used to his personality especially in contrast to the more easy-going twins Yuuta and Yuuki, effeminate Shun, and Kaname the typical megane character. But after a while, the show becomes so much better: the cast really works well together, the stories are more heart-warming and the music works really well at times. At times i want to call Chizuru a walking plot device but his own personality gives the show life which spreads to the other main characters in due time. The stories are very heart-warming and you may think “Oh, wow i did that too!”. It’s a series about high schoolers, so expect to relate to one of more of the stories presented in this series. 
 
What really surprised me had nothing to do with the anime itself but the company involved with the production of it. If you were to tell me a year ago that J.C. Staff was going to animate a slice of life series with an all male-cast, i’d laugh at you. J.C. Staff is the biggest abuser of the tsundere anime character and the mascot promoting such characters (Rie Kugimiya) and most of their works are criticized for being unfaithful to the original source, bad pacing or sub-par animation.  Most of their series are about tsunderes or moe characters with little or no originality (tell me Hidan no Aria doesn’t resemble Shakugan no Shana?) and i was really fearing for the worst with news of this adaptation.  
 
Luckily it seems that my fears were quickly dashed and i commend J.C. Staff for doing a great job with this series even if it’s obvious they didn’t really put a lot of effort into it: the production values aren't anything special, the occasional CG sakura petals notwithstanding, and the character designs take a bit to get use to but it's nothing horrendous of the sort. 
 
I really love the voice acting in this series. Yuuta and Yuuki’s voices are so scary similar you actually think they are voiced by actual twins but in reality kudos goes to Kouki Uchiyama (Yuuta) and Ryohei Kimura (Yuuki) for doing a splendid job. Of course the real star is Miyu Irino as the spunky Chizuru, balancing a tight line from being too dull and too annoying. Other notables are Toshiyuki Toyonaga (Shun, also Flit from Gundam AGE and Mikado from Durarara!!) and Yuuki Ono (Kaname, many minor roles).  The insert songs used in the series are also timed perfectly in most cases, and surprisingly the singer of those songs is a guy! But the real treat for me is the OP/ED: I really liked the cheerfulness of the OP with contrast with the more reminiscent feel of the ED. 
 
To wrap it up, Kimi to Boku was a sweet surprise that managed to pull itself out of the weak first two episodes to become a great watch for us slice of life fans and a good watch to anyone willing to give this show a chance. 
 
2011 was the year to not judge a book by its cover, and Kimi to Boku is one of the many examples of that rule.

          
 
       Helpful The most crazy reason why I've watched this series is because the seiyuu of Yuuta Asaba is Uchiyama Kouki which I really love that seiyuu. 
 
But sometimes when you watch an anime you would find new things that'll surely make you feel happy about it. 
 
The funny thing about this Anime Series is that it has a lot of characters that each have different stories and personalities. 
 
For me the story is 10. Because it's not that boring unlike all the High School Shoujo, shounen and Slice of life anime. The thing is they make people watch this anime because of the characters! They make them cute and have various behavior and complex to their lives. Their stories are very much like our lives right now. It kind of reflects each individual who watch this anime. This will make them understand themselves. Each human being have the personality of Kaname, Asaba Twins, Chizuru, Shun and etc. 
 
 
Art wasn't that bad and wasn't that a ""WOW"" factor because the art is really common in animes. But because the story is too damn amazing!! well,, I didn't really mind. 
 
Sound wasn't that good it was a little off but for me it reflects the whole series. XD but then it's the story and the character that matters in this anime. 
 
Character... well it's a ten because each character has their own way of showing their emotions. Watching 5 guys fooling around and talking about random stuff makes my day!! They absolutely made me laugh but I was touched as well. 
 
Enjoyment is a ten too because when you watch this anime it gives you random emotions and countless laughs! EVerytime a character makes a fool of himself the other also makes a fool of himself. Which is very interesting.  
 
 
Overall it is a nice anime and I hope for a good ending!

       Helpful It was hard to rate this one because I liked the concept but not the result. And there's a list of reasons why, and I'm going to be blunt. 
 
The story had little depth. The emotions portraryed were often uneven or strange and made gay or bi guys seem to be dumb whether they were complete ""bags"", silly or gutless or that it is necessary to apologize for loving someone of your own gender or its a mistake. The backgrounds of the characters were too brief. Conversely, when they do give some background, such as in the case of Madarame, the reptile guy, what they did tell was so mixed: sometimes sensitive, sometimes a total ass...made no sense (even though, yes I did get the madadurai/non-madadurai aspect) . Or he's abusive to others, the so-called tough guy, then he gets punked out and embarrassed himself and does nothing! I could understand some shaky parts, as far as story goes, but it it too uneven too often throughout. 
 
Yes, this is BL for those who can't have gay sex (m/m) themselves or don't really know about it or who don't care that it is even passably accurate in any way. Foreplay is a definition that should be reserved for hetero sex. Generally we don't need foreplay to want to do the deed. We can get it done and then do it again (especially at the characters ages), so the lamenting of ""wait for me next time"" is completely stupid and doesn't apply.  
 
That being said, I could get the comical aspects of some of the ""sex scenes"" but I entirely get tired of yaoi that tiresomely puts forth a guy will only have sex with another if they are raped, and that they like or accept it as normal somewhat or afterwards. And if it wasn't that, the scenes were boring. 
 
Shiro, the regular human, was especially boring to me though I liked the cat spirited guy out of all of them all, Norio. I could see where the idea of the storyline might be intriguingly different but so many ideas or suggestions was too sketchy, moving so quickly point to point: sex, conversations, confrontations: almost total incoherence. Most of the time I was asking myself, why characters were saying or doing a certain thing, because it made no sense! I didn't understand why it had this title either.  
 
A few laughs and cute moments provided by Norio, but as some others have had, nothing special and the frequent misrepresentations of gay love and relationships is totally unacceptable. Many bad messages, and hope no one believes that how gay love is or that its normal like these poor examples. Sex Pistols could have been so much more but was just too flawed in my opinion.

","What the ballocks is this?! Is this memes?! - Kyoukai no Rinne review 
 
Rinne is an anime adaption of the same author who wrote and illustrated the classic manga Inuyasha. However, Rinne quickly becomes a parody of itself and lacks the passionate writing of its fore sibling. It is completely undermined by lackluster characters, mediocre plot, and repetitive gags that quickly loses its substance. While I did have personal enjoyments throughout the show, it is far from redeemable. 
 
The premise of Rinne is quite simple. Our heroine, Mamiya Sakura, wanders into the spirit world and after coming back to the real world she can see ghosts. One day in highschool, a mysterious boy, Rokudou Rinne, shows up and their wacky adventures begin. Quite the opposite as it is usually the mysterious girl, but it doesn’t innovate anything. For the first few episodes they proved to hold potential. I genuinely giggled and enjoyed the type of gags it was going for. Throughout the show we’re introduced to some non immersive episodic episodes, especially when the character development is nonexistent and most of which are 1-2 dimensional characters. I’ll elaborate on characters later. Furthermore, one of the most essential/annoying plot lines in the story concerns Rinne’s dad, Rokudou Sabato, that doesn’t give any deeper insight to the linear story we’re given that ultimately concludes in disappointment each time there’s a new plot line that centers him as the antagonist. The money gag in the show is quickly overused and utilized way too much and forced. There isn’t one episode that does not focus on money at some point. Especially since it’s always shoved into your face trying to be funny and garner unwarranted laughs and giggles. There are quick lived moments that’ll reassure you and then demolish your mentality of any enjoyment you would like to have while an episode is still playing. I will give credit to the narrator for making the shinigami tools at least interesting enough to sit through the show. Yes, it uses the money gag, but it’s one element highly underutilized where many of its potential lies. And then it is quickly shoved as a money issue rather than focus more on how funny the actual tools can be used in circumstantial situations that the cast is in. 
 
I have to give credit where credit is due. The art and animation in this show is good and well done. It’s highly consistent and far better than its story counterpart. Some criticisms though is that the fight scenes are a little bit usually just weapon clashes and then it slows the motion down for a bit. That is not very interesting. I mean c'mon, Rinne is a shinigami. Let us see him fight with the powers and fighting capabilities of a spirit exorciser, then it will bring a balance to comedy and the action sequences it clearly failed  to do so. The voice acting offers quality as good as the art and animation. Music in Rinne I didn’t really notice too much, it doesn’t stand out as something I’d download myself. The first opening was good and represented the series faithfully, and then the second opening happened. It wasn’t the song but the animation were just ripped from the first opening and it felt lazy. It was unsynced and awkward that they did not match at all. Lazy. Endings are good as it is. 
 
Wow, now onto characters. Like gameplay is important in games, characters are the stronghold of a show. They are not at all great. Mamiya Sakura’s nonchalant nature at times are on point and others it is used in scenes unbalanced with the current moments. It quickly turns many scenes into bland oceans filled with dead Sea Bass. When she does show her sincerity and compassion, it’s always a short fuse that is quickly outlived killing the buildup of actual character development shown in our faces. Rinne had potential. I felt like a little tweaking to his character or at least not make him focus so much on his money problems, then maybe he may have been a much better protagonist. He doesn’t show much range in his character. For someone who has so much potential, for instance, being a shinigami, in debt, and issues with his dad, it is all proven to waver in weakness of the rest of the weak cast. Another main cast member, Juumonji, never changes at all. Or at least have a higher understanding of his friends. Nope he’s your everyday ‘holy ash’ character. Additionally as to being very in love with Sakura, not even that helps his overall character design. Ageha has it the worst of all. Being so obsessed with Rinne, Ageha so pathetically tries to attract his attention in comedy that clearly is one forceful, two generic as fuck, and three annoying as fuck. That’s all there is, and Rokumon is just Rokumon.  
 
The episodes with Kain and Masato are completely lacking in the seriousness they try to convey, specifically concerning Kain with Sabato. Rokudou Sabato is the main antagonist of the series, but all he is there is to be a fuck boy. That’s it. A fuck boy. And Ageha’s sister, Bijin, to simplify it, she basically falls in love with Sabato and that’s it. She ends up just an ignorant and stupid character. That’s as far as those guys gone in the first season. And I hope for Buddha’s sake, they eventually do more than the one dimensional crap that they are and do. 
 
There are too many key elements in Rinne that falls apart deeply into the pits of Hades’ underworld. The beginning episodes moved on strong, it displayed what we were getting, but never improving itself. Gintama is an anime that proves to evolve itself even if it brings up old jokes from time to time like justaway and Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, is because it’s utilized uniquely and in appropriate story bits. But that all rarely happens. I sorry to Gintama for even making that comparison. This show earns a little respect for not pissing me off so much. And that is why Kyoukai no Rinne earns a 5/10, it’s mediocre. The writing of the story, characters, and overall development disappoints highly, but still holds intricate moments at times as well as the beginning episodes that holds it very strongly. This isn’t something I can recommend because of its repetitiveness and what I’ve stated above. I’d say you check it out only if you’re a huge fan of Takahashi Rumiko, but even still you’re going to be have a terrible time.

Short Summary: 
Sakura Mamiya, a main character of the series disappears once when she was a child. She came back safely but returned back with the power to see ghosts. 
Now as a teenager she has gotten tired of seeing ghosts and wished they would leave her alone. At school, next to Sakura is a desk that has been empty since the start of the year and one day out of nowhere the classmate who sits there shows up! 
Just who is this person?? 
 
Soooooooo, where to start? 
 
I guess I enjoyed this series. Although I'm worried about the fact that there are a lot of young ghosts in the series. I mean does a student die everyday or something? That fact was in my head the whole series and it really bothered me.... 
 
But other than that, the series is fun to watch. 
 
There's romance and A LOT of comedy in the show. As can be seen with my scoring. 
 
The art didn't give off that ""modern"" anime feel either; so it was nice to watch. 
 
If you like comedy and solving ghost cases why not try this show?

          
 
       Helpful The story is not really original or complex, it is another Rumiko Takahashi works, and that is the best and maybe the worst you can say about this anime. If you enjoy Ranma, Inuyasha or Maison Ikkoku then you would probably enjoy this new work, otherwise better try to look for something else. It has the same kind of comedy, similar drawing style, similar kind of romance... this anime make me feel like watching a 90s anime, I mean the drawing style is old, characters as well give me a feel of old style (that  do not correspond to the typical cliches that we find on 80% percent of current anime) and  besides it lacks of recurrent ecchi and fan service, (which is for me a good point but I think many people disagree about this). I personally find the characters very cool and funny, story is very slice of life so most of time every episode is a new story and general development is very slow.... but come on is a comedy, ?what are you hoping for?. I am a bit old generation and I find Rumiko style very enjoyable, but maybe new generation are not fit for this old style and probably that explain why Rinne is so poorly rated by the community in MAL, but if you are not a Rumiko hater then you should give it a try, Rinne and Mamiya deserve it.

       Helpful I like how Minami-ke Tadaima begins each episode with a brief commentary: 
""This story is a simple illustration of the three Minami sisters and the ordinary life they lead. Please don't expect too much from it."" - Minami Chiaki. 
 
Just like all the previous seasons, fans of Minami-ke should be familiar with how it begins an episode with one of the characters commenting along those lines and that's essentially what Minami-ke is entirely about;heartwarming slice-of-life revolving around three plain girls with very lighthearted jokes delivered throughout the entire show. Alas, this season is one you shouldn't ""expect too much from it"", just as Chiaki said. 
 
With no story or focus on whatsoever, Minami-ke Tadaima is the latest follow-up, fourth season in the Minami-ke series, however, it does not require the viewer to have watch the prequels in order to understand the storyline(because there really isn't any) or know the characters(because they already provided introductions for most characters). Comedy presented in Tadaima is very light, so don't expect yourself to burst out in laughter. Apart from a few chuckles, Tadaima's sense of humor is random sadly, its bland and unimaginative. Even so, Tadaima is relaxing to watch. 
 
Like all seasons of Minami-ke, Tadaima also had undergone a refresh regarding its artstyle. Okaeri, Okawari and the first all had different artstyle. This season's new art is good, however, its none too special or memorable. Just one's personal opinion though, I still find Minami-Ke's first season was far superior compared to any of the other seasons, in terms of humor, OP and ED and rewatchability, just the artstyle looked pretty dated. 
 
Characters are pretty much unchanged; Kana remains to be the naive, energetic middle sister. Chiaki being the youngest but has more brains than Kana does, and Haruka being the motherly-type. There's almost no character development throughout the seasons so far. On that final note, most of them are still adorable as ever and to be more specific, there wasn't a character I disliked. Hosaka remains to be the most eccentric and funniest character in the whole series.  
 
Ultimately, Minami-ke Tadaima was an decent show for me. On the plus side, the charming characters remained intact, has solid visuals and also can be relaxing to watch but regrettably its sense of humor has gone stale. Some people may even consider this to be the weakest season. Nonetheless, Minami-ke Tadaima should appeal to slice of life junkies, but for anyone looking for good laughs, stay away.

Time passes, and Sisters Yui and Rena live a peaceful life in the Enastoria Empire, but they become involved in a vortex of destiny when a giant robot attacks Enastoria.
","Warning: the following review may contain spoiler. 
 
Regalia: The Three Sacred Stars was surprising in a good way, however that doesn't really change it from what it is, although it does make it more tolerable. 
 
Regalia is a show about aliens who come to earth but they look exactly like humans and then some of these aliens can transform into mechas and be piloted by another alien that they are paired with except for the protagonists which are a pair of an alien mecha and a human pilot.  
Now Regelia sounds like a generic mecha anime, it even takes place in a monarchy like a lot of mechs tend to. However the aliens and pilots are all girls and they're also all moe which makes for a rather interesting combo of genres here. 
Now the story goes that currently a new empire is ruling but there use to be an old empire, the remains of the old empire are its old queen, the queens little sister, the butler of the house and a mysterious young person, I say person because even now I have no idea what gender this person is, I'll just go with boy for simplicity sake but note that I can not confirm ‘his’ gender. 
Now early on we learn that member of the old empire like the mysterious boy named Johann and the butler like dude Jonathan Marshall use a small sphere object in order to summon a mecha for them to pilot without the need of an alien to do it for them. 
The old empire starts its attack on the new empire with the goal of reclaiming what they lost and so the queen finds out that her big sister has actually been an alien this whole time and can turn into a mecha and the two fight back against the old empire. 
We also meet other aliens who are there to help and support our protagonist and also those aliens that are there to work against them. 
The story is about as generic as you can get for a mecha but the cute girls do help it a lot in terms of enjoyment, it's easy to just look at all the cute girls and be happy with that. 
Which brings me to a common criticism I see towards Regalia which is that the fights in it aren't very good, now first of all most of the people I saw with this complaint were not very far in and I'd say the last few fights are actually really solid but even without that it all has to do with expectations. 
Most people who watch mecha anime are expected there to be some cool fight scenes, because mecha. However I feel like while this is an anime with mechs in it and a generic mech like story set up it it doesn't do very many mecha things aside from the set up and of course having fights.  
It's main draw is the cute girls and at times I feel like I'm watching a more generic moe show, it's very rare that it actually goes full slice of life nothing happens kinda stuff, but it defiantly has a weird blend of that with mecha that causes it to just kinda be cute girls doing cute things and for some reason mechas are there. 
Overall though I like this, if you've read some of my reviews namely the New Game! review then you would know that I like cute girls doing cute things so this was able to make me actually enjoy a mech anime since more often than not I dislike them with this and Evangelion being the exceptions to that. 
(Note: I’m not comparing this to Evangelion, those two are so far apart from each other in so many ways, it's just that both are different enough for normal mechas to make me enjoy them, but for very different reasons) 
 
The shows animation is nothing special, it's about what I expected and doesn't really do anything neat or cool looking, the transformations into mechs happen within a sphere so you don't actually see it happen they just go from alien loli to alien mech in an instant. 
Oh yer all the ones who can become mechs are Lolis minus one who's a dude and even then his stuck in his mech state and also can't move, so he's basically dead but not really.  
The voice acting is actually really good and that's cause this shows got a lot of talent behind it with people like Sakura Ayane, Touyama Nao, and Yurika Kubo. The others are also great but I'm just giving you an example of what kinda talent we got here and also my super bias comes into play because Yurika Kubo. 
But despite the great voice acting it's not exactly memorable or special, none of the characters have voice tweaks or anything super interesting to say, I don't remember how anyone sounded and that's at no vault of the voice actors it's just how it is. Which is a flaw of the show as a whole though. 
The opening and ending theme are also super forgettable so I can't even talk about them since I don't remember them at all. 
The background music is also a mess of stuff I don't really remember. 
 
Yuinshiel Astoria, or just Yui is the protagonist and queen of the new empire despite still being a school girl. Also despite being a schoolgirl someone ask for her measurements while she's giving a briefing to the nations and guess what, she actually says them, however we as the audience doesn't get to hear what they are.  
Yui is a human girl and she has one of the loli aliens living with her, she however thinks that Rena, the loli alien, is her older sister. 
Older sister because Rena being the alien that she is was born looking like a loli and thus stays that way for her entire life, it seems to be that the aliens are just born at whatever age and keep that body appearance and size for there entire lives. 
So when Rena come down to earth and Yui's mum took her in and made the two sisters she didn't know that Rena would not physically grow in any way and she died before finding this out. 
This leads to the classic Rena is the older sister but she's small and Yui is the older looking and much more mature and dependable but younger sister that a lot of anime likes to do since K-On did it and that was popular. 
I have no gripes with K-On but seriously guys it's over done now and it doesn't even change anything, like in this its just a throw away thing they do once and then it never really matters again if she's younger or older. 
In K-On it had reason and purpose and actually affected events and how things played out, okay, enough ranting. 
Overall I actually like Yui enough, she's nothing special really. She looks nice but her voice acting isn't anything special and overall she doesn't do much, at multiple points in the show she fails to be able to do anything without Rena. 
At one point when Rena has to go away she basically is forced to do nothing but hide and whenever Rena loses control (because she's bonding with a human and not another alien) Yui is never able to regain control of the mecha or stop herself from the danger she's in from being stuck inside, instead Rena will either wake back up or the alternate Rena with red hair will come in and deus ex it. Funny thing she's actually called deus ex, or was it just deus, either way it's funny. 
 
Tia and Sara Kleis are two aliens that are bonded, Tia is the loli who becomes a mech and Sara is the pilot. Sara is also the best because Yurika Kubo. 
I really enjoy Sara and Tia for one very obvious reason, they're freaking adorable. The two work off each other very well which makes sense since they're actually sisters and look very similar, they do have a third I sister however she was captured and put under the control of Johann. 
Tia and Sara came to earth in search of Rena and Kei (the other loli alien) they find Rena rather early and once they meet up then Tia/Sara and Rena/Yui always fight together as a team. 
Pretty obvious at this point that the three loli aliens are the three sacred stars mentioned in the title of the show, for a majority of the show Rena and Tia have no idea about this power and even if they did they wouldn't be able to activate it without Kei.  
Tia and Sara are a little bit of comedic value, they of course have there importance and when they need to they can fight just as well as the others but they have the most silly moments, some slapstick and are just off in the background messing around sometimes. 
Like when everyone finds the alien dude who is stuck as a mech and can't move, Yui and Rena are off talking to his wife who is explaining how he ended up like that and then as we hear her explain we get a shot of Tia and Sara playing around on the mech and Tia sliding down one of the arms. 
Either way these two are cute and when they need to they can defiantly fight along with the rest of them, I like them a lot. 
 
So who is this Kei, well she's the third alien loli that's also a mech. She's actually under control of Johann but in a different way to Tia and Sara's sister, Kei is under his control without having to be chained into her mech form without a pilot.  
It's not fully explained what it is that caused this we just know that Kei is hooked up to a machine and Johann runs an experiment on her in order to gain control of her, he goes directly against what anyone thought he was going to do in order to do this and as a result Kei’s older sister (who I think is also a human pilot) Ingrid is forced to follow Johanns orders. 
For a majority of the first half of the show Kei doesn't say much as she's actually just a lifeless shell of her former self, during this time Ingrid also doesn't say much but she definitely does more talking then Kei who might as well not be there for how little she does in some episodes. 
However after a battle of Johann and Kei/Ingrid vs. Tia/Sara and Yui/Rena which is one of the best fights in the series spanning quite a few episodes, Ingrid is able to get Tia and Rena to enter some kind of separate realm and then due to there connection to Kei. 
Them being the three sacred stars and all, allows them to break her out of the mind control right before she's about to shoot Ingrid. Which by the way was actually an extremely powerful moment, I almost cried during it because Kei hold the gun at Ingrid and before she's about to do it a tear rolls down her check because the real Kei trapped inside doesn't want to do this, a very powerful moment. 
I will say it would of been more powerful if she had actually done it and then had to spend the rest of the series dealing with that fact but I digress. Once broken out of Johann's control and it coming to light that he was the real mastermind the whole time and despite Ingrid being the queen of the old empire she never actually wanted to overthrow Yui and was fine to just find a new role in society as it was. 
Ingrid is actually a really deep and a cool character, she has so much guilt and responsibility on her shoulders and with the help from the others and the real Kei she finally starts to try and be happy again. 
Also this is a good to mention that a side character named Retsu has her very faith in a god restored at the sight of Kei. It's a really weird but funny scene and I like the idea of Kei being so adorable that Retsu goes from being an atheist to a believer in some god. 
Either way Ingrid looks way older than Sara or Yui so she actually almost looks like a mum to Kei, these two are really cute together regardless and have some of the most powerful moments together, plus with the three alien Lolis assembled they get to all form together like the power rangers and form a mega mech which they use to win the final battle, but that also involved some confusing BS with deus. 
 
Then we have Johann, who at the start doesn't seem like the main villain. Marshall clearly seems to be in a higher position and we know Ingrid is the queen of the old republic, it's really not right until Kei is freed that we fully learn what has been going on this whole time. 
It's actually a pretty good twist and later on there's like multiple Johann that show up, like one dies and then another shows up and he jumps off and a cliff but then there are like 10 of him.  
Me and my friend who I watched this with has a series “ahhhhh” twist reaction and I liked that it was able to that, as I said this show was really surprising it's defiantly exceeded my reputation. 
So at first we think the enemy is the old republic but it's really just a cover up that Johann is using in order to be able to act out his schemes in the background without seeming like the main leader and also hide behind the idea that it's just the old empire wanting its power back.  
I gotta say I do feel bad for Marshal, he died pretty early on being killed in his fight with Rena/Yui however he made it clear that he died happy cause he was helping Ingrid and the old empire with its ultimate goal however in the end he was only following Johann’s orders just though Ingrid since he had absolute control of her. He died fighting for what he believed in which was whatever Ingrid wanted, however he just needed up being a pawn in Johann’s game and overall didn't really do anything for either side. 
Although I will note that Johann has a weird mech, in the final battle when he enters his final form the mech has a very long and phallic object in a very specific place and it's also what the girls hit and destroy in order to defeat, just gonna say… It's weird. 
 
Overall despite Regalia being a mess in its genre and kinda shooting itself in the foot by being a mecha anime that panders to a very different kind of audience I actually enjoyed it a lot. 
The story is extremely generic and the presentation is nothing special outside of the voice acting but the characters are fun and I enjoyed my time with the show. 
When it comes down to it, if I'm able to enjoy a show and have a good time watching it despite it flaws then that's pretty good. 
After all I sat through the whole show and for the most part had a good time, I watched it with a friend which may of made it more fun and thus is adding some extra bias but overall I don't think it's affecting the score too much since I did actually enjoy watching it and not just the events surrounding the watching of it. 
Plus my real bias comes from Yurika Kubo being in the cast. 
 
Overall a 7/10 mainly for the hella good time I had while watching despite its flaws.

          
 
       Helpful This show wanted to be everything, and failed at all fronts. This show wanted to be a mecha anime, wanted to be cute, wanted to be """"""""""""""""political"""""""""""""""", wanted to be SoL, wanted to introduce some mythical """"""""""""""""lore"""""""""""""""". Unfortunately, it failed at all of these (except for being cute, thanks QP-Flapper). 
 
The premise seems to be good in paper. Unfortunately, the execution is terrible, the plot development is terrible, the script is terrible and the characters are underdeveloped. Aside from Yui, Rena, and Ingrid, I barely knew any of the other characters, and they barely made an impact on the show. The worst offender of which are Tia and Sara, which have no personality beyond some assembly of tropes whatsoever. At points during the final confrontation with the villain, the protagonists are spewing cringe-worthy shit, whatever the villain is saying stopped making sense and the I stopped caring about the whole thing.  
 
Since the name of this show is ""Regalia: The Three Sacred Stars"", I'm going to give this show a 3 stars out of 10.

          
 
       Helpful I liked the artwork and fight scenes in this anime and i really liked to appearance of the characters. but unfortunately that doesn't make up for the bad story. 
 
The big problem comes from the way the story is structured. At the beginning of the story it feels like the writer was trying to make it a slice of life anime mixed with mecha fighting and it just felt very awkward. the personality of the main characters were never really developed properly. They just introduced far to many characters. and split the dialogue between to many characters at once. not giving you enough time to feel any sort of connection to these characters. 
 
there were  far to many fighting scenes an this anime. The writer of this story was just trying to do way to much at once They split half the anime into fighting scene's they split half the anime into discussing the lore of the world(poorly). But they spent almost no time developing the characters personalities.  The fight scenes were not as dramatic as they should have been because the characters were not developed properly, so you couldn't really feel the tension when the characters were in danger because the writer didn't make you feel a connection to the characters to begin with. 
 
The main villains motive for wanting to kill the others was very silly. I can't really say more then that because it spoil the story

9,10165,85,6.016604457,A group of people living together,Nichijou,"Nichijou  primarily focuses on the daily antics of a trio of childhood friends—high school girls Mio Naganohara, Yuuko Aioi and Mai Minakami—whose stories soon intertwine with the young genius Hakase Shinonome, her robot caretaker Nano, and their talking cat Sakamoto. With every passing day, the lives of these six, as well as of the many people around them, experience both the calms of normal life and the insanity of the absurd. Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in  Nichijou .  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen']","Nichijou follows the everyday lives of various people in the town of Tokisadame, centering on the energetic Yūko Aioi, the bright and cheerful Mio Naganohara, the quiet and deadpan Mai Minakami, the anxious android Nano Shinonome, her young creator the Professor, and a talking black cat named Sakamoto, along with an ensemble cast of characters. Random and/or outlandish events regularly occur throughout the series, mainly through the mundane situations each character goes through.
In the anime series, Nano receives the most prominent story arc out of all the characters; the first half of Nichijou involves her desire to become a student in high school, while the second half deals with her fear of being exposed as a robot while at school. Vignettes which are mostly unrelated to the main focus of the series are placed throughout each episode, some of them adapted from another manga by Arawi, Helvetica Standard.
","Overview: 
 
This is an anime that I went into with high expectations. I was told OVER and OVER online that this was one of the funniest anime series to ever exist! I don't think I laughed once. I'm not just saying that I didn't get any sidesplitting laughs out of this, I don't think this series made me smile more than 2 times! Nichijou is certainly a series with an outstanding online reputation, but in this case I don't feel that the reputation was well deserved.  
 
Background: 
 
Nichijou was actually a bit of a flop in Japan and wasn't able to build a large Japanese fandom. However, it became a massive hit on the English speaking internet after 4chan latched onto it. For the last 3 years, Nichijou fans have been to /a/ what the bronies are to /b/! They are an absolutely devoted cult that recycle the same tired image macros OVER and OVER and team up the attack anyone that doesn't worship this piece of shit. Much like the Bronies, it is very difficult to tell how many actually like the show and how many embrace it entirely out of irony. Considering Nichijou is a comedy that is less funny than dropping a hammer on your big toe, I would say the latter is likely. Most of the humor consists of Japanese language puns and wordplay that doesn't translate well to a non-Japanese audience and even Japanese audiences didn't like it! This places Nichijou in a similar humor category as Vampire Holmes, which I also hated. The rest of the humor is ""uber moe UGUUU"" BULLSHIT, and tired slapstick gags that were old when Charlie Chaplin used them in the 1920s. 
 
Story and Characters: 
 
The story is simply the everyday life of a group of schoolgirls. Nichijou seems to borrow elements from both Azumanga Daioh and Cromartie High School without ever coming CLOSE to achieving the same level of humor and charm. A portion of this was that Azumanga and Cromartie had hilarious characters, while Nichijou just has really obnoxious characters. If I had to compare Nichijou to another anime it would be Lucky Star, but a version of Lucky Star that toned down all the anime and gaming references, leaving only the most mundane topics like finding a skirt that fits. Each of the characters fits into a well established archetype, but that alone doesn't explain why it's so bad. The Italian ""commedia dell'arte"" plays recycled the same stock characters and still won over audiences with their farcical humor. It is the combination of bland characters, linguistic humor lost in translation, tired gags, and horrible comedic timing that all come together to make this show a nearly un-watchable clusterfuck. If the show told a purposely bad joke and stretched it out until it became awkward for the audience, that would actually get a few laughs. When used right even ""dead air"" can be a useful comedic tool. Consider the opening of the famous comedy movie ""Spaceballs"". The joke is that the ripoff Star Destroyer is absurdly long in comparison to the ones in Star Wars, but that alone wouldn't be funny. It becomes funny because it just keeps going...and going...and going until the audience laughs because they don't know how to react. Nichijou just hits the audience with one bad joke after another in rapid succession like a machine gun of FAIL. 
 
Animation and sound: 
 
Here is where Nichijou got its points from. The opening theme is at least kind of catchy and the animation has moments where it shines. Having said that, I fucking HATE the art style of this series for taking even ""moe"" to a new rock bottom. 
 
Overall: 
 
If you want to tell other people online that Nichijou is great in order to fit in, go for it! However, I warn you to NOT actually bother watching Nichijou yourself because it is a massive waste of time. There are few experiences more annoying that watching a horrible comedy with no laughs. Avoid this anime like the plague!

          
 
       Helpful Maybe there is more than one series called Nichijou as going into this seeing how much it is raved and fawned over I expected a lot more, and instead I dropped it after barely 6 episodes and really didn't like it at all. 
 
I completely agree with Japan on this one and think the West have got it wrong I just found this completely unfunny and felt it really tried too hard in that regarded and for me it completely failed in that respect. 
 
Obviously everyone has a different sense of humor, so that is probably where the difference in opinions lies but still seeing people going on about a second series and how great it was, seriously get over it this series went over really badly in Japan...so your never getting your second series and honestly the news of a dub for this series (which is now fairly old) boggles my mind, guess they think there is some kind of audience out there for it.

          
 
       Helpful Being a KyoAni project, the first thought that came into my mind when I saw the cover art for Nichijou was that it is going to be a comedy/slice of life filled with cute girls doing cute things. Luckily, there's much more to this anime. Nichijou is a sketch comedy, with a sprinkle of slice of life, set in a junior high school. While the title in English is ""My Ordinary Life"", Nichijou is full of the extraordinary.  
 
There are two main plot threads going on throughout Nichijou. The first follows the trio of Yuuko, Mio and Mai as they try to get through the year at school. The second follows the Professor, her cat, Sakamoto and her robot, Nano as they attempt to run a working household together. Alone, these stories are enough to carry the series. However, this is a sketch comedy with recurring characters. A feature of sketch comedies with recurring characters is that each character gets their own story. Hence, Nichijou manages to have many short stories throughout the series involving many of the side characters in addition to the main ones. This means that, unlike what most people say, Nichijou has a lot more plot than people realise. 
 
Upon initial viewing, it takes a while to get accustomed to the style of comedy. However, after being acclimatised to the randomness and energetic scenes, the show will become enjoyable. Of course, comedy is going to be reliant on one's sense of humour, so if this isn't down your alley, then it won't work. But for the majority of people most sketches in this show will hit the mark and have everyone laughing. The sketches themselves are mostly based around usual occurrences at schools, for example, forgetting one's homework or having a crush on a guy. However, Nichijou is also willing to go to the extraordinary with situations like the school principal fighting a deer or the ""tsundere"" trope being taken to the extreme where she uses missile launchers instead of the usual ""B-BAKA!"". By setting the tone early, this series manages to not only feel like these sketches belong together, but the stories themselves intertwine as each episode progresses. 
 
The technical aspects of the show help sell the comedy. The animation flows extremely well, which is quite surprising for a comedy, but it allows for the slapstick scenes to be as high octane as the creators want it to be. There isn't much of a soundtrack to the show, however the sound effects add to each scene well. One of the drawbacks is that each character's design is quite similar, especially for the girls. Almost all of them have the same body shape and face, where the only differences are the hair style. Also what can be a negative is when the girls get into shouting matches that their high pitched voices can be quite intense. 
 
Overall, the best part of Nichijou is the world it creates. The characters and setting are fleshed out well and feel like a real place; even with the bizarre events that occur frequently. The show isn't just all comedy; there are many touching moments throughout which helps one empathise and connect with the characters while perhaps teaching a few lessons on being a good friend. That's not to say it's a tearjerker, but it will remind viewers of the troubles they went through in high school and how they dealt with it. However, the show's message is quite basic; friendship can make everything fun and can help people get through difficult times. 
 
I would recommend this show for everyone who enjoys lighthearted anime, but it must be noted that one's sense of humour must be considered first before deciding whether to watch the show. For people that do enjoy a comedy set in a high school and full of energy, Nichijou is a must watch. Now I join the many fans who are hoping for a second season.

About Corpse Party: Missing Footage, it represents a slice of life mini-episode showing every character we met in the main story. Ironically, it gives more screen time and information about useless characters. I might sound harsh saying so, but it was plus or less the case. Indeed, we kinda knew nothing beside relations between characters. That made me having trouble feeling empathy, fear or pain for those (except for Yuka, who finds a terrible fate). 
 
This OVA was no more but an introduction to the 4-episode anime/OVA that brought blood, guts and horror. It should be watched before watching Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou.

It's okay. This short OVA that takes place before the main 'series' 'Corpse Party; Tortured Souls' is just okay. It's nice to kinda have a bit more insite to the characters and their relationships prior to the events of the main 'series', this just kind of bored me. It's fine as a short prequel, but they could have made it a little more interesting in my opinion. 
The story is just them going about their mundane lives, which is fine and well, but honestly, was rhis even needed? Yeah we get the insite of their relationships, but the subtle hints in the main 'series' does that well enough.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","One day, a massive horde of flying saucers appears out of the depths of space and launches an invasion of the planet Earth. Despite the best efforts of the world's militaries and the Earth Defense Force under the Japanese Commander Oka, simultaneous deployments of the invaders' fleets of well-armed and highly mobile flying saucers devastate key strategic targets around the world and completely overwhelm the defenders. The invaders are aliens from the imperial planet Boazan, fighting under the command of the Boazanian emperor's ruthless nephew, Prince Heinel. With their victory all but assured, the Boazanian commanders retire to Castle Heinel, a secret underground citadel constructed by their agents in preparation for their conquest, and deploy the massive bio-mechanical ""Attack Beast Knight Dokugaga"" to destroy humanity's last bastion of resistance.
Unbeknownst to the Boazanians, however, are the efforts of Japanese scientists Mitsuyo Goh and Professor Hamaguchi, who have been working alongside Oka on a plan originally created by Mitsuyo's vanished husband, Dr. Kentaro Goh. Having forced her children, Kenichi, Daijiro, and Hiyoshi, to undergo a grueling training regimen alongside the American rodeo champion Ippei Mine and Commander Oka's daughter, Megumi Oka, it is revealed that all of their efforts up to this point were secretly meant to prepare the earth for this very eventuality. The scientists take the children to a top-secret base on the hidden island of Ootorijima known as ""Big Falcon"", where they reveal to the five Kentaro Goh's greatest life's work and humanity's last remaining hope for survival: the Super-Electromagnetic Robot, ""Voltes V"". Though it takes them some time to adjust to the controls, the five are able to work together and save the EDF from total destruction by finishing off Dokugaga with their powerful Heaven Sword, or Tenkuu-ken.
As the series progresses, the Boazanians continue to come up with a variety of strategies to try to defeat the Earth's powerful new robot, always involving the production of a new Beast Knight based on a different animal. As the Voltes team trains to improve their teamwork and skill, they also learn more about the nature of the Boazanians and the Goh siblings' missing father. Professor Goh is revealed to have disappeared on a diplomatic mission to the planet Boazan itself, hoping to stop their invasion before it came to pass. Having been imprisoned by the Boazanian empire this entire time, he escapes from their control and attempts to return to earth with several allies, but is waylaid by a breakaway force and taken prisoner by Heinel's traitorous science officer, Zuhl. Much of the second half of the series revolves around the Goh siblings desperately searching for their father, while he in turn works to oppose the invaders in secret.
Aside from its technological advancement, the planet Boazan is in fact very similar to Earth, and the native Boazanians are so like humanity that the two races can even healthily interbreed. The planet is wholly governed by an oligarchic monarchy with a cruel caste system: Boazanians born with horns are highly regarded and form an aristocratic elite, while the hornless are forced into slavery and worked to death on physically demanding tasks such as mining and construction. During a succession dispute between the highly-revered Chief Science Minister La Gour, son of the late emperor's brother, and Zu Zambajil, an illegitimate son of said emperor, it was discovered that despite La Gour's noble birth, he had been born hornless and had hidden the fact with prosthetics. Taking advantage of this fact to further his own quest for power, Zambajil had La Gour imprisoned and exiled his wife Rosalia, causing him great despair. After learning that Rosalia died while he was forced to work as a common slave, La Gour joined a band of hornless dissidents and subsequently led a daring insurrection against the empire, only to be easily thwarted by their vastly superior military. With no other options available to him, La Gour was forced to escape on a flying saucer and flee across the galaxy until he found himself on the faraway planet of Earth. Upon crash-landing, he was discovered by a Japanese scientist, and they fell in love. To blend in on Earth, La Gour exchanged his name for a Japanese one: Dr. Kentaro Goh. Thus, Dr. Goh's powerful technological advancements and knowledge of the oncoming alien invasion suddenly make sense, for he was once a native of that very planet himself.
Knowing that Zambajil's ambition was to rule a galactic empire, Goh quickly set into motion his plans to protect the Earth from their eventual attack, and moreover, to someday finish what he started by returning to Boazan and liberating its oppressed underclass. Yet when Zambajil threatened to invade the earth unless Goh returned to work under him, Goh had no choice but to abandon his family. Refusing to work for the tyrannical ruler, Goh was once-again imprisoned and nearly executed, only to be saved by the remnants of the rebel army he had created right before his exile. It is here that he met the rebel General Dange, an aristocrat who cut off his horns to join the rebellion, and they left for their ill-fated return to Earth. Just when everyone else believes them to be dead, it is revealed that Goh and Dange have been working on the creation of a massive spaceship known as the Solar Bird, with which they hope to return to Boazan to topple its oppressive government once and for all.

       Helpful Make way!!!! Childhood anime coming through... I am a fan of mecha when I was a kid. I collect robot toys, videos with robots in it and I draw robots. This is the cause of all this. MY FIRST ANIME!!!! To all staffs who created this, thumbs up from the Philippines!!! My father watches this so I tried to watch and it was awesome. Amazing story, characters and battle scenes.  
 
One of the best mecha anime genre of all time. Everything is great. The plot is somewhat repetitive but it is still enjoyable and watchable. The opening song is catchy even the background music. The background music is the highlight of the anime. 
 
Love the memories of this. I even watch it during weekdays in TV when it was aired.  And it was still amazing. By the way, my rating is based on my memories the first time I've seen this as a kid. You might not enjoy this if you watch it right now. The plot would be childish for you.

          
 
       Helpful I watched this anime after it was recommended to me in a Transformers fan group. Although very old, it is pleasant to watch. The story of a combiner robot may feel cliche now, but it was probably fresh in the 70s and Voltes V is one very cool mecha with great weapons. However my favorite character was the antagonist, Prince Heinel - I wouldn't say villain, for he is not one, not for me, at least.  
This anime also reminded me of some childhood favorites such as ""Voltron"" and ""Saber Rider"", which was a pleasant feeling, as it reminded me of better, carefree times. 
Final rating: 9.0 out of 10.

9,7465,88,5.990865507,A group of people living together,Eve no Jikan (Movie),"The movie version is the complete version of the story. It includes all the ONAs and completely new scenes giving details on the background story of some characters. 
 
Sometime in future Japan, androids have been involved in every aspect of people's lives. One day, upon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the ""people"" in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?"". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, ""The Time of Eve"". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.
The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.
","We humans are in fact similar to androids in many aspects. We are programmed in our genes and minds to feel emotions, love, and apprehension. If our amygdalas, the parts of our brains responsible for emotions, were removed, our behavior would be along the lines of an android with a ring on its head in Eve no Jikan. As we saw in Eve no Jikan, the androids, when given the chance, will show human-like emotions and feelings for those around them. With the added fact that the androids look and act identical to humans, we must ask ourselves: in the future, will there be any differences between humans and androids? 
 
Eve no Jikan had a very ""contemporary modern"" feel with the cafe, artwork, androids, and soundtrack. What is known as pop culture today is not evident in Eve no Jikan; instead, the setting had a very tranquil and creative mood.  
 
Eve no Jikan's artwork was very unique in that scenes were shown in more of a fixed camera point of view as opposed to the point of view of the characters. The artwork was very consistent and devoid of blemishes. The voice acting and soundtrack were also very considerable. The influence of the piano in both the plot and the soundtrack is very creative; the piano is not only a symbol of an ultramodern theme but also a symbol of emotion. 
 
Eve no Jikan was a very engaging anime that had a lot of big ideas incorporated into its plot. The ultimate questions regarding the relationships between humans and robotic humans are presented in a very discussable and arguable manner.  
 
Please refer to other peer reviews if you are looking for a plot summary.

The Time of Eve is a café hidden well beneath the towering skyscrapers of Japan in the near future. As the customer opens the door to the café, a bell rings signaling their arrival. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy save for a little girl running around and calling herself a cat. A couple cuddles with each other and whispers sweet nothings into each other's ears. A man is sitting on a couch reading a book. With a bright smile, a woman greets the customer and welcomes the customer into their second home. With an order, the customer asks for a coffee to be brought at their table. It is warm, fragrant, and sweet. Before the café owner leaves, she asks that the customer treats every as equal. Of course, the customer would be happy to oblige...but for some, this is easier said than done, especially when that customer lives in a world where he or she is taught that humans will always be superior to robots. 
 
This is Time of Eve: The Movie, a film that rightfully deserves more recognition as one of the more superior anime films based on pre-existing TV anime and/or OVAs. The way the café is portrayed in the film could be an appropriate metaphor for the film as a whole. It's a quiet movie that slid under the radar of most anime fans, but through the help of some outside sources, my interest in the movie was piqued. Keep in mind that I did not watch the Time of Eve OVAs prior to watching this film, so whatever knowledge I have of the series is solely based on the film. 
 
One of the greatest achievements of the movie's story is that it makes the viewer grow along with the protagonists. I noticed myself warming up to the androids as much as the main characters did and felt a brief, small sense of betrayal when I found out which characters were androids. I think that that is part of a test that the movie is trying to bring upon the viewers as well as the two main characters, Rikuo and Masaki: try to get to know a person not by what they are, but who they are. The fact that this mirrors the way judgement is clouded in the real world by racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice is almost chilling. The robots even have rings over their heads so humans can identify them as such. If those rings were to be eliminated, no one could tell one from the other. The movie takes most, if not all of its time to make the main duo divert from the public norm and start embracing these robots as their companions rather than furniture. 
 
Another thing about the movie that caught my eye is that there are prevalent occurrences of television advertisements in the movie as distributed by the ""Ethics Committee"" that keeps a strict watch on all robot activity. The Committee airs these advertisements in an attempt to drill into people's heads that robots are machines and nothing more. This sort of ""Big Brother"" influence that the Committee has in the movie gives the world it takes place in an almost dystopian feel, making the secluded café a more precious setting than one should expect. 
 
As for the main characters themselves, Rikuo's development into his final opinion on the robots is more or less straight-forward, making him a sort of bland character, but Masaki proves to be the one to have more difficulty handling the situation, making him the more complex character between the two. The different levels of development eventually balance the two out, giving them enough chemistry to add dramatic flair to some of the film's more heart-wrenching scenes. The moral conflicts between the two, in addition to the other characters' moral support, make for a story that's just as touching as it is introspective. 
 
For an anime film that was released only a year ago, the animation isn't astoundingly beautiful, but there are some parts of the film that are nice to look at, like some of the computers when put into use and the inside of some of the buildings in the city. Some pieces of the café are rendered in CGI, which doesn't look bad when placed next to the 2D characters and makes for some interesting camera angles, but it's pretty obvious that those pieces are done in CG. The fact that the film is colored in an almost monochromatic tone makes for some slightly uninteresting animation. The animation isn't bad; it's just a little bland. This is a movie that you should try to watch for the story more than the art. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by the voice acting in this movie. Half the cast doesn't sound all that anime-esque, which made the performances all the more believable. The right voices were chosen for each of the androids in the movie, down to some of the older models that were featured. It made the older robots sound human, but detached enough to make them sound like they don't know how to carry on a conversation with another being. There's more of a layer of realism in that than the newer, more human-looking androids. Some of the more comedic scenes have some of the most rapid-fire conversation I've ever heard in an anime. It was almost like the characters were having a tennis match with their words. Speaking of which, the scene where Akiko is introduced is something that must be seen to be believed. While the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is distractingly unbalanced. Some of it is good, but the synth in it is so blatant that it tries to make some of the most touching moments seem melodramatic. Fortunately, the ending theme is performed by Kalafina, who are also known for performing the theme songs to the Kara no Kyoukai films and both seasons of Kuroshitsuji. The song is rather pleasant and the lyrics tie in to the main theme of the film well. If it weren't for the soundtrack, the audio would have been ranked a point higher. 
 
I really want to give this film a 9, but i can't seem to find it in my heart to do so. Looking back at this film, I know I'm going to remember it, but not well enough to make me say, ""Wow, was that a great film,"". Even though this is cliché, to answer the film's eponymous question, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?""... 
 
Yes, yes I did, but it don't think I'll be coming back for a while. Maybe I'll like it more when I do decide to visit it again. Only time will tell.

          
 
       Helpful When thinking of science fiction concepts, images of futuristic technology and the vast frontier of space are the first things that comes to mind. Arguably the most popular item in the former category is that of the robot. A machine that exists to serve a person or perform a designated function is nothing short of useful and can almost be seen as necessary depending on the setting of the story. Upping the ante are androids, ""advanced"" versions of robots that take on a human-like appearance. Though they have an advanced AI system and they can look as real as you or me, they are still machines bound by the 3 Laws of Robotics (not harming a human, obey human orders, protect its own existence). But how well defined are the 3 Laws? That's what Time of Eve wishes to explore over the course of its run time. 
 
Time of Eve is a film that, like the androids of the movie, masquerades its depth early on. In a ""not too distant future"", androids are seen serving humans in daily tasks and treated no different than any other kind of machine one would use. Adding to this is the propaganda created by the Ethics Committee, a group that has roots in radical anti-robot activities. Serving as a stark contrast to the outside world is the cafe known as the Time of Eve, a hidden location where these androids meet to talk and have coffee. In the outside world, androids have to have a pink halo above their heads constantly to let the world know they are robots. The cafe's golden rule goes against this, saying that all androids must turn off their halo as to not form any discrimination.  You would think that even with the halos off, identifying androids would still be quite easy due to robot mannerisms. However, the androids themselves change quite a bit when in the cafe, with personalities and behavior that strikes closer to being made of flesh than metal. It becomes a guessing game observing each customer, wondering who is real and who isn't.  
 
This is what ultimately makes Time of Eve so interesting to watch. The androids of the future aren't a weapon of mass destruction or some perfect human - rather, they are robots that use this independence as a way of better serving their designated master. They learn by observing others and they too have things that make them happy or sad. Just look at the bizarre love triangle of Koji and Rina or the absolutely heartbreaking story of Katoran. Though it is sci-fi on the outside, it's a slice of life at heart - personal stories are shared amidst coffee and the atmosphere of the cafe. Despite the laid back tone it sets, the film is not free from conflict. The main characters Rikuo and Masaki both have had their share of robot problems in the past, planting seeds of jealousy and distrust in their minds. Coupled with a society that condemns humans for seeing androids as more than mindless servants, they can't be blamed for their suspicion of this grey area. It takes the efforts of bartender Nagi and the histories of the customers to sway their opinion. 
 
What makes this film enjoyable stems from how the minds of the androids work. The androids are still bound by the three Laws of Robotics, but they try to grasp as much they can from around these laws. Lying, for instance, doesn't fall under this rule. Yet with all these nifty loopholes the androids have found, they use this towards better providing service to their owners/masters. It forms a strangely heartwarming experience, seeing how these robots wish to be seen as caring loving people instead of emotionless distant machines. With every law examined, it brings up questions of ethics not just for the characters but for the viewer. Is it OK to lie now if it brings something better in the future? Can you follow an order at the cost of hurting another? What appears as a basic human rights campaign is actually that of philosophy. 
 
The film is also a joy to watch due to its excellent pacing. It is told in a series of vignettes, and when director Yasuhiro Yoshiura feels a scene is over, he smartly cuts away or lets it fade into the next one. With a lot of ground to cover in just an hour and 40 minutes, we are given just enough to feel the impact of the characters without them growing tiresome. By the time the movie ended, it left me wanting even more and even feeling a bit upset there was no Season 2 or continuation. As quickly as I learned about this futuristic world, I left it with just as many questions as I started with. Even if there never will be a follow up, Time of Eve exists comfortably in its own world and can work just fine standing alone. 
 
A few problems do impact this film. A little bit of suspension of belief is needed to get into its world setting. I don't think that a future like this with near-human androids would be met with such backlash. Additionally, as human as the androids act, they are still programmable and as complex as the feelings that these robots show, they are still ultimately artificial. Yoshiura's directing style can also be yay or nay with some. His camera angles shift between first and third person quite often and frequently use a motion blur effect. Though it makes scenes more dynamic (I personally loved it), its alternative style can be distasteful to some (and could possibly invoke motion sickness)!  
 
The art style is a mix of 2D and 3D. This can usually be disastrous, but with a smart director (and a decent movie-sized budget), it gives the scenes more depth. In Time of Eve, there's no clash in these styles and things lay naturally in space. I like the character designs in particular - they're not particularly ""loud"" with huge expressions and distorted features but not plain enough to make it seem like a forgettable mid-2000's title. Outside of the typical ""anime feature"" of highly detailed eyes, I could probably see these character models as real people, from their noses to their hairstyles. The movie does fair audio-wise. Aside from the pleasing credits song ""I have a dream"", the soundtrack is more or less sound effects and short pieces to enhance a mood. The voice actors also did a good job in this film, in particular the main characters with a down to earth and realistic tone (though the mania that Yukana gives Akiko is loved as well). 
 
With this in mine, I give Time of Eve a 7/10. I admit that I was a bit skeptical on starting the movie, thinking it was going to be one of ""robot rebellion"" or overtly preachy. What I got was a mature film that was as welcoming and relaxed as the atmosphere in Nagi's cafe. Fans of shows like Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou will adore this movie, as well as sci-fi fans who are looking for something different than a thriller. On every object in the cafe, it asks if ""you are enjoying the Time of Eve?"" I certainly can say I did. 
 
Do you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review. 
 
Thanks for reading and have a blessed day!

Ignoring the message, As Kamitsuki goes about his school life and makes new friends. These people make it their mission to prove any negative stereotypes surrounding Gunma wrong and show Kamitsuki all the ways Gunma is different from the rest of Japan—from its local foods and landmarks, the changes to its daily school life, and even the attitude of the people who live there. Gunma is widely regarded as the least popular prefecture in Japan, but they clearly don't know Gunma yet! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School']",none,"I truly do not have much to say about this. It was boring. It was forgettable. I can’t tell you ANY of the character’s names, their personalities, or their relations with one another. The anime was basically just one big advertisement for the prefecture of Gunma. All of the jokes revolve around cultural knowledge. It has these real life sections at the end of each episode, starring the ACTUAL mayor of Gunma. He dropped some knowledge about the prefecture. It was almost like you were just watching a professor’s lecture. I have nothing more to add about that. It’s just there. None of the jokes hit for me and the Animation was “meh.” Since it’s just a short 3 minute anime, I don’t really think it deserves anything lower than a 3 or 4. It was bad, but there’s not enough material to really critique or flat out hate. Just enough material to call it bad and then forget you even watched it a day after you finish it. 
I’ll probably forget all about it by the end of today.

          
 
       Helpful This anime has 12 episodes of 3min each. I'm usually against that since it's so short no story can develop, but here is a little different since this anime is about promoting Gunma prefecture, which is not very famous (at all). 
 
With humour the anime shows the different sides of Gunma, local food, the difference between the other prefectures of Japan, and at the end a little explanation about the episode. 
 
As I said before, this anime is about promotion, if you love Japan and want to know more about its local culture, you'll appreciate it like I did, but if you're searching for an anime with a complex plot, you will probably not like it. 
 
Anyway since each episode is 3 minute long, I think you can have your own idea by watching the first one. If you like it, you'll like the other episodes, and vice versa.

          
 
       Helpful The gags in this series are sometimes fairly good, with insignificant cultural features of the Gunma region played up as hugely serious business. However there are only one or two gags, on the same note, in each episode, whereas the best three-minute comedies stuff their run with rapid fire gags. There aren't any  memorable characters either. The animation is indifferent, especially the walking girl in the end credits, though the giant Buddha looks rather snazzy. So does the real mayor of Gunma, who somehow found time to put an appearance in, though I don't especially feel like touristing only to Gunma now. Basically, this is watchable for the overblown mock-horror, but one of the worst watchable shows of the season

The review will be long, since the series deserve it, and since I'll try to look at it in detail (yet keeping it spoiler free). 
 
 
Terra e... is a remake of an old 80's movie that was adapted from a manga from the same year. It fits on a very specific sub genre of Science Fiction, referred to as Space Opera. So expect an outer space futuristic setting, large scale space battles, a large cast of characters, supernatural abilities, and one or two typical 80's cliche. While this may seem like a not so viable mix, the reality is that it works quite well. 
To be honest, the show is a slow starter. It will not sweep you off your feet from the beginning. Instead, it will grow on you as it grows in quality itself, and at some point you realize your initial skepticism is gone and all you want is to see what the story reserves next. 
The Story tells the tale of two races, the Human and the Mu (who though joined by blood, have yet failed to have a peaceful coexistence), and the events that led to their inevitable conflict. It is quite the emotional rollercoaster, and it starts quite light themed, with emphasis to friendship and peace. Yet as the show progresses, it grows darker and darker and death, sorrow, fury, vengeance, guilt and war become an integral part of the storyline. Storyline that is spread out through a wide range of years and concentrates attention in the life of the two main characters.(since their coming of age to their adulthood). The pot shifts it's focus from one to another from time to time, and it does so in the form of two separate arcs for the first ~10 episodes. As the anime progresses however, the alternation becomes less spaced and finally inexistent, as number of events draw the main characters and their respective races to the inevitable clash. 
The characters and their development are without a doubt the best part of the show. Looking at such an extensive cast, I would never have imagined they could suffer so many changes throughout the series. The two main protagonists, Keith and Jomy (who are first presented as young teenagers), are the best example of this as they both undergo major character development. 
They seem to be the two sides of the same coin. Each of them faces a large amount of heavy responsibilities and hardships since their youth to their adulthood. And each choses a different path as they climb to the top. Where one is respected the other is feared, while one created friends the other spawned enemies. Both filled with sorrow and grief for their losses, and yet the bearers of great determination.  
But not only of Jomy and Keith lives the story. The primary supporting cast constituted mainly by Shiroei, Soldier Blue, Physis, Tony, Matsuka, Swena and Sam also undergoes great development. And surprisingly enough, also does some of the secondary supporting cast like Karina, Artela, Murdock or Zel. There will be characters to like, characters to dislike, characters you wish you had seen more of, characters you wish you could beat the crap of... but all in all, they all have their space and role on the outline of the plot, and it's hard to stay indifferent to them. Specially after the amount of events/hardships they are forced to suffer. 
A few words to the ending now. To be honest, I think it was a bit rushed. But even so, it was one of the best endings that crossed my eyes, and yet I have the feeling that one more episode would have made it the best ending of all. 
There were a small amount of plot lines that were only explored superficially, like the origin of some characters, past conflicts etc. And there's also one or two of inconsistencies in the storyline. But they're not enough to taint it. The overall storyline, and specially the characters and their development are top-notch. 
 
Although the Art is certainly the most unique aspect of show it is also a double edged knife. 
As I mentioned before the show is a remake of an old 80's movie with the same name. And as so, the producers decided to preserve the 80's feel in the styling of the characters and environment. Yet now reviving the &quot;antique&quot; style with nowadays animation quality and computer generated imagery. While some people, like me, will find this a plus, there will be a relatively large amount of audience that will be thrown off by it. 
Still, the animation starts at a high quality level. That quality does indeed decrease a bit around the middle of the series, but quite surprisingly, after less shinny period it takes a turn for the best. Not only does it improve significantly, but actually surpasses the overall animation quality of the earlier episodes. And the art style evolves quite a lot in that period. Movement becomes more fluid, characters more detailed, and the 80's feel more faded. It is also great to see the characters physical appearance change, as they age during the storyline. 
As I mentioned before there's a large use of CGI, specially in spaceships and space warfare. The CGI's may not be as shinny as those seen in shows like Last Exile, but they are still rather good and quite well used throughout the entire series. 
 
Sound and Music are one of the best things the show has to offer. Great sound effects, and solid voice acting as normal nowadays. The creators put together experienced voice actors like Takehito Koyasu, Tomokazu Sugita, Mitsuki Saiga with less experienced ones like Marina Inoue or Motoki Takagi, creating a balanced team that ended up fitting the needs of the show quite well. Each seiyuu performance is quite good, and fitting to the character. But even so, some performances exceeded the overall great voice acting quality. This is the case of Jomy, Keith and Tony's voice actors for example. 
Still, neither voice acting nor sound effects are the shiniest aspect on this category. It is yet the Music. Terra e... put together some of the most epic, well devised themes and choral pieces I've heard. The music not only superbly supports the show, borrowing sorrow, cheerfulness or thrill to events, but at times even becomes the full back-bone of the scenes. The music made my skin crawl (in a good sense) a good amount of times. A truly outstanding work by Yashuharu Takanashi, who is also the author of the OST's of Gantz, Jigoku Showjo Series, Mononoke and Seto no Hanayome. Surely, the music genre may not appeal to all if listened outside the show, but it could not befit anime's identity more. 
The music brilliance does not stop merely at the instrumental themes though. It is also present in the OP/ED themes. I had not seen a single series in which all of them appealed to me. Yet that fact changed after seeing Terra e.... All 4 are great on their own style. Granted, not everyone will enjoy the all four, but there will be at least one song that will appeal to you. And leaving appeals aside, the songs where clearly not left at random. They strategically mark a shift in the series. From the lighter and cheerful beginning, to the darker and more dramatic ending. 
 
The Enjoyment is the most subjective rating not only in this but in any anime. Great storytelling, epic music, unique art and story line, and a large cast of interesting characters culminated to give me an outstanding amount of enjoyment. Outstanding enough to be in my top 3 overall.  
Granted, it will not be the same for everyone else. And Terra e... is more likely to appeal to older audiences. But I'm sure that no matter the age, if you can defeat the initial skepticism towards the animation and maybe the story, you'll find things to like within the show, be it the characters, the storyline, the music or even the animation. I believe most people will be in for a solid enjoyment and I'm sure, if you ever come across a show of similar story or genre, you'll be reminded of Terra e... 
 
 
So in Conclusion, it's after seeing series like this, I'm glad I watch anime. It's good to know that there are still series that can sweep me off my feet when I less expect them too, and take for a memorable ride. 
 
What awaits you in Terra e... is an epic, unique, dramatic storyline, telling the tale of two races and the events that led to their inevitable conflict. With a great and wide cast of characters that undergo the most dreadful events and suffer major character development. Outstanding music that supports the series superbly and shines on it's own. An Art style with an 80's feel to it, that can either hook you from the first moment or, more likely, throw you off at first... And yet, given the chance it will probably win you over in due time. With a good rewatch value, specially if like myself, you've seen the series as the episodes aired. 
I recommend Terra e... to every fan of the Science Fiction and Fantasy genre, and to a general older audience as they are more likely to appreciate the brilliance this show holds... Defeat your initial skepticism and you'll be taken for a unique ride no other show has to offer 
 


          
 
       Helpful This anime shocked me in many ways. Firstly, it's a freaking 1977 manga story which already leaves a big generation gap between us. Secondly, it's omg science fiction which I have never liked before. Thirdly, what's with that weird drawing.  
 
Little did I know that all the above factors matter not at all. The superbly crafted storyline coupled with that awesome character development easily let this anime to be one of my top favourites.  
 
Gotta mention too that the opening and ending songs for this series were well-chosen and fitted the story nicely. It's therefore very hard not to let your emotions be tugged along. Before I knew it, I was hooked onto the fast pace of the story and it ended in a blink of an eye. The after thought lingered for quite some time because the ending, or rather, the story itself keeps you thinking.   
 
In particular, the development of the main protagonist enticed me so. He was such a wimp to begin with but during the course of the story, he developed such a notable charisma that you can't help but feel for him and the Mu. I'm very sure that everyone who have watched this is equally drawn to him as I am. 
 
To cut it short, I've only got one word to say about this series - Awesome!! 


          
 
       Helpful It would seem I’m not the only one who has been compelled to write a review for this series after having just watched it, and who can blame me? It’s the type of series that you feel compelled to tell someone else about even if it doesn’t do everything flawlessly. It’s not necessarily the best show out there in either the sci-fi, shojo, or sci-fi shojo drama, but it’s such a good watch with nothing else quite like it that you rather want everyone to experience it once. 
 
Plot: 9 
The plot is the strongest point in the show, it has a few time skips as important characters grow up to become more important to the plot and  situations will change over the course of many years. It’s a distopian type future, not the worst place to necesasrily live, until you find out that the Big Brother Is Watching trope is in effect. Everyone is trying to get back to the original planet Earth for reasons that become a tad more evil as the series goes on. I wouldn’t dare spoil it though, it’s a sci-fi series to the core with emphasis on character relations more often found in shojo series, giving a good flavor when it mixes with sci-fi. 
 
Characters: 6 
Now, remember those time skips? Sadly, this is where the bad part of the time skips gets pushed off onto: the characters. My complaint is that while some characters are developed perfectly well (in part because they might not be in more than one time chunk), the time skips seems to have developed characters while we weren’t looking, which makes for some rather annoying character development plot holes so to say. The character this will affect the most is, unfortunately, the designated main himself, Jomy. I say designated because as the series goes on he feels less and less like he’s supposed to be the main main. He seems to go from being freaked out to being perfectly fine with the situation and while It’d be expected after 4 or 5 years for this to be the case, I’m just upset that I didn’t get to see what happened in particular, did he just get used to the place or what? None of this will stop you from enjoying the fantastic story though and the story more than makes up for a few shortcomings with the characters. 
 
Presentation: 9 
The visuals here are good, spectacular in most cases with some key scenes animated just beautifully. The character model update from the 1980 movie is massively appreciated too. It’s overall good, just not the most memorable thing ever. The music on the other hand is one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in a while, save for my not caring much for the 1st ED, but the battle theme just plays in my head over and over again and both OP are great. I don’t think it’s the best voice acting I’ve ever heard, but it’s still pretty good. 
 
Overall: 8 
The characters really do bring this series down a bit, but don’t let it stop you from getting into the addicting well paced story that remains interesting the whole way through. There’s not many big plot twists, but it’s still some of sci-fi at its best, be sure to check it out.

9,807,91,5.981324292,A group of people living together,Tsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no Himegimi,"In their continuing journey to find the feathers that are the fragments of Sakura's lost memory, Syaoran, Kurogane, Fai, and Sakura move through time and space with Mokona. Here, they visit the ""Land of the Birdcage,"" a seemingly peaceful country where people and birds live together, each person having a bird companion. After a boy named Koruri confuses Syaoran and Sakura for ""bodyguards"" and attacks them, they learn that the king of the country possesses a mysterious power. Princess Tomoyo, Koruri, and the other oppressed citizens, having had their birds taken from them, live in hiding within the forest. In order to take back Sakura's feather, Syaoran and the others stand up against the scheming king. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","The series begins by introducing childhood friends with quite a strong and close friendship: Syaoran, a young archaeologist who is investigating a ruin within the Kingdom of Clow, and Sakura, princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king Clow Reed. When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins, her spirit takes on the form of a pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions. As she descends into a catatonic near death state, Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch, Yūko Ichihara, to whom he begs for help to save Sakura. Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish: Kurogane, a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to allow him to learn what true strength is; and Fai D. Flowright, a magician who wishes to never return to his home world, Celes to avoid his king, Ashura-ō. In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions, Yūko demands that each pay with that they value most: Kurogane offers his sword Ginryū; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura's memories that involve him. Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura's feathers. After obtaining the first feathers, Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories. During their adventures, the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives. As they travel, they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them.
During their journey in Tokyo, the group discovers that Syaoran is in reality a clone imbued with half the heart of the original Syaoran. Several years ago, Fei-Wang Reed, the wizard who caused Sakura to lose her memories, took the original Syaoran prisoner and created the clone to collect Sakura's feathers. Shortly after the original Syaoran breaks free of Fei-Wang's hold, the clone loses his heart and becomes an emotionless puppet that follows Fei-Wang's will, betraying the group. The original Syaoran joins in the group's journey with Sakura wishing to save the clone. Foreseeing a future in which Fai kills the original Syaoran forced by Fei-Wang's curse, Sakura gets stabbed in his place, but at the same time splits her body and soul, sending each to different worlds, Seresu and the Dream World, respectively. In the Dream World, the Syaoran clone destroys Sakura's soul when trying to get the feathers. Before her soul perishes, Sakura reveals that she too is a clone of the original Sakura who was also taken prisoner by Fei-Wang. Fei-Wang then takes Sakura's body to use its stored power. The group departs to rescue the two Sakuras learning from Yūko that Fei-Wang is in an alternate dimension from the Kingdom of Clow. Such parallel dimension is the result of Syaoran's wish to save the original Sakura from Fei-Wang's curse years ago. In order to grant his wish, Syaoran became Fei-Wang's prisoner and Yūko's assistant, Kimihiro Watanuki, was used to replace Syaoran within his original world's history.
The group battles Fei-Wang who destroys the Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and strength of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn in the past to live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other, as well as their shared real name, Tsubasa, as they hope to meet again.
","I'll get right to the point and try to make this review simple. Please do note that I will occasionally refer to the anime series, hence there will be some bias present in my review. 
 
Story: 6/10  
Despite being called a movie, its duration is rather short (personally I feel as though it was an OVA or extended episode). The movie has a rather plain and unsurprising plot, not exactly superb but its not horrible either. Still better than most of the fillers from the Tsubasa anime. 
 
Art: 10/10 
As expected of Production I.G, the animation is simply superb and detailed, with a wonderful use of colours. The movements of both the characters and inanimate objects are fluid, and the character designs are also pleasing. There were hardly any moments where I felt the characters look like they were drawn rather odd. While I originally intended to give the art a 9, thinking of how disappointing the animation of the anime series done  by BeeTrain was, I decided to give it a 10. You can clearly see the difference in animation quality between the two studios. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
Music has always been the strongest point of the Tsubasa anime series to me. The music used were all familiar tracks from the anime series, all composed by Yuki Kajiura, so theres no problem where music is concerned, though I did feel that some of the tracks used didn't quite suit the scene. The opening song and ending songs by Kinya and Yui Makino respectively were also very good and fit the movie well. 
 
Character: 6 
Being a 30 minute movie, there isn't exactly anything special about the character development, as the audience is expected to know them by now. They are all the same as you see them in the anime/manga. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Although some will find this movie rather boring or too short, I really did enjoy it. Especially when compared to all those filler episodes from the anime. 
 
Overall: 7 
Overall, I find the Tsubasa Chronicle movie rather entertaining despite being only 30 minutes long. Is this movie really worth your time to watch? While I wouldn't recommend this movie as a must watch, it certainly wont hurt to give it a try either.The plot is simple but the animation really makes up for it (Once more the Tsubasa anime comes to mind when I say this). You are not obligated to fully agree with my ratings and opinions nor does this review truly reflect what this movie is like. Hope you enjoyed this review by a first-timer like me.

Whilst he keeps on his search for finding another of Sakura's feathers, Syaoran is determined to put a stop to the scheming King!

Before watching this movie you should already be familar with the story of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle as you will not get any background from this movie alone. So don't go straight into watching this movie if you haven't got any knowlegde of the main story. 
 
With this movie only being just over the length of an average episode, we are not given any new character development and the movie itself feels like a short arc from the series as there isn't anything inparticularly special about this world from the worlds that the group had visited in the previous Anime. 
 
Whilst saying that, there are some noticable improvements such as the art and animation. It was newly assigned to Production IG to handle it and I think they did a rather incredible job with it. With this alone it gave the movie suddenly more visual interest being more sharp and more beautiful animation than what we've seen in the main Anime adaptation. 
 
Memorable soundtracks from the Anime reappears in this movie along with some new giving it that definite same feel.  
 
Regardless of the few bad points I have made, with more wonderful scenes from the great main TRC cast; I find this a short but nice treat for huge TRC fans. It's a movie I've enjoyed watching time, and time again.

          
 
       Helpful I recently watched the first season of Tsubasa Chronicle, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It isn't one of my favorite shows, but it was pretty good and I look forward to the second season. However, this short film was quite terrible. 
 
Story (3/10): I rarely have ever been so lost as to what the hell was going on in an anime. This movie has absolutely nothing to offer. It isn't canon and adds nothing to the story. This ""movie"" (if you even want to call it that considering how short it is) doesn't even feel anything like the Tsubasa TV series does. It's just a mindless short story about... hell, I don't even know what it WAS about! 
 
Character (3/10): The Tsubasa characters have zero presence. They are just there. The entire time, they seem to be screwing around and at one point flying on some sort of thing (I don't remember what) to try and let some mute girl talk again. (If that's even what was happening. I couldn't follow the mindless story.) The ""villain"" in this movie is extremely clichéd and boring and could not be more forgettable. Every other character introduced also sucks. The mute girl could be an interesting character if she had development, but she's not gonna get that in 35 minutes.  
 
Art (7.5/10): The animation was pretty good. It looks better than the TV series. My only gripe is the coloring. They made Syaoran's hair much too light...  
 
Sound (7/10): The sound was fine. Nothing sounded bad, but nothing astounded me either. 
 
Enjoyment (2/10): 15 minutes in I found myself almost falling asleep. If this movie was any longer than it was, I don't think I could have finished it. I don't think I have ever been so happy to see the credits roll after an anime movie. 
 
Overall (3.3/10): Overall, this is a crap movie with nothing to offer. It adds nothing to the series and was just a way for them to get some money off of Tsubasa fans. Don't bother watching it unless you are a completionist who wants to see everything Tsubasa, no matter the quality.

","I watched 22 episodes of this series. I gave it far more chances than it deserves. 
 
To say the least, this is the worst anime series I have ever seen. The story was just undesirable from the beginning. I couldn't connect with the characters or even care about them... ANY. As for animation, it was decently made. Nothing to gawk at. The box and cover art is misleading because it portrays girls in colorful and interesting looking body paint and near nudity... but in the show there are only a few sparse scenes involving such. Its like making a movie about the moon with box art featuring an artful shot of a tree. Most of the episodes are irrelevant to anything... and no major underlying plot was perceivable. 
 
The story seems to lull and just spin around nothing. Its all about a big rock creature that shows up in the first episode. For the entire 22 episodes I've seen, the plot advanced at a snail's pace. Basically nothing changed. I finally couldn't take it anymore so I dropped it. If I could go back in time I would punch myself in the face and kick myself in the balls for even considering watching it.  
 
I had to write this because no one else had placed a negative review here. The numbers may speak for themselves. Check how many times this has been favorited. Only twice at the time that I wrote this review. 
 
In conclusion, you are completely free to watch this series. But if you're anything like me... go watch something with a more progressive plot, like paint drying on a wall.

          
 
       Helpful Yeah, I can see why this doesn't get much fanfare after seeing it years later when I bought it for my collection. Pretty much, Neo Ranga is focused on how the presence of Ranga makes the lives of the Shimabara sisters turn upside-down when they inherit a kingdom from their dead brother. The first half of the series is mostly a mix of social satire and slice-of-life comedy focused on how Ranga's presence effects the neighborhood in which the Shimabaras live in and how this invites figures like crooked politicians, the mass media, yakuza and the military to get entangled in the hijinks. From how I interpreted things, Neo Ranga was apparently poking fun of the cultural divide between those embracing Western influences and those trying to uphold the older traditions of Japan's past. While the humor was a bit hit or miss for me, the show's first half was structured well enough where it knew what it wished to focus on and things appeared to be getting interesting when the secret society called the Kyoshin Council made their move to gain influence in Japan. 
 
Sadly, the second half to Neo Ranga takes a big hit in quality as the show got too experimental for its own good in what it wanted to focus on. The focus seemed to have shifted on the tensions between the Shimabaras and the Kyoshin Council at first, but the series decided to return to its slice-of-life/ social satire mix for a bit with the addition of ""monster of the day"" plot setups compliments of the Kyoshin Council as this mixture was a bit of a miss. Some of the themes focused on with Christmas and filming for TV specials were quite outlandish compared to the first half's focus on poking fun of more influential elements of Japanese society. The series then decides to go back to being more serious for the show's final episodes with the actions of the Kyoshin Council, a third faction that gets poorly introduced and hardly any depth and attempting to philosophize the worth of freedom and worship of gods. However with the sloppy handling of these developments and not being consistent with the tone of Neo Ranga's first half, these elements for the show's finale lack the punch they could have delivered if consistently delivered throughout the title's complete run. 
 
Another area that Neo Ranga tends to be weak in is character depth. The series tacked on many of its prominent character with simple personalities such as Yuuhi being rebellious and pampered, Ushio being the heroic tomboy and Minami their stressed-out surrogate mother/ sister. While the simplicity was fine for much of the show's first half, Neo Ranga's attempts to incorporate more serious plot development and complex themes required more depth for these characters introduced. With exception to a few notable characters whose roles are expanded upon from the first half, the Shimabara sisters and most other characters don't get much depth given to their characters and their characters don't evolve too much throughout the show's run. 
 
Visual-wise, Neo Ranga does make use of cel-shaded animation in the designs of scenery and character designs which looked solid to a great extent throughout the show's run as many shots featured a great amount of detail put into the designs of scenery and monster designs. The animation isn't the title's best highlight, but it gets the job done in depicting character movement and battle scenes. 
 
Overall, I'm not really sure what drew my mind to come back to this show when I put it on hold years ago. Neo Ranga was seemingly experimenting with differing ways in which to explore its themes as its first half had a solid focus with its mix of slice-of-life and social satire while the second half became quite a mess in its overall focus. While it explores some interesting themes related to Japanese society at large, the series didn't seem to be sure how it wanted to implement them effectively while maintaining a consistent focus and tone. I suppose your mileage could vary on how well you enjoy Neo Ranga. 

          
 
       Helpful Neo Ranga 
 
 
As I stated on my anime list, it is pretty much a real Masterpiece 
 
Animation is very well done, classical in its feel, though in some eps different team was clearly in charge of the production, with a lesser quality but that did not affect the flow of the series, and they did no more than 4 eps. 
 
The plot idea may not be really original, as the use of science fiction elements and misticism is not really new in anime production, but we need to consider that Neo Ranga is nt really new, beingf one of those productions that used really well the concept. 
 
The plot has many interesting points and turns, and the action is fair without transforming it into one of those boooooring fighting animes so in fashion (sadly). 
 
The plot is carried well and without filler episodes, being a constant evolution to the final episodes. 
 
Some elements, as Minami and Haseoka, were not completely explored in the end, but then again perfection is had to achieve. 
 
The end was well done and does close the story, and yet leaves it open for a real sequel, as it did laid a very interesting ideas and plot points that could produce a really interesting sequel. 
 
Some o the plot ideas echoes animes like Demon Lord Dante, which has a really interesting plot regarding ancient powers fighting in Earth's past and mixing/victimizing humans in the process. 
 
I really liked Neo Ranga's concept, which can even be moved into full science fiction category if seen into the perspectivew that the Kyoshinkai were classified as machines by the Tao's emissaries. Tao itself being an egotistical, tyrannical entity evolved elsewhere and wishing to control everything oposing it. 
 
All in all, great show, very good anmation, very well developed plot and a really entertaining show to watch. 
 
I highly recomend it!  
 
I reasn I give it an overall 9 because the animation team was not the same through the whole series, and some characters could have been better developed. Minor over the whole of the series but yet could have been a full 10 easily.

Unfortunately, reality hits her like a truck, and she dies in a sudden traffic accident. Ten years later, she wakes up in Saga Prefecture, only to find herself a zombie with no memory of her past. While still coming to terms with her demise, she meets a man named Koutarou Tatsumi, who explains that he has resurrected her and six other zombie girls from different eras for the purpose of economically revitalizing Saga by means of an idol group. Assuming the role of an abrasive manager, Koutarou begins scheduling events; the girls go along with it, eventually deciding to name their idol group Franchouchou. 
 
An absurdly comedic take on the idol genre,  Zombieland Saga  tells the story of Franchouchou’s heartwarming struggle to save Saga Prefecture while hiding their zombie identities and rediscovering their past lives. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural']","In the year 2008, high school student Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed by a truck on the morning she plans to submit an idol application. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six ""legendary"" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to revitalize Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group that would become known as Franchouchou.
","Out of all of the shows I’m watching this season plus shows that I’ve heard about, none are as insane as Zombieland Saga. Like almost everyone else, I was in the dark about this show. I thought it was gonna be something completely different but it turned out to be a fun idol show with a twist. Spoiler alert: All the main characters are zombies! With a bunch of other zombie girls, The manager, Kotaro, wants to save the saga prefecture by making them all idols for no particular reason other than to save saga.  This sounded like one of those shows that was gonna be so bad but I watched all of it and was pleasantly surprised. It’s really funny, The manager, played by Mamoru Miyano, is as insane as his portrayal of Okabe, The zombie girls have great chemistry, they are all pretty interesting, and the songs sung are great. Like I said before, the comedy is great. The timing of the jokes are really funny and the situations they get themselves in because they’re zombies kills me. This show doesn’t have a dull moment for me either. Every episode was entertaining and even got into character development towards the second half of the show. The opening is also a huge banger. Supposedly, it’s supposed to take inspiration from old anime from the 70’s from the sound to the visuals. It also takes inspiration from super sentai or power rangers here in the states.  
 
There are a few things that bothered me though. Some of the dance sequences are in CG. I don’t have a huge problem with CG but this show’s CG didn’t look that great. It’s trying to take inspiration from other idol animes like Love Live that do the same, which is great, but it just looks worse. Another problem I had was it didn’t seem like the show knew where it was going the beginning. It started out with the girls thrown into gigs that are super entertaining and got me to watch the show, especially the rap scene, but didn’t really show what the purpose was. It started out with just gigs then into the character development with a dance at the end. I feel if it started with the character development in the beginning then moved forward with the random gigs, it could be a little better. I also want to see more of the progression of the girls and the struggle to become better idols. If we could see that, we could care more. I also don’t like that they barely touched on the saga thing. I feel like they had one episode with real Saga things but I don’t know if the auditorium that they performed in is a real place. If the whole goal is to save saga, there should have been more of a saga focus. The last thing that gave me an issue were the character designs. This was made by MAPPA and they make some pretty nice stuff but Zombieland Saga looks pretty rough with the character designs. Honestly, they just kind look weird or more unique I guess. I think it’s just the faces. They look kinda jagged but they serve well for funny facial expressions which there are plenty of. There were also little things like shots in the training room with the mirror. People would move but not in the mirror but those are just minor.   
 
Now, I’ve never seen an idol show but if this is what all idol shows are like, I’ll definitely give them a shot. Extremely entertaining! If you haven’t watched this yet, you might like it or not but it's definitely worth a shot. At the end of the last episode, they said franchouchou isn’t done so I hope that means a second season because I’ll definitely be there to watch it.     


          
 
       Helpful FIRST REVIEW, don't judge... plz 
 
Zombieland Saga was a pleasant surprise this season, I went completely blind into it with just a title as reference so I wasn't really expecting for a comedy/idol (first one I've seen) anime but more for an action/horror kind of anime, then when I started watching the first episode my first reaction was ""WTF??"" and at the same time I was enjoying it. My shock wasn't because of the weirdness of the show, I like weirdness I embrace it, it was more because I wasn't really expecting this at all but I'm glad I stuck around till the end. 
 
This show has some of the best characters this season starting with the manager Koutaro Tatsumi his voice actor (Mamoru Miyano) is excellent and every time he talked he made me laugh,*spoiler ahead* btw many people theorized that he was the one that ran over Sakura I actually always thought that he used to know her or had a crush on her when she was alive the way they show it in the show I could have been right *spoiler end* 
 
As for the girls we have everyone with their special little quirk Sakura being main girl as main as can be, Saki a badass, Lily with her heart poking out and being cute af, Junko being the quiet, gentle soul, Ai being litteraly an idol, Yuugiri slapping people left and right, and Tae doing Tae things, overall it is a group that I would like to see a lot more from them. 
 
My main issue with this show is the cg used on the performances, I know that it is kinda of a parody of idol shows and I know that animating a whole performance with dance moves costs a lot of paper, but i thought that at least for the final performance wouldn't be in cg, but nonetheless it wasn't really too bad. 
 
The end left room for a second season and for what i've been seeing apparently this is big in Japan so I'm 90% sure that there will be a second season and I'm hoping for it.

       Helpful Zombieland Saga had the chance to become one of he best, if not THE BEST idol show out there. The start of the show was shocking, but hilarious. The zombie concept left a lot of room for unique comedy, and the cast of odball characters from different eras (most of whom didn't even want to become idols) really set the show apart! Deathmetal and rap battles, weird promotions and oddjobs to get the group's name out there, it was all very promising in it's creativity and stark difference from other idol shows. 
Unfortunately, the show started to get into formulaic and predictable stuff mid-season. The episodes regarding the character's backgounds, the horrendous 3D concerts, it was all pretty bland. Even the later episodes about the group dynamic and the main character were less and less unique. Even if we take all the objectively bad things out, it's still just wishy-washy idol stuff you can watch anywhere else, probably better. Where are the different music genres from the earlier episodes? Where is that crazy energy that carried the show? 
Unfortunately, Zombieland Saga ended up as another trend-follower instead of the trend-setter I wanted it to be. It's still a quirky show about zombie idols, and I think it's still worth watching, but the show didn't deliver on the promise of it's great early episodes.

I find it a shame you cannot find my review not helpful if you found it unhelpful, but blame the folks who decided to abuse the system. Anyway, this is my review of Venus Project Climax! 
 
 VPC was an anime full of cliches seen in anime for at least twenty years such as ecchi and the main character is an unstoppable force that is greater than anyone else who tries to rival him/her! VPC was also an anime that had some pacing issues due to only having six episodes worth of material and also suffered from a somewhat bland set of characters. Well, I strongly believe Ruka is miles ahead than the complete VPC roster, though we'll leave that to opinion. Yes people, VPC is flawed! Heck, it may be more flawed than a majority of the anime this season alone. Though, what of it? Do flaws automatically mean you will trash a show and say it is indeed shit? Shall I be a sheep and hate on VPC due to its obviously bad for mal standards rating? I know! Want me to justify loving this anime and call it a guilty pleasure!? Well, I just will not do that. I loved VPC. Actually, allow me to take it just one step further. VPC is officially in my top twenty-five and my AOTS. I have already admitted that VPC is flawed and understandable if those flaws have caused you to really dislike the anime, but allow me to come out and say that the anime also had numerous positives and they heavily out-weighed the negatives, some of them being spoilers so I will refrain from listing them all. 
 
 VPC had a very unique tackle on the Idol genre (..even if it really is not a genre) and had my glued to my screen the entire time. I even believe this could of been a very memorable anime for fans of the medium if it had stronger world building and more episodes. With that said, the story itself is likely a hit or miss for most as a lot of people will find the flaws distracting from the anime itself, but I am sure there is at least one other fan on mal who really enjoyed what VPC offered in every department. The art and sound were fine, nothing special and nothing worth going depth in. Hey, I am NOT being lazy. Just, is there a point to discuss something that has no placed to be discussed? The art is fine as I said and the music is not really great, but is in no way distracting. 
 
 The characters..... ah yes the bland characters with bigger bust than personality! Though, let me make one thing clear. Ruka is a character I admire more than anyone in all of anime and she is by the best VPC offers in the character department. Ruka has a mysterious vibe to her, but as the anime drifts on and exposes more plot besides the boobs, you learn to accept her. Well, I admired her. Though, as I stated before I will refrain from posting spoilers so you all can enjoy the anime yourself. By the way, I just claimed Ruka as my new waifu! Haha yes, before anyone else! Stat wise, I am the only user on mal who has her as my top character in all of anime! Please note that nobody will ever own Ruka except me no matter what you try! I am her biggest fan and added her as my top favorite first, after all. Wow, I am deeply pathetic, but anyway besides Ruka, the cast is pretty bland. 
 
 My enjoyment for VPC was pretty high. Not as high as masterpieces such as Aria or Cowboy Bebop, but really high anyway. With all that said, most of my review focused on the negatives. Though, the positives and what this anime meant to me made it a masterpiece for me. How can such a flawed anime be a masterpiece you say!? Well, it just is #deal. Check it out if you want. You may not enjoy it as much as I did, but it is worth trying.

My older sister used to be a dancer, both as a hobby and as a job. And when I was younger, we would always have to go to her recitals. A recital is basically many different dancing performances consisting of a different combination of dancers. 
 
I hated going to them. The recital usually lasted four to five hours. They prohibited food and drink from entering the theater. I was not allowed to use electronics like my Game Boy. My sister was not even in all of the acts: out of the approximately thirty or so different acts, she was in maybe three or four of them. I realize now that I was there to support my sister as her brother, but back then, I could not have cared any less for these boring, time-consuming dances. 
 
Venus Project: Climax is also filled with dancers and dances, although they use robots in conjunction with the idols. Even so, watching this anime was like watching one of those recitals, bringing with it the same boring and time-consuming feelings once more. 
 
STORY 
 
Venus Project is six episodes, which is about half the length of a regular anime season. As it turns out, that is six episodes too long. 
 
The plot of Venus Project is a simple one: Eriko, a rising star in the world of “Formula Venus” – the anime’s term for idols who dance and sing and fight with robots – enters the “Rookie Queen Tournament” to compete against other rising stars and to prove she is the best among them. Thus, each episode includes a dance battle that involves – coincidentally enough – dancing and battling. The problem is that the dance battles are only used for dancing and battling. They do not serve a greater purpose to the characters or the narrative or anything else that the show is doing. Each pairing of girls just shows up and dances for a bit. The before and the after might be affected by the dance battles, but the dance battles themselves do nothing for the narrative. 
 
With only six episodes, the anime cannot do much besides these dance battles, but the anime does try. Training montages, trips to Pooristan (Ruka’s self-titled, poverty-stricken country), and even an aside at the beach make up the downtime between the various battles. To be fair, these have more purpose than the dance battles themselves. The montage shows Eriko’s determination. The trip to Pooristan gives the audience the chance to understand just how excited everyone is to see Ruka competing. The beach aside (while mostly meant as fan-service) helps to take Eriko’s mind off of the troubles that were plaguing her. So surprisingly, the events that are not the focal point of the anime manage to have the most substance. 
 
And in a way, this is somewhat the point. The show is less about the lives of the idols and more about the lives of the people behind the glamor and the success. This is further reinforced by the ending. In a surprising twist, Venus Project actually does not go the obvious route of Eriko winning. Instead, Ruka wins the overtime duel. Eriko winning it all (while it would have been nice to see) does not matter. What matters is everything surrounding their dance battles: the friendly competition between the duelists, the support of their respective parties, and the prospect of future fights. There is more to life than just winning, and Venus Project proved that through the narrative it constructed. 
 
The show may have too much exposition, and the events themselves may have too much repetition, but again, for six episodes, the show does what it can to craft a narrative that is as purposeful and as well-constructed as it can be. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Some of the worst parts of Venus Project are its art and its animation. 
 
Looking specifically at the art first, the anime does not have a wide variety of locales. The orphanage, the hospital, and the auditorium are the most visited areas, and even when the anime decides to go elsewhere, the attention to detail remains relatively low. This is most apparent with the dance-battles: the environment their robots fight in remains the same boring plain despite the song selection changing each time. All of this says nothing of the lighting and cinematography, both of which are practically nonexistent. 
 
Getting back to the robots, each character has a robot that fights for them based on their dancing and their singing. Eriko has a giant, orange, humanoid robot. Ruka has a slender, purple, snake-like robot. And Miu has a small, dainty, nurse robot. These designs are not only bland in appearance – especially for giant robots – but also bland in their symbolism. Eriko’s is generic. Ruka’s snake-like abilities contradict her true persona. And Miu’s hardly fits her character. There might be a case for Horasu: her robot has big guns that coincide with her own “big guns.” Even so, some breast symbolism is not exactly worthwhile. 
 
The rest of the designs are likewise lackluster. As idols, the characters, similar to their robot counterparts, just do not have presence. Again, Eriko is orange. Ruka is purple. And Miu is pink. Colorful and accessorized, sure, but none of their designs are necessarily interesting. As was the case with Horasu, there might be a case for Romi Oze since her design seems a bit more involved than the others, but that is not saying a whole lot. 
 
But the actual animation is by far the worst part. These are supposed to be dancing idols, but they do not dance so much as they choppily flail around on stage. Their robot “fights” – which consist of little-to-no choreography and too many explosions – are no better. And everything in-between features the same sort of low-execution animation. There are some moments that have realistic hair shifting and some moments where the chest of the women bounce more so than usual, but these moments are a rare occurrence and do not represent the majority of the anime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
For Venus Project, there are three main characters: Eriko, Ruka, and Miu. 
 
But they do not make up the entire cast. There are other side characters, like their coach, Tosano, who is there as a motivator for Eriko. Then there is Romi Oze, a newbie dancer, who demonstrates the harsher side to the idol world. And Asuka Kougami, the legendary Formula Venus competitor, who inspired Eriko and countless other women. Unfortunately, these characters are not the strongest. Tosano does have a character arc in the sense that he passes away due to his illness, but his actual character does not extend beyond a lot of shouting. Romi Oze is somehow forgotten about, so her aftermath is never revealed. And Asuka Kougami, while put on a pedestal, never actually interacts with Eriko and the other women she helped to inspire, turning her more into an idea as opposed to an actual character. 
 
This is not to say that the anime is without at least competent side characters. The orphanage that Eriko grew up in has a little girl that is initially extremely shy, even around Eriko. But after watching Eriko battle her heart out and seeing the wonders of Formula Venus, she gets inspired by Eriko to break out of her shell. In other words, this chain of inspiration provides a nice full-circle effect to Eriko’s character. There is also Ruka’s manager. She is blinded by passion for helping her and Ruka’s country as well as by Ruka’s recent success. Such blindness causes her to not see the turmoil Ruka was going through until it was too late. From then on, she always kept Ruka’s well-being in mind, leveraging Ruka’s scarce performances to her and Ruka’s advantage. Again, these characters are by no means strong or even above average, but they at least demonstrate that Venus Project put some semblance of thought into its characters. 
 
The same can be said for its mains – namely, Eriko, Ruka, and Miu. Eriko is the main character and arguably the best of the lot. When she was little, she was without family and without any hope. But as was said, when she first watched Asuka Kougami take the stage, she knew what she wanted to become. So she practiced. She trained. She battled for her spot in Formula Venus. This was all done in flashback, but her character progressed from a down-and-out child to a promising young woman. In the present, where Eriko is competing in the Rookie Queen Tournament, she goes through a lot of emotions: elation at winning her first battle, sadness at defeating her best friend, and acceptance at losing to her rival. In the end, Eriko does not win the battle but she does win the war: she has finally made a name for herself in the world of Formula Venus, fulfilling the dream her kid-self had those many years ago. 
 
Contrary to Eriko, Ruka is arguably the weakest of the main characters. Ruka’s past is not divulged to the same extent that Eriko’s is, but given where she comes from (Pooristan, which has to be an in-joke of some kind) her looking nowhere else but forward is understandable. Ruka is known as the front-runner in winning and the one to beat in the Rookie Queen Tournament due to her magical voice. But what most people do not know is her secret: an incredibly fragile throat. Her voice is both a blessing and a curse, a curse that sees her lose to Eriko before the main tournament. Yet Ruka never complains and never lets the defeat get to her. In fact, it is presumed that she wants revenge against Eriko. In actuality, all she wanted was to sing her songs against Eriko as a rival and, more importantly, as a friend. Ruka wins for her country, inspiring millions and saving them from a life of hardship, which in turn earned her some much-needed rest. Ruka’s biggest problem, however, is that she not only has no personality but also has no development as a character. So while she is characterized well-enough, the other parts to her character are sorely missing. 
 
As for Miu, her character rests somewhere in-between Eriko and Ruka. From a young age, her path in life was set: to take over mother’s position as head of the family company. That is, Miu was forced to take her mother’s dream. Miu, understandably upset, pushes back, choosing instead to become an idol. When she meets Eriko for the first time, however, she realizes that even this path might not really be the one for her. So when Miu loses to Eriko and follows through on the promise she made to her mother by quitting Formula Venus, Miu reviews herself. Her last few scenes showcase her cutting her hair – a common symbol for change – to demonstrate that the right dream for her is still out there. Maybe it will be at the family company, maybe it will be as an idol, or maybe it will be something else entirely. Regardless of what the dream actually is, Miu’s newfound determination to find this dream will prove that when shedoes find it, that dream will finally be the right one for her. 
 
Looking at Eriko, Ruka, and Miu collectively, they are not awful characters for a six-episode anime series. They are also not amazing. However, they do manage to have something in common: the main characters each have a reason for fighting. They each have a purpose for dancing and battling and performing. For Eriko, she wanted to prove that the support from her family and friends was not for naught. For Ruka, she wanted to bring hope to her country where none was found. And for Miu, she wanted to run away from her mother’s dream to pursue one that was right for herself. 
 
This is an interesting message because it is such a true one. Not everyone is out to make a name for themselves and are instead motivated by other factors. Yet people do not normally think about what someone else might be going through or what someone else might be dealing with. So Venus Project taking the time to show this in its main characters – how everyone involved has their own reasons for wanting to win – was a surprisingly human theme that added some depth to the characters where there previously was not any. 
 
SOUND 
 
In any other genre of anime, Venus Project’s music would be subpar. But given that this anime is one all about music and idols and singing, the music is not subpar but awful. 
 
Starting with the OP, the OP begins and ends in a cool manner due to the hard guitar. But once the remainder of the track starts to play, the smorgasbord of instruments and the low range of the vocalists turns the OP into a mess of a song. The ending theme fairs slightly better because the beat and lyrics are slightly catchier, but the vocalist still does not bring enough emotion into the piece, and the final few seconds feel way too out-of-place. Not to mention that both the OP and the ED are a bit too peppy for this arguably dramatic tale. 
 
Perhaps Venus Project’s most egregious mistake is the lackluster original soundtrack. While the songs the vocalists sing are varied, the songs have no lasting qualities and are ultimately uninteresting to listen to. And this is not even counting the rest of the other songs in the OST. Boring piano pieces, lyric-infused montage ones, and a flute tune that can only be described as having been taken from a JRPG. But the worst track is technically not even a track at all. The transition track between the “A” and “B” parts of the episodes is so goofy and inappropriate that it singlehandedly ruins the episodes. And to top it all off, it is often played twice, back-to-back. 
 
Even the voice acting fails to reach a level that plays to the strengths of this type of show. Sawako Hata as Eriko uses a voice that is a bit too husky. Riho Iida as Ruka does not nail the “Da’s” of the seemingly Russian girl. And Marika Hayase as Miu tries to mix a cute and mature voice that fits the cute and mature character, but her voice does not have any oomph to it. This extends to their singing during the Formula Venus battles: nobody gives a performance that is even remotely memorable. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Before watching this one, I actually watched an episode of the television series that accompanied the show. Meaning, I knew from the beginning that this anime was more or less an advertisement for the franchise it touts. But I have to give the anime some credit because it never felt like an advertisement. Yes, they sing songs that are most likely from the game (I have no idea since I do not play it). And yes, they have cameos of characters from other parts of the franchise (based on what I learned from that one television episode). 
 
Sadly, this does not save this one from being an absolute chore to watch. I think the only scene where I legitimately liked what the anime did was when Kenta, Eriko’s biggest supporter from the orphanage, was revealed to be visiting the shrine every day because he was praying for her to win. That was a cute and clever moment. One cute and clever moment. Out of six episodes, if only a single scene did anything for me, that cannot be called entertaining. 
 
Venus Project: Climax is a sorry excuse for an anime. Its abhorrent art and animation, its horrendous music, and its low amount of entertainment make it nearly unwatchable. Its story and its characters barely (just barely) save this one from bottom-of-the-barrel status. On second thought, those recitals do not sound half as boring anymore. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, the battles are worthless, and the exposition and repetition might be problematic, but the focus on what truly matters is not-so-worthless 
 
Animation: Terrible, bad art direction, lame robot designs, lame character designs, below average actual animation 
 
Characters: Fine, side characters like Romi Oze and Tosano could have been handled better, but some of the sides are fine, and Eriko, Ruka, and Miu are competent characters whose theme on personal reasons has a surprising amount of value 
 
Sound: Terrible, poor OP, bad ED, poor OST, below average VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Terrible, very boring from beginning to end, except for one particular scene 
 
Final Score: 2/10

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to my review of Venus Project: Climax! Now that the 6 episodes have come out, this version of my review will be the final one. 
 
(Story - 5/10) 
The story itself feels rushed. Considering the number of episodes, that should be a given. But, that's where the strength of the story lies as well. Precisely because of the short episode count, each of the main character's development progress was quickly done and over with, which brings the Anime itself straight into the climax, which is the Formula Venus singing and dancing competition. That's where the strong part of the Anime lies; because of the interesting concept that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer's soul when they are singing, us audience will want to be able to watch more of those. Jumping straight into the climax only helps fuel that. The other good part of the story would be that each of the competitors in Formula Venus has their own dream, although that part wasn't properly played out due to the low episode count once again, but that doesn't pose much of a factor. 
 
This part comes in at the final episode of Venus Project: Climax where the final song of the competition happens to be  itself. I like this because it brings a proper closure which many Anime lacks and if you have watched it, it shows how Ruka and Eriko sing their hearts out not because they want to win, but simply because they just want to sing alongside each other. Winning at that point isn't important anymore. 
 
(Art - 6/10) 
The art style of this Anime is pretty fitting. The choice of colors are colorful and vibrant, which is a great fit for any Anime involving singing and dancing, as they portrait each character's joyfulness and cheerful self. The way the characters are designed are pretty well done as well. When looking at them, you couldn't possibly say that one is a rip-off of another,because they aren't! Each character has their own unique design. 
 
(Sound - 7/10) 
Short as it may be, being an Anime about singing and dancing, this should come as no surprise. Songs are great, and the uniqueness of the way they are presented was really what caught my eye. As mentioned in the story section,  the interesting concept that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer's soul when they are singing has also helped to represent the songs in a different light. Because the characters put their heart and soul into singing and dancing coupled with the action in the virtual battle, the charm and attractiveness of the songs which makes the audience listen to them were brought out. 
 
(Character - 4/10) 
To be completely honest, the Anime itself does not have much character development. Yes, while we have seen the characters progress how they came to know about Formula Venus to participating in it, there isn't much else to see other than the competition itself. That being said, the plus points are when the types of each competitor are shown when they have either won or lost a match, that is the sportsmanship and the friendship between some of them.  
 
This part was also added because of the final episode of the Anime. Considering the number of main character listed and how late into the show Ruka appeared, I was worried that she wouldn't have enough screen time to develop as one of the main characters. That changed because of how much she has done for her country and it also shows how much she loves singing. 
 
(Enjoyment - 7/10) 
Given that it is a 6 episode series, the main point would come down to whether the Anime can rein my interest in for that long. In the end, I would have to say that it did. For that, the enjoyment part deserves a high score. For those who are new to the series or have not watched it till this point, the way to keep your interest in it is to put your attention and focus on the competition itself. That way, you'll be looking forward to the next match once the previous one ends and you'll never get bored of it until the end of the Anime. 
 
(Overall - 7/10) 
On overall, I'm giving this Anime a 7 out of 10 score for how much I enjoyed it. It is a good watch if you're someone who enjoys listening to songs while watching action go on at the same time. While it is centered around singing, it is not too much too the point where the singing itself becomes mundane. Do give it a go and tell me what you think about it!

It seemed to get directly to the point and have the plot going right away. However, that didn't last long. The romance seemed a little dragged out, and although I did enjoy it, I think it moved to slow to keep the interests of the majority of the anime-watching population. 
 
The art, I actually became fond of it after a couple episodes. The faces seemed a bit too round for my tastes, and sometimes looked a bit big, but after a while it seems perfectly fine. I do have to say, I've never seen so many blonds in a show before. 
 
The beginning theme was very intriguing. It was soothing, almost like a lullaby, but something that lifted your spirits rather than making you drowsy. I think it was very well composed. 
 
Once again, it moved slowly, even with only 12 episodes. You get a feel for who the characters are, but they don't change very much. Static characters aren't necessarily bad, but I prefer characters who go through ordeals that noticeably change them. The protaganists to change some what, but I don't think they made it obvious enough to emphasize the amount of emotion involved. And on the subject of emotion, Emma seemed completely void of them sometimes. I don't want her to be a whiny little baby, but I certainly don't want her going around with such a usual serious face when supposedly she's gotten her heart broken for the first time.

          
 
       Helpful I don't watch romance animes too much. Usually only when I get tired of  animes with too much testosterone (shounen animes). But I can safely say of the few romance animes I've watched so far, Victorian Romance Emma is my favorite of them all.  
 
Story: 9 
The story is really simple it reminded me of Cinderella with just some alterations. Rich young man meets beautiful maid, falls in love with her and goes after her. Due to the difference in their statuses, various problems arise. One thing I liked about the story is that it didn't feel like your typical japanese anime. I felt that it had a more western feel to it which was refreshing. The situations in the story are not far-fetched and are believable that it can happen.  
 
Art: 9 
Since I'm fascinated with culture, this anime impressed me because its depictions of London during its time were accurate. For its kind of anime, the creator did a good job of depicting Victorian London. 
 
Sound: 9 
The music suits the anime well. Nothing too fancy about it. Just like the laid back atmosphere of the anime, the music is also laid back and supports the scenes well. 
 
Character: 9 
The characters are the foundation of a great story. The 2 main characters are what made this story great because its a romance story. The reason that I said earlier in my review that this had a western feel to it is that in this anime, the man courts and asks the woman out. So far, in most of the romance animes I've watched, the girl confesses to the guy she likes (which I think is very wrong). In my opinion, a guy should be the first to make the move to a girl he's interested in. The male main character did this and this is why I admire him.     
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I really enjoyed this anime. It's unlike any other animes I've seen so far. Even with its simple premise, it was still interesting for me. Another factor that made me enjoy this anime was the accurate and detailed depiction of Victorian London. It gave me an idea of what life was like during the Victorian era. One of my favorite scenes in the anime was when they went to the beach (I forgot if it happened in this season or in the sequel). It was a learning experience to see what nobles usually do during their era when they went to the beach. 
 
Overall: 10 
I gave it a 10 because this anime was worth watching and was memorable. I highly recommend it for a change of pace of what you normally watch.  
 
I'm too lazy to write another review for its sequel so here's a short review. The sequel was also very good and a little better than its predecessor because new characters were introduced. Since its a sequel, you must watch it to conclude the story. I felt very satisfied after watching this anime. 
  

          
 
       Helpful Emma - A Victorian Romance is a series about a member of the gentry, William Jones, who who falls in love with a maid, and the hardships they endure due to the differences between the classes. As William's family stops at nothing to dissuade him from the romance, it comes off a little bit like Romeo &amp; Juliet with all the external tribulations preventing the couple from realizing their love. Of course both William and Emma both have a central character that provides them with encouragement when the going gets tough. 
 
It's a classic romance that seems to stray from the cliches that abound in typical anime, mostly because of the style and the setting. The series takes place in 19th century Victorian London and seems to be quite accurate in it's portrayal. You also won't find any green or blue hair here, many of the colors of the people and the setting are subdued with shades of tan and brown. 
 
Emma took a couple of episodes to draw me in, but I was hooked after that. I found the historical context of the setting to be pretty intriguing, and mostly I just wanted to find out what happens between William and Emma and if they can overcome their obstacles. 
 
I did have a little bit of difficulty finding something to like about Emma, she was a little too reserved and bland to warrant the attention that William gave her. The most interesting character imho, Hakim, could probably stand to have a little more scene time to liven up the series a bit. Animation is good, but nothing to write home about. As there really isn't any action going on here, there isn't much need for dynamic pans and ultra-fluid movement. DVDs are in subs only, which is perfectly fine with me as I always watch subs anyway, but it could pose a problem for dub fans. Finally, as this affects my review score, [SPOILER ALERT] the ending leaves a bit to be desired, I suppose they were paving way for the second series, but I didn't find it too satisfying after investing the time to watch the series.

-Where the bad lies: Well, the animation is from the 80s so don't expect a HD format in 16:4, it'll probably be in 4:3 format. Another important thing to notice is that the way they portray things may be rejected by some people according to their ideology. Try to be open-minded at first.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"I managed to finally watch Love Live and this time in theaters! It was an amazing experience might I add even though it was the second screening and there were no posters... So let me say that this was an insanely great movie and really showed what I love most about Love Live... The music.  
 
The story was good don't get me wrong but overall I really enjoy the music even though I can't understand what they are saying. The songs have a catchy beat to them that just get's stuck in your head. It's been over 12 hours since I watched it and I still have Sunny Day Song stuck in my head and have already listened to it over 15 times! 
 
The story this time was a little different in the sense that it's the buildup to the end of Muse. They plan to break up after a concert to show the appeal of school idols to the world. Before this happens though they end up going to America to meet up and do an interview about School Idols and also play a Live. They sing the song Angelic Angel which let me say I have played a bunch on the game. 
 
They return to America and... BOOM all of a sudden they are extremely popular with everyone and there are posters and there Live of Angelic Angel playing all over the place. They are shocked but more importantly they are surrounded by their fans in the airport! 
 
After running away from their fans the problem arises *HAHA The puns* where they must decide... will Muse break up or will they continue to sing as Idols! If you didn't figure it out yet they broke up there band and finished off the movie with Sunny Day Song! 
 
The movie overall was abesolutely amazing and brings back the feels of the anime when you watched it for the first time. There were many funny moments throughout the movie and it was much more enjoyable then I had expected! Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Love Live Franchise and also anyone who hasn't seen Love Live should defianetely watch the series then the movie.

          
 
       Helpful A Review on Love Live: The Movie 
Story –  
The story at best is simply: “Ok”. There isn’t anything exciting or interesting about it. It’s just mediocre. This was already an apparent trend in the actual series, but having it condensed in a 1 hour 39 minute movie, really makes it obvious how bad it is. The pacing is god-awful and it just throws you from scene to scene will barely any suitable transition. At one moment, it’s like: “HAH, HAPPY FUN TIME WITH MY FRIENDS” then it’s a supposedly seriously moment with a (kinda) heavy atmosphere. Then it swaps right back to the “happy, energetic moments” with again, little to no transition. It makes you question, “what was the point of that whole scene?” It feels like a waste of time and adds nothing to the overall story. It was there for simply the moe appeal. That brings up another issue I found while watching this. Because of this over usage of dramatic moments with no substance, it made me care less and less about those moments. Why is this bad? Because when there are scenes with actual substance, such as the whole tension about continuing the Muse after the third-years graduate, I couldn’t care less about it because the viewers have already been diluted to the point where their perception is just “another pointless dramatic scene.” If I were to give this Movie anything, it creates a decent conflict for once. A battle against “ the audience they  wish to continuing performing for and their relationship as a group” vs. the “philosophy of what school idol means to them”. It’s a shame the execution was just terrible, it had no proper built up, and once we got to the climax, it felt underwhelming. I also need to point out the transition to the music videos, or song section if you will. Based off what I’ve seen, it feels as if they made those segments first, and were like: 
A:“Hey, check out this cool music video we made!”  
B:“Great! Where is that going in the movie?” 
A:“Oh” 
 
 Out of the six song segments, I’ve seen, four of them were just awkwardly placed there for the sake of “We need to put this somewhere”. What annoys me about this is that seeing how they could fit in two other songs in the movie well, they failed to do it with the other four songs. It was lazily incorporated into the movie, and honestly felt like I was watching a kids show where they suddenly break out into song just out of nowhere. My best example of this is the first song segment. Where it’s just “suddenly, it’s raining... ooooh that’s bad… we can’t have fun… (or something). Then BAM, SONG. Like what? It goes from one side of the spectrum to the other within a split second, and the initiation to that segment was just, Rin jumping…. It’s a mess. 
Art –  
The animation has been half-and-half for me. Overall the drawn animation looks pretty good, especially during the dance segments. There are parts where it looks a bit stiff, but otherwise it was well made. My only complaint would be the CGI. It just awkward to look at and contrasts heavily with the background. You may argue that “dancing is hard to animate”, which it is, so using CGI is justified. But they keep on switching from CGI to Drawn, and sometimes the dancing is done in 2D animation, AND IT LOOKS BETTER. And sometimes they have CGI AND Drawn in the SAME SHOT. IT’S LIKE THEY COULDN’T DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY, otherwise, its awkward and a pain to look at.  
Sound –  
The music is good, this is the only good part of the movie. They’re idols after all, this is probably the reason why you’d watch this in the first place. If the music was bad, I don’t know why this movie would exist then, let alone the series. 
Characters –  
My main issue with Love Live would be its overall premise. They tried to make an anime based solely on an Idol group. That’s it. In an Idol group, you only need a few things to be successful. Good songs, Moe Characters, and quirky and cute personalities. In an anime, you can’t do that, you can try, but the quality will surely drop. The Love Live gang is just generic. They’re not interesting, they don’t have any character development, they’re just one-tricks. Quirky and baseless. It works for the first ten minutes at most, but in a movie? It gets fucking annoying. Allow me to run down the list: 
Honoka – Clutsy leader 
Rin – Makes meow noises at the end of her sentences, this isn’t cute. It’s annoying. 
Hanayo – WHITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Other than that, nothing is memorable. 
Umi – Overreacts to literally everything 
Maki – Generic Tsundere attitude 
Niko – NICO NICO NIIII. That’s her contribution to the story 
Kotori -  Her contribution in this movie specifically was minimal, mainly just restates the lines. 
Nozumi – Has tarot cards and just is there.  
Eri – Serious, and gets the plot rolling.  
Of course this a general description of the characters, but it's to get my point across.  
The issue here is that you can’t make a show just on very shallow personalities. From start to finish, they’re the same. Boring.  
 
Enjoyment –  
Can’t say I enjoyed it. I had literal headaches watching this. It was a waste of my time, and I’d rather would just want to see the music videos.  
 
Overall –  
The Love Live Movie is bad…. Not terrible to the point where it’s unwatchable, nor a “masterpiece” as some may describe it. It suffers from being just extremely bland, average, and mediocre. Despite the movie having great music/dance segments, that only constitutes maybe 10% of the movie. Making the other 90% of the movie just unbearably annoying.  
 
To clarify, I don't think Love Live as an Idol group is bad, I just think that the transition from an idol group to an anime and full-on movie was very very poor and deserves another look at the drawing board for we cannot continue with the perception that this series is ""well-made"" when it clearly lacks in the most important areas in what makes a good anime.  
 
Final Rating: 
5/10

       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, albeit minor ones 
The Love Live movie was kinda good 
 
It had a lot fan service but not in the definition that most people would use. Quite a number of scenes, jokes, lines and details are throwbacks to the previous two seasons, meant to give fans enjoyment when they recognise them. Also, that one snippet very near the beginning with Maki, wow. 
The plot was... ...it didn't give a clear direction in where it was going until past the halfway mark. They were working hard but I was wondering why. Actually, we weren't even shown their hard work and jump into the group song when they say so. I think that might have contributed to my inability to root for them in the movie. 
 
Most of the songs were seemingly randomly inserted with dances that make no sense in the moment. I even started thinking, after the second random insert, that the creators put those songs in to match the number of songs that there would be in a full season. 
 
Admittedly, the throwbacks were really enjoyable, among other things. 
 
The mysterious person was quite an interesting addition too. 
 
The art was also a great improvement. 
 
Overall, it's good for fans and a pretty bad place to start for the uninitiated. 
...I'm kind of torn between rating it 6/10, 7/10. 6/10 for the reasons above, 7/10 because it was enjoyable nonetheless. 
 
I guess I'll settle for 7/10

","I've been watching a lot of anime lately, and stumbled upon Myoiga somehow. It was sitting in my ""Plan to watch"" list for a while. The ratings/reviews seemed  daunting, but I took a gamble, and I'm glad I did. Right from the beginning, I was impressed with animation and sound work. The music was very complimenting to the scenes. As it progressed, I liked the physiological aspects quite a bit. The story was fresh, and kept me interested until the end. The feeling of never knowing what might happen next was quite inviting. You also get an emotional understanding of some of the characters. I was really able to empathize, and  shed a few tears in the process !  
 
       Now, a good review has to include the negative aspects. To avoid spoilers for the first one, I'll just say ""The Secret of Nanaki village."" Some of these ""Secrets"" were animated in a cheesy manner, and didn't accomplish what their intended purpose was. The story also had some issues. More could have been done to explain setting, but more importantly, the ending seemed rushed. It didn't include much resolution, and definitely was not as satisfying as it could have been.   
 
       All and all, Myoiga isn't for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it. If you want a mystery style anime with a little romance, action, and emotional character stories, it is a good short watch.  
 
Overall, I give it a 7.5/10. Not quite an 8, but that .5 is well deserved.

          
 
       Helpful I know what you are thinking, a 2? can any show be a 2? If you asked me, i'd say its pretty difficult, but I'd like to explain why Mayoiga was so unsatisfying. 
 
For this review Ill disregard what its about as MAL provides a description, but express the issue with it. The story line establishes itself as a ""death flag"" style show. The scenes are set up to be eerie and uncomfortable, but ironically, they fail to do so. The show builds itself to be scary and uncomfortable, but instead became laughably bad. Each character felt stale, irrational overdone, the way the behave is odd if not hard to watch.  
 
The plot line starts ok, but spirals out of control till its basically doesn't follow any progression or story line. It jumps and skips around to eventually explain its goal, which doesn't fit the show well to begin with. Music and artwork is fine, but not memorable, and with the characters distasteful feels flat. 
 
Overall, this show just was poorly executed. Characters were mehh, many scenes felt wildly inconsistent and out of place,  and the ending was stale due to  no connectivity with the cast or setting. In short, if your looking for a dark show, this is not the place to start. Shows like Another, or shiki do a far better job. 

          
 
       Helpful If M. Night Shyamalan made anime, this is what it would look like.  
 
The story, such that it is, is about a creepy village where people with problems integrating into society escape so they don't have to deal with their problems. What follows is a clusterfuck of characters we barely care about (if we care at all) yelling and screaming at each other as mass hysteria sets in. There is barely a plot other than this yelling at each other and the character's various neurosis manifesting themselves. With such a large cast of characters you would think at least one would apply any sort of logic but they don't. It falls to plot devices to tell the viewer anything important that happens in the story. The characters themselves are uninteresting and ridiculously tropey in the worst way. 
 
Terrible anime. Terrible story. Absolutely mediocre design and animation set to non-existent sound design and vapid character writing. 
 
I wont disparage anyone else's reviews but I wholeheartedly believe that the 7s and 6s I see are due to pity or not understanding that 5 means mediocre, not 7.

","You completely miss the point of this anime. COMPLETELY. 
It's not just another parody OVA with bunch of fanservice. 
It's a USSR and Russian culture parody. So, for haters it does not count as worthy, but we Russians (and I think Russian culture lovers) like it very much. Not all, but most of us, who is not an ill hooray-patriot and can laugh upon its birthplace.  
I am not a patriot (who said wapanese?..), but I still like Russia, so thematical jokes I found sometimes funny. For example, this anime. 
It is good. It is really good.

Story 7/10 
So, when you read the synopsis for the story at first. It sounds completely ridiculous, right? But, when you actually watch the anime and story unfold, it's hilarious. It's about a guy, Galan, who is obsessed with the samurai lifestyle and even wants to become one if possible. When his friend, Natsu, gives him a ancient sword as a present, strange events start to happen (i.e being attacked and his friend asking him to marry her). Now it is up to Galan to stop these strange events.

Man, all the character are so funny! You got Natsu who has a dad who is a pervert and wants to grope her, to which Natsu beats him up (despite that he says he enjoys it). You got a overly protective servant of Natsu, who is really strange. You have a freelance reporter who speaks in a weird what seems to be Texan accent xD And you have your protagonist, Galan, who is stupid at everything he does xD 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
At first, I thought this was going to be a serious samurai anime. Boy, was I wrong! This is a comedy and it's really funny and I ended up really enjoying it! 
 
Overall 8/10 
Don't think this is a serious samurai anime 'cause it's not! This is a comedy that has many hilarious laughs. If you're just looking to laugh at something, then I recommend this anime. But if you're looking for a more serious samurai anime, then this is not it.

       Helpful Honoo no Labyrinth is what I consider a very decent anime. It's a short 2 episode OVA. For the 1 hour run time I would say it was enjoyable, yet simple.  
 
The Good: 
Overall I enjoyed it's art style, very 90s which I enjoy, and for an OVA the animation quality itself isn't too shabby. I also thought the humor wasn't too bad, it was kind of hit, and miss with more hits for me than misses for me personally. I felt the characters were nice, and decently written.  
 
The Bad: The humor I felt while enjoyable was very obvious with it's punchline. I felt the over abundance of panty shots were too much, but it's an ecchi anime, what am I to expect? 
 
Would I recommend it?: Short answer, yes. It's an hour long, it's goofy, and filled with OVA cheese. It's not perfect, but it's a fun time.

","For me, this was quite painful to watch. I powered through because I wanted to see how it ended, but I had to pause more than once to get the cringe out of my system before being able to go on. 
 
The most painful thing for me is that the tone of the show is serious, but many silly events occur and they are played completely straight. Almost every character has a ridiculous/exotic backstory, with no justification for why so many unusual people happen to be involved. If it were a silly-themed show this would be fine (see: To Love Ru), but the show's serious theme demands some kind of justification for the craziness which just isn't there. 
 
Piled on top of this is a heavy helping of some of the worst puns I've ever heard. 
 
 
The other major gripe I have with the show is that the writing seems lazy. It pulls lots of Deus Ex Machinas to steer the plot where it wants it to go and conveniently forgets about things when they go against the intended story direction. Some examples: 
 
When in the middle of the series they need a reason for a normal human to be able to take on a squad of alien attack robots, a new character shows up out of the blue and gives the human magical power stickers, with no proceeding explanation of who she is or why she's helping or even WHY MAGIC EXISTS IN THE UNIVERSE (it didn't up to that point). 
 
Another example of this is when they introduce a character with a teleport ability. They have a whole scene where she demonstrates how she can teleport objects up to 50 meters. Then, in the very next scene a bad guy throws a flashbang at her and she just cringes and takes it instead of using the power she just demonstrated to teleport it away, resulting in the bad-guys escaping. If she were caught off-guard and had remorse for her mistake afterwords that would be fine, but she never even notices that teleportation was an option in that situation. 
 
The leader of the good-guys has a multipurpose transmogrifier/organizer/weapon thing which she makes a big deal of pointing out is a weapon, and then despite it being involved in multiple battles throughout the remainder of the series it's never actually used as a weapon; Chekhov's gun is never fired. 
 
 
It's not entirely bad; the character arcs are decent if predictable and unlike many harems the protagonist manages to avoid being a doofus (although he is a bit oblivious). The references to other SciFi and fantasy shows are a nice touch (including Star Trek, Red Dwarf, I Dream of Jeanie, and Bewitched), and the theme song parodies can be fun. 
 
 
I would advise my past self against starting this series, as the pain of viewing it was not worth the payoff of seeing the ending. If I was going to do it anyway though, I'd let my past self know that the first two episodes are prolog and very different from the rest of the show.

She decides to live with him to explore and learn more about Earth.  He has several other friends that are girls that all love him, or like him in that manner.  He of course has no idea and goes about his daily activities as such.  This anime isn't bad.  I recommend to anyone wanting to watch a cute anime that has a little bit of action in it.  There are some parts that drag on because they discuss their similarities which are being in love with the same person, but it isn't bad.  They cat aliens end up finding out that the dog aliens are there and it causes some level of conflict.  Will it ever be resolved?  Watch and see...

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so this is more like an extraordinary situation were black ops mixed with ET and added with child's play kinda thing, I like the characters the way that they were drawn and the setting, were it is set on the southern part of Japan, in Okinawa. Eris, the lead female character seem to have the combination of Lala from ""To Love Ru"" and  Horo from ""Spice and Wolf,"" but just like any light novel animes it is still a combination of different genre for each episode which by the way I kinda hate the musical part about a space man in ep9. Then again that first assistant droid  could  had a longer role within the series. My main criticism is the authors and illustrators idea of arming the 2 girls Minami and Aoi which basically doesn't have the right body mass to weapon recoil ration e.g. when Aoi pull up a 3.57 Colt Python against her chauffeur/ handler I'm surprise that she can handle a gun that weight about 5lbs and has a recoil of baseball batter when fired for a pettit girl like her to handle, if a girl with the body mass and height like that of Aoi were fire that kind of gun, she would also get hurt in the process because the gun's blow back would literally throw itself back  towards her co'z she's unable to control it. For Minami, she was branded by Kio as gun otaku, if she is then why is ep6 she requested for a M134 Minigun that is not mounted in a tripod only to find out that it's just to heavy for her to lift ? As a gun otaku it is important that you know what gun you can handle and what you can't handle, that doesn't seem to be the case with Minami who only has an average IQ for guns, also, Aoi is seen using a Dragunov Sniper rifle  in ep8, black ops usually shy away from that kind of rifle because of it's limited accuracy most would either use an H&K PSG 1 sniper rifle, A1 Arctic Warfare or Remington Bolt Action Rifle. Also there were instances were the girls handled various 9mm pistols but can still prove to much for a petite girl to handle. However I can give credit for the illustrator for making Aoi use the S&W 38 police special for the rest of the series  it is basically a kind of gun which petite teenagers can handle. I also noticed that in ep7 there is a German WW2 MG42  featured, doesn't  the illustrator know that such weapon is no longer being manufactured and the M249 SAW is the most widely used machine gun amongst armed forces like Japan's SDF?  
 
You know, I think authors and illustrators should not just focus on any gun for the character, it is important that a certain gun should match the character's physique, age and combat role, if we'll look at the more matured characters in the anime we can seen that the guns they possess matched their physique   like Antonia's maid which is understandable that they also functions as her body guards, in fact, it should be Kio's uncle who should be possessing the 3.57 Colt Python and M134 Minigun in the first place, as for the Dragunov Sniper Rifle it kinda looks good for Maki Itokazu (Kio's teacher) to handle it.  So just like that certain guns should be match like jewelry for certain character. 
 
Trivia: It is Illegal in Japan for a citizen to own a gun, do you know that not all law enforcement officers in Japan carry a gun? In fact only the SDF, SAT and those assign for body guard duty were allowed to carry a firearms. Even thought Japan's police were trained to shoot, their standard issue Nambu cal 37 Revolver were always left in the station under lock and key only to be use for very special emergencies.

It was fabulous, five friends, five warriors of justice and super cool! So I tried to watch it again because I forgot many things, I didn't like this season to tell the truth, I found it boring, especially Chibiusa, it's a very annoying character and she always interfers  between Usagi and Mamoru, the other thing I didn't enjoy was Mamoru behaviour, I mean he could tell Usagi about his dreams (nightmares) and as every couple does, try to solve the problems together, except for this, I like the sailors' transformations, attacks and I would have liked to see more of the others sailors but Usagi always has the spotlight. Opening and ending are nothing special, the music is the same of the previous season. But I see in this season a development of Usagi's character, she is growing up a little and yes, she is always a klutz and a crybaby but when it comes to rescue her friends she gives her all. The art is very good, to think it was created in 90th years, the characters are not flat and they have their own personality, I prefer sailor moon S to tell the truth but this season is not that bad.

          
 
       Helpful The second season of Sailor Moon, though it isn't my favorite season, this was definitely worth the watch. And with the new Sailor Moon Crystal coming up it seems like it is a good time to make this review. 
 
The bad. I wasn't a huge fan of the doom tree arc, I'm gonna out right say that. It seemed too much like they just wanted to rush the show along while fitting in more and more episodes to fill up the episode quota for this season. This arc could have been done without, but it wasn't horrible and it did serve a very small purpose. The soundtrack was pretty much the same, which is to say it was lacking during the actual show itself but it had amazing opening themes in both English and Japanese. The art style was Toei animation, that is to say it was a bit lacking back then, even during the fight scenes some times. And like the whole of the doom tree arc, the Arabian Knight was unneeded. They really could have saved time and money by skipping to the Black Moon arc, introducing Chibi Usa right off the bat. 
 
The good. I did like the relationship development in the doom tree arc, so that arc isn't without its virtues either. The fact that Usagi had to win Momoru back instead of them all just having their memories back and Chibiusa literally falling out of the sky and into the plot. So it had that, and adding in An to be a sort of rival to Usagi was a good idea as well. And keeping with the kid's show idea, even in Japan they cut out some of the more morbid things from the manga. We don't see nuns spontaneously combusting in this version. 
 
Final Verdict: 
The first half is kind of rocky if you a huge fan of the manga, but it's still a good watch, and a time waister. So watch it. 
 
7.4/10

          
 
       Helpful To tell the truth, this wasn't my favorite season of Sailor Moon- I have mixed feelings about it... shows in my scores. I consider it the worst but most important. It was the season that brought back Sailor Moon, and was connected to the rest of the seasons in a special way because of that. That's why I give it 7 overall, otherwise, it would of been a 5. 
 
Story was pretty good. I like how there was a huge cliff hanger on the first season. And I also like the build up on the first arc-But it was a &quot;filler&quot;. The story introduced a mass of new characters and scenery. They explained things in greater detail, for that, I give it a 9. 
 
Art was a joke. This is the only reason why I think this season was the worst. I think the creators could of done a bit better. I mean, this was made during the mid 90s, even Fushigi Yuugi was better. The art of Sailor Moon R was really meek and... disgusting to see on screen. 5. 
 
Sound was the same as the first season. They just added a bit more to it. Theres not much to say about it but &quot;Blunt&quot;. That's why I gave it a 6. 
 
Character, the characters in the series were either new or old. As I said before, they introduced a lot of new characters such as (SPOILER!!)Chibiusa, Sailor Pluto, etc. I liked the unique personalities of the 5 senshi in the first season and many other characters, so I give it a 8. 
 
Enjoyment is pretty medium. I mean, you get to have a repeat of gathering the 4 senshi and 2 parts of the season, a new villian, and so much more. I give it a 7 because the art was of low quality but the story and characters were at a all time high. 
 
Overall, the art was bad... super bad, but the rest is fresh and new. It's good for any shojo fans and for children to enjoy. I think many people will enjoy it.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']",none,"It is a light-hearted anime that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has plenty of relatively light fanservice. It is also quite silly, but that is what makes it interesting. The anime also has surprisingly nice art/character design... and at the same time occasionally displays significant dips in music quality. I would say the series are a bit underrated. Detailed breakdown below. 
 
Story: 5/10 
It is based of several japanese legends, but mostly those are an excuse to make heroine travel around, doing various silly things and often changing costumes. The story isn't exactly DUMB despite being silly, meaning I didn't get any facepalms while watching.  Occasionally story gets a bit predictable, and its quality drops in several filler-like episodes. 
 
Art: 7/10 
It is surprisingly good/solid. Very nice character designs on everybody, without rushed drawings anywhere. Most characters are visually very interesting, from girls/women which are cute (onihime specifically) to the large detailed onis. It is definitely not a super high budget designs, but it is surprisingly solid and above average quality. I think the only issue with art is odd design of momoko's primary costume, but everything else looks good. 
 
Sound: 4/10. 
The music is odd. There are a lot of interesting or average sounding tunes, but the anime frequently switches to some very weird electronic music that at times sounds almost like a chiptune. Those fragments feel completely out of place. 
 
Characters: 5/10. 
It is a light comedy, meaning characters are mostly plot devices and thier primary purpose is to be entertaining, so there isn't much to tell. THey aren't horribly written, and main characters are okay. There's nothing deep in character, but they're entertaining/amusing enough without being overly predictable. In short - archetypes, but no or at least not many horrible cliches. 
 
Enjoyement: 6/10. 
I liked it. It is a good anime to unwind while watching some characters doings something silly. It is not a super high quality comedy, and honestly the main reason to watch it is eye candy in term of character designs.  
 
Overall: 6/10: 
Worth checking out if you're okay with light fancervice or like/don't mind a bit of ecchi. However, this isn't really an strong ecchi title... to put it bluntly it doesn't ever show a nipple, and characters (surprisingly) don't have a habit of falling into some sort of risque/provocative pose every time. Still, there were several obviously fanservicey episodes.  
 
Bottom line: Light comedy with cute characters and some ecchi overtones. Worth a watch if you want to unwind, skip if fanservice offends you. 


          
 
       Helpful Momo Kyun Sword 
The story revolves around a naive Momoko and her 3 animal gods that took care of her and trained her since a little girl. 
 
Story 
It was a typical fan service anime, where this group of girls have to find some stones of power so the demons don't control the humanity, where there's little action and a lot of fan service. 
 
Art & Animation 
The art on this is very good being a fan service it has to be, for some reason their boobs shines, and the animation is really colorful. 
 
Sound 
It wasn't something great, it was fine and the ED for some reason was hypnotizing. 
 
Character 
They were fine, it wasn't anything remarkable but the fan service on them was. 
 
Enjoyment 
It was fine to see the fan service and the colorful art but more than that there wasn't anything. 
If you are here for the fan service then don't there are better anime series that has better fan service but this is fine.

          
 
       Helpful This is the best bad anime I've seen in a while. It isn't good. It doesn't really stand out. Due to Momo Kyun Sword's rather shallow exterior and interior, there isn't really a good way to write a long review about it without some filler. Therefore, I'm going to keep this review short. But I'm going to try to recommend that you watch it, despite the low score that I think it deserves.  
 
Here's the story: Follow Momoko, her boobs, and her 3 animal friends as they travel Japan, meeting more boobs and changing costumes along the way. Beware of predictable plot twists and cliches.  
 
The art is colorful, but isn't all that special. Everyone's shoulders and cleavage and various other body parts are blushing at almost all times, unless they are male and are therefore not sexual objects. But who cares about them, right? 
 
The music confuses me, it's usually generic and more annoying than not, but then sometimes I can almost dig it. I was left with a feeling of vague satisfaction coupled with deep disappointment in the sounds in this anime. 
 
Every character falls into some archetype and doesn't expand on it or do anything out of the ordinary. Onihime was my favorite. That's really all I can say here. 
 
Enjoyment: Well, I enjoyed this. I'll explain why, but that's where this review kind of gets long, so if you want to leave off here, just know that it's possible to revel in Momo Kyun Sword's lack of substance, but that doesn't at all make it a ""good"" anime. It is inherently bad, as (hopefully) evidenced by my brief description of everything about it above. I didn't really leave anything out, I think I've described the entire anime in this review.  
 
Anyway, here's where my ""short"" review ends, and my ""long"" analysis of why I enjoyed this anime despite its terrible-ness begins: 
 
This is a very simple-minded anime made with a very simple-minded audience in mind. It doesn't look down on its viewers at all - it puts itself exactly on their level and celebrates the mediocrity. I assume that if you're going so far as to read a review about Momo Kyun Sword, you aren't the type of person it was intended for. So, in order to enjoy this anime, you need to exert some effort. There is no meeting halfway here. You won't be rewarded for your trouble with anything that is at all redeemable by the end of this story. No, for someone that enjoys thinking critically about anime, the only surefire way to make this worth your while is to go all in and lower yourself to the very standards it expects of its audience.  
 
At least, that's what you have to do if you want to enjoy it and also rate it higher than a 3. I, however, enjoyed this anime without respecting it. It was risky though, I very easily could have hated it (still probably giving it a 3, but without the fond memories). All I had to do was start watching this anime, fully anticipating something underwhelming. I know that people say that you shouldn't watch this anime if you're wanting something deep, but I'm going to change this to ""only watch this anime if you're wanting something shallow."" It's not enough to know that this anime is bad, you have to WANT it to be bad. If you want this enough, you will be rewarded with exactly what you want, and therefore enjoy this anime! 
 
But really, everyone needs a mediocre anime or two under their belt. Not necessarily to accentuate the better anime, although that's not a bad reason. I just kind of like to take a breather, to stay grounded in reality. If I throw in some bad anime along with the exceptional anime, I won't get bored with my favorite medium always meeting my expectations. But that may just be me.

Lying in the ocean is an island paradise; its inhabitants peacefully going about their lives. A cool breeze sweeps through, lightly caressing the body of one of the residents. Ominous music calmly drifts into the viewer's ear as the camera brushes across the tranquil scene hinting that something is ""off."" A voice heard by all suddenly rings out, clear as the azure sky on a bright summer day— 
 
""Are you there?""  
 
The voice entraps those who hear it; an ethereal feeling washes over the body; the residents are frozen in place.  
 
The voice is gentle... 
Inquisitive... 
Tempting... 
 
It seizes the very soul of the one who hears it.

The residents evacuate to the island shelters, a strange feeling gripping them—its younger inhabitants having strange thoughts rush into their minds, thoughts they shouldn't have. They instinctively understand what is happening; they have been conditioned as such. Should an emergency arise, certain elements about what they need to understand the situation have already been implanted within their brain. 
 
A creature has breached the island's shields, its form enriched with a golden luster—the Festum. Its beauty entrances those who see it.

And the journey begins. 
 
Note: I wrote the introduction in this summary-like way because it will make it easier to discuss certain elements from it later in the review.    
 
Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor/Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor, or simply, Fafner, is a series that starts off with a bang, quickly thrusting the characters and the viewer right into the midst of a conflict. Numerous questions are immediately raised, mysteries that leave the viewer hungry for answers. Fafner's first episode is fast-paced and rapidly drops a large number of concepts onto the viewer's plate which could easily be described as far too much, far too quickly. This rapid influx of material to take in could possibly elicit some confusion within the viewer as well. A lot of information is given in just a single episode, and, while this can be a bit overwhelming, it can easily be seen that Fafner is a series that holds a large amount of potential. Will it capitalize on that potential though?  
 
Fafner is a series that initially seems to struggle to find itself, but, soon enough, it demonstrates that it does, in fact, have its own identity. Fafner has several ideas it wants to explore, a number of interesting places it wants to visit, significant messages it wants to communicate, and a large cast of unique characters to develop.  
 
To begin, the writing in the first ten or so episodes of Fafner is not anything special for the most part, and it leads to a number of the ingredients of the series feeling under-cooked or unexplored. While I say this, the first episodes certainly did keep me entertained, and, by the end of the series, I came to have a new appreciation for them and what they managed to achieve, even if the execution left much to be desired. At around the mid-way point of the series the writing sees a significant improvement as it is at this point that the one who handles the script for the series was changed (I think it was around Episode 15 that it shows the change in the credits). Another individual takes the helm, Tow Ubukata, a man who will probably forever be recognized for his failures (Psycho-Pass 2, Ghost in the Shell: Arise) while his successes fall into obscurity. With Fafner, Ubukata managed to take what had been established in the early episodes and unite everything the series wanted to achieve in a cohesive way; he succeeded in galvanizing the messages the series wanted to portray with a polished finesse. Since writing on this first installment into the Fafner franchise, Ubukata has written all related content for the series. Down the road, Fafner would go on to get multiple sequels, a prequel OVA, and a movie.  
 
Fafner is a series that has a rather melancholic, yet simultaneously optimistic tone, strange as that may seem. It certainly features a rather tragic story, but there is an ever-present tint of hope lingering in the air—a faith in humanity. Within Fafner, humanity is basically fighting a losing war against a silicon-based lifeform from space, the Festum. Having been pushed to the brink of extinction, much of Earth is left a ravished wasteland. In this ruined and broken world people are simply trying to survive by any means necessary. One such group is found on the island haven of Tatsumiya. There are also other groups such as the Neo U.N., as well as those that can be found in Exodus (I won't be talking about Exodus here though. That's a review for another day) grappling for survival, each seeming to hold slightly different ideals. 
 
If there's one thing that Xebec is notoriously well-known for it's their visuals, and not in a good way. In a number of their series of today they are frequently absolutely horrendous, but that is not the case with Fafner...okay maybe it is most of the time, at least with this installment into the series that is. Oddly, it still looks better than some of the stuff they've made recently though. How that happened, I don't know. Anyway, I do believe the animation is impressive in some scenes, but there are also a lot of scenes where it could have been better. I can't say the animation is anywhere close to being perfect because it will take a hit and there are times where it can be rather awkward. However, while the animation (or lack thereof in some instances) is not the best in this first installment into the Fafner franchise, I think the art/artstyle of the series manages to significantly make up for it. 
 
The color choices within the series are rather muted and possess a gloomy hue that adds significantly to the tone of the series. The ocean that surrounds the island on all sides is a dark blue, frequently giving off a rather lonely feeling, which is often oppositely weighed against the feeling of unity that can be found among our cast of main characters. The darkened ocean also gives a feeling that perhaps it could represent the internal feelings of some of our characters within the series at times. Existentialism is a big part of this series and the dark, lonely, melancholic ocean can often come across as something meant to be compared with the struggle for finding meaning in one's life or finding who you are. A character may feel lost in that black ocean as they struggle to find where it is they belong in the world, which I believe was a comparison mentioned at least one time in the series. Backgrounds within the series are quite stunning (not always though), probably more so than the actual things in the foreground a lot of the time. The greenery on the island boldly asserts its presence and the grey and brown colors that adorn the homes of the residents add quite a realistic feel to them as they dot the land across Tatsumiya.  
 
Character designs within the series are likely going to be very hit or miss. They were handled by Hisashi Hirai, an individual whose designs are certainly unique. Probably most well-known as the character designer for Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, he handled them here for Fafner as well. While they seem to be rather disliked by some, I actually liked the character designs in this series, but hey, that's just a personal opinion. Well, they are adding a little something I guess. I think the designs do a good job of placing an emphasis on the character. For a story where characters play a massive role, these designs make them seem more ""visible."" They stand out so much that it makes it somewhat hard for a character's presence to be ignored.  
 
The Fafner units have sleek and polished designs. When speaking of the service these machines provide to the series they are rather praiseworthy. When a pilot is chosen for one of these machines they essentially must become the Fafner unit. They are not a pilot of the unit, they are the unit (this has to do with Being and Nothingness, something I will elaborate a bit more on throughout this review). I guess it could be said that it ""merges"" with them. As described in the series, they see as the Fafner sees, they feel as the Fafner feels. This naturally means that they will feel the damage sustained by the machine as well, but to keep them fighting efficiently it will be reduced by transferring it to the operator of the Siegfried System.  
 
The Siegfried System is essentially where the one who commands the Fafner units directs them from during an operation. The operator of this system crosses with the minds of all the Fafner pilots to get the layout of a situation so as to be able to command an operation accordingly. Since the operator of the Siegfried System will also feel the damage a Fafner unit takes, they are in a rather difficult position. The operator of this system must possess good judgement as well as be able to function under extreme conditions to maximize the survival rate of the mission. Despite not being directly on the front lines their job is quite important to the outcome of a battle as they are in a sense responsible for the lives of all the Fafner pilots.  
 
The fact that the ones who link with the Fafner units must essentially become those machines is the reason why it is far more difficult for adults to be pilots. The series implies (and outright states in the novel) that seeing yourself as something else, using your imagination to visualize yourself as something else, is much, much easier when you are younger. This explains why it becomes much more troublesome to pilot a Fafner unit the older a person is and would be the reason as to why the Fafner pilots are young.  
 
The Fafner units themselves are machines designed to combat the Festum's abilities. In order to make their pilots function as efficiently as possible they directly link with them and bring to the forefront their survival instincts by stimulating the Reptilian Complex. Rage, fear, anger, hatred, etc. can come forward and can change their pilots mental state so they can fight the Festum effectively. It can also change the person themselves after they leave their unit. As a result of this, the machines are quite dangerous to the well-being of their pilots which can be seen on numerous instances. When inside the Fafner a character's established personality can completely change, shifting to one that is far more animalistic in nature. The after-effects can probably most clearly be seen in Koyo's change after Shoko's death. Having had feelings for her, the Fafner unit stimulates his anger and hatred at her death, frequently manifesting in him lashing out at Kazuki verbally, as his rational thought has been affected by the Fafner unit. Koyo's behavior would probably aggravate viewers who don't understand why he is behaving the way he is. They may just think he's being a jerk. He's not though. He's been altered and he is no longer who he once was. This can clearly be seen if we look at who he was before becoming a Fafner pilot. Koyo was a rather kind-hearted and loving characters in the series, a boy who would die for his friends if necessary. A boy who has been changed unwillingly.  
 
The Festum are meant to be seen as a beautiful creature and the golden tone they possess coupled with their majestic appearances are alluring. They are a strange, complex lifeform, but an important thing to realize about their nature is that they are not attacking humanity because they want to wipe them out—at least not initially, that is. They are simply confused and do not understand humans. The Festum are a hive-mind species that constantly assimilate information and refer to themselves as ""we."" Being a hive-mind they don't comprehend a humans way of life. They wonder ""why"" humans are doing such strange things. They genuinely believed they were helping humanity when they began assimilating them. And this is where changes gradually began to manifest within the Festum. Emotions are a foreign concept to them, and when humans are assimilated frequently negative emotions are what is running through them as it happens: hatred, anger, etc. They don't understand this, they don't comprehend what it is they are experiencing.  
 
As expected, when the Festum take negativity into themselves they will eventually learn such emotions themselves. This gives rise to a Master Class Festum referred to as Idun, a Festum who has learned hatred from humanity. He is consumed by it and it eventually leads to several encounters with him in the series.  
 
The Festum do not have individual will; they are created by something called the Mir, their ""God,"" which they cannot go against, as the will of the Mir is their own will. The Festum are another way for the series to explore Being and Nothingness. 
 
The Festum are also used as a way for the series to make a point. Festum are something that a vast majority of the world believe needs to be eradicated. A few people however, such as some of those on Tatsumiyajima, believe coexistence with each other is possible, and efforts will be made to try and see this happen. This is a primary topic of the series, the idea that two separate, intelligent lifeforms can understand one another. It's also done to try to make yet another statement: if coexistence between humans and Festum is a potential possibility, then shouldn't it also be possible between all humans as well? Considering humanity is often fighting each other rather than the Festum a lot of the time it seems to be a rather poignant examination. 
 
The battles within the series are what I'd describe as being engaging to watch, seeing as they will always manage to find a new way to innovate old ideas, successfully managing to keep each one unique and special in its own way. The whirlwinds of action meshed with psychological and philosophical exploration create a special tension that, personally, kept me quite interested in what was happening. A perfect cocktail of thematic depth mixed with emotional reverberation is something that is not easy to achieve, but it was pulled off to great effect.  
 
The music in the series is mesmerizing when it plays, being expressively forlorn and beautifully heart-rending when necessary. It certainly left an impression on me and managed to become one of my favorites. The voice acting is quite astounding in certain scenes with the emotional depth being conveyed exceptionally well. Kazuki's pain as his best friend Soshi disappears as he screams, ""Soshi"" repeatedly is heartrending. The touching poignancy of Episode 15 when Kazuki confronts his past and realizes that what he wants is to protect the island, his home, is deeply moving to see play out, especially for a character who has struggled to find his place in the world. The opening theme, ""Shangri-La,"" and the ending theme, ""Separation,"" were both done by angela. The opening theme drips into the viewer's ears with a blend of ominous instrumentation mixed with a heavy-hearted delivery of sorrowful lyrics, while simplistic, yet relevant visuals progress across the screen. The visuals of the ending are even simpler, just zooming across three characters with solemn facial expressions, as the melancholic and mournful music plays out.  
 
It's no surprise that a series based on something like Norse mythology can get quite dark and rather tragic, taking a vast amount of inspiration from it and a few other things related to it. This is probably most obvious through the name Fafner, but also other names like Fenrir and Mjolnir. These are only the most blatant of instances though, and to go further into detail of the other little things would result in this review being even longer than it's already going to be*, so I'll just briefly mention one thing. Fenrir, in this series, is a self-destruction weapon on the Fafner units, there to allow the pilots to detonate the machine so as to avoid assimilation. This is a preventive measure so it doesn't force allies into having to kill someone who was once their friend after assimilation. This Fenrir function may be hinting at a Fafner unit eventually using it's Fenrir function to detonate with the Mir, the ""God"" of the Festum, seeing as Fenrir is foretold to kill Odin during Ragnarok, if coexistence can never be found. This is only speculation, however, it was stated that if Kazuki's Mark Sein were to use Fenrir the destruction would extensive. Looking more into these related things that the series takes inspiration from could help you to get more out it in the long run. 
 
The Neo U.N. often take on an antagonistic role to the island of Tatsumiyajima. They are another faction of humans who are trying to survive in this broken world. To call them purely ""evil"" is to have missed the point though. Their methods can be very extreme, but I can understand why they are the way they are in this world. It makes sense, though they may not be agreeable methods, I can see where they are coming from.  
 
Additionally, just because the people at the head of this group may be that way is no reason to assume that all the members of the group are that way. Everyone is simply trying to survive, by whatever means necessary, in Fafner.   
 
It would be a mistake to call Tatsumiyajima entirely free of sin as well. After all, they are making their younger generation fight. Even if the adults can't pilot the Fafner units, that's still no justification. These battles are all the more dangerous because of how the Fafner can alter the mind. The island also hides itself from the rest of the world. They have the means to fight back more efficiently against the Festum, but prioritize their survival above all else. Again, this is an understandable action. After all, they are a small island, and their help can only aid the world so much before they find themselves in a situation they cannot defend themselves against.  
 
Also, the island ""conditions"" its residents when they are young. When their brains are not fully developed (another reason why young people pilot Fafners) they have certain information planted into their minds so they can be able to understand things in an emergency situation. The information is locked away until a situation demands it necessary to flow out. This can be seen in the first episode. It's not made all that clear, but most obviously we can see this in Kazuki with how he instinctively understands how the Fafner works. (This also has to do with existentialism and the absurd in a way.) His exclamation of, ""I know this."" serves to show that the information locked away is gradually being released.  
 
Additionally, the young characters were not born via natural means. There are discussions of gene manipulation which is yet another topic in which many questions are raised. Fafner often spends its time engaging in dialogue-heavy philosophical topics or discussing its own in-universe science which can can quite extensive. Thankfully, it's actually interesting stuff that has relevance to the plot and makes sense if you're actually paying attention.  
 
Fafner treads a very grey line of moral ambiguity. On the one hand humanity faces extinction by being unable to fight back effectively against a complex lifeform. On the other hand, they can fight to survive even though it requires less than desirable methods to do so. Questions about humanity are then asked in the process. What is the meaning of peace? How far should humans go before their humanity is ""lost""? Do the ends justify the means? Where do we draw the line? 
 
Fafner has quite a large cast of characters,** but there is something that unites the Fafner pilots: they all display signs of Savant Syndrome in some way. This, too, is how they are chosen to be pilots. Individuals with signs of Savant Syndrome may display abilities that are far beyond the norm in some aspect. For example, Kazuki has athletic prowess, his ability going far beyond the others in his age group. Maya has keen observational skills, to the point where she can deduce a person's feelings simply through their gestures/behaviors. There is the implication that she can climb rock faces without safety equipment just because she will instinctively understand the most effective way to do so after seeing its face.  
 
Fafner is a series where the character's are of great significance and often drive it forward. Existentialism is one of the biggest aspects of this series, most frequently manifesting itself in the form of the question: ""Are you there?"" Variations on this are asked and stated by the characters throughout the series as well.  
 
And here, I will now make a point of stating why I find the confusion of the earlier episodes to actually be worth something of value in this series. Whether it was intentional or not, this sense of disorientation, or confusion, that the viewer is subjected to in these early episodes is likely to be eerily similar to the feelings that the characters within the series are experiencing towards the situation as well. Suddenly, these characters are thrust into an absurd world that they do not understand. As such, I see what we experience as the viewer as being a mirror for what the characters themselves are experiencing since we, too, are effectively thrust into this absurd world. What makes this really interesting to think about is that an individual's beginning in existential thought starts with a sense of confusion, and this confusion that is created within us (as the viewer) at what is happening during these early episodes is actually quite ingenious if it was intentionally done, which I'm inclined to believe was in fact the case. Still, some of the writing choices needed more polishing in these earlier episodes.  
 
Often we can see a character's struggle for identity and meaning in their absurd world. I will use Kazuki specifically as an example to further illustrate more on the aspect of existentialism and Being and Nothingness within the series. Kazuki routinely denies himself and his existence as a result of his past with Soshi, where he believes he scarred and left Soshi's left eye blind. This is an act of bad faith and Kazuki's denial of his past can be seen as his leading an inauthentic way of life in that he is not living in accordance with his freedom. Fafner, as a series, can be seen as the story of Kazuki ""creating"" himself and then subsequently acting in accordance with this self that he has created. He will act freely as who he is and live an authentic existence, and he will not act as something he is not or blame his actions on something or someone else. Kazuki struggles to find the meaning to his life, and, he eventually comes to realize that what he wants more than anything is to protect his family and friends on his island homeland. Soshi cannot pilot a Fafner unit as a result of his left eye being blind which leads Kazuki to think he must do it in his place. But, as a result of Kazuki's journey in the series he will not be defined by what Soshi or anyone else wants him to do or to be, but rather by what he chooses to do and what he is. Kazuki's freedom and that which he is responsible for are connected to one another. 
 
There is a scene at the end of Episode 15 where Kazuki emerges with Mark Sein from a lava pit and breaks out of hardened magma, almost like a ""birth,"" or coming into Being. This is the same episode where he finally confronts his past. This is shortly after he obtained the Salvator-model Fafner Mark Sein which literally represents ""Being."" Kazuki now exists as his current self and no longer replaces it with a past self that does not exist.  
 
Soshi is a stoic young boy and he was Kazuki's best friend in childhood. Over the course of the series it seems to be implied that Soshi's feelings for Kazuki go beyond mere friendship and it also implies that Kazuki may reciprocate. It leaves it pretty ambiguous though, much like a majority of the relationships in the series, but you'd still have to be blind to miss it. Despite appearing very cold, Soshi's aim above all else is to protect Tatsumiyajima and its residents, possessing strong leadership skills and exceptional judgement. He wants to be a Fafner pilot so he can protect the island, and laments that he unable to do so, having to manage the battle from the Siegfried System instead.  
 
Koyo is eventually assimilated by the Festum, though he will still help the island as a Slave Type Festum, meaning he actually still possesses some of his own will over the assimilation. It also represents that humans and Festum can eventually understand one another. At one point he is almost killed by an island resident because of his assimilated state, but the realization that ""Festum don't cry."" saves him as it is understood that he is still, Koyo.  
 
Maya's presence brings a large of amount of comfort to the character's in the series, particularly Kazuki. She is a gentle, loving girl, and also rather strong-willed, especially when facing the Festum. I'd call her the glue that unites everyone together, her overall importance to the story being of the utmost significance. She would do anything for her friends, even if a great burden is forced on her in the process. The characters are probably one of Fafner's strongest elements and are some of the most well-developed I've come across. I'd like to talk about more, but for now I'll hold off.  
 
When a character dies in Fafner, they never disappear from the story. They may be gone, but they are never forgotten; they are always remembered. This creates a strong sense of unity between our characters and it makes their affection for one another have an authentic feel to it. People die in Fafner. A lot of people. No one is safe, no matter who they are in the story, they can die at any time. Death can be sudden and unexpected, but it comes anyway. Even so, the deceased will still have a roll to play within the narrative as their memory is lovingly held within the hearts of the living. Even if a character dies they are and were always—there. Hope remains ever-present within Fafner's story.  
 
The meaning of life and death is explored extensively as well. The Core of the island, Soshi's sister, Tsubaki, teaches the Mir about what it means to live and die, a concept that it has no understanding of within the series. She represents a Valkyrie.   
 
There is a scene in Episode 17 that manages to perfectly encapsulate everything Fafner wants to say in the most brilliant fashion. To this day this scene is one that sticks with me because of how well-executed and genuinely heartfelt it was. An attack is launched against Tatsumiyajima by those who want it eradicated since the Festum, being a hive-mind, are learning new strategies and tactics from their encounters with them. At this point, Canon, is forced to make a decision, by her own free will. Kazuki, comes out to face her, but instead of doing so in battle, he does so in spirit. Canon has lost everything in life—she has no family, no friends, and still worse, no identity to call her own. Is she really there?, the series asks. As a means to cope, she has shut all things off, living only to follow the orders she is given, even if that order means her own death. She is incapable of making choice. She won't make one. Canon, holding the key to whether Tatsumiyajima will survive or not faces Kazuki and rather than engaging in an all-out battle with her, Kazuki simply talks to her, facing one another in their machines—facing one another, not in combat, but by facing each other's hearts. This is not something that Canon is mentally suited towards given her circumstances. She is ""broken"" and doesn't believe she has any real thing to call her own. She believes that she does not exist anywhere. She will be able to easily follow an order that leads to the deaths of a lot of people because she is empty, so she can't really understand.  
 
This is one scene where I really have to hand it to the voice actors because the emotion, the pain, and the genuine desire to understand one another is palpable. In this encounter there is another thing that needs to be understood, the two are in their Fafner units, units that I've said heighten the survival instincts and the darker emotions found in humans. Rage, anger, hatred, you name it, the Fafner units are a stimulus to bring it out and make their pilots fight better. By all means Canon should probably be flying into a violent rage. But she's not; she's getting angry, but she's struggling. The fact that she is pushing herself so hard and that she is being pushed so hard, that she is being forced to make a choice for herself is a testament to how desperate she was for someone to reach out to her; to just try listening to her. Being in such internal turmoil that all she needed was someone to hear her and to realize she was here with that alone being proof enough that she was, in fact, there.  
 
Kazuki implores her to make the decision for herself and if she doesn't then he will disappear with her placing her in a situation where she now has someone who has shown that they do care about her well-being. She's not alone and she deserves to be here and experience the emotions that everyone else does. Tears stream down as she begs for Kazuki to tell her what she should do. He refuses, telling her to make the choice herself. So, she does. She makes a decision of her own.  
 
In this scene there is no blood, there is no violence, and no one dies. There are only two people who manage to understand one another despite being on initially opposing sides. Canon makes a choice for herself; thus, Canon is someone; she is Canon; she is the only one of herself in existence; no one can replace her because she is the only one who can be uniquely her. She is a seemingly hopelessly broken individual, who with the help of others, slowly begins to pick up the shattered fragments of herself and piece them back together.  
 
She is here.  
 
This scene hits the existential aspect of the series, while simultaneously showing fighting is not what is needed to allow humans to understand one another. It seems to want to represent that we are all human, we can all understand each other if we try, and we can be there to help one another when it is needed. Canon eventually becomes a resident of Tatsumiyajima, and is adopted by Yoko Hazama who had previously adopted Shoko. Initially feeling like she doesn't belong on the island she eventually grows to love it. She has found hope, despite her past suffering. 
 
Fafner, true to what it has established itself to be, ends in a rather bittersweet way, with a nearly blind—being blind is a form of nothingness—Kazuki returning to Tatsumiyajima where he vows to wait for Soshi's return forever. Kazuki has found where he belongs in this world and what he wants, his character journey reaching completion. Despite being unable to see, he has never seen just what it is that he wants as clearly as he does now. He at last fully understands himself and who he is; he is an authentic existence true to who he has created himself to be. He is Kazuki—the Fafner. He will protect the treasure, his home, Soshi's home, just like the Fafnir from Norse mythology that protects treasure as well. And s",0

Saeki Makoto's family possesses the power to see the gods' agent, but the ability is limited to one living relative at a time. When Makoto's mother passed away while she was still young, Makoto inherited the ability as the sole remaining family member. With the help of fox spirit's power, Makoto and Gintarou help the people of their community, in spite of their many differences. 
 
(Source: MangaHelpers, edited)","['Seinen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Makoto Saeki is the daughter of a shrine priest in a small Inari Shinto shrine dedicated to the God Ukanomitama. When she was 4 years old, her mother died and she inherited an unusual gift called The Sight, allowing her to see the Shrine's Heralds. She met the messenger of the god Inari, an anthropomorphic fox named Gintarou, during the funeral, and he declared her as the fifteenth generation heiress. Gintarou can see a short glimpse into the future and can find lost things despite being rude and unmotivated, but still develops a good friendship with Makoto. As she is the only girl who can see the spirit, both of them decide to be a go-between for the gods and humans as they try to help those who come to the shrine.
","Gingitsune caught me at a good time, offering a bit of heartfelt drama and a relaxing atmosphere to take it all in with. Looking at the premise I almost skipped over this series entirely, mainly due to my personal bias against slice-of-life and how I usually see them as snore-fests where nothing really happens. In the end I gave the first episode a chance and my expectations were quickly surpassed. 
 
What exactly caught me off guard? It would be the fact that the script and characters brought genuine life to the story, both subtle and meaningful. I’ve grown used to slice-of-life having little to no story, and themes that ultimately are delivered in such a limp-wristed way that you can’t care about it. Already in the first episode, Gingitsune accomplishes to remind me of how drama can teach us things about real questions we face in everyday-life. At its best points, the series focuses on problems ranging from isolation and bullying, to more philosophical matters such as what gives apologies their meaning. 
 
The animation fulfills its purpose and always manages to stay at an above average to great level, showing that plenty of love went into the making of the series. The design and direction manages to be colorful yet never abundantly so to the point where it sticks out, giving it a more neutral tone that feels more grounded in reality, disregarding the presence of fox-spirits and other deities of course. 
 
The use of the soundtrack helps in creating a tranquil environment for the series, with its use of flutes and string-instruments at the forefront, emphasizing the feeling of being at a mysterious shrine that contains more than meets the eye. It is also a perfect fit for the bits of Japanese culture and Shinto religion that is shown. The one thing that could have been improved sound-wise would be some of the voice-acting, as certain voices didn’t fit the characters’ ages, and in the case of the spirits there are some who get very loud and annoying at times. 
 
As for the down-sides of the series, there are a few annoyances and at least one greater flaw. The biggest con among the pros of Gingitsune is that it‘s short and incomplete. Normally when a series’ main flaw is that it leaves you wanting more, that is a compliment. At the time this review is written however, there seemingly is no available manga to continue the story with, leaving the viewer with some loose threads hanging at the end of episode twelve. 
 
Ultimately, Gingitsune captures its audience with a lovable cast and skillful writing that makes you care for the simple things in life. With a relaxed yet mature tone that doesn’t talk down to its audience, Gingitsune includes a lot of heart into its characters and script, ultimately ending up a short but sweet experience.

          
 
       Helpful I finally decided to write a review, yay xD Hopefully somebody will read this incoming rant :P 
 
Gingitsune revolves around a girl Makoto, who can see gods' messengers and a bunch of people around her, mainly her father, friends from school and Gintaro, the fox spirit that resides in the shrine where she and her father live. With Gintaro's power to see glimpses of the future and find lost things,  Makoto tries to help anyone from their little community who comes to the shrine. Around the middle of the series, a boy named Satoru comes to live at Makoto's shrine. He can also see the messengers and has one attached to him as well, Haru. She is also a fox spirit, but a younger one than Gintaro so she is much smaller compared to him and has a childish personality.  
 
The pace story is really slow. It's an episodic anime with no central story. It's just about every day lives, and the relationship between Makoto and her friends, with a little bit of supernatural. If you are looking an anime before bed, that's not hard to understand  and relaxing, this is the right choice for you.  
 
There's nothing much to say about the art; is't pretty decent, somewhat similar to Kotoura-san plus the big white anthropomorphic fox. There are no fantastic nature background images, no detailed outlines nor anything spectacular. I think that flashy art was not needed in this kind of anime anyway, you just watch it to relax, not to see something complicated and out of the ordinary. 
 
There's nothing memorable about the sound, OP and ED songs are also pretty quiet and in accordance to the overall mood of the series. The seiyuus did a good job, nothing out of the ordinary. I personally find Haru's voice a little annoying but that's just a personal opinion. High pitched voices are just too much for me. 
 
The characters are pretty likable and all of them have their own unique personalities. There are lot of hints for a potential romantic relations between a lot of characters, but there was just not enough time to develop anything. It's like the series is just a prologue to something more awesome and engaging. Many dialogs and moments are funny, too, especially between Haru and Gintaro. Satoru's background story brings some drama into the picture too, so I think this series has a lot to offer. 
 
Gingitsune is not a story for the masses, it doesn't have flashy fight scenes, witty dialog or any kind of mystery. All the cards are on the table from the start (except the explanation of how Gintaro got to be the herald of that shrine,which is not essential to anything ), there are no surprises. Still, I found this series really likable and was looking forward to every new episode. I just wanted my 20 minutes of relaxation every week, because that's what this series was for me. Also, Satoru's background story really got me hooked on it and I generally liked him the most. His socially awkward moments were the best, always getting me to giggle and smile.  
 
I would recommend this to fans of Natsume Yuujinchou, because the series has somewhat the same feeling. And also for all fans of Japan in general, because you can also find out about their culture through this, mainly the purification ceremony and some interesting customs. 

          
 
       Helpful I have downgraded this anime for a few reasons. There are some bright spots, but most of it is not very good in my opinion. 
 
I liked the overall general idea that there are some temple people that can talk to temple gods. I thought that was a pretty cool idea and they probably could have done some interesting story elements with that.  
 
But alas! It is a slice of life and I feel that this anime doesn't really get started. For some slice of life, that is fine. Slice of Life is my favorite genre. 
 
But I felt like this slice of life was more character focused and driven. And that was the issue. I thought some of the characters were way to emotional and whiny. It got very annoying and that is why I dropped it. I did my best to use all of my anime logical and just get through it. But at the end of the day, there are so many great series out there.  
 
Everyone, be selfish with your time. Watch what you want, drop what you dont.

i definitely recommend anyone in search of romantic, slice of life and encouraging anime to watch this for sure. 
 
this is my first review. sorry in case if i have done anything wrong

          
 
       Helpful I may be the minority, I may be the majority, I honestly have no idea. All i know is that the characters, and the story of Ano hana have stuck with me FOR A LONG TIME.  
 
Something I thought would be an absolute waste of time had me clicking on the next episode as often as possible because I really wanted to know what happened. Over the course of only 11 episodes, I grew more attached to these characters then I have for characters who have episodes that run MUCH more than this one.  
 
After watching this I immediately recommended it to my friend, who proceeded to curse me out after finishing it for making him feel things like that. 
 
Its an anime that touches on incredibly relate-able topics, some which might connect with you, simply because they are ""real"". For a show that has the ghost of a girl walking around, the emotions, the story, the characters, and everything just feel so real and relate-able. This anime was, has been, and still is one of my absolute favorites. And I very much recommend it if you are in the mood for a powerful story with real human emotions, that left me crying by the end.

          
 
       Helpful Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don’t Know the Name of the Flower we Saw that Day) [from here forwards we’ll refer to it as Anohana] is a series that undoubtedly conveys the strong feelings of friendship, loss, grief, anger and love in a powerful manner. Personally I chose the series on the assumption that it would give me the same level of emotions that I got from series such as Angel Beats and Clannad, both of which have had an impact on the way I view things and this series does not disappoint when it comes to leaving a mark on the viewer. If you’re only reading this to see if you want to watch the series or not, then all I have to say is give it a go. Chances are you won’t be disappointed. 
 
Let’s cut straight to the chase and look at the story and concept of the anime. The concept of ghosts hanging onto something isn’t new, in fact the series manages to play around with the thought and it creates something much more powerful. The most memorable scene for most is the ending, and I have to agree there. Without going into spoilers (even though it’s pretty blatantly obvious what happens) the ending leaves the viewer feeling sad but not disappointed. In fact the whole final episode builds to a climax almost perfectly, and that’s why the series has gained such acclaim. 
 
The story is probably at a perfect length, whilst I would have liked to see a bit more character interaction I think that the way it was executed in 11 episodes made it extremely memorable as you never really find a space to get bored. Honestly, the first episode almost threw me off the series until I first saw the complexity of the relationships between the characters. However from then on it just moved at a perfect pace to engage the viewer. 
 
The backstory is also interestingly crafted. There is no real mystery of what happened, but the complexity of what happened on that day unfolds at the perfect rate for the viewer to be curious but never fully understand the entire picture. In fact the last reveal of what happened threw me completely off but looking back it made quite a bit of sense. That’s another thing in this series. There are no real unexplainable things; everything just pieces itself together with logic, which is something quite rare in an eleven episode anime series. 
 
Anohana as a story is enough to keep the viewer engaged and if that’s all you care about then go watch it. 
 
The art is reasonably good, especially in the concluding few episodes. The use of colours and tones were quite excellent and the character design was almost perfect, aside from my small dislike for Jintan’s father. The climax scene, in fact the entire last episode, was animated wonderfully and I definitely liked that. 
 
The music and voice acting for this series is quite good. Firstly the soundtrack used in the emotional scenes just amplified the feelings of the characters, and that was done so beautifully. The OP and ED were both quite decent (I’m actually listening to the full OP as I type this) but you’ll remember the songs more due to their roles in the final episode. 
The voice acting was done so beautifully. It’s hard to find a flaw in the cast, they were all suited well for their roles and none of them felt out of place, and the result of that was impressive. However the reason they were memorable were their emotional performances and the like. Their emotional cries were quite powerful, and it impacts the viewer beyond belief. 
 
I really liked the characters, and particularly their interactions with each other. The main group (The Super Peace Busters) are all interesting in their own way but it’s the relationships and their individual emotions that make them so fascinating. The way they all change is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the series along with their respective relationships with Menma. 
 
The main character of the series is Jintan, and he’s the only one who can see Menma. He was once the cliché leader who led by his actions (basically a classic Shounen style hero). However once Menma dies and everyone in the Super Peace Busters split apart he becomes much more complex. He basically locks himself in his house and refuses to come to school, that of course changes as the series progresses. As the group are forced to interact with each other again his personality is put in the questions, who he wants to become is also put into the question of the viewer. I personally found his character development the most interesting, and his feelings for Menma and Anaru are also placed into the spotlight (which provides a strong focal point for the drama). Ultimately his personality shines through as that of a Leader, and that’s something quite enjoyable. 
 
The girl in focus on this series is Menma. She died before the series began and returns hoping to fulfil her dream (which she conveniently forgot). To my surprise she was voiced by Ai Kayano (Mayaka from Hyouka and Mashiro from Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo), her voice just seemed different. Her dream is the ultimate driving point of the story, and is what brings together the old group of friends. Her personality is the classic innocent girl who wants everyone to get along. Ultimately the way she acts in the final episodes is what people will remember, and her impact on everyone’s life is monumentally instrumental. 
 
Anaru is an interesting character. She was once the more quiet girl with a large collection of video games and manga but she grew up to be much more of a ‘bad’ girl. She admits to imitating those around her, and ultimately it’s her growth (and her evidently soft side) which is highlighted. Her feelings for Jintan are highlighted from almost the beginning, and the viewer is left to feel sorry for her as she is pushed aside in Jintan’s quest to fulfil Menma’s wish. Her emotional importance to the story was quite memorable and was definitely a key factor to the enjoyment of the series. 
 
To be honest, my favourite character was probably Yukiatsu, only due to the raw emotions that he emitted during the story. He was in love with Menma as a child, but he knew that she only saw Jintan, causing him to hold a bitter feeling towards the ‘Leader’ as someone that was always better than him. His obsession over Menma was frighteningly powerful, and his pain was a key reason as to my liking of the character. His inferiority complex leads him to pursue Menma even if she is dead, which leads to some of the more creepy moments of the story. Ultimately he is one of the key characters and my favourite. 
 
Tsuruko and Poppo were both probably the least important characters in the story. Whilst they undoubtedly held an important role in the progression of the story, I found the four above characters to be far more powerful in their stories. I found certain parts of their story sad and I never felt like they were irrelivent, but I didn’t find them completely useful either. 
 
Anohana is one of those series that leaves you thinking, and I left thinking of the importance of friends, the pain of loss and just a general load of feels. In conclusion (this is basically a TL;DR) I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who was willing to watch a serious drama.

Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","Below is a summary for the past twenty-two volumes in chronological order.
Aboard the ship Advenna Avis in 1711, a group of alchemists summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence, by ""devouring"" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.
In New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.
In late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, an assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure. During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the Advenna Avis. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.
The train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.
Later that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.
Eventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them however it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the battle. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways.
The next year in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.
The remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals.
In 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved.
In 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.
In 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella. It is eventually revealed that Czes's tormentor Fermet is in fact the mastermind and overall villain of the series after Szilard Quates.
","The only things I can praise about Baccano are the art and music. Both above average. All the rest is pretty bad. Being well-written does not make it good. The first half of the show is confusing. I started understanding what it was about at half of the episodes. 
 
 Characters: There are a lot of them and none are remarkable. At the end of the show I only knew the name of two of them, Isaac and Miria. Guess why? Well, they are the ""stupid couple"". They keep repeating each other's name throughout the show. 
 
 I feel like this story could be way better if the humor was good. I guess Isaac and Miria were supposed to be funny, but they are so stupid that it feels forced. 
 
 Conclusion: If you do not like the first episodes, do not bother finishing the show. Enjoyment 2/10. Overall 3/10.

          
 
       Helpful How do you pick the main character? Is he the center of the story? Or the most handsome? The strongest? How do you unfold the story, then, if the story began way before the appearance of the main character? Where do you start the story? 
Baccano is the first non-chronological anime I've watched after Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. The first scenes were too incoherent that I was almost going to stop watching Baccano in the first episode. 
I'm glad I didn't. 
Well, then, let's start the review. 
 
Overall: 10 
For few hours after I finished the anime, I just sat there. It was the best thing I have ever watched. The amazing twists, appropriate soundtracks, colorful characters, comedies in between and old yet distinct art...It was a whole new experience to me. In terms of story, there will never be as good an anime for a long time. 
 
Story: 10 
As I said earlier, the story was a perfection. The author used non-chronological method to increase the suspense and questions yet not dropping the interest rate. As the episodes went on, pieces all fit together and all the stories explained themselves. Like Inception, these kind of stories are the hardest to write and think of. I give my bow to the author of Baccano. 
 
Art: 10 
The art wasn't exactly a clean one, neither was it a graphical innovation. However, the art was detailed and well-expressed. In the scenes where a sense of terror had to be expressed, the characters' facial expressions wonderfully summed up the situation. Moreover, the swift movements of the battle scenes of the characters were beautifully shown, so much that it was as if seeing two actual people clash inside the monitor. 
 
Sound: 10 
The opening of Baccano, Roses&Guns, is one of the few instrumental openings. These kinds of openings are often frowned upon or dodged by the aniime industries because their adversary drops down with their ""boring"" openings. However, Baccano's composer did a wonderful job of expressing the witty and comedic everyday life of the mafias. It uses the sax to express the mood of the 18th and 19th century and fast tunes to express the twisting series of events. 
Moreover, the soundtracks were all kicked in at the right time, and neither was it too frequent. The anime displayed the right songs at right times, and silenced at right times. For example, for a mysterious mood, the bass played a low-pitched plucks followed by high-pitched violins, adding up to the mysterious mood. 
 
Character: 10 
Going back to the first question, who is the main character of the story? Is he/she the center of the story? No! Baccano shows the quality of the main character by proving that even the central character of the story could not be the main character because he/she lacks ""main-characterishness"".  However, really, the main character in the story is everyone! The author showed that everyone is his/her own main character in their own story. By holding more than one story in one series, this anime was able to establish every character as his/her own main character. 
Speaking of establishing, the anime does an amazing job of establishing all characters. It never leaves out a character. It develops all characters, major or minor and not ""fires"" the extras just because they are extras. This kind of character development is one of the hardest and the most tricky kind, but Baccano was able to pull it off. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Although the series as a whole is a story of mafias, the anime is never too dark or too light. It contains the right amount of composure while kicking in some slapstick comedies and interesting development. By either using the ""basic"" comedy characters or displaying an interesting yet quite comical development, the anime never takes the viewers deep into the abyss. 
 
Baccano is an interesting anime. Certainly it doesn't have the best animators in the world, nor does it have the best reviews in the world, but it does have an amazing hook and non-chronological twists that keeps the viewers' heart beating. For that, I shall give 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Baccano is one of those series where it leaves you laughing in the beginning, perplexed in the middle, and on the edge of your seat by the end of each episode. It has the kind of story where it gives you pieces of the story here and there allowing you to guess the main plot of the series, without spoiling it for you. It jumps from each characters own unique story to a bigger story where they all seemed to be connected. 
 
The main attraction of the series is the very colorful cast of characters that all play a role in the  plot. They range from to questionable protagonists, to obvious antagonists, to indifferent characters who you can't tag the word protagonist or antagonist... yet. But  judging from the plot pieces, your the one to decided who is a hero or a villain. 
 
The English dub is also a note worthy part of the series. Since the setting is placed in many parts of America many decades ago, it's only natural to have a well rounded English cast right? Each character has a slight accent to his or her voice imitating accents different parts of America. Which makes this English dub very unique.  
 
So if your in for something new with a interesting plot and memorable characters. Maybe Baccano is something you might want to add to your collection.

9,732,107,5.713714239,A group of people living together,Vampire Hunter D,"10,000 years in the future, the world has become a very different place; monsters roam the land freely, and people, although equipped with high tech weapons and cybernetic horses, live a humble life more suited to centuries past. The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","While walking her guard rounds in the country, Doris Lang, the orphaned daughter of a deceased werewolf hunter, is attacked and bitten by Count Magnus Lee, a 10,000-year-old, long-lost vampire lord (also known as a Noble) for trespassing in his domain.
Doris later encounters a mysterious vampire hunter, known only as D. Infected from Count Lee's bite, she hires D to kill the vampire and save her from becoming one. While in town with D and her younger brother Dan, Doris is confronted by Greco Roman. Greco is the mayor's son and promises to help if he has Doris for himself, but she refuses. D requests that the authorities, including Greco's father, the town sheriff, and Dr. Feringo, should hold off Doris’ incarceration at the local asylum until he kills Count Lee.
That night, Doris's farm is attacked by Rei Ginsei, Count Lee's servant, and L'Armica, Count Lee's daughter, who is highly prejudiced against humans and dhampirs. During the battle, Rei reveals he has the ability to twist space around him. Because of this powers, D's attacks are redirected onto himself. Fortunately, D turns out to be a dhampir and can recover in seconds. After defeating the vampires, he orders them to leave with a warning to Count Lee. The next day, D travels to Count Lee's castle and attempts to confront him. Aided by the symbiote in his Left Hand, D holds his own against the Count's monstrous minions. Doris is then kidnapped by Rei and brought to the Count. Using his vampiric powers, D rescues Doris and escapes the castle.
Later, Greco overhears a meeting. In it, a messenger from Count Lee gives Rei a candle with Time-Bewitching Incense, a substance powerful enough to weaken anyone with vampire blood. Rei takes Dan hostage to lure D out into the open, and D comes to his rescue, cutting off Rei's hand in the process and discovering that the candle is a fake. Meanwhile, Dr. Feringo turns out to be a vampire in league with Count Lee. He leads Doris into a trap but is killed by L'Armica after requesting to share Doris with the Count. Greco, who stole the candle from Rei, then appears and uses it to weaken L'Armica and cause Doris pain (likely due to her own infection). He is then shot at by Dan and falls down a cliff. Afterwards, Doris, who has by now fallen for D, tries to convince him to live with her and embraces him. This triggers D's vampire side, and he forces her away from him, unwilling to bite her.
The next morning, Rei kills Greco and uses the real candle to weaken D. Rei then mortally wounds the vampire hunter with a wooden stake. Doris is captured and taken back to the castle. Rei requests that the Count give him eternal life as a member of the Nobility, but is coldly rebuffed for his past failures. This makes Rei become enraged.
As a mutant attempts to devour D's comatose body, his Left Hand revives him just in time for him to kill the monster. As the processional for the Count and Doris’ wedding takes place, Dan infiltrates the castle and attempts to attack Lee. Unfortunately, he fails and falls into a chasm before being saved by Rei, who has switched sides. Rei attempts to weaken the Count with the candle. However, Lee is too powerful and destroys it with his telekinetic abilities before killing Rei. Before Doris can be bitten by the Count, D appears and fights Lee. D's attacks are futile due to Lee's psychic abilities. About to be killed, D unleashes his own telekinetic power and succeeds in stabbing Lee in the heart. With Lee dying, his castle begins crumbling. D tries to persuade L'Armica into living as a human, but she chooses to die with her father and stays in the castle as it falls.
D, Doris, and Dan escape the collapsing castle. D then sets off under a now clear blue sky. Doris, now recovered from her bite, and Dan, bid D goodbye as he looks back briefly at them and smiles.
","From start to finish this movie is a true miracle.  Vampire Hunter D is a movie that if you consider your self a fan of anime you must see to be credible.  The monsters, the gore, the story, the atmosphere, the themes, the setting...all done so wonderfully. 
 
The art is amazing, though dates, nobody can deny this hand drawn gem.  The way shadow is illustrated is so uniwue and japanese you will think your mind is playing tricks on you and hallucinating.  The cross hatch work is something that is so hard to replicate.   
 
D is a great character too.  Watching him interact with this bleak, evil, daunting, and demonic world of the future is so good for some reason. I don't know, maybe it is just a nice shot of the 80s for me when I watch this but it is truly my favorite vampire flick ever.  I have seen them all and it is like the ultimate adventure/hammer,george a romero, amano, artistic, syphony of true grit cult horror.  Science fiction, post apocolypyic future, horror, adventure, western (in some of the direction surrounding D), and pure classic japenese master swordsman are just a few of the genres this movie reps with authority. 
 
I would really challenge anyone to give me a negative point of this movie.  The last scene run through the castle is one of the best climaxes in film period.  Watch this!

          
 
       Helpful NARRATIVE: 5/10 
 
This anime would likely have been better off as a short series rather than a movie. (I do realize this comes from a Light Novel though). There simply wasn't enough room to develop the characters and plot enough, leading to plot holes, underdeveloped side stories, and poor viewer engagement. The story itself was pretty good though, and the pacing was about as good as it could be for such an ambitious story in a measly 1 hr. 20 min time frame. The action scenes were enjoyable albeit a little short; They could've been utilized in a better way to deliver the plot, but they are largely inconsequential. 
 
 
CHARACTERS: 3/10 
 
As stated in the narrative section, character development was quite poor due to there simply not being enough time to develop them. After finishing the film I still have no idea who ""D"" really is or why he's killing vampires, and the ""relationship"" between D and Doris was nascent at best; I would've liked to see it pushed a little more. The character that got the worst treatment however was Ds talking sentient face-hand. What was this thing? Zero information is given on what he is, what he does, or why he even exists. His only significance to the plot is delivering snarky dialogue and eating spiders and dirt (?) to save D when he's in a pickle; although I admit it's a pretty cool character concept. At least the evil two vampire siblings were well written. Ramika started gaining some humanity throughout the film, and realized she is more than just vampire, and Rei-Ginsei vainly tried to increase his family standing which ultimately lead to his demise. 
 
 
PRESENTATION: 7.5/10 
 
The animation is pretty alright, I wan't blown away by it, but it definitely did it's job. The art however is where this anime really shines. everything was well drawn with plenty detail, and the character designs are done by the king himself Amano Yoshitaka. It was able to pull off the extremely dark Gothic Castlevania-like setting with great justice. All-in-all the setting combined with the visual themes and gory violence really makes for an immersive and memorable atmosphere. Of particular note is the scene when D walks through the hallway with all the wonderfully portrayed grotesque rows of macabre monsters, which really solidified the mood for me. 
 
 
SOUND: 5/10 
 
I watched the dubbed version on VHS, which I suppose had decent voice acting for the time. It wasn't that great honestly but I didn't let it affect my enjoyment too much. I don't typically care or put much thought into music or SFX in anime, but of particular note in this anime is lack of music in a lot of parts, which I think helped contribute to the desolate feeling of the world. 
 
 
OVERALL: 5.0/10 
 
Vampire Hunter D was a real treat for the eyes and left quite the impression on me, it has good character design, pretty cool fight scenes and plenty of violence and gore, but is plagued with severely underdeveloped characters, plot holes, and is far too short.

          
 
       Helpful First off I do not like vampire stories. 
I just have a hard time buying into the idea of them. 
Sesame Street's ""The Count"" ruined it for me I think. 
That or Count Chocula.... 
 
But the idea is interesting.... 
Style dated... 
but there are other anime's of more interest. 
 
That is not to say I would refuse to see it with friends if they wanted to see it. 
Heck, at least its not a DBZ show!

","This is actually one of those anime which is  more relatable to an actual cartoon with a little more depth,drama and hint of  manga styled comedy the violence is just hilarious  half of the time they're just shooting and blasting everything on sight. 
 
This show sadly never made it outside Asia or at least in any eng speaking region so this isn't much popular on the web only thing you can actually find about this show is some bootlegs VCD's or youtube videos no torrents or live streams sorry. 
 
Story:7/10 
 
The story in this show opens and ends in a very old styled fashion like ranma1/2 story isn't really cohesive as it is chaotic like tom&Jerry you know its  just about a housecat its not going to break new grounds. 
 
No matter how crazy the premise gets there isn't really much to the story other than kuro getting into constant trouble and saving his elderly owners which ensures hilarity. 
 
Animation:7/10 
 
It is very basic&simple  but its not too cheap either simple character designs make it easy for comedic purposes and the animation studio didn't really have good funding considering that they got bankrupt and cancelled the show so give them a break. 
 
Sound:7/10 
 
Japanese voice acting is good as far as i've seen in subbed episodes Kuro chan is actually voiced by the same voice actor as Agumon from digimon besides the music is very catchy and lighthearted. 
 
Characters:7/10 
 
Kuro: He's the main character who has a short temper and skills to build something from complete scrap yep just like Wile.E.Coyote he can build a giant turbo propelled car out of simple hunk of scrap. 
 
Grandparents: Kuro's owners who are quite simply are not aware of anything going around and are constantly getting kidnapped because of kuro,kinda like Eustace&muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog. 
 
MI-KUN: Well i'm not Japanese so i thought his name was just ""Mikun"" turns out ""Kun"" is a Japanese honorific he's the cat who can shapeshift by attaching metal things to his body and and he can even fuse with kuro he's very gentle and shy unlike kuro. 
 
Nana: An eccentric table lamp turned into a girl robot who's lovesick with a Housecat.. LOL the hilarity  
 
Dr. Go:He's the cliched evil scientist who made kuro into a cyborg though he's not really that evil and actually ends up helping kuro all the time and all the villains are mostly just goofy except for one that is a devil virus. 
 
Matatabi:Well he's a ""Rough"" kitty who has a history with kuro and is  actually NOT A cyborg and yet can talk.. yep its very much like a cartoon now. 
 
Kotaro: A boy Genius who for some reason is obsessed with Kuro and usually hangs around with Dr.GO 
 
Overall:7/10 
 
If you're a fan of anime like Tokyo pig or shinchan or  just a fan of old school anime/cartoon with some comedy you can have plenty of fun with this show.

","Story 
At present, sadly, the story is nothing progressive like the last seasons of this series; I find at present the basis is on an obsession between Part 1 and Party 2. There isn't much depth, not much background - It seems more of a drama than a reverse harem romance at this point, which disappointed me greatly. 
 
Art 
As per past seasons, I enjoy the art style very much. Eyes are expressive, backgrounds are detailed nicely and there's always a beautiful amount of color and nice effects during the songsy parts. 
 
Sound 
The music so far hasn't disappointed, which is a relief considering the anime is based around music. However, the songs are just ""alright"". They didn't blow me away like in previous seasons - Episode 6, thankfully, kept to that standard however. 
 
Character 
Sadly, this is what frustrates me most about this season of Uta No Prince Sama - The characters we all know and love are either OOC (Out of Character), or are getting absolutely no development other than their obsession with their competition. Nanami, whom I adored as the heroine for having a voice and a part in the previous seasons, barely shows up and has little to no dialogue from episode to episode. Again, episode 6 made up for that a bit, but up until then I've never been so unhappy with how a new season has come out. Considering the appearance of Heavens and the clear conflict that was present during Season 2, I was expecting a lot more - Though it is interesting to get a take on their group's personalities, what with the addition of members, I would never take that over keeping the personalities of the characters I already love. Bland and tasteless. 
 
Enjoyment 
My expectations for the show in general were high, considering everything Uta no Prince Sama has previously dished out. Season to Season, I've had nothing but a thirst for more, and have been thrilled when it was announced time and again that they would continue their series. The most recent one, I've been especially excited; I figured with a whole other group of antagonist men, things could get interesting. Maybe I would sit on the edge of my seat, awaiting what was to come. I've been disappointed, clearly. 
 
Overall 
Up until episode 6 at present, this barely qualifies as a decent anime; and I only say that because it breaks my heart to speak badly about an anime I've loved for so long. However, I can't accept the lack of character in general/at all with our Starish crew, the void where Nanami should be, and the progression of story that allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the show. As I've mentioned, episode 6 is starting to show more promise, so for any fan of previous Uta No Prince Sama seasons looking to avoid disappoint, I recommend you start there. I'm deeply hopeful that with the next few episodes, things adjust properly. 
 
(P.S. The first episode still kind of makes me laugh xD Random buggers) 
 
*Update* The anime has become increasingly disappointing and at this point is absolutely not worth watching for an Uta No Prince Sama fan, nor fo a Reverse Harem/Romance fan. At this time, the anime is moving forward in the same way as Free! or any other sports anime, with bits of yaoi innuendo within.  
 
I have no issues with yaoi (positively love it, actually), but this is not what I came to see with this anime. The OOC tendencies have only gotten worse, and episode 6 is the only saving grace at this point. With most Uta seasons ending around 13 episodes - Leaving only 5 left to air - This anime has no chance of getting any better unless the sky comes crashing to the ground. I'm severely disappointed and would not recommend this anime to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Sooo plot-wise it isn't anything deep or hard to undestand like ""D.Gray-Man"" for example but this is an otome game turned anime so we have to keep in mind that no Uta no Prince-sama series can dive down the proverbial 'story slash rabbit' hole because it's main purpose is and will always be to promote the games and reel in the fans with the bishies.  
 
However for a game turned anime, I have to confess that they have done an unbelievably enjoyable creation that not only gives you a good feel of the characters without giving away too much but also managed to mesh the characters from the different routes into very cohesive and interesting units. Which is one of the MOST important aspects to consider when tackling this particular type of an anime. If we take the anime ""Amnesia"" as one example, another otome game with an anime, we get the feeling that the storyline is all over the place with different scenes from the characters routes overtaking the episodes and disabling us from getting a good grasp on them. It has some merit points of course, as I have enjoyed it's high rate art style and extraordinary in my opinion opening song, which I love a lot, but for the life of me I just could not get a good understanding of the male characters no matter how hard I tried and thus the anime lost its main purpose - to make the watchers interested in the game. Somehow it was still better than the disaster that was ""Diabolik Lovers"", whose only redeeming point was the intriguing colour pallete for the characters that slowly turned into my favourite and the opening song. If they had incorporated more of the game plot and explained things, instead of just pushing on with the blood sucking scenes as its main 'priority', I believe it would have turned out a bit more decent than just eye candy and a treat to its hardcore game fans. I mostly gained interest in the games from their songs, wiki information and fan reviews than the anime, which had almost no purpose. I could go on with this but I rambled off topic long enough. 
 
 
The Utapri series as a whole and not just this particular season have achieved their main purpose but done it in such a way that the anime has managed to stand almost next to the game, as if with its own entity. The males aren't all over the main heroine nonstop and she has a set goal that she doesn't stray from, which creates more room for development unlike with every other harem anime I've seen up till now be it a normal harem or a reverse one. It gets sickening and annoying after a while so I am very happy to announce that the romance in this series gets less and isn't overbearing at all. Cheers to the creators!! I apploud you for managing that near impossible feat! And the refreshing new concept completely seperate from the stand alone routes that is STARISH brought out a whole new prospect for development that both game fans and non game fans can enjoy without confusing the audience in any way, shape or form. The characters are fleshed out just enough to make us interested in them without giving away their route information. The voice actors are all complimenting the characters and just doing a wonderful job, they always have strong and vivid openings, whereas the endings promote the final song and every song throughout the episodes is built up on in its personal episode, making it even better. The plot is light and different from the game, avoiding the confusion caused by combining all routes and in general promotes the games leaving everybody happy. 
 
As a side note, every season had its own set goal to reach at the end and now that everything important has been introducen or at least pointed out, there might be more focus put on the development of or between the characters, while dishing out equally great song that cater moslty to the set pop criteria of the series. After all, the three groups have been fully introduced, along with the academy and the master course so now there is a lot of room for development. The first season will always remain the best plot-wise as it brought out the main aspects of the anime along with just being the first season of a great series but I believe that each season has its own set goal at the finish line and has achieved the point it wanted to get across - such as introducing the aformentioned groups and main aspects, whilst still being a great season on its own. Of course the heroine is bland for the most part but again for the thousand time this is an anime from a game so she HAS to be like that. It's a set standart for these types of animes simply so that every male character can somehow fit with her. I honestly have no complaints on any season so far. 
 
On a personal note, skip it if you wish, this series has been able to pull me out of my depression a couple times and it was what brought Miyano Mamoru to light for me. His songs as Ichinose Tokiya left me wanting more songs with his voice and now I have a decently packed playlist saved on Youtube, which is getting deleted all the time to my heartfelt rage. And if by some miracle the creators of the Uta no Prince-sama games are actually reading my review then heed my plea and translate at least one of your games in english already. It's been years and Diabolik Lovers came out after your games if I am not mistaken but they have two of their games already translated (and I am set on buying the first one to finally understand the plot as it interests me and the anime was a near complete zero). I'm not alone in this either. Many wish to buy them if they ever get an english release. Unfortunately Japanese is not taught at schools on a general principle, very few do so and everybody has their own wall preventing them from being able to start learning the language. 
 
I give my thank you to anyone who read this long ass review but I needed to get it off my chest ^.^'

          
 
       Helpful I did enjoy the anime, but after the second season it became a bit boring. There is not really a plot after the second season, as you know that all of the main characters are going to fall in love with the main protagonist, every single one of them. I mean the main group thats fine, but having Quartet Night and HE★VENS also wanting her, gets a bit boring and just leaves you hoping that it will actually end soon, or progresses with a plot.  
 
I liked the art style of the anime and manga, its definitely one of my favorites.  
 
I thought that the music from anime was amazing. I enjoy all of the opening soundtracks and most of the character songs. They are well thought out and appeal to a wide audience. Its a shame that most of the songs from season one have been taken off from youtube.  
 
The characters are good but in this season, HE★VENS do copy ST☆RISH's characters a bit. for example; Nagi and Natsuki. They both have the cute and adorable personality, whilst one is rude and one has a split personality, which is also rude. Do you see where im coming from? But apart from the clashing of the personalitys, the characters have a really good back story. 
 
Overall, i actually watch the anime for the music, tbh. The storyline does both me a little, but i put that behind me when new music is shown.

9,614,110,5.681984488,A group of people living together,Okusama wa Mahou Shoujo,"Ureshiko Asaba, 26 years old, married. Few people know the fact that she is a magical girl named ""Agnes"", and she is actually the guardian of the town where she lives. One day she meets Sayaka Kurenai, aka ""Cruje"", another magical girl appointed by the magic realm as the legitimate sucessor to her position, but Agnes is reluctant in letting her assume because she knows that Cruje has orders to erase the whole place, including its human inhabitants with the purpose of creating a new one. To complicate matters, Ureshiko must deal with the growing distance between her and her husband, Tamotsu, her crescent feelings for Tatsumi Kagura, a young man who is now living as a tenant in her home, and the fact that in the moment she ever kisses a common human, she would lose her powers forever.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Magic', 'Romance']","On the surface, Ureshiko Asaba appears to be a 26-year-old housewife who helps to run a boarding house. In reality she is a magical girl from the world of Realm. When she transforms into her magical girl persona, Ureshiko is called Agnes Bell, and her job is to protect the Wonderland—an artificial town created by her mother, who protected the town in the same way many years ago.
One day another magical girl appears from Realm—Cruje Gapp has been sent to replace Ureshiko as the manager of the town, as Ureshiko has become too old. However, if Agnes relinquishes her responsibility, the town as it stands will vanish and be remade according to Cruje's wishes, which goes against all of Agnes's beliefs. Agnes refuses to hand over the Managerial Ring to Cruje, which is the only item powerful enough to begin the town's transformation. In the end, Cruje is forced to give up, and enrolls in a local middle school under the alias Sayaka Kurenai while biding her time.
However, this is not Ureshiko's only problem—she and her husband have grown distant after she refuses to kiss him after having sexual relationships, and she start to flirt with Tatsumi Kagura, a young man who is lodging in her home.
","Okusama wa Mahou Shoujo was one of the big surprises of the 2005 summer season. When I first heard of the show, it first reminded me of the 1960&rsquo;s U.S. Television Series, Bewitched. But I'm happy to say that it turned out to be a very different type of show. I am not a fan of magical girl anime, but I really enjoyed this one. It was nice to see a show that was as character driven as much as it was. Personally, I did not find the fan-service offensive but it was repetitive. Other than a couple of places where stock footage was used with out checking for continuity, I have no complaints. 
 
The quality of the Seiyuu cast in this show is outstanding. Inoue Kikuko, who best known for the voice of Mizuho from Onegai Teacher &amp; Belldandy from AA! Megami Sama has just the right voice for the lead female character, Asaha Ureshiko. Kishio Daisuke, who has voiced such characters as Chitose from Happy Lesson and Suginami in Da Capo, does a great job as Kagura Tatsumi, the main male character. 
 
This is one that I will recommend it to anybody, even if they don't really care for magical girl anime that much. Overall very good production from JC Staff and excellent Seiyuu performances makes this a definite buy when it comes out on R1 disks

          
 
       Helpful Tatsumi Kagura is a young college student who had a promising career as a professional athlete ahead of him... up until he injured himself, and had to leave school. He gets a job working at a publishing company in a boring city called Wonderland, and finds a new home at a nearby boarding house. It’s here that he meets Ureshiko Asaba, the granddaughter of the house’s manager. She’s older than he is, but she’s kind and gentle, and he soon begins to fall for her. But little does he know what kind of tightly guarded secrets are standing between them. 
 
For you see, Ureshiko is really Agnes Bell, a magical girl from another world, and the reason she can never return his feelings is because it would only take a single kiss to rob her of all of her magic powers, for the rest of her life. 
 
Now, on the surface, this may seem like yet another schmaltzy little fanservice-fest, a borderline harem with the barest ghint of a will-theyp-won’t-they plot to hold some semblance of a story together, and that the magical girl element is only there to justify a bunch of highly sexualized transformation sequences. But the truth is, this well runs surprisingly deep. 
 
For starters, Ureshiko is 26 years old, at least ten years older than your typical magical girl, which makes the transformation sequences significantly less creepy than they could have been. Directly related to this is the fact that a much younger, more traditionally aged magical girl has come to Ureshiko’s territory to force her into retirement and assume her position. And for some reason, this girl has little to no regard for the safety of non-magical people. 
 
Oh, and that kiss thing? It isn’t just some silly little tension builder. There are actual consequences to it. See, the other thing about Ureshiko that prevents her from loving Kagura is the fact that she’s still married to another man, to whom her marriage actually crumbled due to her inability to kiss him. They’re separated, but not divorced properly, and yes, he’s involved with another woman. 
 
Yeah. Didn’t expect THAT out of your harem romp, did you? 
 
Okusama had a moderate animation budget, but it was managed extremely well... Still frames are used sparingly, where they mostly won’t be noticed, so that the bulk of the budget could be dumped into some amazing action scenes and hilarious motion cycles. It’s fluid and graceful when it needs to be, but never goes too far overboard, placing every single yen where it belongs. 
 
The artwork is just that... It’s art. The backgrounds are highly detailed, to the point that every single landscape... Even those that are only on screen for seconds at a time... Appears to have taken hours to complete. The blend of colors is elegant and precise, giving an impression of almost gritty realism to it. The character designs are also colorful, attractive, and well thought out. In short, this anime looks really pretty. 
 
I’m afraid I can’t talk about the dub, because after nine years, there still isn’t an English dub to speak of. The subs sounded great, though my American ears aren’t entirely reliable. I can tell you, if nothing else, that the seiyou for Ureshiko and her estranged husband give performances that were nothing short of perfect. Everything else sounded like typical anime voicings, so I guess no comment is a good comment. 
 
But as pretty as it may be, no anime can stand on it’s own without good writing... Well, except for Angel Beats, but that’s another review. Anyway, when it comes to Okusama’s writing, the first thing about it that really strikes me is how mature it is. I don’t mean mature as in ‘tons of adult content,’ I mean mature as in... Mature. The characters are mostly adults, dealing with complex problems that a lot of similar anime wouldn’t even consider as possible topics. They grow and develop in ways that don’t become evident to the viewer until after the fact, and yes, all of our noteworthy characters have gone through some very distinct changes by the end of it’s thirteen episode run. There’s no true villain to this story, just opposing viewpoints that clash endlessly with no true compromise in sight. nobody is completely right, nobody is completely wrong, and as you learn more about the situation brewing between them, you’ll find yourself constantly shifting between sides. The romance is also handled really well, developed at a steady pace, with just enough reasonable doubt to make the end result feel a lot less predictable than it should have felt. 
 
I don’t want to give away any serious spoilers, but the plot evolves and develops just as gradually as the characters do Every single twist is delivered naturally, without a hint of exposition, and as each layer is peeled, it’ll reveal just enough information about what’s going on to leave you hungry for the next one. Although this could also be considered Okusama’s biggest downfall, as several really important questions are dangled in front of us for a really cruel amount of time without ever being answered. 
 
Okusama carries a very strong theme about growing up, and how difficult it can be to leave your former self behind in the process. This is explored not only through the perspective of the individual giving up her old responsibilities to a younger generation, but also from the perspective of that younger generation, as she takes on the pressure of the older generation’s responsibilities, leaving behind all sense of ego as she does so. It teaches that time doesn’t wait for anyone, and that as long as both generations can trust and respect each other, they may just be able to live together in harmony. 
 
Okusama wa Mahou Shoujo... Or the literal translation, Madam is a Magical Girl; Bewitched Agnes, is a very obscure anime series from 2005. It’s never been licensed for an English distribution, so I unfortunately cannot recommend watching it in any kind of legal way. It took me a long time to find a sub that wasn’t in French, and it wasn’t even a very well translated one. You can find it at Anime1.com, and trust me, if there was a legal way to watch it, I’d be recommending that instead. You can also buy the Malaysian bootleg off of Ebay, but the quality of those things are always a gamble. 
 
Bewitched Agnes... Which is the name I’ve come to assign to it... Is a very mature, well written show that offers a surprisingly gripping experience. It falls apart towards the end, starting with a somewhat insulting deus-ex-machina event, and slowly losing all sense of the dark, pyschologically complex reveals that it could have easily reached. It’s a fun ride, but we never learn anything substantial about the magical world, or about Wonderland’s relationship to it, or how this bizarre system came to be in the first place. And that’s a pretty big blight on an otherwise perfect series. Some people won’t mind this, but for me, it drops the show down by about two points to an overall score of 8/10.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Harem', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","There is an organization called the Arcana Famiglia, which protects the island of Regalo (Italian for ""gift"" or ""present""). The Famiglia is made up of people who have made contracts with Arcana cards, and have received special abilities due to this. On his birthday celebration, Mondo has decided it is time for him to retire and give up his title to a new boss who has control over an Arcana. To decide who in the ""family"" gets this title, he calls for a tournament, called the Arcana Duello, between Arcana users. To the winner, he promises the title of ""Papa"", a wish of the winner's choice and his daughter's hand in marriage. Refusing to accept this, Felicità decides to fight to choose her own path, with Libertà and Nova fighting for her freedom by her side.
","Ooh Arcana Famiglia. I really wanted to enjoy this series...and to begin with, I actually did. 
 
The setup was sublime. A mafia-esque vigilante organisation, known as The Family, is dedicated to protecting the port town of Regalo. Many members of the Family have made deals with the ""Arcana"", granting them abilities based on different tarot cards. Okay, interesting... 
 
The head of the family announces he wishes to retire from his role and choose an heir by means of a grand tournament, in which all Family members with Arcana powers must duel until only the victor remains, who will become the new ""Papa"" of the family...and have his daughter Felicite's hand in marriage. Felicite violently objects to this sudden announcement, but has no way out of it unless she either wins the tournament herself, or the new Head of the Family grants her freedom. 
 
Felicite's two close friends, the rebellious Liberta and the moody Nova, both agree to grant Felicte's freedom if either of them win the tournament...even though both of them appear to share feelings for the girl, and constantly compete for her approval. 
 
It was a great setup, with a solid concept and characters that weren't wholly original, but mostly likeable. The style is crisp with a pleasant colour scheme that gives is a classy but lively atmosphere. 
 
Unfortunately, in time it became clear that the series suffers from two CRIPPLING faults: 
 
1) Felicite is NOT a protagonist. A protagonist is supposed to be a driving force the moves the plot forward and who's actions are most influential to the story. However, Felicite, whilst certainly the FOCUS, does not exert any kind of force on the plot. She stands around, looks cutely puzzled or asks questions, and doesn't actually do anything unless promted to do so by another character. And it does beg the question: Why does she consider independence so valuable when she seems incapable of making independent decisions? Why is she so bothered about losing her freedom when she seems quite happy to just do what everyone tells her to do anyway? Now, this COULD have been an incredibly original and fascinating approach to a tired concept, and raised questions about the value of freedom for freedom's sake, or if there's any shame in admitting when you can't live the independent life you desire. Unfortunately it eventually became apparent that Felicite was just a poorly written protagonist with all the impact of a wet flannel, and hinging dangerously on looking like a fan-made Mary Sue. 
 
2) And by far worse: The series seems to be under the delusion that just MENTIONING a good idea is enough to constitute entertainment. It's...honestly a very unusual habit. It will bring up a fascinating concept or a promising plot point and then...forget about it. Case in point: The Family is referred to as a kind of vigilante organisation, and yet we barely see ANY vigilante activity throughout the whole series, they just become a bunch of characters in suits for no reason. Similarly, many of the arcana powers are mentioned, but go entirely unused. Even the tournament, which is set up as the main concept, is forgotten about until the end of the whole series!! But perhaps the most shocking example of this is when one character reveals an experiment he's been working on...I'll keep spoilers out of it, but suffice to say it is a pretty major project with staggering ethical ramifications and with massive potential effects on the whole Arcana concept. What happens to this experiment? Never mentioned or alluded to again. Ever. In any form. Like I said, the series believes that it just needs to mention a good idea to get an audience's attention, and then either forgets to follow through with it or doesn't believe it needs to. Some backstories never come to fruition, ideas are never explored, and a mass of potential is painfully squandered. 
 
So, combine a weak protagonist with some extremely clumsy ""idea-only"" storytelling, and an entire tournament that feels like it was forgotten about and then slapped togehter at the last minute...and you can imagine that the ending of this show didn't leave me with a good taste in my mouth. 
 
This show had so much potential, soo muuuch!! The setup was golden, the concept presented lots of possibilities, and most of the characters (Felicite aside) were actually very likeable and interesting, especially Debito, Pace and Luca. Even the humour, which is often a weak aspect in most anime, was pretty solid, either focusing on amusing character interactions or some well-timed slapstick. I also loved the picturesque, European design of Regalo, which created a very distinct setting. 
 
But ultimately, all that was good about Arcana Famiglia was quickly buried by the efforts of overly-excited writers throwing in plot points and ideas without bothering to think how they'd tie into the story and how they'd resolve. 
 
A promising start that came to a bitter, frustrating end, and is only enjoyable on its most shallow level.

          
 
       Helpful Watching Arcana Familga is like reading an autobiography, you know..the sort of book a person writes about his or own life and it is usually full of all sorts of boring details. In any case, Arcana Famiglia is a strange series from the start.  
 
La Storia Della Arcana Famiglia details a group of people who have made contracts with the Arcana cards to obtain special abilities in his or her own rights. On the birthday of the head of household, the Father decides to host a tournament -  a series of duels known as the  Arcana Duello, between Arcana-users. It is every one for themselves because it's winner takes all.  
 
Apparently, the series' promo depicts around a tournament but half way now through the series, what do we have? 
 
- cat/neko chasing 
- babysitting  
- rivalries between two of the main characters in a boring love triangle that has little flavor 
 
At any rate, this series is not exactly the smash of the season and shouldn't be especially with throwing in fillers at the very get go.  
 
The series continuously avoid the major story of the series but instead throws fillers at your face like apple pies. But the story is not as tasty. It lacks flavor of an apple pie because they are all fillers from the beginning. Although later on, we do see some storyline development (chiefly flashbacks), the main story so far is avoided. Furthermore, it seems that the flashbacks are cliched and stereotyped. Honestly, who on Earth is planning on sitting through over four episodes to watch some flashbacks? We want to see some movement and drama with the main arc!  
 
Luckily though, the character designs are cool. And of course, they need to be especially since everything up to this point has been focused on the characters of the tournament (you know, the one that hasn't yet officially begun yet). But towards the finale (yes the very last episode), the duel is finally presented. Even the duel itself has some problems though with one of the main characters actually withdrawing while other battles between our cute pigtailed girl being way too short and no flavor. 
 
Felicità is the main heroine of the series, the  holder of The Lovers arcana, which gives her the ability to read the hearts of others. She is spicy, she is cute, and she is to herself. And those little pigtails, who doesn't want to cuddle them? Beyond that though, she has some interesting interactions between two of the main characters, Libertà and Nova. 
 
That brings to their rivalry. 
 
It seems that Libertà and Nova often gets into fights like ying and yang. Just look at it. Every five minutes in the series, they fight out and competes sometimes over absolutely nothing. Libertà is depicted as the hot headed guy while Nova remains his cool. (most of the time) Regardless though, it gets old after watching it over 9000 times. Besides, there's already rivalries similar to this without the l for love in a certain ongoing series. Perhaps the Tail of the Fairies ring a bell?  
 
The other characters of the series seem to be like background characters of a stage play so far despite their cool appearances. The bold headed guy who has the ace hands of a bazooka, the cool level headed guy with the eye patch, and the mysterious Jolly with his shades. I'm sure they will eventually get the opportunity to shine but so far, it's not happening. Besides maybe Jolly, everything seems so stale between the background characters. Yup, the apple pie is once again losing its flavor. 
 
Luckily, there is some minor good flavors for this disappointing anime so far. The soundtrack, namely the opening  song of the series seems to play well in this series.  
 
Magenta Another Sky"" by Hitomi Harada is well orchestrated and depicts the Arcana-users showing off some of their abilities in the sequences. The music is also catchy and as one of the first series to watch on Sundays, it's a pretty damn good way to start off the week, at least in the music department. 
 
The art is also colorful in this series. It gives off an Italian like atmosphere and overall, demonstrated well with the cool looking characters, some backgrounds, and the mansion where the family stays at.  
 
Overall, to enjoy this series, you'd have to be a real brave fighter, one that is very patient and ignores the fillers but instead concentrate on other aspects of the ""story"". The first half of the series isn't one of the best ways to start off this originally hyped series. The ""story"" moves like a turtle and the apple pie is losing its touch. It's not too surprising that J.C. Staff's expectations didn't live up to the hype.  
 
With all the filler episodes going on and the ""story"" moving so damn slow, it's no surprise that some people have dropped it. There should be limits on how to start a potential series but in this case, Arcana wasted it. It brings up boring sequences from the get go and fails to deliver anything unique to the viewers. While the art and music/Op song does somewhat makes up for this, it so far is anything but special. J.C. Staff you disappoint. No one likes reading an autobiography and especially of a series that originally had potential.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful La storia della Arcana Famiglia, most known by, simply, Arcana Famiglia, is a mafia anime. It's a so much interesting theme, don't you think? All these men with suits, guns and power atmosphere. All their mystery and charm, inherent of a mafia member surely will come with good characters and great stories, yeah? Yeah, the characters are great but the story... Uh... Keep reading and you will know what I'm talking... 
 
In begining, you're introduced to Felicitá, the only daughter of Mondo, the mafia chef in Regalo island. This place has a lot of beauty and a safe population because the mafia efforts are much effective. But the members of this mafia have something more special than guns and knifes, they have Arcana powers, some type of magic controlled by emotions. Each Arcana power is based on a Tarocco card and Felicitá, our protagonist, has the power of Gli Amanti, the power of heart. She's a courageous and pretty girl, but she can't decide her own destiny because her father announced the Arcana Duello, a duel for all the Arcana users to decide who will be the next chef and who will marry Felicitá. 
 
There is many guys wanting to win the Arcana Duello, specially Nova and Libertá. Nova is my favorite character, he's serious, shy and dedicated. Libertá is his opposite, funny, outgoing and irresponsible. They're Felicitá's best friends and their relationship are pretty well. Between them and Felicitá, of course. Nova and Libertá are mortal enemies. Another characters, like Luca, Felicitá's majordomo, Pace and Debito have funny moments and deep personalities. And Dante and Jolly too. I can bet that the characters will enchant you because I think that is the better point of this anime. My grade is 8, yeah! 
 
The art and sounds are bad. Yeah, I think they worked in low budget all this time and didn't get a good result in this side. I can't see a good match with the music and the rest of anime... Argh, I will not comment more nothing about this. Next topic. 
 
But the story is fair, we have a interesting plot, there's something uncommon in animes here: a girl with a lot of guys! (In the most, there is opposite, no?) 
If you are waiting action, give up. But if you want see good characters facing troubles and having fun, keep going. 
 
Arcana Famiglia is fun and that's all. A good distraction, a few episodes and a weekend of adventures are waiting for you. My overall is 6 and that's not bad. I hope I helped you with this review.

9,30187,112,5.650614992,A group of people living together,Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru,"When Shoutarou Tatewaki first meets Sakurako Kujou, he knows his life will never be the same. Initially believing her to be responsible for a disappearance in the neighborhood, he later learns of her true talent: analyzing bone specimens. Sakurako has quite the collection of reconstructed animal bones, but she wishes she had more of the human variety, much to the chagrin of those around her. 
 
Soon, Shoutarou begins accompanying the eccentric osteologist on the many different unsolved cases she comes across—usually in the form of decomposing bodies. But with so many incidents happening around them, could there be a larger mystery at work in their lives? 
 
 Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru  is a story of two unlikely partners, each showing in their own way that bones can tell how one died, but only people can tell how they lived. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]",['Mystery'],"Sakurako Kujō is a genius beauty in her mid-twenties whose life is centered around one thing and one thing only: bones. With little tolerance for others, she would be completely isolated in her study full of skeletons if it weren't for high school boy Shotaro—her new assistant and constant companion. Why exactly she has taken a shine to him remains a mystery, but one thing is clear: Whenever the two go out together, the chances are high that they will come across a human corpse.
","I don't know about you, but the whole ""mundane, reactionary dude and a sociopathic genius with a knack for solving mysteries "" set up has been rubbing me off as of late. I already had the atrocious ""Ranpo Kitan"" sear itself into my memory just weeks before Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation began, so realistically speaking (even with the cliche premise I described) the show could not be any worse. I sure as hell was right, but not by anywhere near as far a margin I would have liked.  
 
The mood Beautiful Bones goes for is a pretty strange blend between the macabre and the mundane varying one weekly episodic endeavour to another. To give you an idea, the script goes from murder mysteries to something as innocuous as finding out the final wishes of a dead grandmother. This is not really a problem to me in theory since it isn't uncommon for episodic titles to jump back, forth and sideways between tones, nor should it be discouraged. Bluntly put, it's just that the mysteries are either boring, badly written or both. Right off the bat the series asks for a high degree of suspension of disbelief when Sakurako arrives at a crime scene with human remains and is allowed to push around and belittle the police their despite the fact she lacks the credentials to even be at a crime scene to begin with, and it only gets worse from there. To further illustrate my problems with how mysteries are dealt with in Beautiful Bones, allow me to draw your attention to another episodic title starring a genius investigator, Master Keaton. It's a series where you could reasonably make a case for the main character being a ""Mary Sue"" in how his deductions are never wrong and the way in which he can competently handle all kinds of dangerous situations, but the reason why Master Keaton can get away with it is because the writers restrict Keaton's intellect to his broad areas of expertise as a human civilizations buff and a former British SAS soldier. That way you can, at least, buy that he would know how to do everything from identifying obscure pieces of jewelry to disarming criminals at close quarters. Sakurako, on the other hand, spends her entire life studying bones as an osteologist yet is sometimes able to draw random factoids convenient to the situation at hand. One moment she can be an expert on knot-tying, the next, a 19th-century paint aficionado. The emotional impact the show tries to go for with some of these stories is always hampered for one reason or another, whether it be the realization of how the characters bring misfortune due to their own stupidity, the pacing being rushed, or the mysteries themselves being just too low in stakes to care about (without good characters driving them) the show always found a way to leave me cold. 
 
If you watch Beautiful Bones for the character interactions, you may find yourself as disappointed as one looking for well-written mysteries. The only characters in the show worth wasting digital ink on are Sakurako and her sidekick Shoutarou. I already went into how Sakurako's Sakurako-isms are bad for the mysteries, but the character herself went someone I originally found to be mildly amusing to watch at 1st to one I found rather unlikeable by the end. There's a difference between being unsentimental and being outright cruel to people, and I was hoping that through her adventures with her social norm abiding sidekick she would come to find that line. Instead by the penultimate episode, Sakurako is still the type of person who would wave around bits of newly discovered human remains around the people that cared about the deceased. There's also some subplot regarding Sakurako's history with a dead younger brother which is continually hinted at, yet never gets any closure by the end, so much for that I guess. No better a character is her boring accessory Shoutarou, whose main role in the story is to be the voice of proper social etiquette to counterbalance Sakurako's wackiness (sort of like a straight man of a comedic duo but applied  to a mystery anime). It wasn't enough for him to be a boring archetype, however, he also gets to be a part of annoying and cliche drama. Such as the time where he cries over how Sakurako doesn't show the same level of sentimental attachment to the bones of long dead cats (which shouldn't be a surprise considering not even seeing dead bodies phases her at all). The drama usually ends with Sakurako turning out to be a bit more kind-hearted than normal before ending the episode on a happy note before starting it all over again later. The formulaic drama didn't make me like either of them more as characters so much as it accentuated just how little the two seem to learn from each other. The final episodes put up one last-ditch effort to convince me of their friendship, yet failed since the two of them as individuals aren't particularly likeable, and the fact that it became clear that the main hanging plot thread (Sakurako's quest to stop a pretentious serial killer who collects sphenoids for some reason, aptly named ""the Sphenoider"") was left as bait for a 2nd season I don't care to ever see come into existence. 
  
The worst thing I really have to say about Beautiful Bones, however, is that there is no reason to remember it now that it's done airing (asides from the fantastic background art). It's not utterly terrible like Ranpo Kitan, but it never showed enough promise to even be a memorable disappointment

          
 
       Helpful Where do I start. I guess I'll just state what I liked and felt about this anime, I'll try not to include spoilers as much as possible. 
 
I always have this thing about light mystery because I'm not fond of overly serious mystery genre and Sakurako-san really hit that spot of me. Rather than mystery oriented, Sakurako-san is like slice of life with drama and little twists of light mystery. 
 
Having this cliche high-school themed filled with force romance and fanservice anime over here and there, this anime is a breather for me and I always have this smile whenever I watch each of episode of this but don't get me wrong, Sakurako-san get's serious when it needs to be. The story is actually good and the pacing is also good. I know I'll raise some eyebrows because a lot of review said that it's rushed and pacing was terrible, but have you forgotten that this is a mystery and a lot of mystery either anime or novel tends to get quirky about pacing of the story? Well enough of the pacing I guess, 
Sakurako-san is a light mystery which tells each story that can actually happen in real life, that's why i view it as a slice of life. It does not goes beyond over exaggerating the mystery element but rather take account the scenarios that can take place in real life And instead of throwing some heavy words to try to be serious, this anime takes real life point of view. Comes with beautiful arts and story telling which TROYCA magnificently delivered. Opening, ending and ost tracts that gives the feeling of lightness despite being a mystery. I was truly amazed of what the anime showed and makes me feel positive about living. It on par with the Hyouka feeling I felt back then! 
 
But Probably for anyone who expects with grand showdown of intelligence like in other heavy mystery stories out there but definitely a mystery anyone could appreciate to if you just try to appreciate. You don't need to be really smart just to understand the mystery element, you just have to view it realistically to an extent. 
 
 
Over all it is a must watch  for those who have a thing for light mystery and for those fed up of cliched anime. 
 
 
I'll just end my review with the quote I really like from Sakurako-san 
 
 
""Listen It's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of the future, you gain nothing And nothing begins. You spend your life as though you're already dead."" 
 
 
then Thank you very much for reading. 
 
 

          
 
       Helpful So the premise of the show is that it is a mystery and that Sakurako is an osteologist and thus knows a lot about bones and can tell the gender, animal and traumas from it, but the biggest problem with the stories/crime solving is that she magically becomes sherlock holmes at whim. She's suddenly knowledgeable in art. She's suddenly knowledgeable in jewellery. She's suddenly knowledgeable in knot tying. When you never present your character as being a very diversely knowledgeable person from the beginning (like Sherlock from Elementary), everything seems to be resolved by deus ex machina.  
 
Now the show is presented in a fairly episodic format. One episode generally has no relevance to its previous one besides character introduction, similar to Elementary. So what makes a mystery show great is that there are often lots of clues given out, some that are later proven to be wrong to the case or some that are proven crucial since the beginning. This show basically has none of that. How the mysteries are resolved is largely Sakurako showing up at the necessary place and everything is solved instantly, letting only the audience see it being told. There's no amazing in-depth explanation or analysis of things, it's really just: I'll show up, have a glance, and now the problem is solved. A little bit of techno-babble would have been great as well as letting the audience see into the life of an osteologist would have been ever better. But as it stands, it really feels like the author thought up an idea then decided to research it on wikipedia and eventually made the summary of it in his story. 
 
This is a horrible way to present a show, let a lone a mystery. It's boring, it's basically skimped. Let's take a look at another show that does something like this, Mushishi. Now why is this show so much better than Sakurako? It's because there's actually some techno-babble in it along with some developed episodic characters. Most of the episodic characters in Sakurako don't have enough backstory and we're just given a simple exposition explaining their relevance then everything is resorted to melodrama and yelling. 
 
Next, since this is basically Sherlock Holmes, let's compare the two. Now Sherlock has a side-kick, Watson. And basically Shoutarou is Watson in this story. Except for a Watson, he is absolutely irritating and does nothing to contribute to solving the case; in fact it sometimes feels like he's hindering it. Hell, he's more like Watson and the police department mixed together since he ends up bringing the case to Sakurako. Shoutarou is probably one of the worst characters I have seen to date as he basically believes himself more mature than Sakurako but has the obtuseness of a male harem MC at understanding other people's emotions. 
 
So how does the show feel overall? Well it's a mystery without the interesting mysteries. A dialogue heavy show with very superficial and unintriguing dialogue. The only redeeming thing I can find is the art, I find the character design okay, the background art ranges from industry standard to pretty good. 
 
Lastly, yes there's some kind of story and it's told in between and kind of at the end of certain episodes (again, sort of like Elementary). Except we're basically left out of the actual story arc and you're either left to wait for season 2 or forced to read the novels. 
 
In regards to deus ex machinas, Shoutarou is a black belt in whatever style for a single episode so solve that one exclusive case and then it's never heard from again.

","Has a rather dull feeling compared to the other prequels and why even call this a prequel this should be a spin off rather since we don't get a continuation of the story and just get a new story.The characters are reduced to kids even a loli was added (makes me wonder if they're going to follow a similar pattern in today's anime) animation in all was good but the CG design of aquarion does not blend well to the art.For the OST I'm sad to say that it wasn't what I have expected to this long running enjoyable series instead of going out and doing the usual which is what most of the viewers would prefer adding to that epic feeling when they insert the OP or ED to the fight scenes this was poorly or not even done at all. overall its a mediocre series for me, that ""AQUARION FEELING"" 
is ""GONE"", If your going to watch this then go ahead but be advised that for those who watched the other two series you'll be rather disappointed or lets just say baffled to what they have done to this series and for those who haven't watched then watch this first before Genesis and EVOL (that's the best option so you won't get that feeling of disappointment based on my preferences).  
 
To sum it up. 
 
All the charactars have a generic design. Animation quality is dull. The scene of the joining is dull. No insert songs. OP is very weak.I loved Aquarion EVOL and Genesis but Logos doesn't have charismatic characters, good music, or good songs.

          
 
       Helpful My first thought was ""...no"", but I figured the other Aquarions were also a little weird at first. I came to love them after a few episodes. So I watched 2 more episodes.  There are more annoying kids as part of the team now and it seems they have dropped the target age-group of the show to 6-7. I have to draw the line somewhere and ""ballet dancing robot to look cool as a fatal strike and not ironically"" is a little over the edge. To top it off it's not very cute either, the main character is like Narukami Yu meets Rock Lee. So in short I wouldn't recommend this even if you are a 6 year old girl. 


          
 
       Helpful One of the first Mecha series as a fan, Aquarion has never ceased to amaze me with its plotlines and mecha fights, but after a few years after Evol, I feel as if the writers tried to come up with something new but got lost in where they were heading. Forget what you know about the previous Aquarion's and read onward about the true nature of this series. 
 
I am in no way bashing on this anime, but I believe it really had potential. At first glance, it seems the writers geared this Aquarion towards a more younger audience. The original Aquarion and Evol were geared towards many mature audiences and I believe this is the case. As the merges in this series were short and did not show much nudity, the other Aquarion's showed more mature content and more nudity and adult-like themes. The Verbalism Club in the show is all means family friendly and of course the other Aquarion's shows like I said above were more serious and adult centered, I do believe this was geared towards a new generation audience of Aquarion rather than old time fans. 
 
As for the plot, there are a bit of filler episodes which can sometimes be unnecessary. The series does grow more darker as it progresses as you see a certain character in the story embrace his destiny and becomes a living badass! Certain Episodes such as, 14 and 15 could of been away with since they really had no relevance with the plot and were there for comic relief. Now, this series does portray comedy well and I find myself laughing at Akira for always shouting, ""I am the savior."" which makes fun of anime cliches of shows. The plot is executed weirdly but it stays true to its world and always never ceases to amaze me of how much weirder it can get. The climatic fight scene was well worth it, but I often found myself curious on how everytime Akira needed strength, the Holy God of Plot decided to intervene and give him the strength or OP power to make it through the situation. Kinda cliche. Now let me hit on something that I haven't seen in the other reviews. 
 
Moral lessons. This show is very good at portraying moral lessons that are very close to home and real life. Lessons of the consequences of holding your emotions, to the satisfaction of winning the appeal of others, to the creating your own dreams and not letting your parents decide it for you and finding your voice to make change in the world. It is excellent on really showing the struggles of teenagers and the moral lessons that they learn. I found myself smiling at how it reminded me of some decisions I have made in my past as a child. 
 
Overall, its a decent show but being a fan of Aquarion, I would of love to see the reincarnation theme back and the good ol' Solar Wing. I would watch if your are looking for something happy to watch and something interesting with lessons but as a long term fan, you might not get satisfaction from it.

1 - I will admit that the first couple of episodes of the show were both boring and slow, but as the show went on, the more it got better. 
 
2 - This was one of the very few occurrences when having short episodes were better than having the traditional 22 minute format (these were round about 11-14 minutes per episode). 
 
Dislike -  
 
1 - The one thing that was bad for me was the ending, the thing I mean was that it ended perfectly on episode 12, so what was a point for episode 13.

       Helpful Foreword 
Found the torrent from Tokyotosho RSS feed. Yes, it's another release from Jumonji-Giri. They've been around re-encoding old series,those that aired when .mkv format was not so widespread, and widescreen broadcast was uncommon. After a quick look on AniDB, I downloaded this series. FYI, this time too, J-G peer swarms were small, and up/down speed was so low, around 8 kBps. 
 
Story 
This kind of theme has been recycled again and again for romantic comedy (particularly harem, and ecchi) anime. Although there's not much similarity between them, I am tempted to compare FA to Daa! Daa! Daa! (UFO Baby). No... no... don't ask me anything if you feel this comparison is not really relevant. I just feel like it. 
On both anime, the hero and heroine live together like a newly wed couple, with less intensity in FA, for there is another girl with close age too. There, the driving force for this whole series are Shizuka's naivety and our hero's coldness. Many incidents here and there, could only count as really standard slapstick jokes. Each episode just passed away, with few laughters (sometimes rather forced ones) and went by, hardly leaving any traces in my mind. 
Several story elements' in FA also made me drop huge sweat from my chin. Those 'Agent Smith(s)', really freaked me out, feels like I'm seeing artificially bred and cloned human beings. I don't wanna think that they're cloned from Shizuka's DNA, for it's too gross. The arranged marriage, and a girl soliciting herself to a boy she never knows. It makes me feel really sorry for Shizuka. Really gross plot, I think. 
To sum it up, FA has many things any average (or better) romance anime offers, but it fails to deliver them well. 
 
Art 
I'm not really familiar with romance anime art from that era (the time when this anime was aired, I have no access to any anime except those that were aired in local TVs). I could scarcely remember School Days or Daa!3x tho, and I could confidently say, the art is not superior compared to those latter two. The hero was poorly designed, his shoulder being too wide and his eyes too sharp, as if he was from an average beat-em-up' action anime. The girls were not particularly interesting, too. 
 
Sound 
Not really paying much attention. Not much special, but the insert song for the last episode (is it the same song as the OP Theme?) is quite good. 
 
Character 
Not much to say. Average characters, you'll most likely meet characters like those in FA in other countless titles you've watched, and other countless series to come. 
FYI, although she's not appealing enough to be admitted to my anime harem, I never refuse a girl like Shizuka, and Emiho's sanguine friend is interesting too (I always like that kind of voice character). 
 
Enjoyment 
At least, worth for spending your free time. 
 
Overall 
Right now, out of about 400GB storage space (I'm poor, huh?), I'm considering freeing up more. Maybe, I'll delete this one, but I'm trying to keep this series. It's worth archiving.

          
 
       Helpful Well i was just bored at only watching ongoing shows for a while and just wanted to give a marathon of a random anime and then i picked this anime i dont know why. 
 
the synopsis and the original plot was absurd enough to ruin my interest, however, i kinda liked the main girl shizuka and ryo's sister akane from the first episode and decided to stick with it. 
 
in the end, i am glad that i finished it and its way way better than stupid anime like akane-iro no somaro saka. if anyone compares this anime with akane-iro, then they have pretty bad anime taste. 
 
tonikaku, 
 
plot: one word. stupid. 
 
story development:  the anime started with stupid child birth issue forced by government, midway became an unasked for love triangle and ended up  close ended and if it hadn't, i would have given this anime a 5/10 after all the affections she showed for him, did i just spoil you, i think i didnt, because from the start you can tell there was only one girl for him. unlike ichigo 100%/ urgh. i had to remember that sub per anime. 
 
characters: 13 eppys x 12 mins runtime wasnt enough to focus on all the characters in the anime but they did great job making them kawaii and at time going chibi-forms which was the best part of the entire anime. the love triangle seemed to be unnecessary but somehow helped develop their feelings for each other on the closing episodes and unlike many anime, ryo isn't a total jackass nor a pervert, which makes him different. and shizuka is like...can i have her for myself? 
 
seiyuu: 10/10. this is where the anime scores the maximum. i loved the way they carried their emotion and feelings, as well as their expressions with their voice, two thumbs up! 
 
art and sound: i watched froth-bite fansubs xvid release and from the medium video quality, i have to say the  aniime is neatly drawn and although the BGM wasnt to be found in many cases, the OP and EDs were good enough to give it an overall 8/10. 
 
enjoyment: 9/10. despite having a weak plot, i have to say i loved the last few episodes around the climax. overall the anime was really funny and i had my share of laughing doses and went through romantic labu-labu moments. i wish there was a shizuka popping up in my life, i would have taken her as my wife anytime. she is probably one of the cutest heroins in anime :P 
 
well there ends my robotic regular review, overall the anime gets an 8/10 from me. i wasnt being generous. i have seen many love comedies, and this one falls in the better half. that sums up the overall reaction for you. too bad to see that the average score is below 7, when this anime deserves at least 7.5/10, if not better :/

Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, creatures that look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live among the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers including enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces 4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a kagune (Japanese: 赫子), which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their sclera in both eyes turns black and their irises red. This mutation is known as kakugan (赫眼, ""red eye"").
A half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the ""red eye"" transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate. There is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased speed and reaction speed, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can also eat like normal humans or full ghouls.
The story follows Ken Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul and tries to eat him. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive.  Ghouls who run a coffee shop called   ""Anteiku"" (あんていく) take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika.
The prequel series Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] follows the youths of Kishō Arima and Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend at the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well.
The sequel series Tokyo Ghoul:re follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kishō Arima). He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called ""Quinx Squad"" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them but still being able to live as normal humans.

Character development is a joke and if you haven't read the manga you wont even understand sometimes what the hell is going on. Overall really feels sad that this is the adaptation we get for a manga that good. 
 
I would highly recommend to read the manga if you haven't and then may try this mess of 120 chapters cramped into 12 fricking episodes if you really want to.

TL; DR : I, for one, don't believe that the series deserve all the hate it's getting..  
******** 
Having done my fair share of watching animes and reading manga, I can say that the whole series is not the worse anime as other reviews intend to say.   
 
What got me hooked on this anime is how miserable and dark the world is and the lives these characters lives are and still get through.  Of course, it would have been unfair giving the series such a low score having admitted you don't understand the series at all.  
 
 
I liked how dark, miserable and depressing the setting is.  Though I may admit being biased since this as always been one of my favorites, not only does it tackle warfare and how fucked up the world is looking from a perspective of a weakass main character, it also shows the hardships he has to het through and not having blamed anyone for the things that happened to him.  That although he may be weak and pathetic,  protecting those who need him and those important to him gives him the strength to thrive.  Surely, many people might not relate to it since there's this setting that is so different from the real world, this goes to show how psychologically intriguing it has been, how people become who they are, their thought processess and why they did what they have done. Also, its vision is quite impressive. To live in a world were humans and ghouls can co-exist.  Might have seemed farfetched for many within the story, its been inspiring how they battled through the obstacles for a better world.  That the world is not as fucked as it seems.   
 
Just one vital flaw: the love story. (because this was not an anime for romance,  for pete's sake)  I know, i know you might say ""Another fujoshi has infiltrated the fandom"", im gonna stop you right there.  You see, setting aside the fujoshi in me, i don't think the character dynamics between touka and kaneki works well.  Additionally, I believe that the purest form of love I've seen in this series is how much Hide can sacrifice so much for Ken and always be there to save his soul.  Un-fucking-conditionnally.  Heck, man.   
 
Overall, time spent here was worth it. Also, loved the aesthetic of this anime.

          
 
       Helpful this season is horrible! 
the story keeps jumping up and down the track 
and you will have many questions, 
there is also a love scene that is too hasty 
and too forced! I didn't get the chemistry 
unlike season 1 and 2 which made me like this anime, the character was built slowly but surely and pleasantly 
in this season each character appears suddenly and suddenly 
make the audience unable to explore each character well  
and in the end only knew that person was GOOD or BAD 
for the picture it's pretty good, and the sound is okay 
but what I regret the most is the storyline that is too rushed and pisses me off 
I'm disappointed watching this season

9,2254,116,5.567029328,A group of people living together,Sentou Mecha Xabungle,"On the planet Zora exist two societies: the Innocent, an advanced culture that lives in domed cities, and the Civilians, who are forced to live in the harsh desert wilderness. As dictated by the Innocent, any Civilian that commits a crime is forgiven if they are not brought to justice within three days. 
  
Civilian Jiron Amos seeks revenge on the villainous outlaw Timp Sharon who murdered his parents, despite the fact the three-day period has long since passed. Hoping to get his revenge by stealing the mecha Xabungle from the merchant Carrying Cargo, Jiron teams up with a group of bandits known as the Sandrats and kidnaps Cargo's daughter Elchi, who ends up being sympathetic to his cause. Jiron's quest for revenge soon grows into a conflict much bigger—one that will eventually see the Civilians rise up against the Innocents' rule. 
  
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","A young man named Jiron Amos is found in the desert by a group of bandits known as the Sand Rats (Rag, Blume, Dyke and Chill). Jiron hopes to steal the Walker Machine Xabungle from the local trader Carrying Cargo to use it to take revenge against the Breaker who killed his parents, Timp Sharon. After kidnapping Carrying's daughter, Elchi, she agrees to help them steal a Xabungle from her father's landship, the Iron Gear. Timp convinces a rockman named Groggy to attack the Iron Gear, and during the attack Carrying is killed. Elchi takes charge of the Iron Gear and possession of the transporter's license that belonged to her father. Her father's top Breaker, Kid Horla hopes to marry Elchi and gain the license, but she rejects him and he flees.
Following orders from the Innocent, Timp recruits several other Breakers and traders to defeat the Iron Gear including Gavlet Gablae and Bigman but they all fail and are killed. Running low on supplies, the Iron Gear heads to an Innocent dome to exchange blue rocks, a form of currency, for supplies. Although they are initially rejected, an Innocent overseer named Biel appears and agrees to make the trade. Jiron and his pursuit of Timp leads to multiple battles inside the dome and during one such attack Jiron ends up destroying the dome, forcing Biel and the others to depart. During the battle, Timp fakes his own death causing Jiron to believe he has gotten revenge.
The Iron Gear comes under attack from Kid Horla, now working for Biel and in possession of a landship. Following passage over the Mud Sea, where the Iron Gear is confronted by the mysterious Hanawan, Elchi leaves the Iron Gear, falling in love with a man named El Condor who is soon killed in a battle with Horla. Rag also leaves the Iron Gear and falls in love with a subordinate of Horla's who also dies. Timp tricks a trader named Karas Karas to battle the Iron Gear and he is eventually killed although his wife Greta makes it out alive. The Iron Gear battles Biel, now living in another Innocent dome, and Jiron steals the Walker Machine Gallier, which he pilots for the rest of the series.
Jiron meets a woman named Toran Milan, and through her influence the Iron Gear and its crew start working with an organization named Solt that rebels against the Innocent. Around this time Elchi is captured by the Innocent. Biel delivers her to a fellow overseer named Billam, but is demoted and abandoned. Elchi is put under an intense level of brainwashing by the Innocent, who cause her to desire the Iron Gear's destruction and Jiron's death. Solt's power continues to grow, although Jiron frequently clashes with its leader, Katakam. Katakam's methods are not respected however, and when everyone believes him to have been killed, he disappears from view, enabling Jiron to take on leadership of Solt.
The Innocent continues to send Breakers after the Iron Gear, including Greta, Kid Horla, the returned Timp, and even Elchi herself who is provided with a land ship identical to the Iron Gear. During an attempt to rescue Elchi, Biel is killed, but not before revealing the truth about the Innocent to Jiron and the others. The Innocent have created the civilians as a race that will be able to live in the harsh environment on their planet. Jiron and Solt hope to meet up with Innocent leader Arthur Rank, although his influence has been significantly reduced through the efforts of the villainous Kashim King.
Jiron and the others are able to capture Arthur Rank, who agrees with them that it is now time for the Innocent to relinquish their control of the planet. He broadcasts this message to all of the Innocent. Kashim continues to attack the Iron Gear and Solt, hoping to kill Arthur. Elchi is captured by the Iron Gear and with the sacrifice of Arthur her original personality is restored. The Iron Gear and Solt lead one final attack on the Innocent's stronghold, X Point. During the battle Kashim launches a series of missiles that cause heavy damage to Solt's forces. However, the Iron Gear smashes through the dome and Elchi attacks Kashim in the Xabungle. Kashim fires off a missile that causes a chain reaction when another missiles topples over. Kashim and Billam are crushed. The resulting explosion blinds Elchi. Jiron has one final battle with Timp, who flees. With Kashim dead, the Innocent's grasp on the planet has ended. Elchi runs away, thinking she will be a nuisance to everyone, but Jiron catches up with her and convinces her to return.
In Xabungle Graffiti (the compilation movie for the series), Arthur Rank, who had died before the end of the series, returns (in new footage) on a hover bike to sweep Elchi up and take her away, leaving Rag to claim Jiron herself.
","Xabungle is a mish-mash of genres combining westerns, mecha action, sci-fi, and comedy focused on a young man named Jiron Amos who partners up with a gang of sand bandits and the crew of the landship known as the Iron Gear to seek out the whereabouts of the murderer of his family named Timp Sharon. Within the world of Xabungle, mechs called Walker Machines are used by landships to combat one another and there is a three-day rule in place where all crimes have to be resolved within that time or else they are pardoned. In addition, there exist two living beings within the series: the Innocent who live lavishly in domed cities and the Civilians who live out in the harsh planet landscape. 
 
Xabungle was directed by famous mecha anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino, sandwiched between his work on the more darker and serious Space Runaway Ideon and Aura Battler Dunbine. The series is more lighter fare with its focus on Jiron and other characters as comedy rears its presence frequently throughout the series to parody typical tropes of the mecha genre and usually breaking the fourth wall with characters being self-aware of their status as fictional characters and whatever roles they have to fulfill within the series. Some characters even aspire to be greater than the roles they personify or attempting to seem tough and intimidating, yet their comical and klutzy behavior goes against whatever role they are attempting to come off as. The comedy actually helps to allow Xabungle to stick out from the many mecha titles that were made throughout the 1980s trying to come off as serious, as the series is self-aware of its roots and doesn't take itself seriously on enough occasions throughout its 50-episode run. 
 
Outside of the comedy, Xabungle also sticks out for the rather unique world it has to offer up in its mixing of sci-fi and western story elements. On the surface, the series seems to be a western with the attire, settings, and weaponry employed; mixed in with the more advanced technology such as the Walker Machines and landships used by the Civilians. But as episodes progress, more is revealed about the workings of the world that Xabungle is set in that eventually leads up to a conflict between the crew of the Iron Gear and those under the influence of the Innocent. A good chunk of what is revealed is pretty typical of sci-fi and mecha focused anime, but the mentioned comedy rears its head enough to keep things from getting too overly serious. 
 
In regards to characters, the series has a fairly large cast considering its length and the scale of which its main conflict onfolds. Some characters, notably the villains, are pretty standard with their motives and character types. Others, like major characters among the Iron Gear, do get a good deal of fleshing out that let them have more to them beyond their character types as Xabungle shows how a number of characters are affected by the escalating conflict with the Innocent and there are a few characters within the Innocent concerned about how things are escalating with their influence on the Civilians. In spite of how typical a number of the character types are, Xabungle still does a solid job with exploring how each side is affected by the developing conflict between Civilians and Innocent. 
 
Overall, Xabungle makes for a fun and engaging mecha show thanks to the humor coming off its self-awareness of being a mecha anime, as well as the unique blend of western and sci-fi storytelling tropes implemented in its exploration of the Iron Gear's conflict with the Innocent. Old-school mecha fans looking for something unique for the genre should definitely consider giving this a watch.

Yuuichi is not really overjoyed with the prospect of living here though, because all of his memories of this place and the people living in it have mysteriously vanished. His cute cousin Nayuki seems like a stranger as well, even though he used to play with her all the time when they were younger.

This is one of the first clues that will make Yuuichi take a stroll through the snow-covered town and make him start recalling fragments of his past, broken promises and buried secrets. Yuuichi soon realizes that there is something supernatural going on, and all of his new female acquaintances seem to have links to his forgotten past. ","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']",none,"Before reading any of my reviews, please keep in mind that I am a VERY harsh critic. I do not hand out 10's easily and anything I rate 7 or higher I consider recommendation worthy. 
 
In my opinion it is necessary to watch BOTH Kanons in order to get a full appreciation of the series. So I will give my review for BOTH at the same time, comparing and contrasting what I believe to be the key advantages and disadvantages of each. I will be rating them separate however. Please keep in mind that one series is primarily drama while the other is primarily comedy. Because of this it is very difficult to accurately compare the two. Chances are that if you see people saying they liked one much more than the other, then they probably like that GENRE much more than the other. 
 
Story 8/10 
Despite popular opinion, it is actually the original story that has the better storyline. The stories of Nayuki (8/10 &amp; 4/10) and Shiori (9/10 &amp; 2/10) were not done very well at all in the remake. Neither was Makoto's (10/10 &amp; 8/10) as they attempted to make her story ending seem light, happy and even cute which significantly lowered the impact of it. Ayu's story (8/10 &amp; 9/10) was probably done a little bit better in the remake, though I liked the way they handled the story about the hair band in the original more. Mai's story (4/10 &amp; 10/10) was obviously done better in the remake, and is the remakes biggest attraction. The main thing that the original story lacks is humor, which Kyoto Animation makes up for with interest in the remake, giving depth to an otherwise flat main male lead. The original series started slowly due to the lack of humor, unlike the remake. However, the ending was done better in the original because they did a better job with Nayuki as well as added more importance to the accidents, which the remake glossed over a bit. A nice touch in the remake is the incorporation of Pachelbel's Canon in D as a minor theme for the series. 
 
As for the story in general, it wasn't really that original of an idea. Main male character returns to a town he lived in as a child, but he can't remember anything about his time there because of what appears to be a tramatic experience he had 7 years ago. He ends up spending part of the series trying to regain his lost memories of the time he spent there, and who he spent that time with. It's pretty much all been done before, but I strongly believe that something doesn't necessarily have to be completely original to be good. And Kanon was good, though you need to see both in order to better understand exactly what happened 7 years ago, and to understand why certain characters are the way they are. In other words Mai in 2006 and Nayuki and Shiori in the original, both Ayu and Makoto lack certain bits of important information in each series. Like it's predecessor, AIR, Kanon is at times very emotional. They don't call them &quot;cry games&quot; for nothing. There will be times when you will laugh (especially in 2006), there will also be times when you will cry (especially in 2002), and if you appreciate a good drama then you should find the series to be enjoyable from beginning to end. If I had to rate the overall story, then I'd probably have to rate it 8/10 for the original and 5/10 for the remake. Unfortunately the butchering of Nayuki and Shiori severely hurts my rating for 2006, otherwise it would have been 8/10. The original would have been 9/10 had Mai's story been done better. Also, Kanon had a more obvious haremish feel to it than AIR did, and had less flow between character arcs, though it didn't really affect my rating it may have if the review system worked with decimals. 
 
Art 4/10 
I don't think there can really be any debate here. The art for 2006 was much, much better than the original. The original had a very obvious h-game art style. The characters had very rough designs, though the detail was good. The backgrounds were dull and flat. Overall it seemed very early-90ish, which is a bit hard to handle considering it came out in 2002. Overall I'm being generous when I give it a 4/10. You would expect them to do a better job than they did. However, Kanon 2006 was extremely visually pleasing. The art is very reminiscent of AIR TV which is a very good thing. I love the way the background art was done. The scenery was spectacular, the skies were amazing. The attention to detail was stunning with an excellent choice of colors, color techniques and appropirately placed CG enhancement. As with AIR, the thing I liked most was the eyes. The way they combine CG effects with contemporary art to make the eyes shine like that is beautiful. Kyoto Animation gets full marks from me for art, 10/10. 
 
Sound 8/10 
The sound is pretty good for both shows, but 2006 definitely has the edge. The BGM were good for both, though I give 2006 the advantage in the theme song department. I loved Ayana's songs. Last regrets was powerful and beautiful and Kaze no Tadori Tsuku Basho was extremely catchy and uplifting. Flower and Floresence just didn't stir the same kind of emotions in me. The voice acting was good in both, the edge again going to 2006 mainly because of the one change they made from 2002 to 2006. The decision to change Yuuichi's seiyuu to Tomokazu Sugita was pure genius. His highly sarcastic tone was a perfect fit for a Key leading role. His interaction with Ayu's and Makoto's characters was pure magic. However, Makoto in episode 9 of the original was much better done than in the remake version. Overall I give the original a 8/10 and 2006 10/10 once again. 
 
Character 8/10 
The characters follow some of the typical Key stereotypes. Plenty of mo&eacute; provided by Ayu (very similar character to Nagamori in ONE, only difference is Ayu's mo&eacute;ness) and Makoto (sort of a cross between Nanase from ONE and Michiru from AIR, similar hairstyles too, again with added mo&eacute;ness), the quiet and seemingly unpersonable Mai (nearly identical to Akane from ONE in personality and looks almost identical to Nanase from ONE also), the childhood friend (in this case a cousin) Nayuki (sort of like Misaki from ONE personality wise) and the seemingly cheerful girl with a dark secret Shiori (similar to Kano from AIR) and of course the highly sarcastic (in 2006 anyway) main male lead Yuuichi which seems to be a Key trademark. I made no comparisons with CLANNAD, because unlike ONE and AIR it came after Kanon and thus had no influence on the series whatsoever (even though Jun wears a CLANNAD t-shirt in episode 13 of the original series, other things to watch for are ONE's Nanase making several cameos in episode 17 and 18 of 2006 and a Moon poster seen in the theater in 2006). Stereotypes aside though, they were great. Some were done better in the original (Nayuki 9/10 &amp; 2/10 and Shiori 7/10 &amp; 3/10), other were better in 2006 (Mai 7/10 &amp; 10/10, Makoto 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Ayu 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Yuuichi 2/10 &amp; 10/10). Overall I rate both an 8/10. This is due to the fact that the highly humorous nature of Yuuichi, Ayu and Makoto (as well as Akiko at times) in 2006 made it easier to watch. However, the characters in the original (despite having the same seiyuu) seemed more dramtic to me and better portrayed the more serious elements of the series. 
 
Entertainment 9/10 
The entertainment value for both series are high. The original's main source of entertainment is the more dramatic elements of the story, while 2006's main source of entertainment is the more humorous elements of the story. Depending on which you prefer it will drastically affect your opinion on which series is better. Also, a lot of people tend to like 2006 more because of Mai. As I said earlier, 2006's main shortcomings arc-wise were Nayuki and Shiori, who aren't nearly as popular as Mai. It is these 2 factors, combined with the difference in art, more than anything else that I attribute to 2006's much higher rating than the original. Maybe it was because I saw the original first, but I found that the story in the original was much more engrossing than 2006. Possibly the light atmosphere in 2006 made it easier for me to take breaks while watching, but when I watched the original I couldn't put it down. For that reason, combined with the effectiveness of the drama in the original I have to rate it a 9/10 for entertainment. It would have been 10/10 had Mai's story been done better. If you like sappy, slow paced drama, then you will love this series thoroughly. Even though I really enjoyed 2006, I have to rate it a little lower at 8/10 due to the fact that certain elements that I felt were key were missing. They did a marvelous job with Mai, but Shiori's story was confusing and Nayuki was completely glossed over. So i'm docking 2 marks for ruining 2 stories. 
 
Overall 7/10 
Though I rate them 7/10 for the original &amp; 8/10 for the 2006 version, it would actually be closer if I could use decimals. The original was more like a 7.5/10 for me. The remake was slightly better overall even though I split the category ratings 2 for each with one tied. The bottom line is; if you like drama more, then you'll probably like the original more, but if you like comedy more then you'll probably like the remake more. I tend to appreciate both roughly the same so I ended up liking both versions for completely different reasons and disliking elements of both versions for completely different reasons. In order to get a more complete story it is recommended that you watch both as the original did a poor job with Mai and the remake butchered Nayuki and Shiori. The main reason why most people like the remake more is because Mai is an extremely popular character, the art was much better and there was a lot more humor.

          
 
       Helpful Kanon 2002, the predecessor of our beloved Kanon 2006. Since Kyoto Animation released the remake of this highly acclaimed eroge by Key, the Toei Animation version has been overshadowed and underestimated. Is Kanon 2006 really that superior as many will want you to believe? 
 
Well, in my personal opinion, Kanon 2006 definitely surpasses its predecessor in almost every category, due to reasons that I will keep to myself, as this is a review for Kanon 2002 and not a comparative essay. But believe me, those two are not that far away. 
 
Kanon's 2002 story, although crammed in 13 episodes, is consistent and well developed, at least in a superficial way. You will realize at the end of the anime that many questions were left unanswered. Although they're not highly relevant, and would only serve as an aid to understand the story in a more in-depth manner. After you watch the first character arc you will realize what I'm trying to say. 
 
The artwork is not that bad at all, judging from the year, but what really gets on my nerves would be the exaggerated big chins the characters have. Trust me when I say that it's going to take you time to get used to seeing those abnormal chins throughout 13 episodes of 24 minutes, if you manage to control the urge of dropping the anime due to this factor. It is one of the major reasons Kanon 2002 is discriminated, and not without reason. It's just weird. 
 
The sound was average, nothing too flashy or too boring. They match well the mood of the anime, although the opening theme is kind of boring and monotonous if you ask me. Again, Kanon 2006 wins over 2002 because of this; it clear when you listen to 2006's opening theme. 
 
Character development, in my criteria, was where Kanon 2002 gains an upper hand. The character development, in my opinion, was very realistic. They behave in a more humanly fashion, and their emotions are really strong and human-like. You'll be able to witness love, fear and resentment that will let you sympathize and identify yourself to the characters. Personally, it is this factor that kept me sitting down in front of the monitor for about three hours straight, watching the last half of Kanon. 
 
Well, Kanon 2002 is a good watch, and probably is not going to disappoint you as many people will have you think. It's a very decent piece of work and deserves a good place amongst the innumerable drama anime we have out there. 7.5/10 I would have to say, but since decimals aren't available I'll round it up to 8.  
 
And as a small piece of advice: watch this one before 2006, it's going to boost your experience. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I apologize in advance of this review is too much of a series comparison rather than a review, but here goes. I watched Kanon 2006 first, and it is definitely my favorite anime of all time. The music, the characters, the voices (I'm partial to english dubs, sorry), and the atmosphere were all perfect and I didn't think anything could top it. Kanon 2002 was not as good (for the most part...I'll get to that later) as Kanon 2006, but if you watched 2006 first, which I recommend, then you will really be able to appreciate Kanon 2002. 
 
Story: It's Kanon! What could possibly go wrong? The story is the same as the visual novel and anime remake; Yuuichi Aizawa moves in with his cousin in a town he hasn't visited in 7 years, and he can't remember anything from his past visits. During his time in the town, he meets a bunch of girls who connect to his past and he slowly begins to remember what he forgot. 
 
13 episodes plus an OVA is a pretty tight schedule to tell all of Kanon in, but Toei did a pretty good job. They missed explanations on some important details, such as the way the title relates to the story, or Sayuri's 3rd person speech (which the sub I watched didn't even acknowledge). Overall the main arcs were handled pretty clumsily compared to 2006, but Mai's arc still shocked me at the climax, and Makoto's nearly brought me to tears, just showing how well written those two were. The one thing Kanon 2002 definitely did better than 2006 was Nayuki in the ending. In 2006, Nayuki was really important throughout the whole series, then gets completely shafted at the end when her arc comes about. In 2002 however, she is ignored most of the main series, until her arc comes. She's my favorite heroine by far, and I feel she came really close to the ending she deserved. Sadly I disagree with both series choice of which girl ""won"" (for lack of a better word).  
 
Overall, the story was great from a nostalgic point of view so 9/10 (I'm a fanboy sorry) 
 
Art: Kanon 2002's art style is infamous. There is a scene in Kanon 2006 in which Shiori draws a portrait of Yuuichi and he acts completely offended and repulsed by it. I like to picture that portrait as Kanon 2002's big chinned Yuuichi. Besides Yuuichi though, I think the art was rather good for what it was. I feel like the grainy lo-fi quality helped it gain sort of a nostalgic feel, and made the atmosphere a bit darker. I imagine it like this, listen to a band like Merchant Ships or I Wrote Haikus About Cannibalism in Your Yearbook, then listen to a band like William Bonney or Old Gray. They play the same style of music, but the production values completely change the atmosphere. 
 
Overall, art is 7/10 
 
Sound: Let's start with the voices. As I mentioned before, I'm partial to english dubs, but that doesn't mean I can't at least try to objectively evaluate the original Japanese version. That said, this had a pretty good dub. One thing I realized was that the English dub VA's had very similar vocal timbres to their character's Japanese counterpart. For example, Sayuri's VA's in both languages sound very similar, as does Mai's. The only ones that took some getting used to for me were Kitagawa and Nayuki. It's hard for me to see any blonde Visual Art's/Key character that doesn't have Greg Ayres' voice. As for Nayuki, the difference between Jessica Boone's interpretation and Mariko Kouda's interpretation if the character is more than noticeable. While I prefer Boone's voice for Nayuki, I can definitely appreciate Kouda's performance as well. 
 
As for the music, it was mostly forgettable. The only tracks that stood out to me were the tracks I recognized from 2006 (I really dig 2006's soundtrack), and the opening and ending themes, which were freaking phenomenal. 
 
Due to a mostly forgettable soundtrack, I have to give sound a 7/10 
 
Character: Oh boy, this is gonna be a fun one. I love all of Kanon's characters. Or should I say Kanon 2006's characters. Mai, Sayuri, Shiori, Ayu, Akiko, And Kuze were pretty much the same in both versions (though Kuze got way more screen time in this version than 2006). I feel there wasn't enough focus on Makoto until her arc, which was only one episode. Kitagawa felt kind of random and his personality shifted a lot. Kaori made a complete 180 at the end if Shiori's arc, as if someone magically flipped a switch that turned off her mean glands. Nayuki was pretty much ignored until the last 3 episodes, though they have her story a more proper conclusion in this one than 2006 
 
My biggest problem with Kanon 2002 is Yuuichi. He's barely a character. He's more like a vessel for the plot. In 2006, Yuuichi is quick witted, caring, a bit mean at times, but still an all around good guy. In 2002 they could've replaced him with a piece of toasted cardboard and the series wouldn't have been too much different. 
 
7/10 for characters 
 
Enjoyment: I'm a Kanon fanboy. Watching this version was almost like my first time with Kanon 2006 all over again, but through a nostalgic looking glass with a grainy filter that made everything that much more dark and melancholy. I'm a sucker for romance, and I love winter, and anything that's kinda dark in a bittersweet way (my favorite movie is Lost in Translation and I listen to shoegaze #sadbois4lyfe) so this was a great ride for me, despite all the criticisms I may have. 
 
For pure enjoyment, I give Kanon 2002 a solid 9/10 (for myself personally). 
 
Overall: I would recommend this, though I would recommend you watch Kanon 2006 first, then enter this one with and open mind. It's an emotional story and despite it's flaws it is a very touching series, regardless of which incarnation. 
 
Overall, I give it an 8/10. Now time to play the Visual Novel.

9,10271,118,5.545484855,A group of people living together,Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku-hen,"Owing to an increasing debt, Kaiji Itou ends up resuming his old lifestyle. One day, while walking on the street, he stumbles upon Yuuji Endou, who is hunting Kaiji due to the money he owes to the Teiai Group. Unaware of this, Kaiji eagerly follows Endou, hoping for a chance to participate in another gamble, but soon finds out the loan shark's real intentions when he is kidnapped. 
 
Given that Kaiji is unable to pay off his huge debt, the Teiai Group instead sends him to work in an underground labor camp. He is told that he will have to live in this hell for 15 years, alongside other debtors, until he can earn his freedom. His only hope to put an early end to this nightmare is by saving enough money to be able to go back to the surface for a single day. Once he is there, he plans to obtain the remaining money needed to settle his account by making a high-stakes wager. However, as many temptations threaten his scarce income, Kaiji may have to resort to gambling sooner than he had expected. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Seinen']","Japan, February 1996. Three years after graduating from high school and moving to Tokyo to get a job, Kaiji Itō fails to find steady employment due to the country being mired in its first recession since World War II. Depressed, he festers in his apartment, biding his time with cheap pranks, gambling, liquor and cigarettes. Kaiji is always thinking about money and his perpetual poverty frequently brings him to tears. Kaiji's unrelenting misery continues until he is paid an unexpected visit from a loan shark named Yūji Endō, who wants to collect an outstanding debt that Kaiji has carelessly co-signed for his former co-worker. Endō gives Kaiji two options – either spend ten years repaying this outstanding debt, or board the gambling ship Espoir (""hope"" in French) for one night to clear the debt. Using a con, Endō pressures Kaiji into accepting the deal, believing he will never come back from the voyage.
However, Kaiji survives the gamble and is invited to another gambling night, this time at Starside Hotel. Although initially wary about the offer, he is spurred by his acquaintance Sahara to go. After being the only survivor of the Human Derby, Kaiji decides to avenge his friends by competing in another gambling match the financing corporation known as Teiai Group has prepared: E-Card. Kaiji, despite losing an ear, defeats his opponent Yukio Tonegawa, the second highest ranking executive at Teiai. He goes all-in once again in a new game with Kazutaka Hyōdō, the president of Teiai, but this time loses both the money he had won in E-Card and four of his fingers.
Though Kaiji survives the events at Starside Hotel he now has a debt of over 9.5 million yen. He contacts Endō in hopes of being able to take part in another high-stakes gamble, though Endō betrays him and sends him to Teiai's underground labor camp where he will have to work off his debt for 15 years. In the labor camp Kaiji is paid 91,000 perica (equal to 9100 yen) per month to dig an underground kingdom. This is reduced to 45,000 perica after Kaiji loses to ?tsuki in Underground Cee-lo. However, Kaiji allies himself with other Forty-fivers (those earning 45,000 perica per month) to defeat ?tsuki and win enough money for a one-day outside pass.
Although Kaiji manages to get out of the labor camp with 800,000 yen on hand using multiple one-day outside passes, he only has 20 days to earn the 60 million yen he needs to buy his freedom and release the other Forty-fivers. Fortunately, Kaiji comes across Kōtarō Sakazaki, a man who tells him of a pachinko game known as the Bog in a high-stakes casino where Kaiji can win over 500 million yen. Kaiji agrees to help him beat the Bog. However, the casino is owned by Teiai, and the Bog has been rigged in several ways by the manager of the casino, Seiya Ichijō, and his men to ensure that it will not pay out. Kaiji succeeds at beating the Bog after a long battle and Ichijō is sent to the underground labor camp working for 1050 years to pay back the 700 million yen from the Bog that Kaiji won. However, Endō drugs Kaiji and takes away the majority of his winnings as debt payment for the amount he loaned Kaiji to win the Bog.
Months after the events and finally having cleared his debt, Kaiji has been living with Sakazaki and his family until he kicks Kaiji out with 3 million yen in cash. Kaiji then agrees to help the former Forty-fivers Miyoshi and Maeda beat Takashi Muraoka, the president of a casino at his Minefield Mahjong game and potentially win over 100 million yen. After losing sums of money during the game, Kaiji realizes that the game was rigged from the start in Muraoka's favor, with Maeda looking at Kaiji's tiles and giving information to Muraoka and Miyoshi sending false signals to Kaiji. Kazuya Hyōdō, the son of Kazutaka Hyōdō, who was in the same room with Kaiji and the rest, loans him money to continue gambling, and after several matches, Kaiji is finally able to defeat Muraoka and wins 480 million yen through a pure stroke of luck.
Kazuya offers Kaiji an opportunity to gamble with him, to which Kaiji accepts and follows him. Kazuya reveals to Kaiji his twisted and bloodthirsty personality and how despicable he thinks human beings are. He decides to test his view on human nature with a life-or-death game called Salvation Game, with three friends indebted to him, Mario, Chang and Mitsuyama, and see if their friendship is a true bond. Kaiji is an observer to this game and cheers on the three men to challenge Kazuya's corrupted views. However, after several rounds, Mitsuyama ends up failing to put his trust into his friends and betrays them, taking all the money of the game and leaving them behind to die. Kaiji instinctively saves Mario and Chang from death, and before going with Kazuya to a warehouse and do their gamble, Kaiji asks them to join and support him to defeat Kazuya.
Kaiji and Kazuya play a game called One Poker, and after several matches with Kaiji close to death, he finally overthrows Kazuya. Nevertheless, Kaiji, in an act of mercy, saves Kazuya from dying with the help of Mario and Chang. While Kazuya lies unconscious, they escape with 2.4 billion yen. Enraged after he found out what happened, Hyōdō commands the blacksuits and Endō to chase after them and get the money back. Kaiji, Chang and Mario, on the run from Teiai and after many trails and evasions from them, realize that they have an army of debtors who relentlessly look for everywhere Kaiji, Chang and Mario go. Consequently, Kaiji is planning to leave Japan for good after Chang and Mario go back to their countries.
","This will not be much of a review. I'm going to go against the previous two reviews, and I'll make this very quick. 
 
 
This season of Kaiji is actually quite terrible. It's basically just an advert for pachinko and the upcoming Kaiji live-action movie. 
Now the first season of Kaiji (aside from being very good) was dragged out a little, as are most other anime, but this season is really taking the mickey. 
 
Any tension i intially felt while watching this has completely vanished. Kaiji's chances of wininng are like watching someone with bipolar, up, down, up, down... every single episode, just so they can stretch the series out to 26 episodes. Midway through the series it just gets horrendously repetative. 
 
In summary, just don't waste your time on this.

          
 
       Helpful Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku Hen is the second season of kaiji ultimate survivor  which  continues from where the first season left of.  
 
 
Story 8/10  The second season starts of with Kaiji wondering around japan looking for ways  to earn money.   
Wile he sees an  familiar face Endoh from the first season which somewhat helped him with his debt problems in season 1 eg The gambling ship  this time though Kaiji is kidnapped by Endoh and forced into slave labor to pay off his debt with very harsh living conditions. Now what l like to say about the first half of season 2 it has a lot of suspense to it rivals the first season's   and the antagonist in  both half's are great  the problem is with the a second half the bourge arc. Which is basically impossible pachinko   each episode does drag on with this arc.  And makes the  show irritating to sit through you will be there yelling at your screen is kaiji gonna fucking win or not.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animation  8/10  It's madhouse madhouse does some amazing amazing animation with their shows.  Sure the weird character designs are still there but l won't take a point  of as its part of the shows style. The animation  does have a few problems near the end but the animation with the characters reactions when  they are in  peril is fantastic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sound 7/10 The sound probably the weakest part of the show. But its not bad at all the opening is fucking fantastic even though it is screamo the ending sucks it just flat outright sucks  
 
 
 
 it doesn't suit the tone of the show at all and just takes you out of the experience.  
 The ost though is nice the iconic zara zara is there when something is  not going kaiji's way or if its just a bad situation in general.  Characters 9/10   
 
 
 
 
Our fantastic protagonist kaiji is back while he is still  a bit of a mean spirited person  the development from season 1 he has extremely pure goals and  pretty much putting his life on the line against impossible odds.  
 
 Sometimes not always winning in the end and adding more despair and tension to the series.  
 
The side characters and the villains are also unique the villains are evil evil fucking people and you just want something really awful to happen to them at the end of it.  and the sides especially kaiji's friends being a great bunch of unlucky people.  
 
Enjoyment 10/10  
 
The show had me on the edge of my seat most of the time more in the second half as it had way more build up then the first half. But still weaker in general.  
 
l really enjoyed the second season of  kaiji even though l didn't like it as much as the first season and the resolution is a bit too open ended for my tastes.  
Overall 8/10  Kaiji's second season is something you should definitely see if you loved the first season.  
 
 But the second half may  frustrate you imagine how the people who watched this shows airing right fuck that must have been awful anyway thanks for reading my review.

Story: 9/10 
 
You'd think the novelty of high gambling will be dull after 26 episodes right? But Kaiji's sequel not only delivers yet again but surpasses expectations! But it's not all a win. The story pits Kaiji into an underground camp as a slave laborer in order to pay off his debts. As in typical Kaiji fashion, it's not all as it seems. As Kaiji butts heads with his 1st antagonists and the 1st story arc deals with the struggle of who'll come out on top. The script delivers yet again with the stakes matching the given level of risk. The psychological element is still there but it's safe to say that season 2 leans more towards who can cheat the best than actual strategy. 
   The second arc continues the trend of who's the better cheater, showing a natural flow from one arc to another. However, there's a reason the story doesn't get a 10/10 and that will become apparent as soon as you reach the 2nd half. The challenge is a 1/1000,000,000 high gamble game of pachinko. And unlike season 1, where arcs were resolved within 6-7 episodes, the final arc will have you yelling ""FUCKIN WIN ALREADY!""  at your monitor, as it's apparent that it's being stretched to reach it's desired 26 episode mark. The ending also remains open-ended. 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
Never since the Death Note potato chip eating scene has scenes about mundane tasks get the blood pumping! 
 
It's Madhouse, it should go without saying that they always deliver. The ugly yet appealing character designs are as bold and GAR as ever! There's also a clear improvement of the facial features. Giving the over the top look of joy or anguish when necessary. The visual metaphors also added a much-needed flare for a show with no real physical action. You know, the whole ""if Kaiji is winning, he's grasping the universe"" or ""if he's losing he's sinking into a swamp"" that kinda thing. Although it can become unnecessary at times, done only to extend the episode run time. Nerveless, if you like the blood rush of this series then it'll do the job! 
 
 
Sound: 8.5/10 
 
ZAWA ZAWA ZAWAAA 
 
The sound also keeps stride. The attention to detail is apparent, from the hissing sound of an air current to the crackling of dice in a bowl. The soundtrack is also well synchronized in scenes when needed. Especially noteworthy during the symbolic visual cues throughout the show. and who can forget the 'ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA' lol 
 
 
Characters: 8/10 
 
Kaiji radiates so much GAR that Kenshiro will nod in approval. He's also slightly developed as well, as his methods for winning become more cutthroat than from season 1.  That doesn't mean he changed, in fact, he still trusts others too easily right up to the very end. A point even brought up by a character later on. But unlike other MCs, Kaiji's flaws are apparent and in the same process makes him feel more human. He struggles, he cares, he deceives and ultimately he learns.  
all the antagonists are over the top, and I'm talking about your Saturday morning cartoons kinda evil. But given the fact that the entire show runs on testosterone and MANLY MANPOWER it's to be expected. In fact, I would say this elevates the show more than hindering it. Making the already suspenseful roller coaster ride that more enjoyable.  
Hell, even the narrator exudes MANLY MANPOWER. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
Very little shows manage to hook me from beginning to end. Kaiji 2 became just as addicting as gambling itself as I found myself marathoning it without stop. This was an exhilarating thrill ride that brought my GAR meter back to stable conditions. 
 
Overall 9/10 
 
If you're a fan of manly men doing insanely manly shit and psychological mind games then this is the anime for you. But be warned, once you start there's no stopping it!

As they adventure, people begin to refer to them as ""Those Who Hunt Elves,"" gaining a reputation as warriors that put a stop to evil-doers with their miraculous cannon, terrifying elves by stripping any that they find.

When they find them, they will be able to return to Japan.
The Elf Hunters travel by means of a Type 74 tank, which has been transported to the magical world with them.
The reaction of various elves as the team attempts to strip them naked is a primary basis for much of the show's humor, and are more ridiculous than suggestive. The series is also known for breaking the fourth wall, mostly from Junpei.
","Wow… this is, um, different. It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over.  
 
Lets talk about the characters, shall we? There is a young high school girl named Ritsuko who seems to have a tank and tons of guns and ammo. How a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Her character is a bit duncy and slightly annoying at times because she is a natural high school student with a military fedish. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he takes the cake. All he seems to care about is food and his high and mighty actress, Airi. He always fights Ritsuko and just… I can’t deal with him. Airi is so high and mighty about being an actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well for the comedy that they are trying to keep.  
 
Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2. Seriously, I just feel they did what they did at the ending to make more money with the second season.  
 
The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously.  
 
The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I don’t know but it feels way too serious for what it actually is. I love the dubs script since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script a lot. The voices on the other hand really fail at times making characters hard to take seriously when they need to be or just plain annoying. Sometimes characters seem to of been given given new voice actors who have no idea how to actually act. Many times they end up yelling way too loudly. They seem more like Bible Black in some aspects but luckily they don’t go into sexual stuff… well, not that badly.  
 
It’s fun to watch, but trust me that it isn’t the best. It’s rather laughable that works with the comedy but they can’t do a serious scene when they really need it. Even though I can’t actually give this a really good rating, its still fun to watch. 


          
 
       Helpful This anime, probably more appropriately titled ""Those Who Strip Elves"", is not horrible or unwatchable. It's just bad. While some of the recurring gags are actually funny, the story is completely contrived and repetitive, and the characters are rather unlikeable. Add annoying opening and closing songs, and the eye cancer that is late '90s anime design, and the end result is the kind of series that one watches because they're bored and have nothing better to see. 
 
The positives here are cartoony violence and seeing the inept characters deal with bizarre situations before they strip the female elf of the week. I don't really care for elves, but if you're into that kind of thing, well, there's plenty of elf nudity to satisfy your desires, as well. If this all doesn't appeal to you though, then don't even bother with this series.

","This anime can seriously go screw itself. Holy cow is this anime dogshit. Its not even entertaining to have a laugh at and i seriously contemplated strangling myself with my shoelace more than once while watching it. 
 
You might be wondering ""oh Cravey, if it was so bad why did you bother sitting through however much you watched?"". I'll start by saying i would have dropped this like shit into the dunny but i am obligated to finish it for my anime watching challenge. Brave 10 at first glance seems like it has much to offer. It has some nice voices and alright art. I especially was tricked when i thought it had a Sengoku Basara historical vibe to it. Sadly, after getting into it you soon realise that that what you're stuck with is dogshit. You'd think that if they go out of their way to use historical figures for their characters they'd be able make some of them interesting, but frankly its insulting the way they turn these legends into angsty teenage bishies. Each of the characters suck, the worst being the main girl, who suffers from typical retarded heroine syndrome. WHY are you so dumb Isanami?! Seriously, they are written so bad that you might think an autistic gerbil with downs wrote this shit. 
 
The story is dumb. It involves some lord trying to gather strong people for whatever reason, i didn't really care to follow, but it'll probably end with Isanami being retarded and screwing everyone over with her shit. Most of the screen time goes into long ass fights where they try desperately hard to try give each character some kind of interesting ability, kind of like some shit from Naruto or Bleach. I mean its OK if you're into that kind of shoneny stuff but most of the characters only ever get one fight so its kinda pointless. I mean in the first place there's too many characters. Why does the lord even have to get 10 people anyway? its not like its important to the story and it would probably be better if they just focused on a couple of characters. It like they decided 10 was a good number and made each of them have different powers so we wouldn't forget their names. The only character i remember is Isanami and that's not because she's memorable. Seriously i don't even remember the main characters name but its probably some generic ninja name like Hanzo or something 
 
The art and animation is OK. The OP and ED and pretty interesting, but other than that there's nothing much memorable in the sound.

       Helpful Pleasant But Forgettable....... 
 
Brave 10 is a somewhat comedial interpretation of the historical Sanada Ten Braves folklore. It’s not a bad anime but it’s definitely not exceptional or great for that matter. While Brave 10 might never be considered a classic, it will still manage to entertain and please the anime viewer. 
 
Story: There’s not really much to say about the story because the story of Brave 10 is weak and follows more or less in the same footsteps of many other similar anime, rarely displaying any form of originality. It follows the typical cliché character archetypes one would expect from a shounen anime and never attempts to keep viewers inclined to watch. The story has acceptable progression and can easily be understood and followed but offers nothing different or anything astonishing. 
 
Animation: This is one of the rather better aspects of Brave 10. The colors are vibrant and do an excellent job of bringing life to the anime. The colors are soft, light on the eyes and never has too much detail. The art direction is also somewhat acceptable. Characters are well designed and fit excellently to the humorous tone of the anime. The areas are also pleasing to look at. The action set pieces can seem a bit bland at times but the sequencing itself is excellent and easy to follow.   
 
Sound: The soundtrack fits the anime well but never tries to elevate it, making it quite forgettable. Seriously, you’ll probably never remember Brave 10’s soundtrack. The voices are done well but then again that’s something we’ve come to expect from an anime.  
 
Character: This is Brave 10’s biggest problem. There are too many characters that feel as if they weren’t fleshed out enough and some feel as if they were given more development than others. The characters that were given more development are surprisingly developed quite well. The problem is that a 12 episode anime is nowhere long enough to allow acceptable development for so many characters.  
 
Enjoyment: Regardless of its flaws, Brave 10 will probably be enjoyed by many viewers. I found it at times enjoyable but it never possessed that “wow” factor. It’s best to watch this anime with zero expectations to prevent a feeling of disappointment 
 
Encode: Excellent encode. Rarely saw any pixelation.	 
 
To Sum Up 
 
Ups: Nice vibrant colors that fit the anime’s tone, interesting fighting sequences, acceptable  
story progression, easy anime to follow, character development is good when it’s there. 
 
Downs: Cliché story, bland set pieces, forgettable soundtrack, character development leaves much to be desired 
 
Final Words: Brave 10 isn’t a bad anime but it will never be considered great either. Mixing so many different things into a shounen anime was a good idea but the execution of that idea was its failure.  

          
 
       Helpful Here we have another re-imagining of the ""Sengoku"" Period/Warring States Era based on the Sanada Ten Braves. Although it's an interesting twist, it doesn't deliver much in actual story; however if the story were to continue beyond the current episodes expected to air there is ample room for improvement. Personally, I love the artwork. Lines are crisp and clean, plus the color palette offers plenty of visual flair. Battles are short, too short in my opinion, and the main protagonist is made out to be some sort of bad ass warrior but is continually getting his butt handed to him. (Not a good sign) 
 
Overall, the story just seems too rushed and not completely thought through on many elements. It's a decent watch but don't get your hopes up on being a spectacular anime...at least not yet. The ending could be rather epic...maybe.

She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place, while leaving time to explore new lands. Kino says in The Land of Visible Pain that this principle is probably a lie, specifically noting ""if I stay any longer, I'm afraid I will settle down."" The recurring theme of the anime and novels is described by the phrase, ""The world is not beautiful, therefore it is."" Kino's Journey explores what the anime director Ryūtarō Nakamura described as ""a radical sense of 'beauty,'"" and brutality, loneliness, nonsense, oppression and tragedy are often juxtaposed against compassion and a fairy-tale atmosphere.
For protection and hunting, Kino carries a .44 single-action revolver (called ""the Cannon"", based on a Colt Walker) that uses liquid explosives in place of gunpowder and a .22 automatic pistol (named ""the Woodsman"", based on a Colt Woodsman). Later in Kino's adventures in the novels, Kino also uses a pump-action shotgun (based on a Winchester M1897) and a semi-automatic sniper rifle (called ""the Flute"", based on an M14 rifle), along with a variety of other tools, including knives. In the anime, Kino is shown to carry no fewer than five knives, including one which can fire .22 bullets from its hilt. Kino is an unusually quick draw and practices every day before dawn.
Technology in this world exists, sometimes to the level of science fiction, although anachronisms are common (for example, the same land that has talking robots also appears to have phonographs, yet simultaneously the world has only begun to develop heavier-than-air flight). The level of technology also varies from country to country. The world is not heavily magical (the only ""magical"" elements include land that moves, talking vehicles, and a talking dog), although it has a certain fairy-tale quality.

ENGLISH: 
 
*This review does not contain spoilers and does not take into account the original product, as well as any other of its aspects (light novel, manga and other anime). 
 
""The world is not beautiful, therefore it is"". It is with this phrase, present in the anime synopsis, that we can correctly summarize the story of Kino, a young traveler, and Hermes, his motorrad (a kind of motorcycle). 
 
With a great dubbing job worth paying attention (starring Saito Souma, magnificent as Twelve in Zankyou on Terror, and Yuuki Aoi, striking in Gosick as Victorique), the story tells the adventures of Kino by the countries in which she passes, staying at most three days in each, which, according to her, is the ideal to know the customs and traditions of a place. Here, it is worth emphasizing the immense creativity in developing completely different rules and scenarios for each country, which fuels the curiosity of the viewer without letting the anime fall into the same or become too dull. It's all always new and different (although the same script will always be followed on each visit). 
 
With a dazzling animation, full of colors and with abuse of the great general plan (which masterfully reinforces the open world feeling and freedom), unfortunately the series sins in one of the points that could raise it from very good to spectacular: soundtrack. Despite an Opening beautifully performed by Yanagi Nagi, the fantastic singer behind Nagi no Asukara Endings, Ano Natsu de Matteru and many others, it's a shame that Kino no Tabi's  soundtrack has just done ""homework ""(which is not to be expected from Satoki Iida, the sound director who was also responsible for the musical part of such great hits as Angel Beats and Tsuki ga Kirei). 
 
The chemistry between the principals works, and if it were not for the fact that Kino is a human, and Hermes a motorcycle, it would not be wrong at all to assume that they were blood brothers who have always been together since the beginning of their lives. But those who think that there are only two as recurring characters are deceiving themselves. 
 
As charismatic as they are, the anime still reserves a few episodes to introduce other travelers and develop (albeit shallowly) their stories, and of course show the key character that made Kino initiate such a lifestyle (the episode in which him appeared is by far one of the most distressing and cruel). 
 
However, I can not fail to mention the total exemption of time positioning. Without any rhythm of continuity between episodes, the show culminates in sporadic and punctual stories, almost a huddle of one-shots, not knowing when they occurred or how much time passed between them. Undoubtedly, this is due to the fact that this anime is only an adaptation of the favorite stories of readers of light novel in a contest of popularity, which makes it impossible to connect the facts of history. Anyway, it is absolutely possible to skip a few episodes (or almost all) and still be within the end of the series. 
 
A brave anime, full of endings of imaginative and unexpected episodes (the feeling of surprise is constant during the watch), a pinch of fantasy, dialogues, monologues and a miraculous break of the fourth wall in the last scene, in which Hermes assumes the paper of the viewer, and Kino, the representative of the series in general. Kino no Tabi is more than fit to marathon on a rainy weekend accompanied by treats. 
 
PORTUGUESE; 
 
*Esta crítica n?o apresenta spoilers e n?o leva em conta o produto original, bem como nenhuma outra de suas vertentes (light novel, mangás e outros animes). 
 
“O mundo n?o é bonito, portanto é”. ? com essa frase, presente na sinopse do anime, que podemos resumir corretamente a história de Kino, uma jovem viajante, e Hermes, sua motorrad (uma espécie de moto). 
 
Com um excelente trabalho de dublagem que vale a pena prestar aten??o (protagonizado por Saito Souma, magnífico como Twelve em Zankyou no Terror, e Yuuki Aoi, marcante em Gosick como Victorique), a história conta as aventuras de Kino pelos países em que passa, ficando no máximo três dias em cada, tempo que, de acordo com ela, é o ideal para se conhecer os costumes e tradi??es de um lugar. Aqui, vale ressaltar a imensa criatividade em desenvolver regras e cenários completamente distintos para cada país, o que ati?a a curiosidade do telespectador sem deixar que o anime caia na mesmice ou se torne ma?ante demais. ? tudo sempre novo e diferente (apesar do mesmo roteiro sempre ser seguido em cada visita). 
 
Com uma anima??o estonteante, cheia de cores e com abuso do grande plano geral (o que refor?a com maestria a sensa??o de mundo aberto e liberdade), infelizmente a série peca em um dos pontos que poderiam elevá-la de muito boa para espetacular: a trilha sonora. Apesar de uma abertura maravilhosamente bem interpretada por Yanagi Nagi, a fantástica cantora por trás dos encerramentos de Nagi no Asukara, Ano Natsu de Matteru e muitos outros, é realmente uma pena que a soundtrack de Kino no Tabi tenha apenas feito o “dever de casa” (o que n?o é de se esperar de Satoki Iida, o diretor de som que também foi responsável pela parte musical de grandes sucessos como Angel Beats e Tsuki ga Kirei). 
 
A química entre os principais funciona, e se n?o fosse pelo fato de Kino ser um humano, e Hermes uma moto, n?o seria nada errado supor que eram irm?os de sangue que sempre estiveram juntos desde o início de suas vidas. Porém, enganam-se os que acham que há apenas os dois como personagens recorrentes. 
 
T?o carismáticos quanto eles, o anime ainda reserva alguns poucos episódios para apresentar outros viajantes e desenvolver (apesar de forma rasa) suas histórias, e, claro, mostrar o personagem-chave que fez com que Kino iniciasse tal estilo de vida (podendo ser citado que, o episódio em que esse apareceu, é de longe um dos mais angustiantes e cruéis). 
 
Contudo, n?o posso deixar de citar a total isen??o de posicionamento de tempo. Sem haver qualquer ritmo de continuidade entre um episódio e o outro, o show culmina em histórias esporádicas e pontuais, quase que um amontoado de one-shots, sem sabermos quando ocorreram ou quanto tempo passou entre uma e outra. Sem dúvida, isso se deve ao fato de que esse anime seja apenas uma adapta??o dos contos favoritos dos leitores da light novel em um concurso de popularidade, o que nos impossibilita de ligar os fatos da história. De toda forma, é absolutamente possível pular alguns episódios (ou quase todos) e, mesmo assim, ficar por dentro do final da série. 
 
Um anime corajoso, repleto de finais de episódios imaginativos e inesperados (o sentimento de surpresa é constante durante o assistir), uma pitada de fantasia, diálogos, monólogos e uma mirabolante quebra da quarta parede na última cena, em que Hermes assume o papel do telespectador, e Kino, o de representante da série num geral. Kino no Tabi é mais do que indicado para se maratonar num final de semana chuvoso acompanhado de guloseimas.

          
 
       Helpful This is both a sequel to the old series and a remake of some of the most remarkable episodes within it. I'll try and avoid any spoilers here since this series is episodical so any spoiler would be an episode gone to waste. For the most part, I'll be comparing this series with the original one in terms of what has been improved and what has been demoted. 
 
Story 
 
As I said, most of this are completely new countries that Kino visits so even if you, like me, did watch the original series this one is still going to be enjoyable for you. The remade episodes, however, aren't as good when compared to the original. Episode 2 is a remake of a three-episode arc in the original series so they've basically removed everything good in it and replaced it with Kino practicing shooting in the entire episode. The side-characters' development was erased, Kino's perspective of the country was left ambiguous and the relationships that Kino built with most the characters were mostly unmentioned. If you haven't watched the original this, probably, won't be a problem for you. Though, the rest of the remade episodes, three in total, were well-done and although weren't as good as the original, they didn't demote the original story as was with episode 2. In either case, the new episodes are completely new experiences and most of them were very interesting and beautiful so those you're probably going to enjoy regardless of whether you watched the original series or not. 
 
Art 
 
Absolutely beautiful. The older version was fairly old so the style gave a somewhat dark vibe to it, which I frankly enjoyed. Nonetheless, this one is, in my opinion, far more suitable to the story since it intends to show the beauty of various countries and the experience of traveling from one to another. One good example of that is the scenery which have become so vibrant. Another would be the characters whom Kino encounters; the new art style adds a lot especially to the remade episodes. Kino has also become fairly more expressive and cheerful as well which I like to think of as a result to visiting that many countries and the encounters with the other travelers. 
 
Character Development 
 
In the original, the main character development we had was Kino's and Hermes' while everyone else felt like a supportive character. However, this time there are other travelers whom we see and they get their own fair share of character development as Kino does which acts as a good break to see other travel experiences. What makes it even better is their perspective of traveling is very different than Kino's. For Kino, traveling is for the sake of experiencing new things and exploring the world while for the other party, they travel mainly for the best country they get to settle in. Kino also avoids getting involved with any country no matter how absurd their way of living may be while the others apply their own beliefs and righteousness to wherever they go. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
If you liked the original, then you're definitely going to enjoy this one as well. New countries, new people and absolutely stunning scenery. Most of what you liked in the older version is still here with even more. 
 
If you're new to the series and don't want to bother seeing the older version, this anime is mild when it comes to action, but it has its own share. It's going to be somewhat like a slice of life experience, but with traveling from place to another. Kino faces her own share of hardships and sad unpleasant encounters as she travels, but the fun and enjoyment of traveling overwhelm those greatly.

The Orginal Kino's Journey or as I like to call it OG Kino is an endless classic that many anime fans love. It had great worldbuilding, amazing themes, and messages; the episodic episodes were well told and well written that had a point. The characters despite being episodic were all memorable and likable due to them being well written. The visuals while being basic had great direction and cinematography and music while not having many tracks was still great. Plus both the sub and the dub were very good. 
While I was watching OG Kino I decided to watch the new Kino alongside with OG Kino weekly. After watching the last episode of New Kino as well watching the last episode of OG a day prior to watching the last episode of New Kino and am going to say this right now. 
 
New Kino or as I like to call it Lerche Kino completely misses the point of the original series in every way possible as well completely disrespects fans of the original series. 
After watching OG I was satisfied with what I watched, however, Lerche Kino makes me facepalm because Lerche Kino took everything that was great from the OG Kino and manages to fuck it all up to a point where I can say is THIS IS NOT MY KINO. 
With all that said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review of Kino' Journey 2017 (Lerche Kino) and with that all that said let's us begin. 
 
Story. 
 
The story of Lerche Kino is the same as the original Kino. It follows a young girl called Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes and they travel to many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands. 
 
The story of Lerche Kino is a mess. A very boring, uninspiring and poorly directed mess. 
To get things started the show doesn’t have much atmosphere. I know am talking about the visuals this early but this is the problem that Lerche kino and it hardly goes away. Because Lerche has almost no atmosphere most of the worlds that Lerche Kino goes to arc bland compared to the original. You see every Country in OG has a different and unique atmosphere that showcases the tone of each country as well as the theme. Lerche Kino hardly does this because each world that Lerche Kino shows are either watered down versions of OG Kino or they are just uninspiring new Country’s that OG Kino did not showcase. 
One of the examples of Lerche Kino being uninspiring is in episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others. That episode alone completely sets the wrong tone of the series which I will explain soon after a compare the first episode of OG Kino. The first episode of OG Kino which is called Land of Visible Pain where Kino visits a town where people with incredibly advanced technology, however, it appears that everyone is living in total isolation and shuns any contact of other people. Once Kino finally started to have a conversation with one the town residents he reveals the advanced technology of the town allowed them to modify their bodies so they can understand each other thoughts allowing for much easier communication. Ofbersly this idea eventually turned sour because it meant that people could no longer hide thoughts on each other and so the nonstop communication eventually drove everyone in the town into isolation. The main themes that were explored in that episode were human modifying, isolation and the consequences of relying on advanced technology. OG Kino did a great job with the first episode and its easily one of the best first episode I have ever seen in an anime. 
Lerche Kino Episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others is a perfect example of how to not do the first episode. Kino travels to a country where murder is legal and the reason why she even wants to travel to that country is that she want's to kill someone just for her own satisfaction that she killed someone. She want's to kill someone not because she has a grudge against someone or anything like that but she wants to kill someone just for her own satisfaction. Do you see how this series completely misses the point? Not only that the episode itself doesn't really change the nature of the murder of that town not to mention there's barely any theme exploration as well having characters that you can sympathize with in that town. 
  
Don’t get me started with the Colosseum arc in episode 2 because that arc was atrocious. Not only the themes were butchered to hell but the pacing, writings, character interactions/development and production values were abysmal.  It felt like a badly made shounen series. 
Another problem with Lerche is pacing and worldbuilding. The pacing in Lerche Kino is honestly pretty damn bad. Most episodes just drag on to the point where you just get bored and let’s be real unlike OG Kino most of the events of Lerche are not that interesting in a slightest due to the show butchering its themes and messages for no reason other than appeal to the lowest common denominator of anime fans who like watching crappy light novel adaptations from A1 Pictures. As for worldbuilding, it’s very lackluster and almost none existent. Every Country in OG had a lot of detail put into it while most of the Country in Lerche Kino feels empty and lifeless. 
However, I give Lerche Kino this. 
As much I dislike Lerche Kino colosseum arc Lerche Kino did a good job with the Kino back-story arc and it was the only arc that I can consider to be good in Lerche Kino, 
Overall the story of Lerche Kino is terrible. It has poor pacing, butchered arcs, no atmosphere, barely any themes exploration. 
 
3/10 
 
Characters. 
 
This is where the show literally falls apart. 
Why because the characters in Lerche Kino are a complete bastardization to the OG counterparts. 
Seriously it’s like director Tomohisa Taguchi didn’t even watch the original series while directing Lerche Kino. 
Let’s start with Kino herself. What did Tomohisa Taguchi do to you? The original Kino is a transient being and her personality was kept to a minimum. What makes the original Kino so great are her unpredictable reactions. 
Lerche Kino has too much personality and she often portrayed as a little brat. What makes it worse he is her reactions which are almost predictable and this alone completely defeats the entire point of her character. Overall Lerche Kino is shit. 
As for the rest of characters. They are all bland and uninteresting which is honestly a shame because characters like Shizu and Shishou were interesting in the original while in the new one they are bland and uninteresting. 
 
Overall the characters in Lerche are a big failure. 
 
2/10  
 
Visuals. 
 
The original Kino wasn’t the best-looking anime in the world is as it sticks to the old washed out color pallet for every episode but what the original Kino had over Lerche Kino is constantly as well having great cinematography. 
 
Why am I bringing this up? Because the visuals in Lerche Kino is shit. 
Terrible lighting, subpar character designs that are inconstant and constantly go off model, awful background design that doesn’t fit with characters that are in it. What makes this worse is the camera shots and overall direction. For example Episode 1 we have a close shot of Kino traveling while the backgrounds are just burred out and overall less detailed. Also unlike the original Hermes is completely done in CGI and it was horrible. Poor Hermes you DESERVED better than this. 
As for the animation itself, it’s pretty okay overall. 
The main reason why I really dislike the visuals of Lerche Kino’s because not only it abandons the charm and consistently from the original but it actually butchered a lot of messages thanks to this shows shitty visual direction and poor camerawork. 
 
Overall the visuals of Lerche Kino are shit and it completely missed the point of the original Kino. 
 
3/10 
 
Sound. 
 
The soundtrack in Lerche Kino is bland and very forgettable. 
 
The opening and ending themes are pretty decent overall and they fit into the series quite decently. 
 
As for sub vs dub. They are both pretty good overall so I have no complaints. 
 
5/10 
 
Final Thoughts. 
 
So that was Lerche Kino. A bad remake that has terrible production values, shitty writing, butchered themes, lackluster characters and awful pacing. 
 
This is honestly one of the worst anime remakes I have ever seen in anime. 
 
It completely misses the point of the original Kino series and it has no charm on its own at all. 
 
This is one no contest one of the worst animes from 2017. 
 
You better off watching the original Kino and completely skipping Lerche Kino. 
 
Final Score 3/10

9,758,122,5.457281515,A group of people living together,RahXephon: Tagen Hensoukyoku,"Ayato Kamina was separated from the girl he loved, Haruka Mishima, when an event occurred that was thought to have killed everyone outside of Tokyo. But one day three years later, invaders suddenly attacked the city. It was then that he meets an agent of TERRA, Haruka Shitow, who tells him that she will give him the truth about the world. It is the beginning of a series of strange events, which involve him activating a giant mecha, the RahXephon and finding out that many people, including his own mother, has blue blood, and that he was actually living in a self-encased dimension where time moves slower than that of the outside world. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Psychological', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Ayato Kamina and his classmate Reika Mishima are in middle school and are a young couple, still dealing with some awkwardness. However, the sudden appearance of visitors from an alternate dimension, the ""Mu"", tears the two apart. All of Tokyo is enveloped in the giant hemispherical Absolute Barrier, which looks very similar to Jupiter, and they become separated into the world inside and the world outside.
Three years later, Ayato, who was left inside, has become a high school student. He has been taught that the world outside has been obliterated and feels as though his memories of Reika  are a distant vision. But one day, invaders from outside attack, and Tokyo is engulfed in the fires of war. And as Ayato runs about in confusion, a woman appears before him. The woman says her name is Haruka Shitow and tries to take Ayato outside the Absolute Barrier, saying, ""I'll tell you the truth.""
The truth is, her identity is his former girlfriend, Haruka Mishima. But now, she is 12 years his senior...The power of the Absolute Barrier had delayed the advancement of time inside. That was something Ayato's mother, Maya Kamina, had plotted solely for the purpose of his awakening. Maya was in fact the leader of the Mu. And as Ayato was the tuner of time, who held the fate of the world in his hands...a person who had the ability to reform the world that had been torn apart into the Mu and Earth.
Ayato awakens during his escape with Haruka.  He is drawn to the giant in the image of a God, ""RahXephon"", and ends up aboard it. After the RahXephon destroys the Mu super-weapon, ""Dolem"", it escapes Tokyo with Haruka. Having the Mu's Dolem with the RahXephon. Haruka can only support Ayato in his battles, not even being able to bring herself to tell him who she is.
There was an even more cruel fate awaiting the two. When Ayato achieves true awakening and become one with the RahXephon, the world stands upon the brink of destruction. In order to prevent this from happening, Haruka must kill Ayato, whom she has finally found once again. Will Haruka be able to tell him how she feels and save Ayato and the world?
","Ah, the Rahxephon movie. How much you get dismissed. 
A lot of things you might hear about the Rahxephon movie is how most of it is just copied and pasted from the series, how it's rushed and makes very little sense. This is true. BUT you need to take into consideration two things: this movie was not a theatrical release, but a made-for-TV special. Secondly, NHK demanded this movie from Bones with a ludicrous deadline that they barely completed as it is. So, with that in mind... 
I think, as a stand-alone ""movie"", it sucks. Which is no great surprise to anybody. I do, however, think it's a great supplement to the series. It's really best if you watch it DIRECTLY after seeing the last episode with no break in between. I find it's like End of Eva for me, in that it should theoretically be very confusing, but actually clears up a lot I didn't understand about the series' ending. 
The movie is technically an AU or re-telling, but even so it helps clarify the series' version rather than make a completely new and bizarre one. So, as long as you're talking about it as part of the series, I really don't think it's so bad.

          
 
       Helpful Somehow, after watching the movie, some things were more clear to me, but it wasn't enough. the movie isn't some other story as it should have been to my opinon, after watching what Bones did to eureka7 movie. 
The movie is like copy past of the series but with new scenes and make some thing more clear, the problem is, the series have many things to understande that building in each episode and episode, the movie didn't do something like this and just put a 26 episodes in one movie and skipping so much important things, changing characters and also deleting characters, it's not good, but it's not bad either. 
Still, it's still RahXephon... but not the RahXephon I loved so much, recommending watching the movie right after complete the anime, so you will understand much more. for me, I need another good watch on the TV-anime to clear some things, and... because the story I falled in loved in and like other psychological animes, I love rewatching.

          
 
       Helpful It's been a while since I watched this movie and my memory of it as a whole was not very special, its just that it's music is one of my most favorite. With that this review says it all. I re-watched the movie a few days ago...just to clarify myself about it and boy was I thrilled. 
 
The music was as I remembered...absolutely captivating! The movie as a whole was what would call a nice, good anime but with nothing out of the ordinary. The story was very confusing at times..indeed for those who haven't watched the anime series it can get very troublesome as they won't know which end's which. But it gets better eventually, though as the plot is so rushed you won't get any time to settle in. On the whole its plot needs the support of the movie to survive than the the other way round. 
 
Artwork was ..for it's time..nicely done..especially w.r.t Rahxephon. Again however the scenes are so rushed that you don't get to grasp the full meaning of each picture..for example the Dolems (giants) were given too inadequate a time compared to the anime series, they mentioned even briefly..you start to think them as side characters whereas in the anime they hold an almost pivotal position. 
 
Characters in the movie fared of better..at least select ones.. than most other aspects of it. In particular mental growth of the main characters is clearly visible. Here too though some mismanagement made it's way in for some characters who were proudly introduced but then conveniently ignored. 
This contributes to a lot of headache in understanding the story. 
 
In the end however, the soundtrack impressed me a lot..even if little else did. The music is absolutely fantastic..though it has only one real song. Then again you might expect at least this from an anime whose main theme is a musical world. The assertion that the movie was saved only thanks to its music would hardly be unfair. In particular a certain soundtrack in the middle of the movie almost made me cry. I would thus definitely recommend the movie to any lover of anime music, I can virtually guarantee that you won't be disappointed. 
 
In a sense a person can truly enjoy the movie only if he hasn't seen the anime first...otherwise the whole plot is spoiled. That's the way it worked for me.

","This by far is one of the most unique anime out there. I mean everything is unique, the storyline, the characters, even the animation! This anime can be greatly appreciated by comedy lovers and users who have a passion for let's say 'crazed' storylines. But be warned, most of the comedy in this one are 'dirty', in other words related to sex, and are just weird. Compared to other comedy/gag anime out there this has to be the best. 
 
Now let's take a deeper look at the sound and animation since we identified most of the other areas. I would give the sound a 9/10, since the OSTs, particularly the opening and ending themes were very funny to listen to and they suited this type of gag anime. The art on the other hand was OUTSTANDING, (yes I have to say it caps) since it is so well done and it stands out from other typical artworks. Describing the artwork using words is hard so I'll use weird words like 'crisp' and 'clean' to describe it. 
 
The comedy really had me going there throughout the anime. Its really the king of gags. Enjoyment 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Looking for an anime with the wackiest, silliest, dirtiest humor out there? Want an anime that's so ridiculous and over the top that it would put other comedy anime to shame? Look no further than Katte Ni Kaizou, translated as, ""Kaizou Who Does As He Pleases!"" 
Story: 5 
To tell you the truth, the story description on the site is only true for the first two episodes. The whole idea about being a gullible boy with delusions isn't really carried out throughout the rest of the series. Still, it doesn't detract from how ridiculous this anime is.  
Art: 10 
The art is pretty memorable. Shaft made the characters' movements very fluid and there aren't too many still frames throughout this anime. Both animation and art were very well done. 
Sound: 8 
Weirdass opening and weirdass ending (very catchy ending theme). Both fit well with the show and as for the actual OST, it was quirky which fit with the overall mood of the show. 
Characters: 4 
Very flat and one dimensional characters. It's really not a big deal though because this isn't what the show is focused on (it's gag-based and wants to make you laugh). The characters were there for the sake of being there and fit their roles pretty well for the most part. Want development? This show says, ""Fuck it. Let's have as much fun as we can with weird ass gags."" 
Overall Enjoyment: 10 
For what this show is, it succeeds in being hilarious. It's unique, quirky, and the weirdest anime I've ever seen. Highly enjoyable if you want to laugh or if you're looking for something different.  
Would I watch a sequel? 
Sure, why the hell not? XD

          
 
       Helpful This series is well written, has good artwork, good animation, good characters, and a decent soundtrack. So why only a 7? The reason it's so good, and the reason it's not a 10 is the same: it's a prototype for Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. 
 
It's pretty simple really. The characters look, sound, and act like the characters in SZS. The animation, soundtrack, sound effects are all similar for obvious reasons.  The quirky randomness is the same. The way the story seems to take place at school, but the characters meet around town and engage in silliness is the same.  
 
But as stated earlier, it's a prototype. As you watch, you can tell Kette ni Kaizou is less mature and sophisticated than SZS. The former has less social commentary(though it does happen occasionally) and replaces it with ridiculousness, sexual jokes, and general being over the top.  
 
Since these connections are so clear, they are constantly in your mind as you watch. I'm sure this was done intentionally to ride on SZS's popularity but that's what's holding it back. It doesn't have it's own identity, and will always be overshadowed by it's better and more successful older(or younger depending on how you look at it) brother. It's still fun, enjoyable, and funny, just not great.

(Source: ANN)","['Hentai', 'Horror']",none,"Fantastic hentai with plot. You will end up watching the whole thing. In general, most people watch hentai to fap/look for fap scenes and then they're done. How many people actually continue because they want to see the story, and is what you're seeing more than just a stage show for sex? That is probably a good way to define if a hentai has plot. A hentai is definitely good hentai when you want/able to fap to it, but it is the sex scene that hooks you in. When I see a hentai with plot, I desire to hold any fap intentions in just to see the story play out. I go back and pick a part to fap after I finished watching. This hentai is exactly that hentai with plot. It got an excellent, interesting, and really developed plot. All the girls get to have sex through plot development not because its her turn to have sex. The characters are honest which I like, acting human with great backstories. Right off the bat, I'm going to say this hentai is a hidden gem. It has a lot of elements, ROMANCE, consensual, bondage, stun gun, rape, mild feeling of NTR, teens, oniichan, all incorporated very well. The main character Ryuichi is a much better guy than the average loser. Hiromi got a sexy body, and Wakaba is a cute imouto. The flashbacks Ryuichi gets really presents much buildup and suspense. Don't be intimidated by the synopsis that someone dies. It does happen, but it's not painful to watch and contributes to the suspense/peril of the current situation/story. The ending is really suspenseful, adds a lot of emotions, and is a good end/make sure to watch past credits of episode 3. To describe my experience with this hentai, thumbs up it's my favorite.

Enjoyment - 10 
 
To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself! 
Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women? 
 
Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you!

          
 
       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.  
 
Art: 7 
I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.  
 
Sound: 8 
I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime?Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime?Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime?Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

9,23225,126,5.368731616,A group of people living together,Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi!,"Even during summer break, the Amusement Club lives up to its name! When Akari Akaza, Kyouko Toshinou, Chinatsu Yoshikawa, and Yui Funami find a camping tent, they decide to put it to good use by spending the weekend outside in the mountains. When some student council members catch wind of this, they are invited to come along as well. 
 
After a very long journey, the group arrives at their destination and is ready to make the most of their trip. They engage in classic camping activities, such as outdoor cooking and tests of courage, and finish it all off with a visit to the hot springs. An extravagant trip like this doesn't happen every day, but the Amusement Club is sure to savor each moment. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Shoujo Ai', 'Slice of Life']","Taking place at the fictional Nanamori Middle School in Takaoka, Toyama, the series revolves around the daily lives of the Amusement Club (ごらく部, Goraku-bu), consisting of Akari Akaza, her childhood friends, Kyōko Toshinō and Yui Funami, and her classmate, Chinatsu Yoshikawa; along with the school's Student Council which is made up of its own set of characters.
","It's been almost 2,5 years of waiting but Yuru Yuri is finally back! 
 
Assuming you've seen both seasons of the TV-series prior to this, there is little need for introduction and thus I will keep this short. It's the same good old character cast as it has always been; Akari's hair buns are still detachable, Chinatsu's artistic skills are still frighteningly bad and TOSHINOU KYOUKO is still as whimsical and energetic as ever in her tomato outfit. 
 
In this 1-hour OVA, after a rather... *unexpected* opening scene, the story is about the whole group going on a camping trip in the summer. It's a very typical slice-of-life story without any unusual elements attached to it. However the comedy, the light Yuri moments and the relaxing atmosphere of the series is still as good as it ever was, showing that Yuru Yuri's concept is far from dead yet. 
 
Furthermore we get brand new opening and ending themes for this special alone, both of which are very catchy in typical Yuru Yuri fashion. I also felt like the animation quality was all-round improved here compared to the TV-series. 
 
Overall, while simplistic this OVA still manages to once again show why Yuru Yuri is and always has been one of the absolute best slice-of-life moe comedies in the anime industry, and it should thus be considered a must-watch for anyone willing to call themselves a fan of the original series. 
 
As a final note, at one point this OVA also gave an implication that the show may return in the future in some shape or form. So... season 3 when? 
EDIT: As of March 7th, Yuru Yuri 3rd Season has now been confirmed~ :)

          
 
       Helpful Watching YuruYuri Nachuyachumi is like reuniting with an old friend, and the spark of friendship reignites. I remember when I watched seasons one and two back in 2012, and I liked it a lot. However, the ending for the second season felt incomplete, and that has bothered me for a long time. Thus, when this OVA was announced, I was so hyped that you wouldn't even believe it! Luckily, the hype I had was well worth it. 
 
In case you're not familiar with YuruYuri, it's basically a slice-of-life centering around around four middle school girls, Akari Akaza, Kyoko Toshino, Yui Funami, and Chinatsu Yoshikawa. Akari, Kyoko, and Yui are childhood friends who form the Amusement Club, a club where they basically slack off and do whatever the heck they want. Did I mention that they have taken over the room of the now-defunct Tea Club? Chinatsu, who is a classmate of Akari's, comes into the Amusement Club room hoping to join the Tea Club, but she ends up joining the Amusement Club instead. Hilarity and maybe a touch of yuri ensues. 
 
In this OVA, it's summer break, and the Amusement Club, along with a few member's of the Student Council (Ayano Sugiura, Chitose Ikeda, Himawari Furutani, and Sakurako Oomuro), are camping! Now, doesn't that sound like fun? 
 
Now, I'm not going to lie; this OVA, along with the series itself, is very cute. The story is a very relaxing one, and there are a lot of funny moments. For example, when one of the characters, Chitose, takes off her glasses, she has yuri fantasies about Kyoko and Ayano. Not funny enough? Okay, then what if she has nosebleeds when she does? Laugh-inducing yet? 
 
As always, the characters are quite fun to watch, especially Chitose and Akari. (Who? Don't worry; that's an inside joke.) The OP and ED for this OVA are really cute, as well, and as always, the voice actresses fit their roles quite well. Now, let's talk about the animation. The animation studio for seasons one and two of YuruYuri was Dogakobo, but the animation studio has changed to TYO Animations. It's not too hard to notice, either. That's okay, though, because the animation is actually pretty good. 
 
YuruYuri Nachuyachumi was overall a good episode of YuruYuri and a good OVA overall. Is it the best? No, not really. However, it does make me remember how much I liked the series when I watched it a few years ago. I'm also looking forward to the upcoming third season!

          
 
       Helpful What's better than a 24-minute episode of our favorite Yuru Yuri anime? An OVA that is 1 hour long. Yes, that's 60 minutes of Yuri Yuri's cute cast. Is it really worth watching for an hour, or is this OVA a bust.  
 
                         JAPANESE LEARNERS (2/5 Easy to Understand) 
 
Yuru Yuri still manages to be an easy anime to understand without subtitles if you are at the intermediate and advanced levels. It may just be me, but after watching Yuru Yuri seasons 1 and 2, I've come to the realization that the grammar and vocabulary used in this show is rather simplistic. No matter, if you are a beginner, feel free to use this anime as a tool for your Japanese learning. 
 
                                                        STORY 
 
For a one hour OVA, there really isn't too much of a plot to be expected. In short, the girls go on a camping trip during the summer. Yes, I know what you ecchi fans are thinking (I'm one myself). Why the heck are they going on a camping trip doing the summer? What about the beach? Yes, the beach. The number one place where our cute Yuru Yuri cast can be seen in tight bikinis and school swimsuits. Ah, but I have some good news, my ecchi friends. If you are patient and wait until the near end of the one-hour episode, you are treated to an osen scene where you get to see all the characters butt-naked. That's pretty much it for the story, though. They should've gone to the beach. 
 
                                              ANIMATION/ART 
 
I was really impressed with the animation. It might be because the developers had a lot of time and budget money to work on this OVA. The character models are fascinating. Also, there are two scenes which were reminiscent of a Miyazaki Hayao film. The camping scenes in the forest were also nice and made me feel as I was camping too, if only it would have been the beach, though      
 
                                                          SOUND 
 
There was nothing special about the sound this time around. The OST was that of a typical slice of life anime. I will say that I did enjoy the cicadas and cricket noises as it is a perfect summer noise. I would have loved some campfire music since most of the scenes were taking in the forest. Just don't expect any Clannad OST here. 
 
                                                    CHARACTERS 
 
By this time around, you should be really familiar with the characters so I won't go in-depth with them. However, I am proud to say that all the main characters are in this episode. In the original season, certain characters appear in certain episodes so if you hated one certain character then that particular episode might have been painful for you to watch. Thankfully, there is a 99.9% chance that you will get to enjoy your favorite cute Yuru Yuri character in this episode. 
 
                                     FINAL VERDICT/ENJOYMENT 
 
Let me get right down to it. No beach. There I said it. Who goes camping during the summer. Why couldn't they just go to the beach. I wanted to see bikini-clad Yuru Yuri chicks.(っ??╭╮??)っ Okay, despite that detrimental setback, this one hour OVA was rather quite good. It wasn't as funny as a regular Yuru Yuri episode and there weren't many parodies, but it was well worth a watch.

The leader of the Jetters Mighty is a powerful Bomberman, who is looked up to and respected....his brother however is a lazy crude slacker named Shirobon. Suddenly Mighty disappears and Shiro finds himself placed in a new situation. Shiro steps up and become a responsible Bomberman, and with the new friends he made of the Jetters it may become possible for him to be the next ""Jetters leader."" 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","The Jetters are a highly trained intergalactic police force for keeping unique items safe from the Hige-Hige bandits. Mighty, an expert Bomberman and the leader of the Jetters, disappears while on a mission. Dr. Ein accepts Mighty's younger brother, White Bomber, into the Jetters because they need a Bomberman for the team. White Bomber is clumsy and childish, but idolizes his older brother. White Bomber and the rest of the Jetters have many adventures, foiling Doctor Mechado and Mujoe's plans to steal one-of-a-kind objects, facing off against the Hige-Hige Bandits, and returning antiques to their rightful owners.
Early episodes of Bomberman Jetters started out with the ""monster of the week"" formula, where Dr. Mechado and Mujoe would send in one of their ""Super Combined"" Bombermen one at a time to attack the Jetters.
Eventually the format shifted from light-hearted comedy ""monster of the week"" to a more dramatic, darker action story dealing with the themes of death, betrayal, and revenge, but still retaining some of the lighter aspect. Plots include characters going through trials with character development such as Shout learning the truth about her mother, how Bagular first met Mujoe, and White Bomber dealing with learning the truth of what happened to his older brother Mighty.
","This is one of my favorite animes of all time. The show, as you guys all know, is based on the videogame series called Bomberman. The story in this cartoon is about the young White Bomber, joining some kind of police force called Jetters.  
 
Of course who would oppose peace, and the Jetters? An ""evil"" scientist and his own group of tiny little robots, with a blond tan guy as his second in command. Oh and there is another evil scientist that works for him as well. 
 
Surprisingly there are some plot twists, so it's not just a journey from point a to point b. Before these twists all occur, White Bomber must learn how to create different sorts of bombs, and surpass his older brother (who mysteriously disappeared). 
 
It is interesting to note that by the end of the series, White Bomber never actually collects all the bomb crystals (think of it like a power up). Usually these kind of shows has the hero collect something, or go through tons of training before fighting the final boss. So that is another thing I liked about this show. 
 
I wish there was another season, even to this day, but.... 
 
Anyway, you guys should definitely check this show out!

          
 
       Helpful This is my review for Bomberman Jetters, spoiler-free. I first found Bomberman Jetters by playing the game. Later, I found that there was an anime adaptation of Bomberman Jetters and watched it. It was two years ago then since I last watched it. So I decided to write a review for a relatively unknown anime that some had come to like. 
 
Story: 8/10. 
The story starts off rather silly and well, periodic with their monster of the week formula and silly objective of protecting the one-of-a-kind item in the universe! Sounds silly enough. It even has running gags that the characters point out. However, it has a sad tone to it when the main titular character, Shirobon, or known as White Bomber, finds out what really happened to his brother, Mighty. Even with the sad parts, it retains its light-hearted nature. Since this anime is a kodomo anime, meant for kids, you really will not take the anime seriously. So if you do not mind the story littered with mostly humour at the beginning and towards the end, watch this. The ending was heartening and lively, so I gave it an 8. Another funny interesting thing is, they seem to point out the out-of-place things, hence another funny part of the series. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
Okay, this is probably the anime's weak spot. Upon re-watching the series, I realised how little sound tracks the anime had used. They are constantly being overused. At least about 5 or 7 tracks. Sometimes, they also place it there to be more 'dramatic' in the sense but it will a bit ruin it. But I gave it a 7 for putting the music there when it is needed. It does not neglect that need. Especially the ending. As for the OPs, the songs are very catchy and easy to like to. EDs are soothing though for me, I rarely watch EDs. 
 
Art: 7/10 
I am not a art freak, but this anime was produced about seven years ago in 2003. The colours are bright/colourful and sometimes animation clips were reused, mainly Shirobon's ""BOMBERRRR SHOOT!"" It IS an kodomo anime, so bright colours are expected. Not so bright as Heartcatch Pretty Cure though >_> It is alright. One more thing everyone asks, why do the Bomberman have no mouths? Who knows... The animation quality is not bad, with it being fluid at the most important parts. 
 
Character: 8/10. 
Shirobon starts off as your average ten year old who is arrogant, naive to the world. His arrogance still continues, however later on he will turn out to be a likeable character. There are many other characters who shine and yet some who don't. Gangu and Bongo are comic relief characters, though they help the team at some point. Birdy is your awesome behind-the-scenes character who supports the team. That doesn't mean the cool guy doesn't have a weakness. Though there isn't any characters you would want to hate, especially the Shitennou. They were hilarious and fun to watch, though they had to die off. 
 
Enjoyment:9/10 
Honestly, I had enjoyed this anime. It was humourous and enlightening. It teaches you how to go on with life and what not, strangely for a kid's anime. The ending was so good that I really liked it a lot. The anime is really great and it is such a shame that it is overshadowed just because of its initial kiddyness and not taking things seriously beginning. It is a good watch, for anyone who wishes to have some humour yet have some thick plot. Ok, maybe not THAT thick. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
It is a good anime, but I will not be biased to raise the score too high. Overall I had fun with Bomberman Jetters with relative pacing and giving me laughs. The battles are one-shot and all. Bomberman Jetters is fresh and nicely paced. Not everyone may agree though, this is PURELY my opinion. First review as well.

","Totally messy action movie with sci-fi, comedy and a bit of romance thrown in. It has potential but eventually the story organization is so bad it's just gonna leave you confused and exhausted. 
 
From scene one it's hard to tell who the main character is, there is a protagonist but the screen time is divided between his sidekicks and the bad guys as well so there are lots of characters which gets needlessly confusing. To make it worse most of them aren't really interesting or important. 
 
At the 1st half the story is shallow yet fun, the bad guys want to kidnap the hero's girl and the good guys try to protect her. her memory was long erased and the movie starts with her believing the hero, her ex lover, is her father and he plays along with it. this was an interesting story line which disappointingly didn't reach a climax to wrap it up. 
 
The last act of the story is incredibly scattered and lacks of reason, just one big wtf full of deus ex machina and there are maybe 4 ""final boss"" fights. It gets to a point, several times indeed, that is laughably weird and effortlessly explained. 
 
The over all production was actually fine, I love the art and coloring of characters and locations, character design of both good and bad guys were nice, the animation is good and also the music had a nice trashy 80s feel to it to fit the cyberpunk mood.

          
 
       Helpful Even as an 80s nostalfag I really couldnt get into this. Its trainwreck, really. Its like they took every bad cliche of the time and threw it in a pot and this came out. Plot is all over the place and the soundtrack is really bad. They also repeat the same tracks too much for a 90 minute movie. 
 
Also, way too many flashback scenes. Again, this is a fucking 90 minute movie. We dont need this. 
 
It does have some pretty colorful psychedellic scenes though, and the first car chase sequence was pretty cool. 
 
But franky, only watch this if you have OCD about seeing every 80s cyberpunk movie/ovas out there. If not, stay away 
 


          
 
       Helpful I read the manga version many many years ago.....since then I forgot the name of that already, I tried to search without a clue for long.  Once in a while, I came across with this anime version and recognized the plot and the characters.  Thanks to the awesome Internet (and MyAnimeList), I could finally put my long-time search to an end. 
 
This anime version is somehow different than the manga version, and I am not going to include so here. 
 
And I want to say that, this Ai City anime kind of makes me like the bad guys more than the good guys, which is a rare case to me. 
 
Despite the fact that Ai City was made in the 1980's, there were some revolutionary sci-fi ideas being added to make this a unique classic. 
 
Lastly, I just want to mention again that, I was able to retrieve the manga name of Ai City, all because of my discovery of this anime version.

9,2450,129,5.340902399,A group of people living together,Crayon Shin-chan Movie 09: Arashi wo Yobu Mouretsu! Otona Teikoku no Gyakushuu,"Adult people all over Japan had been captivated by 20th Century Expo, theme parks that reenacted good old days of the 1970s (the last days of Japan's high economic growth). One day the adults disappeared into the theme parks, leaving their children abandoned. That was a plot by 'Yesterday Once More', an organization who despises the 21st century and tries to bring Japan back to the 20th century with the dreams and hopes. Shinnosuke and his parents, Hiroshi and Misae, fight against the plot of 'Yesterday Once More' in order to live together with family in the 21st century. 
 
(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","At this time I've only made one review, that review was about the Crayon Shin-chan series but now I'm gonna explain why Crayon Shin-chan: Adult Empire Strikes Back is one of the best movies of all time. 
 The story is so well made, it'as emotional and really original. The artstyle and the animation are just like the series, outstanding. The soud was surprisingly incredible, better than the series. 
 You get such an enjoyment cause everything is so good, the charcters are better in the series but they still are incredible in this masterpiece. 
 I give Crayon Shin-chan: Adult Empire Strikes Back an incredible 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Shinnosuke is still the same ol' perverted kid in this movie. 
 
The story begins of nice, Shinnosuke and his family star in this action movie where his Dad plays a parody superhero. (Parody of Ultraman.). After this it just continues normally, everyone we basically know from the normal series is at the World Fair's 20th Century Museum, where all the parents try to relieve they're childhood. As they are about to enter the 21st century, a certain evildoer hypnotizes adults via tv, thr...ough a 20th Century Museum commercial, this turns the adults in childs, not psysically, but mentally. 
 
This shows that Shinnosuke can be very mature, and yet.. not.  
So the story's pretty plain, but the way it is shown in this movie it's just great. 
 
They still use the same weird art style, which is just needed in Crayon Shin-Chan series/movies, specials and such. So I'll give it a good score. The sounds okay too. 
 
The characters, of course, Shinnosuke is still the same ol' perverted kid, which I said before. Furthermore he still has those crazy moods and actions. Shinnosuke's friend group is just as crazy as normally, especially when they get drunk on Oolong Tea. You can see they're mature side which you don't see very often, yet they can act as baby's the next moment. 
 
If you're ready for a bit extraordinary artstyle, alot of humor and a funny adventure. This movie is where you need to be. I recommend that you'd watch (a bit) of the series, &quot;Crayon Shin-Chan&quot;, just so you get to know the characters and minor characters a bit. But it's highly enjoyable, even to watch it several times.

Five billion people lost their lives, decreasing the world's population to 3 billion. Existing economies and military were wiped out. Countries were frozen under solid ice, plains sank beneath seas, the world was changed dramatically. 
 
Human civilization enters a chaotic era. Poverty flourished outside of these economic zones and slums were widespread. The ruling class called themselves Logos and maintained their position by force of arms. They call the poor Revenus, who are exiled to live outside the special economic areas. 
 
Time has passed since then. Katsuragi Jo and Tsurasawa Jin, escape from Phantom, a force organized to watch Revenus and to suppress renegade elements of the Logos, taking with them a mysterious girl, Nobuto Sana. There are many who are interested in her, all with their own reasons.","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi']","In the near future, after the world population and economy is devastated by a series of simultaneous hypercanes, many different factions and fledgling nations appear. In Japan, an elite class called Logos appears, controlling special zones in the country which have most of the wealth and resources. These special zones were created with the help of Power Assist Technology, which allowed Japan to recover from the consequences of the worldwide disaster (which included a combination of land subsidence and rising sea levels resulting in the permanent submerging of low-lying areas and a subsequent ice age in much of the Northern Hemisphere), albeit to a strictly limited degree. The Logos exercise control over the Revenus, a lower class who mostly live in devastated and often poverty stricken zones (urban or in close proximity) and areas (rural) known as Levinas (e.g. Levinas Sector Six, Area 18) and who struggle from day to day in order to stay alive. The Revenus are generally restricted from entering the special zones, causing tension which creates a resistance movement which fights back against the Logos.
With the tagline ""A Near Future Late-Shogunate Action Animation"", the story draws analogies with 19th-century Japan at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate period, just before the Boshin War.The story proper is mainly set in 2035 AD. Jō and Jin defect from Phantom, an elite Japanese military special operations group which is used to help control the Revenus. When they escape, they take a young girl named Sana with them. The series follows them as they work to avoid being caught by Phantom and the regular military forces of the Logos. However, there are more to things than meet the eye.
","Enjoyment / Overall :: 7 
 
The plot was good, had twists that kept me watching, and the characters were all interesting. The problem is that none of the characters have any background and there were some plot holes that bugged me. The thing is, all of this could have easily been fixed with more episodes. This series could have been great had it been longer, but ultimately, it wasn’t, so there was some wasted potential. 
 
Story :: 7.5 
 
The premise of Innocent Venus is pretty cliché: the main characters are protecting Sana from an evil organization and we don’t know why. The first half the anime is a cat and mouse game. The organization is chasing them, Jo and Jin are on the run while trying to keep Sana safe. This part of the story was pretty interesting because we get to see cool fights, meet the characters, meet the bad guys, etc. Right around the half-way point things start changing because we start learning characters motives. This leads to a lot of action, it explains why Phantom is chasing Sana, etc. There are also a few good plot twists that keep you on your seat. Overall, I thought the story was interesting and had the potential to be really good. 
 
The problem Innocent Venus has is it was too short. With only 12 episodes, they could have done some better planning. The second half seemed rushed because they just said characters motivations instead of showing us and they didn’t elaborate on anything. A lot was just said without any prior hint, which felt almost “cheap”. They could have dedicated an episode to flashback to previous events to make motives more clear, then another episode or 2 giving us some background information. At one point, a character tells us the truth behind something in a minute. If there were more episodes, that could have been an episode flashback (yes, there was enough information for an interesting episode). 
 
Because they didn’t have more episodes, there were also a lot of plot holes and wasted potential. I can’t mention all of them because of spoilers, but some things could have had more detail like: Why are Jo and Jin together? Why are some characters close to each other? Also, another thing that was disappointing with the plot was the separation between Logos and Revenus wasn’t significant at all really…they could have used that more effectively.  
 
Characters :: 7 
 
For the most part, I liked the characters. They all have unique designs and personalities. Jo is an awesome fighter and doesn’t speak much.  Jin is a good fighter, but he’s kind and caring towards Sana (wants to protect her). Sana starts off very attached to Jin and he’s all she talks about. She’s very kind, but can be a little annoying at times, not enough not to like her though. 
The problem with the characters is they don’t receive much background information because it’s only 12 episodes. For this problem, there were a few solutions: 1. Make the show longer. 2. Simplify the plot to allow characterization.  I think they should have made the show longer because the plot was good and the only suffered was because there was a lack of background information. 
  
We don’t know why characters like Shiba and Renee were close. What happened in the past with them? There are other things like why Jo is with Jin, why did they join Phantom, where did they come from, etc. I don’t expect detailed background on all the characters, but when the main cast is only 3 characters and the background for one of them (Sana) could easily have done wonders for the plot, I think they could have easily added background information. 
 
Animation :: 8.5 
 
The animation wasn’t spectacular, but it was definitely good. All the characters have unique designs and the backgrounds were all nicely done with color’s and detail. The fight scenes were also animated well, with everyone moving fluidly. As for the mecha, I actually liked the designs of them. They seemed pretty original and looked cool. Not the best, but they did their part and worked well with the story. The biggest thing people will notice is that the mecha are all CGI. At first, it didn’t look that great, but as the show progressed, the CGI got better and I got used to looking at them. Overall, I thought the CGI was integrated quite well and they all moved smoothly. 
 
Sound :: 7 
 
I’ll start with the voice acting. I watched it subbed, not dubbed, so I’ll comment on the Japanese voice actors. Everyone’s voiced matched pretty good, I especially liked Jin, Sana, and Shiba’s voices. They seemed perfect for the roles they were playing. The only voice I didn’t really like was Jo’s voice. It fit pretty good, but I felt it was off a little. I can’t really explain it too well. Honestly,  I didn’t listen to any of the openings or endings so I can’t comment on them…I just don’t like Japanese music very much…sorry… 


          
 
       Helpful Innocent Venus is a mecha type anime about the military trying to incorporate the nervous system of certain humans into machines called Gladiators. Out to stop them is the resistance and they will do everything they can to protect the one called Venus from falling into the military's hands.  
 
My thouhgts:  
I truly enjoyed watching this anime. The animation is very good and fluid. The characters of Jin and Jo are great. Jin is the calm quiet type, he'll reason with you, while Jo is the strong and quiet type and will just plain scare you. Gora could be said to be the comic relief of the story, the one who jabbers on a lot. Overall I truly enjoyed this anime and recommend it for viewing. 

          
 
       Helpful Innocent Venus is a series I heard about a while back and I was pretty excited by the first episode. I was not expecting anything groundbreaking, but I was impressed by the visual panache and overall feel of the show. As it turns out, it is one of those series that starts off strong, and then loses its drive, only to pick it back up again in the final stretch. The problem is, by the time it starts to pick up the broken pieces of itself, it is a little too late to salvage the overall product. As rare as it is for me to say this, I think this series would have been very well served to be even one episode longer, as the end feels like a mad dash to right the wrongs of the middle of the series. 
 
-- 
 
Story: 3 
 
Let us face it: there is nothing groundbreaking about the story in Innocent Venus at all, nor is the writing particularly strong. In falling to so many cliches and failing to really get beyond them, the story of Innocent Venus really drags the rest of the series down. The plot twist of the series, which could have been a very high point--and still, to some extent, manages to be--is so forcefully pushed onto the audience it loses a lot of its weight. Also, though perhaps it seems odd to mention the opening and ending animations here, they actually hint heavily at the plot twist, and raise suspicion artificially in the early stages of the show. Had it not been for the opener and closer, I would not have been waiting for the plot twist from the earliest moments of the series, and, man, would it have been a lot more impressive. I normally ignore those animations for the purposes of a review, but in such a case when they actually negatively affect the series I felt it should be mentioned. Also, the sub-plots, particularly the ones that are the focus of much of the middle portion of the series, are simply abominable, and at times make the series nigh unwatchable. I can appreciate their attempt to diversify the story, but in the execution it fell off horribly. 
 
 
Character: 6 
 
In general, the characters in Innocent Venus can be described in one word: bland. At least, pretty much every character aside from Sana, Jin, and Jo fit this description. Mostly the cast is made up of flat characters whose entire character is established within a few moments of them being on screen, and typically stick close to basic archetypes, deviating ever so slightly from time to time. However, the relationship between Sana, Jin, and Jo, offers an interesting dynamic which is really one of the major strong points of the show. However, Jo is a weak link in this chain, his reticence a great impediment to any development they might have given him, and even Jin suffers from some drastic changes that really make him a completely different character. Sana is certainly a strong point, her girlish nature amusingly and dramatically at odds with the events occurring all around her. When the three's relationship is at center stage, the show generally flourishes, but when it takes a side seat to the secondary characters and various sub-plots, it is not a pretty sight to behold. And, while the characters design is not completely without merit, the secondary characters really get shafted in this department. 
 
 
Animation: 6 
 
Right in the first episode Innocent Venus impresses with its animation. The art itself looks great, and is very expressive. The character designs are interesting without being absurd, and everything moves about smoothly and naturally. Though it begins on a very high note, it begins to taper off noticeably rather quickly, and only rises to its former greatness in short spikes until the very end. Early on the action sequences will take you by storm, but in the middle of the series they serve merely as vehicles from one weak plot point to another, and all sense of drama and impact are lost to extensive use of shortcuts and a great deal of action taking place off screen. The 3d models used for the mechs look simple and out of place amidst the sharp characters and the deep landscapes, looking more like plastic models than dangerous weapons. In short, when the series shines, it's an intense, piercing experience, but more often than not it loses that and comes off weakly. During the majority of the middle portion of the series, in particular, production values fall to great depths, and at times it seems as if there is no salvaging it--and, indeed, this section does drag the entire series down a great deal, making what could have been a very good series into one that is merely okay. Especially bad are the naval battles, which run the gamut from unwatchable to simply bad, and are full of the sort of pseudo-military jargon I think everyone has come to expect from action series. Unfortunately, these battles have none of the other battles' flair or style, and are stale even compared the most perfunctory ground battle. 
 
 
Sound: 6 
 
Now, I will be the first to admit that soundtracks can be too overbearing, and dominate a scene to the extent that you sometimes wonder why they bothered with the animation. Innocent Venus generally takes it to the other extreme. Most of the music in this series is so subdued as to be completely unnoticeable, occasionally flaring up into existence to nudge a scene in the right direction. Thus, the soundtrack is not bad, per se, and certainly has its place in the series, but a little more weight would have been a good thing. At times this is not the case, primarily in one of two instances: piano pieces, which hold a fairly important place in the story, and during action sequences, during both of which the soundtrack really shines. One thing that can be said for the soundtrack throughout most of the series--certain sections in the middle the most notable exception--is that it is timed very well to what is happening on screen, and never leaves a sour taste in your mouth. However, even this trait suffers in the middle portion, unfortunately, the only thing not noticeably taking a hit being the voice-acting. On that note, the voice-acting is almost universally decent, but--aside from a few instances and Sana's seiyuu Nazuka Kaori--never impressive in any sense. However, because the seiyuu for Sana does such a good job in expressing her character and providing most of the fun in the series, and because she is present throughout much of the show, the voice-acting as a whole remains a modest strong point of the show. 
 
-- 
 
Overall, Innocent Venus was an enjoyable ride, but it drags so much in the middle portion, and loses everything that made it exciting in the beginning. Though efforts are made to pick up the pieces in the ending stretch, ultimately they fail to make up for the miserable pacing and drop in production values that haunt the majority of the central third of the show. With a supremely forgettable soundtrack and uninspired voice-acting from all but one of the cast, nothing in Innocent Venus manages to stand strong throughout the series. The series loses it focus a great deal, and cannot manage to regain its lost concentration until it is too late. When events are focused around Sana, Jin, and Jo, and the relationship among them which is quite well developed, the series thrives, and is a genuine pleasure to watch. However, take this away and a cold, unpleasant taste is left in the audience's mouths. 
 
 
The Ten Second Version 
 
Story: 3 - Full of cliches expressed through lackluster writing, the story is propelled forcefully by the series' stronger traits. 
 
Character: 6 - The relationship between Sana, Jin, and Jo is a remarkably strong point in the show, but the majority of the other characters are flat and dull 
 
Animation: 6 - Early on and later on the animation is extremely well-handled, but during the middle portions it all suffers greatly. Static art is attractive, although many of the designs, both for characters and machines, could have used a lot more work. The 3d animation in the series is also poorly integrated. 
 
Sound: 6 - The music is mostly subdued, barely managing to push scenes in the right direction, although the piano pieces are very good. Some of the tracks are put to good use, however, and the dramatic timing is often quite good. As for voice actors, Nazuka Kaori shines as young Shana, and there are no glaringly bad ones, but overall the performances are lackluster. 
 
Overall: 5.5 
 
Seems a little out of tune...

But why would I give it a 7 because most of the time the anime have this dead airs, that makes me bored.

Although some may enjoy this anime I personally found it to be the most boring anime I've ever seen. I guess it's a little too dark for me.

There's very little real action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. 

          
 
       Helpful Noir is another girls-with-guns anime with somewhat of an interesting plot about an ancient fate, however this is overshadowed by the slow development of the show and also the dull and lifeless action sequences. 
  
Mireille Bouquet is a top class assassin and Kirika Yumura is a mysterious Japanese schoolgirl who woke up with no memory at all. This is an action anime about two female assassins, who happened to encounter each other by fate.  
 
After the exciting action packed first episode, not much is explained about this show. Throughout the first half, all there is to go by are the subtle hints and surreal intro however there&rsquo;s only one word that can describe this show as it begins, &ldquo;boring&rdquo;. It was so boring that people hoping for some form of development, may not be able to continue watching this anime however for those who are patient can enjoy the better half of the show. It is the second half that is somewhat interesting, with a lot of things finally being revealed, like the secret organization behind everything. Though it is interesting it never becomes truly captivating. 
   
The animation style resembles that of &ldquo;Cowboy Bebop&rdquo; with the same artistry and fluid animation. This tries to give a little extra by being widescreen format and beautifully drawn characters, nonetheless it losses its greatness once the action kicks in. It isn&rsquo;t long before you&rsquo;ll quickly notice the incredibly useless enemies they are up against and the lack of blood. This isn&rsquo;t an important thing for anime, when it comes to a &ldquo;Bang! Bang! Shoot-em-up&rdquo; gunshot wounds are essential and that isn&rsquo;t found here.  
 
The music is exceptionally great especially when it gets to the action or when it&rsquo;s building up to it. On the other hand the music lacks variety so it gets tiring to hear the same tunes other and other but what really is annoying is the high pitch watch melody that will pierce through your ear drums whenever you listen to it. 
 
This had the potential of being a great anime, but it took so long for anything about the plot to be revealed that only the second half of the show was enjoyable to watch. This is the major downfall of this, plus other little annoyances like time wasting techniques and the constant, pointless flashbacks. This anime was predominantly filled with gun-battles which were usually great but it didn&rsquo;t change the fact that the enemies they faced were so rubbish, with a gun, that they couldn&rsquo;t even hit a parked car. It&rsquo;s only till the finally 2 episodes when something spectacular happens, but by then this decent show is over, with a BANG! 
 
If you enjoy the odd action packed anime and don&rsquo;t mind censorship, then by all means check this out.

Character, 3/10 : The main character is very annoying, I'm just happy to find old character of the first anim, but new character are really straightforward 
 
Enjoyment 3/10 : The design of the serie is to simple, so I can't appreciate corectly the season.. +1 point for old characters 
 
Overall 3/10 : I'm really disappointed

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review, so I hope it's good enough. 
 
Before you watch this series, I suggest to watch Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded, the remake of the original series' 27th episode. You can also watch Inazuma Eleven: Outer Code before or along with this series to learn the perspective of other teams in the series. With that said, I'll start my review. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The plot is set on a parallel timeline one year after the altered 27th episode. The story is somewhat boring, as there is basically no emphasis on the actual title, ""Ares no Tenbin"". 
Simply put, this series just introduced a set of new characters and remake of some the original characters, to play in Football Frontier. This could be good but the execution is quite bland. 
However, the series tried to make three perspectives along the Football Frontier, through the main characters Asuto, Haizaki, and Nosaka. I believe Haizaki and Nosaka were developed nicely, but Asuto was very underdeveloped. Unlike the original series' core main Endou Mamoru, this series' core main Inamori Asuto is not attachable. I decide to give the story 7/10. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art of the series is different from the original series and the GO series, but still quite nice. I enjoyed the original art the best. I decide to give the art 8/10. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The sound effects were nice and the both opening and the ending songs wasn't bad. The animation of the songs follow the usual stream of openings and endings of Inazuma Eleven series. I decide to give the sound 8/10. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The characters... is what I want to discuss most. The Inakuni Raimon team character development is horrible. You don't feel attached like the original series to just Asuto, but the entire team. Everyone in the main team was underdeveloped until later episodes. The captain never stood out until later in the series, ironically being the captain. Very few characters has slight development and the rest have almost none. The only character in Inakuni Raimon that was good was their coach, that isn't even in the team. 
However, most of teams outside Inakuni Raimon were wonderfully developed despite their brief appearances. I decide to give the character 7/10. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
With all the above said, I enjoyed the matches almost as much as the original series. Even though this series involved quite a lot of normal shots which is a new thing in the line of the entire series, it is very enjoyable. I decide to give the enjoyment 9/10. 
 
Overall: 8/10

On to the review: 
 
It's just a bunch of schoolgirls fighting off an alien invasion composed of loli girls. If the premise isn't childish then I don't know what is. With this you can expect the monster of the week and all those things above. I can't really expound anymore since there's nothing to expound about. 
 
The art, sound, and character designs are the same as Hand Maid May so I think you know what to expect. Poorly designed male cast with cute girls. There is the constant proportion problem that will made me wonder whether the animators were stoned during the conception of this anime. 
 
Amidst my poor rating of this title, it was enjoyable in a guilty pleasure sort of way. It's not something I can recommend but if you want to experience what it's like to have all the otaku fetishes rolled into one anime then you might just enjoy G-On Riders. Then again maybe not. 
 
 
 
Enjoy the anime but make sure that the ""ordinary civilians"" aren't around when you watch this not so secret shame of anime.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Magic', 'Sci-Fi']","
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS. The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","Once again, be aware that just like my .hack//Intermezzo review, I cannot talk much about this anime because it's so short. I may have written more info that can be shared between Intermezzo and Unison, so please refer to the Intermezzo review if you wish - http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=26094 
 
Pretty sure I've actually already seen this, but I re-watched it again because I wasn't sure. 
 
STORY: This special is basically a feel-good episode for the main SIGN series, and really only shows the anime in a light-hearted manner, compared to SIGN's typical dark themes. This was definitely a nice, enlightening way to end the series, (even if I had watched SIGN in 2007.) and has a mixture of SIGN and Legend Of The Twilight characters meeting up for a celebration, and interacting with each other. Even Sora who is portrayed as a devious character, took part in the celebrations and enjoyed himself. 
 
ART: Simply bold and smooth, and the animation is fairly well done in this, like the rest if the SIGN series. (Best if you referred to the Intermezzo review of mine, since I'm being lazy here.) 
 
SOUND: The .hack series sound has always been good, whether it's background music/insert music or opening and ending theme songs. 
 
Characters: Rather than the ridiculousness of the players taking The World so seriously and deeply, we don't actually see this in this special. As a personal opinion, because the actual players and their seriousness isn't shown, I actually enjoyed this a bit more than the main series and Intermezzo. 
 
Best suggested for .hack fans, and I know that they will enjoy this special either way, if they just want something easy and relaxing.

          
 
       Helpful I had seen this when I was around age 14, and now I'm 28 as I review this with a different perspective. At 14 (I never played the games) I really didn't understand what was going on at all in this. I just thought it was another episode to knock off my list of anime to watch. But now I'm back after playing the 4 games and refreshing my memory of SIGN. 
 
You can't truly appreciate this without having played the 4 PS2 games games from Infection to Quarantine. Otherwise, the episode seems pretty pointless, and you wouldn't understand why for example Sora is walking around, or who Macha is and why they can't remember anything. 
 
The purpose of this episode was to tie up the past-history of SIGN that was teased throughout the 4 games together with the characters from the PS2 games, while beautifully giving us closure on Macha's backstory.  
 
So my positive bias comes from the fact I played all 4 games and Macha's backstory (from .hack Quarantine's Macha epilogue) makes this episode worth your time. I wouldn't watch this if you only watched .hack//SIGN. It's meant to be watched after SIGN and the 4 games.

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed watching SIGN, and had wanted to watch this since I had first heard of it. 
 
It was great to see Kite and BlackRose from the game appear and see them mingle with the characters from the anime. 
 
It was a light-hearted OVA, because of SIGN being a rather dark series. But, because of its light-heartedness, it felt rather strange to see such humour in a setting which was always bleak during the series. 
 
Nevertheless, it was an OVA that was as good as Intermezzo and was quite enjoyable.

The group plans to use him as a bargaining chip in negotiations which ultimately failed. Now abandoned and betrayed by his former employer, Rokurou decides to join Black Lagoon. In order to survive, he must quickly adapt to his new environment and prepare himself for the bloodshed and tribulation to come. 
 
A non-stop, high-octane thriller,  Black Lagoon  delves into the depths of human morality and virtue. Witness Rokurou struggling to keep his values and philosophies intact as he slowly transforms from businessman to ruthless mercenary. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Seinen']","The story follows a team of pirate mercenaries known as the Lagoon Company, that smuggles goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia in the early to mid 1990s. The Lagoon Company consists of four members: Dutch, the leader; Revy, the main gunfighter; Benny, the mechanic, computer specialist, and researcher; and Rock, an ex-salaryman hijacked by the team and abandoned by his department chief, eventually becoming their negotiator and ""professional"" face of the group, retaining his old job skills. Their base of operations is located in the fictional harbor city of Roanapur in east Thailand near the border of Cambodia (somewhere in the Amphoe Mueang Trat district, likely on the mainland north/northeast of the Ko Chang island or on the island itself). The city is home to the Japanese yakuza, the Chinese triad, the Russian Bratva, the Colombian cartel, the Italian mafia, a wide assortment of pickpockets, thugs, mercenaries, thieves, prostitutes, assassins, and gunmen. The city also has a large Vietnamese refugee population following the Vietnamese refugees exodus after the communist takeover of Vietnam in 1975.
Lagoon Company transports goods for various clients in the American made 80-foot (24 m) Elco-type PT boat, Black Lagoon. It has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions—which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles—in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam. When they are not working, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights.
","Black Lagoon is an action series, people have guns, people use guns, people die, pretty standard sounding, but everything about it works and creates a truly brilliant experience thanks to it's memorable cast of characters. 
 
The setting focuses on Southeast Asia where the Lagoon Company who are a team of mercenaries that specialise in smuggling goods. A lot of the time is spent in a fictional town in Tailand which is very run down and gangster run, it actually give a bit of a break from the almost perfect cities a lot of series are based in. 
 
The actual story is divided into small arcs made up of two or three episodes, they start with the introduction arc where we get to find out about the characters then goes onto various others where we get to see characters from all over the world including Russia, Germany, Columbia and Japan. 
 
The art is very basic and not too much detail is drawn and some of the characters got slightly disformed in certain scenes but it never ditracts from the show, saying that the backgrounds were really nice, the animation is top notch and every scene is animated nicely, it even shows the slightest amounto of movement when a cigerette is burning and the motion of boats. 
 
The sound for this show is sensational it really fits the setting, the opening is a great techno song with rather vulgar/agressive lyrics which adds to the flavor of the Anime, the ending is a slow sad feeling song, now it may seem weird after the opoening song comments but this also gives a great meaning to the show, although the opening shows whats on the outside and in the present of the show, the ending gives a feeling of what the main characters pasts were like and maybe gives the true feel. 
Black Lagoon along with shows like Cowboy Bebop and baccano give us one of the best English dubs out there, every actor gives a great performance and we are treated to a variety of accents including those mentioned earlier we also have Chinese and Irish and they make the show even more fun to watch. 
 
The characters of the show are what drives this show, they make everything fun as there is not one bad character, Revy is a foul mouthed girl-with-guns trigger happy type with a harsh past and Rock is a white collar type and doesn't like to get mixed up with the action but has a good mind and fights with words, these two really bounce off each other and make up for what the other lacks. One thing i noticed is most of the action comes from females, it seems that if you are female you are most likely more badass than all the guys. Dutch, Benny and Balalaika are fun and each have their own style as well as all the antagonists and minor characters 
 
Black Lagoon is one of those shows that you can easily sit back and just enjoy, your not going to get any heavy drama here, your also not going to get a huge complex plot thats hard to keep up with, the cast of characters, the setting and the incredible voice acting make it one of the most enjoyable action shows. 


          
 
       Helpful Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first- some of the voice actors/actresses voices were just annoying. They just didn't do that little ""click"" for me. However, it was only some of them- most of them minor characters that only appeared in one or two episodes, never to be heard of again. I also can't stand Garcia. Are you familiar with Vampire Knight? He's kind of like Yuki, and his maid Roberta is kind of like Kaname. Roberta herself is an okay character with a little bit of developement so far, but Garcia. . . he's just the epitome of annoying, and he's so emotional for no reason as far as I can tell. It's like the creators tried to make him like Ciel Phantomhive but failed. Also, they had some good potential ideas for a cliff hanger at the end of each episode, but most of them didn't leave me feeling as hyped up as it shoud've- mostly because of how insensate it was and how the ending song turned out kind of. . . plain, to be honest. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good either. 
Black Lagoon also has lots of cursing and dirty talk, which may also be a downer for some people, but personally, when it's used right (and it is, in my opinion) it's something that that makes me enjoy the anime/manga even more. The ""inappropiate language"" really sets the mood- it can make you laugh, get riled up, or pissed off. One thing to note is that despite the jokes, there are some pretty serious badass scenes, so don't you worry- Black Lagoon isn't some kind of slice of life comedy. 
 However, that's all the bad things I have to point out- now let's get along with the good aspects of Black Lagoon. 
 
My favorite part might be the sound, despite all the things I just mentioned. While some of the characters just sounded terrible and the cliffhangers weren't really cliffhangers, Revy and Dutch sounded perfect, as well as most of the other characters. Also, the background noise is great- for instance, the fighting scenes, the driving scenes, all of it. I also loved the art- I was stuck between deciding which I liked more. The detail in the surroundings is like a work of art by itself, and as for the character designs, weapons, and etc, I'd say everything was beyond what I was expecting. To be honest, I didn't really like the art from what I saw on the cover- but then I actually saw it in action, and I fell in love. The characters themselves were also great, although some of them still lacked development. I had to make up my own stories for what caused them to do what they did, although I don't really mind doing that. However, Rock, being the main character and all, came along great, and the more I get to know Revy, the better she gets. That goes for most of the other characters as well. 
 
The story, as entertaining as it is, isn't really original- however, the way it was brought out was what made Black Lagoon shine. A guy is picked up by a group of people who occasionally brush against the wrong side of the law just to get some food on the table. Nothing special. But then you add in the multiple little arcs that lasts one or two episodes that are all mostly unique and   different and boom, we got ourselves a great plot goin' on. It's kind of like Jormungand- it takes an original plot with action and adventure. . . then twists it like pretzel dough, never forgetting to add the desired toppings.  
The only thing knocking Black Lagoon down from a ten to a nine in terms of enjoyment is the things mentioned way above, but really, Black Lagoon's still worth rewatching. . . although i'll be skipping the episodes with Garcia in it.  


          
 
       Helpful (This review covers both seasons of Black Lagoon.) 
 
For the time worth watching this, people have been describing this as the younger sister of “Cowboy Bebop”, being the anime equivalent to the big action blockbuster Hollywood movie (The Rock, Bad Boys, any 80s’ action flick you can think of) with the many details of graphic violence, excessive cursing and language, sexuality thrown in there and a bit of inspiration some such filmmakers as Quentin Tarantino & John Woo, although the former did a bit of anime in his venture (yes, you should know what I’m talking about). 
  
The story follows a team of pirates/mercenaries known as Lagoon Company, which smuggles goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia in the early to mid-1990s. Their base of operations is located in the fictional harbor city of Roanapur in southeast Thailand (somewhere in the Amphoe Mueang Trat district, likely on the mainland north/northeast of the Ko Chang island or on the island itself). They transport goods in the 80-foot (24 m) Elco-type PT boat Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions—which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles—in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights. 
  
 
 
Now for the characters of the show, it does have a very vast range of characters but sometimes that showcase as little as they can. Rokuro Okajima, or Rock, is the main protagonist of the show as the Japanese salary man who is so bored and displeased with his daily life and no one exactly gave a shit about him. Actually, when the company he worked for send him out to deliver a package and he gotten captured, they just abandoned him as he was expendable to them. Aside from being captured, Rock manages to keep his mild-mannered and humble attitude throughout the whole show, which is in contrast to our next character, Revy, also known as “Two Hands” (at least she didn’t swing chains). She is one of the most foul-mouthed, merciless, sadistic and fatal characters of the show and that really got the show in drive. Hell, most of the opening sequence is practically her being showcased in action and while she often gets irritated by Rock in the first season but she is protective of him as the series goes along. 
  
The other members of the Lagoon Company include Dutch, the black leader of the company, who is more of the easygoing and relaxed members and last, there’s Benny, the tech specialist member who in his past gotten into the mafia and would’ve ended up dead if Revy didn’t saved him. Now, I would like these characters to have backstory in the show but unfortunately, it’s being taken up by the former two characters of the series, which really disappointed me considering they seemed like interesting characters to know…maybe they might be in the manga, though. 
  
 
 
Like I said, there was a wide variety of characters in the show that will probably be too many to mention and name drop like Balalaika, the boss of Hotel Moscow, one of the many gangs that are mentioned in the show and not only she is very skilled at what she does but practically a character that makes her presence to be feared. There is also the Hong Kong Triads lead by Mr. Chang and his top assassin Shenhua; The Colombian Cartel, The Church of Violence, The Aryan Socialist Union (Neo Nazis.) and The Washimine Group (Japanese Yakuza), who are more heavily-involved towards the end of the show. 
  
The show is total 24 episodes, with the first and the second season called “The Second Barrage”, and I will say that the second season has more of a storyline while the first is just random missions with little storyline aside from the main one and yet for some characters like Roberta and her arc makes me crave for more of her (luckily, there is an option for that) but the vampire incestuous twins Hansel and Gretel didn’t feel organic to the series or even to most of the plot. They could’ve been thrown out of the show entirely and not much of a difference would have been made. 
  
 
 
As for the animation, the credit all goes to Madhouse for the many use of blood, detailed fight scenes and gun battles, chase scenes, beautiful scenery, and for the opening and ending sequences, which the music for both worked well. The OP theme, “Red Faction” by MELL will get your blood pumping as the show begins, although singing it….I would not suggest if you get the lyrics and the ending music….yeah, music, it’s not much of a theme but many people complained about it being slow, depressing, and drags down the tone of the series…..maybe it does but most of the time when the show have its serious moments, it’s appropriate to rather end on that note rather than just generic hard-driving rock music. The ending music for episode 15 was actually one of my favorites but the last ending theme music was more of a “meh” to me. 
  
 
 
Now, as for the dub from Geneon/Ocean, it is a bit 50/50, on the one hand, the dub fits more naturally than the sub, considering its flair is more international and some characters speak English naturally, performances from Brad Swaile, Maryke Hendrikse, Brian Drummond & Dean Redman, which from him I will say this: “Finally, a black character in an anime is voiced by an actual black guy.” This is a good thing, people. But, unfortunately, some of the voices either irritated or creeped me out like the voice of Hansel and Gretel really had me freaking out a bit, considering I heard them before on a show that in a conscience that I’m not telling you….well, one of the actresses was the voice of Nurse Witch Komugi. Garcia just seems annoying and grating whenever he speaks and whoever voiced Shenhua has the worst and slightly offensive Chinese voice I have ever heard. It sounds like that fake accent most people would put in a black-owned hair salon and that’s about as Chinese as the Panda Express. 
  
 
FINAL VERDICT: By all means, Black Lagoon is worth seeing and definitely worth buying. This could be one of the few anime that I see Western culture getting into, maybe not as much or iconic as Bebop but still. It has a very in-your-face tone mixed with dark comedy and sometimes even darker drama once it gets more storyline driven. Your friends will love this but I wouldn’t recommended seeing this with family or kids…..unless they into that, too.

Still, since he lives alone, he must carry on to sustain himself. Little do humans like Kuroto know, this stress takes the form of darkness residing within a person's body and will bring one's life to ruin.  
 
Fox deities can see this darkness and have the duty to save people before it is too late. To help rid Kuroto of his stress,  Senko-san, an eight hundred-year-old foxgirl, volunteers to take care of him, and will do everything she can to ease the tension in his weary soul.

","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Kuroto Nakano is a young salaryman with a very unhappy and stressful life, almost entirely occupied by his job at the company for which he works. One night, after yet another day spent overworking, the moment he opens the door of his home he finds a seemingly young girl with fox ears and a tail cooking dinner for him – her name is Senko, an 800-year-old fox demigod. Senko has been sent to Earth from the spirit world to relieve Kuroto from his unhappy life and help him find happiness again.
","Furries, where you at? OwO 
(Spoiler-free review) 
 
Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is probably the most wholesome anime I have ever watched in my entire existence, inferior to that of our Senko's 800 years of age. It is quite amusing how this show does not only help Nakano’s exhausted and pressured life with his job by Senko’s meddling towards him, but as well affects the viewers’ mood and problems that they may experience and encounter, and that includes me. It is my basically stress reliever every Wednesday in this season. 
 
What makes this anime enjoyable to watch is its straightforwardness—it does not require any mental effort when watching this show. It is a no-brainer show that is literally trying to tell us that we should just shut our brain off and feel the ease within our minds by Senko’s wholesomeness. Other than her caressed meddling, who could even resist her fluffy tail and ears? owo 
 
Doga Kobo has really done a great job in adapting the manga, as they were able to retain its wholesomeness throughout the first four episodes. The opening and ending theme are so adorable that you cannot even skip it for that exact reason. This anime does not really waste a single moment of making you fall in love with the show itself. 
 
The characters are also relatable—Nakano’s daily life can be easily resembled to every audience who experience hardship and anxiety in their lives. Senko, being your loved ones that welcome you every time after coming home from an overtiring work. Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san exemplifies how showing affection towards someone can be a remedy for all the adversities that they may encounter. 
 
Do not get me wrong, I am indeed enjoying Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san despite with my overall rating. It is already a good show and it really deserves its current users' rating. It is not the greatest of the animes out there, but I know certainly that it is the best when it comes to wholesomeness. 
 
Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is an anime for all ages and does not limit only to furry lovers. It is a show where everyone can be loved by a non-existent, two-dimensional wholesome character that is there to pamper our worries away—only within our imaginative dreams, that is.

          
 
       Helpful Anime is often used as a form of escapism from the daily lives of those viewing it, lately I have found myself using it to unwind after a long day of work. A treat for myself for the hard work that I've been putting in working 50-64 hour work weeks, at work 6 out of 7 days of the week. 
 
In short, I needed this. 
 
Sewyaki Kitsune no Senko-san is an iyashikei style slice of life anime that follows the non-adventures of worn down (same), overworked (same), and consistently stressed out (same) salaryman Nakano after an 800 year old loli fox girl demigod named Senko enters his life and starts pampering him to his heart's content. The story is loosely connected throughout the series as you learn more about the characters and their connection. 
 
Doga Kobo has been consistently delivering moe art for a while now, and while the character designs, Doga Kobo's typical light color palette, and neatly drawn backgrounds and environments all lend themselves very well to the iyashikei style, I found the animation to be fairly weak when compared to some of their other works. 
 
The sound design is just fine for the series, playful cheery music when needed, VAs performing well, and audio cues for the subtle tone shifts are all fairly well done. 
 
The characters are pretty one dimensional, and the attempts at giving them depth are hit or miss. You can pretty much figure out how everything will play out by the end of the first or second episode. Nakano is extremely relatable from the perspective of a worn out employee. Senko is endearing and almost seems to be written as waifu bait. I thought the additions of Shiro and the neighbor Jouska were interesting although their interactions with the main characters could have been explored far more. 
 
Overall, I really enjoyed watching this series. It took my mind off the fact that I would be waking up early, riding my bike which had it's brakepads stolen an hour to work on suburban roads, only to work a 10 hour day and take that hour ride in the opposite direction. It's a pleasure to escape from the arduous monotony and banal aspects of daily life, and Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san does just that.

          
 
       Helpful Nakano is a salary-man working for an exploitative company. After a grueling day, he arrives home late at night to find a fox girl, Senko-san in his home. (Which the anime really wants to remind you know she is 800 years old.) She offers him her help in cooking, cleaning, and sometimes ""specialized"" care with nothing required in return. Only that he would let her pamper him. 
 
The Helpful Fox Senko-san is a ""healing"" anime, essentially through its story and entertainment it aims to comfort it's audience either through light comedy or calming scenes of pleasant wholesome pleasure. If you were to ask me, I really like healing anime. They are fantastic to watch when you wish to wind down before bed, Hakumei to Mikochi as another example and one of my personal favorites. I should let you know btw, despite the setup with a short fox woman and images you may have seen about this anime. Nothing outrageous or over the top happens in the anime from beginning to end, (Except a possible ""fluff"" fetish? Idk...) It's all just very normal if not too normal slice of life scenes you'd expect from any other slice of life anime. With a large focus on taking care of Nakano's problems and stress, giving him something to come home to. It really is too normal the more you watch it and think about it, but that's fine. Altogether the anime really just aims to be a harmless tranquil experience, presented through a fictional encounter with a supportive fox demi-god. Love it or hate it, slice of life is capable of many things for it's fans. It can make us laugh, love, cry, and in this case, encourage us that there is always something waiting for us. Ready to welcome us with a warm welcome, that, my dear friends, is The Helpful Fox Senko-san.

There is just one catch: they are anything but normal. This group of friends—the energetic werewolf Liru, the joyful witch-in-training Uma, the motherly android Aiko, and the seductive vampire Pachira—are actually princesses from the netherworld who have traveled to the human world in search of a new home. Unfortunately, their naivety and severe lack of knowledge make living peacefully among earthlings much more difficult than they imagined.  
 
As they attempt to adapt to their brand new lifestyle, they cause all sorts of trouble, and end up attracting the unwanted attention of a woman by the name of Dr. K-Ko. The scientist believes that these new residents of Earth are up to no good and attempts to capture the girls to prove the existence of the supernatural and gain credibility with the scientific community.

","it's a shame it is not as popular as it deserves to be. Through my long journey with anime and manga, I've stumbled across many so-called ""ecchi"" series, and yet all I saw was a bland fanservice only growing up kid would laugh at. My disappointment was broken though when I decided to watch this. It was probably one of very few series that I laughed out loud thanks to. I finally felt like I was watching an ecchi that has actual jokes in them. Combined with a simplicity of the plot and more moe-like look of the characters (yet not looking like absolute children which would gross me out in an ecchi to no end) gives its viewers something so light-hearted that is enough to light up your day and restore some energy when you really need it. It's not the peak of art and form, but I think it's still worth watching considering how little it takes for it to make someone smile with its own nonsense.

          
 
       Helpful Imagine a flat share with a female vampire, a female werewolf, a loli witch, a  female cyborg and an invisible girl who all long for good looking boys and you have Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan (I'll use ""Magical Pokaan"" for the rest of the review). 
 
Story: As usual for slice-of-life comedy series there isn't that much of a continuing story. To be precise every episode consists of two short completed stories which have nothing to do with the other episodes, which makes this series good for non-continuing watching. Magical Pokaan is good for inserting a random episode in your anime watching just when you need a break of the anime you are currently watching. 
 
Art: The character designs are good and the animation itself is nice and clearly. there is nothing to complain about it. 
 
Sound: The opening song Senketsu no Chikai by Yousei Teikoku is quite catchy even though it is somehow misleading to what Magical Pokaan actually is (as well as the opening video itself is misleading). The ending songs are variations of the same song fitting the individual characters. These ending songs are much more fitting the style of the story since they are your usual standard jpop anime song. 
The seiyuu cast is good including Hirano Aya as the vampire Pachira, they did a good job at voicing the characters. 
 
Character: As mentioned earlier the characters are all kind of supernatural girls living together in a flat share. The characters of this series are making it as enjoyable as it is since they are all very likable and funny in their unique ways. 
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed watching this show. Magical Pokaan is a good anime to watch when you just want something entertaining where you don't have to think that much about it. It's good for an anime evening with friends or just for randomly watching an episode. You don't miss anything when you let Magical Pokaan rest for some weeks and continue watching it afterwards. 
 
Overall: Magical Pokaan is fun to watch. As allready mentioned in the enjoyment part it is nice for randomly watching it. If you want to watch a comedy series which is very easy to watch and has no deep plot, Magical Pokaan is the right anime for you.

          
 
       Helpful Supernaturally funny! What a surprise with this anime!!! 
 
When I saw pictures from this anime, I thought nothing much about it, it was just another anime to check out, but from the start it became a memorable one. It 's just one story about the life of four stereotype characters from tales: vampire, werewolf, android and witch, all of them innocent girls but with a ecchi touch, just a little, making things incredibly funny and unusual, trying to living in peace with humans in our mortal world; isn't the biggest plot ever but is so easy to love very quickly these girls from the bottom of your heart as every episode pass by. If you're searching some anime to laugh a lot and not be picky about the style of drawing, give it a shot, you'll not regret it, is a simply anime but at the same time original, good luck!!!

However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her ""would-be"" self, and the next morning, she finds three brightly colored eggs—pink, blue, and green—in her bed.

Amu's life becomes much more complex, as she struggles to deal with her ""would-be"" selves and Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who each have a Guardian Character of their own. People with Guardian Characters can ""chara-nari"" (character transform) or ""character change"". Each transformation has special powers, mainly for attacking or defending. Character changes have special powers too, but have more practical uses. Later on, they recruit Amu as the ""Joker"" to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of people's dreams, so the Guardians can purify their dreams. In Japanese, the egg is shortened.
Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs, in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.
Later on in the series, a fourth (yellow) egg named Diamond is born. Unlike Amu's other Guardian Characters, she is only seen a few times in the series. Due to Amu's mixed feelings before Diamond was born, she becomes an X character and is ""stolen"" by idol singer Hoshina Utau, who uses Diamond to character change for her concerts, planned by Easter as part of their plan to get the Embryo. Later on, Diamond is purified and becomes a regular Guardian Character. She would then appear in times of heavy crisis.
","The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever. 
 
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo. 
 
The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season. 
 
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline. 
 
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen. 
 
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu. 
 
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show. 
 
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!  
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in her bed. 
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!  
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).  
 
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time! 
 
Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to! 
 
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p 
 
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice. 
 
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself. 
 
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime. 
 
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

          
 
       Helpful (My First Review) 
 
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”. 
 
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character. 
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian. 
 
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her fa?ade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream. 
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.  
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time. 
 
Art: 7.5/10 
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good. 
 
Sound: 7.5/10 
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.

Story 
We all have our hurdles in our life. From a job to a relationship. With a relationship at least from a woman's perspective one feels emotional no matter how it goes. Sadly, life can be exactly how you see on television. Where one finds the origin for those almost glued attributes to categories. From As____ being bad drivers to men being lying scum. Here one gets the idea the singers suffered some heartbreak and find self courage. A really kind hearted message to a troubling time. 
 
Art 
I have stated the message being from negative to positive on relations the art isn't that different. The art rather than being couple (2 players) as one might think is portrayed in a group form. The director here was clever. We already can see from the art or at least tell from the voices the gender standout is female. Safe to say that is the point of view. With the female gender despite what one would think finds strong comfort in females. Even if they are total strangers. The only problem which the director solved with the concept of bounty was what to do as a group since a bar scene was out for it was more two player based. Not only that but to played out. 
 
Sound 
At first i was okay with the tempo as i struggled to get used to the swap from English speaking to back to the negative tongue. Having listened to it multiple times even more so as i write this review i find the idea of swapping a clever concept. For me it demonstrates the start to a breakthrough. Going with idea of straying from the set path. Very clever.

(Source: Official website)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","The film series is set six years after Digimon Adventure 02 and takes place in 2005. A mysterious anomaly is causing distortions in the Real World and Digimon are being plagued by a virus that turns them hostile. These circumstances lead to the eight original DigiDestined being reunited with their partner Digimon. Joined by a mysterious DigiDestined named Meiko Mochizuki and her partner Meicoomon, they are set to solve the mystery of the infected Digimon and deal with the responsibility of growing up.
","Ugh, this was so disappointing. First of all, with eight characters and only seventeen episodes I really hated and resented introducing Mei. She's boring, pointless, and only takes away from the people I actually care about. Same for the secret agent people, they just convoluted the plot and kept important information secret for the stupidest reasons possible.  
 
I'm also fine with a slower, more thoughtful pace. But it felt like there was so much filler nonsense that I should have skipped a few episodes. A lot of plot hangups and character development also depends on the cliche of people being to stupid to talk to each other for five seconds. Finishing this felt like a chore and punishment for having fond childhood memories. 
 
There was some good however, except it's hard to describe because it was spread so thinly and intermittently. Overall I regret watching and should have just found some good fanfiction.

Digimon was one of my favorite TV shows when I was younger, and as huge fan of the series I was in the opposite side from my collegues, Pokemon and Dragon Ball fans. Adventure is an amazing show, with very mature themes in the plot and great characters. The sequel, Adventure 02 was not so good, with lame new characters and an awful ending. Tamers was so called Digimon 3 by TV marketing, but is a spin--off (a great one to be fair), so Digimon Adventure has ended with a bitter taste in the fans mouth.  
 
So I received the news of a new Digimon Adventure with great expectation. Despite the awful ending, was a serie that I cared so much when child. And also, I was sick for a better ending as well.  
 
This first movie/OVA was a great surprise, and made me fell in love again with these beloved characters. But wait... again or for the first time? Yes, for shure, they are no kids anymore, they are teenagers now, with brand new personalities, dreams and dilemmas. Taichi (or Tai) is no more the lighthearted and flustered leader, he's more responsable  and rational now, and is terrified with the destruction that giant monsters can bring. Yes, bein heroic and fight the evil is not so easy when you are grown up, and I liked very much this new Tai. Yamato (or Matt) continue to be the heart of the group, always thinking in do good to others, a great exponent to the crest of friendship he carries. And is still the bad ass. Sora is no longer a tomboyish ""need pretend to be strong"" character, is more like  a cartaker and it seems to be the glue that will keep the group together. Also, the movie draws a possible romantic triangle between her, Tai and Matt. Takeru (or TK) is no longer the whining brat and awful character, is more joyfull and a womanizer project. Mimi is back from a long stay in america, is not more the childish one of the group, is the extroverted happy-go-lucky that stole the spotlight. Izumi (Izzy) continues to be the great computer geek and genie of the group, but have showed a new facet when confronted with the brand new Mimi that activates his libido. Joe and Kari are overshadowed by the others, but are still great indeed. The first have a new dillema in his college aplication marathon and is seen more studiyind than doing other stuff, and the second one, well... continues to be Tai's atractive little sister. I hope she gets more screentime in the next movies, she was extremely important in the old shows .  
 
As you can see, the story is more chacter driven and this is the great merit from this first installement, is presenting a nouveau regard over our old friends. As their bonds intesifies, their challenges seems to be greater then fight giant monsters. Speaking on that, yeah, they are back. And yes, we have also great action scenes and new misteries surrounding the Digiworld. The villaneous Digimon are stronger, and the old pet monster have a lot of work to do in the next chapters. Also,  a new Digidestined is the house. What she will bring? 
 
The animation is simply gorgeous. Toei is a studio that lost the good animation tram and keep the oldfashioned style managed to make a great job here. Also, the OST is back with the great old themes renewed and is simply outstanding.  
 
So, Digimon Adventure Tri is a great work that is trully shot through the heart of the nostalgic fans. Presenting old friends in a new path, and putting them in a comming of age plot is an excellent ideia. The characters are the soul of a good story  and Toei knows that. It's a love letter to the old fans and a great invitation to new ones. Digimon is more mature, more realistic, and a 100% awesome. Now that the  adventure had evolved, I can't wait for more!

          
 
       Helpful The original Digimon Adventures series is known and loved by all of us, so my expectations were high. Did the first movie meet my expectations?  
 
Pretty much. 
 
Story 6/10 
So I will have to say this is the weakest point of the 80 minutes I watched. Yes there are a lot of unsolved mysteries which I find highly interesting. However, the pace of the whole story was very very slow and some parts could have been made more epic like the most important reunion of the group. 
It was beautiful for a die-hard fan to watch the groups high school life, but as soon as we got to see fighting scenes I felt that something was lacking. Regarding this especially the last few minutes felt rushed making the end of the first movie really awkward. 
On top of that I dislike the way the movie was split into four episodes for streaming. Not only was it confusing at first, but the cuts felt really weird at points. I highly recommend watching the movies as a whole if you can! 
 
Animation 9/10 
I simply love the art. It's nothing special in style but I feel like it fits the concept of a series that grew with its audience. I honestly love to see the new definition of the characters while remembering how the drawing style was 10 years ago. Although it's also making it weird to see the characters so different sometimes. I guess this is pretty much what it must feel like to see your own children grow up. But it's good and makes the story a tad more serious. This also blends in well with the Characters. 
 
Characters 9/10 
Everything about this series grew up. It's really hard to write about this section without spoiling, but if you were in love with the characters when you saw the original series, you will also love them after this time jump. The character development on it's own is very reasonable. 
 
Sound 10/10 
YES! MY FEELINGS! It's absolutely the right thing to do: to take the old sound and enhance it. I nearly cried when I first heard the new ""Butterfly"" opening. And listening enhanced versions of the tracks within the anime was also a blessing. Even the ending would have been notable if I had watched the original series in Japanese. They knew how they could catch the old fans by using that music and I would say the sound was the main source for making fans remember the beauty of watching the original series back then. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
I think that you can truly enjoy this show if you loved the original anime especially if you watched it as a 10 year old child like me. There's just so many things that I love about the older characters, the new animation and sound. However, for someone totally uninvolved I think that their focus would lie too much on the story which is anything but outstanding.   
However, this is only what we know about 1 of 6 movies! A lot can happen here. After those 6 movies I would decide whether this series is worth a re-watch. Right now I feel more like watching the original series all over again. 
However, I don't feel like Digimon Tri. gave us a lot more until now. It's really just an addition to Digimon Adventure 1 and 2. 
 
 
Overall 9/10 
I'm waiting for more in march.

One of these small battles breaks in the hometown of young Seabook Arno, forcing him and his friends to flee and ensnaring them in the political turmoil that is quickly evolving into an all-out war. 
 
Seabook meets Cecily Fairchild, granddaughter of the aristocrat Meitzer Ronah, who seeks to create a new political power called ""Cosmo Babylonia."" Using the Crossbone Vanguard as its muscle, the Ronah family schemes to restore aristocratic rule and establish an economic system that will benefit the nobility, thus devastating the quality of life for the common people of the Earth Sphere. 
 
Seabook is tasked with piloting the Gundam F91, a mobile suit created by his mother, and must choose between protecting the status Federation's status quo or cooperating with Cecily to find a better way of life for all. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","The film is set 30 years after the events of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack and none of the characters that had previously appeared in the series were present in the film.
In the year U.C. 0123, the military arm of Cosmo Babylonia, the Crossbone Vanguard, attacks the Earth Federation colony Frontier IV. Student mechanic Seabook Arno and his friend Cecily Fairchild are caught in the middle of the fighting as the Federation garrison is quickly overwhelmed. Seabook and Cecily lead a group of refugees into the lower levels of the colony, where they meet up with Seabook's father, Leslie. As the group boards a lifeboat, Seabook catches sight of Cecily's father, Theo, attempting to abduct her and tries to intervene. However, the Crossbone Vanguard arrives and takes Cecily, who is actually Berah Ronah, part of the Ronah family who are the leaders behind Cosmo Babylonia. Seabook is forced to retreat to the lifeboat while Leslie stays behind to help a lost child.
Cecily is taken to meet her real father Carozzo and grandfather Meitzer, who both dream of overthrowing the corrupt Earth Federation and replacing it with a more just aristocracy. Cecily is reluctant to join them, but feels she has no choice. Meanwhile, the lifeboat manages to reach the neighboring colony Frontier I, but it is also under attack by the Crossbone Vanguard. Seabook's group then comes across the Space Ark, a Federation training ship carrying the inoperative Gundam F91. Due to the confusion caused by the Crossbone Vanguard's surprise attack, the Space Ark is run by a barely experienced skeleton crew with no available pilots. Pressed into Federation service, Seabook works on repairing the F91 and discovers it was developed by his mother, Monica. The crew is able to repair the F91 just in time to repel an assault by the Crossbone Vanguard, forcing them to retreat.
Seabook then uses the F91 to return to Frontier IV, where Cosmo Babylonia has already repaired most of the damage to the colony and has fully occupied it. He infiltrates the Ronah estate and makes contact with Cecily. However, he is forced to flee without her when the guards pursue him. Leslie helps Seabook escape Frontier IV, but he suffers a mortal head injury in the process and dies on the return trip to Frontier I. Cecily joins the Crossbone Vanguard under Zabine Chareux's command. He helps train Cecily to be a mobile suit pilot and warns her that there are several factions within Cosmo Babylonia working against each others' interests, with one faction working on a secret superweapon codenamed ""Bug"". Seabook returns to Frontier I, where he is again forced by the Federation to help defend the colony against an impending attack by the Crossbone Vanguard. Instead, Seabook and the crew of the Space Ark secretly decide to desert and flee to the Moon.
Cecily is assigned the advanced Vigna Ghina mobile suit and accompanies the Crossbone Vanguard as they break into Frontier I. After a brief but intense skirmish, the Crossbone Vanguard are once again forced to withdraw. Seabook encounters Cecily in battle and she decides to defect upon discovering her friends are still alive. Carozzo then arrives at Frontier I and deploys the Bugs, automated war machines designed to specifically hunt down humans. He believes that Earth's population must be purged to preserve its environment, and intends to use Frontier I as a testing ground for the Bugs. Seabook and Cecily work together to destroy the Bugs, with Cecily destroying their mothership. Angered, Carozzo deploys in his own mobile armor, the Rafflesia, and battles Seabook and Cecily. The Vigna Ghina is destroyed, ejecting Cecily into space and Seabook destroys the Rafflesia in response. Zabine arrives on the scene, but decides to spare Seabook and the Space Ark due to his disagreement over Carozzo's use of the Bugs and Rafflesia. After a desperate search, Seabook is able to find and rescue Cecily as the Space Ark arrives to pick them up.
","At the end of Gundam F91, it implies there will be a follow-up series. 
 
Unfortunately this never materialised. Which is a shame, because it's a good movie and would have made a good series. 
 
Because of these cuts, the movie is somewhat disjointed and incoherent, and certainly shouldn't be watched for an awesome plot. What it does do, however, is show off some nice mech designs, have a cool villain with a silly plan, and have awesome animation and art. 
 
The plot is fairly standard Gundam, with people from space, people from Earth and some other people from another patch of space fighting. Also Newtypes, who as fans of the franchise know are sort of halfway between Bene Gesserit, Jedi and idiot-savants. The main antagonist is Iron Mask, who is unsurprisingly a man in a mask and whose plan doesn't make a lot of sense. It is nice, though, to have the Char analogue actually be a threatening and powerful villain. 
 
The soundtrack is interesting, with some nice background music and an iffy ending song full of unneeded and badly pronounced English. 
 
However, it is the detail in the animation and the quality of the art which makes F91 really worth watching. The fights are excitingly choreographed, and the characters have the sort of attention to detail that reminds you of Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Macross: Do You Remember Love. 
 
To conclude, it's best to think of F91 as a ""tech demo."" It's a one-off adventure that sort of works, but is mostly appealing due to its technical aspects.

          
 
       Helpful Anyone in the Gundam fandom knows the infamous history of F91; it was a new series project by Tomino to be released in the early 90s, set a full thirty years after Char's Counterattack with a brand-new storyline and conflict, but due to production difficulties (it DID come out right after the Japanese economic crash) they had to scrap it all and put fifty episodes of content into two hours. So what did they do to turn it into a film? Cut the unimportant storylines and leave only the essentials? Reduce the character count and leave the focus on the dual protagonists Seabook and Cecily? Or (the option they chose) just compress everything into such a rapid, non-stop pace that never stops for a breather just so it can fit everything into two hours? 
 
I had my complaints with Char's Counterattack feeling too fast-paced for me to keep up, but that was also a sequel playing off of long-established characters and a plot that felt like one constant final battle. F91 works, somehow, because it introduces an entirely new cast far-removed from any previous Gundam series or movie and goes through that entire story with rapid-fire intensity. It's somewhat grounded, the entire story taking place in just a couple space colonies, though of course the main villains plan to wipe out all life on Earth and the Moon because they're Space Nazis, so the stakes are high. 
 
Gundam Universal Century is very good about not going into power fantasy mode and keeping you stuck with the grim realities of war, and F91 may be one of the most brutal entries in the saga behind Thunderbolt and War in the Pocket. The opening battle shows the deaths of civilians, including children, and the main cast's home is essentially wiped out in the conflict as they try to escape. The pace is so fast you don't keep attention on the horrors unfolding, but just get thrown into the next one. With both the Earth Federation forces and the Crossbone Vanguard pirates morally gray, it's hard to root for any side and you mostly just hope the characters come out OK. 
 
With a story this fast, the characters are obviously underwritten, which is unfortunate. But the action and animation more than make up for it; Gundam has never looked better, and may never look better again because the series isn't popular enough to justify the budget anymore. Watching Char's Counterattack and F91 back-to-back, seeing the difference in animation quality between them is astounding, especially when you consider they were released only three years apart. 
 
If you're looking for high-octane sci-fi action, F91 has you covered. As long as you've watched some of the previous UC Gundam series and are up to speed on some of its worldbuilding concepts (because this series has zero time to explain Newtypes or Minovsky particles to us), you'll probably be alright. Just make sure you're prepared for the ride. 
 
I may bump up the score for this one after a rewatch, because I feel that the letterboxed low-quality DVD I watched this on probably was not the optimal format to see it in; I'll try and scrounge for a blu-ray copy when I can.

          
 
       Helpful This is a weird movie - because it was originally designed and partially produced as a 50 episode series. For what it is, I do think the movie stands fine, because it has problems while still being exceptional about certain things. 
 
For me, an important aspect for the mecha genre are the action sequences, and F91 has gorgeous animation with very unique and interesting mech designs. The fighting is fun to watch and doesn't clash with the non-action scenes visually. There aren't many, if any, scenes I recall looking off or grotesque due to little time spent on it.  
 
It stands pretty alone in the Universal Century, the most expansive era in Gundam, so you can watch it without needing to know much of anything about the franchise. That said, it follows the most generic outline for a Gundam story it could have, but the differences are rather interesting for fans of the franchise, and knowing what follows in manga format and was meant to be fleshed out actually makes the movie more entertaining.  
 
This applies to the characters as well - they are fairly generic and knowing about them through close attention to the movie and the rest of the universe fleshes them out more than the movie will. 
 
Being a 50-episode anime turned singular movie (Gundam series tend to be condensed into 3 movies), it obviously has major pacing issues. Little is explained straightforwardly, which while not bad, is very difficult to catch onto when casually watching and is fairly critical since scenes of character development can near instantly turn to the start of action when they felt like they should have been naturally longer. I'd judge this less if it weren't a politically driven movie in-universe, and the politics of the world and reasonings of major characters are very difficult to understand. 
 
The audio effects aren't bad, but for some reason I feel like some of them aren't entirely fitting. The soundtrack, save for a few select songs, is forgettable and generic. 
 
It has some wonderful parts in the animation and a few songs, horrible pacing and development of the characters and the situation in the movie, and is decent in all other regards. It is a movie that is prettier to look at and imagine what it could've been than it is to listen to and understand fully.

Rolan ends up spending a year on the planet working for the Heim Family, aristocrats living in a Victorian-like society. This family, like others of similar wealthy status, celebrates one's coming of age with a ceremony involving a giant stone statue known as the ""White Doll."" 
 
To Rolan's surprise, the Moonrace suddenly touches down on Earth with the intent of taking it by force.

With Rolan in its cockpit, the Turn A causes a standoff between the forces of Earth and Moon. The young pilot, along with the people of both sides, must keep the peace and avoid another all-out, catastrophic war. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","Turn A Gundam follows the character Loran Cehack, a young member of the Moonrace. Selected as part of a reconnaissance mission to determine whether the Earth was fit for resettlement, Loran lands on the continent of North America, spends two years living on Earth as the chauffeur to the Heim family, and grows attached to its people. With the expectation of a peaceful resettlement operation from his people, he and a pair of his close friends sent down with him confirm that the Earth is now fit for the Moonrace to make their return. He's taken by surprise when the Moonrace intends to return to Earth via an offensive with mobile suits, and their first attack sparks a violent conflict between Earth and moon.
The night of the first attack, Loran is at the White Doll, an enormous humanoid statue, for a coming-of-age ceremony. When the Moonrace attacks and the battle in town can be seen from a distance the children panic. In the midst of this panic, the White Doll shatters, revealing a metallic figure within, and the shrine collapses around it. During the panic, Loran recognizes the White Doll as a mobile suit, and succeeds in applying his knowledge of the Moonrace's mobile suits to pilot it. The death of the Heim patriarch in the attack pulls the family and Loran into the budding war; Loran becomes the designated pilot of the White Doll, and its discovery prompts the excavation of further mobile suits in the various ""mountain cycles"" covering the Earth. As the Moonrace's invasion rapidly turns into a full-fledged war against the increasingly armed Earthrace, it becomes clear that this state of affairs is divisive among both groups; while the Moonrace's queen Dianna Soreil attempts to negotiate with the local leaders for a peaceful solution by which the Moonrace can come to reside on the Earth, the militaristic among both populations interfere with the negotiations again and again, forcing the war to continue as opposed to accepting a compromise.
","I had a few recommendations for this series, telling me this was a great Gundam Series.  Unfortunately I can't agree. 
 
The series takes place a few thousand years after previous Gundam Series.  After a great war many humans fled to the moon, the remaining humans on earth slowly struggled to survive.  Eventually the earth civilization resembles the early to mid 1900s.  Then the Moonrace comes back to the earth claiming a right to live on the planet.  War then erupts between the moonrace and earth. 
 
The overall story was the best part of the series.  I liked the new plot to the Gundam Series, though it did resemble the better series Gundam X.  The biggest problem I had with the story was the Kihel Heim/Dianna Soreil story.  It wasn't done well and very hard to keep track of. 
 
The characters were the worst part of the series.  Vertically all the characters from Loran Cehack, Guin Sard Lineford, Miashei Kune, Sochie Heim and the rest weren't intresting.  I didn't really care about any of them or what happened to them. 
 
The animation/Music was also pretty good.  The animation was pretty good, but could have been better, this isn't that old of a series.  I really enjoyed the muisc it added to the series. 
 
Overall it's just another average Gundam series, and not on the level of the original Gundam, Gundam X or 08TH MS TEAM.

          
 
       Helpful With the creator and director Tomino coming off of severe depression, the Gundam series went a different direction. The first being Victory Gundam and the second being this one in Turn A Gundam. This would be the eighth installment in the Gundam franchise and has been confirmed that Turn A takes place thousands of years after the events of Gundam in the Universal Century. 
 
Our setting is Earth in which it and humanity has finally recovered enough after the Gundam wars. More so, the people living in space want to return to Earth. The main protagonist, Loran, is one of three sent by the moon queen to scout the Earth and its’ people to see if A) the Earth is again habitable and B) even worth returning to. Loran quickly adapts to the Earth, which is at a state in technology about during the industrial revolution. Quickly, the advanced Moon Race settle on Earth, and of course, the Earthlings are less than willing to cooperate with the quick-draw militia of the spacenoids. 
 
First problem is the plot is incredibly slow. This Gundam show has been stated for pacing issues boarding that of unwatchable. Second problem are the characters. People in Turn A Gundam are generally weak minded, trope ridden, and frustratingly stupid. One pro is this anime is filled with very strong willed female characters or the main ones at least. Unfortunately, people in the anime are poorly developed and the choices they make constantly make the viewer scratch their head. One great example is how quickly characters and militia members easily switch allegiances. Sure the beginning of Turn A Gundam is intriguing and different, but much like Gundam X is far from close to reaching the initial potential. The first 15 episodes have plenty of politics and military struggles, but from basically start to finish the battles are very repetitive, and dialogue just drags to the point of boredom. 
 
Being 50 episodes, the art and animation is that of late 80’s quality than that of turning the millennium. But, can’t fault for a stretched budget. However, fault can be put on bland character designs and even less imaginative writing. At least the music and sound were superb. 
 
In short, much like Gundam X, Turn A Gundam maybe could have been much better made as a 24-ish episode anime as opposed to the long run previous series had. This Gundam series suffers greatly from terrible pacing, insufferable character writing, and battles that just are not interesting. It simply is not worth watching even as a Gundam fan.

          
 
       Helpful The Mobile Suit Gundam series has existed since 1979, so 36 years old as of the end of 2015 later this year, and in that large span of time, Sunrise and Bandai have put out a vast array of Gundam anime. And for the 20th Anniversary of Gundam in 1999 they released the first Yoshiyuki Tomino(Creator of Gundam) series since Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Turn A Gundam. And even when placed against the myriad of Gundam series, and even the black sheep Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Turn A Gundam is a bit of an oddball. 
 
It is a well known fact that Gundam often portrays large scale wars with high death tolls of both soldiers and civilians and the emotional, the psychological effect that it has on the main cast of characters. But Turn A Gundam has neither a large death toll nor any kind of psychological effect. Very few characters actually died in this series compared to any other and their deaths had very little impact on the main cast. In fact, compared to Gundams normal dark atmosphere, Turn A is actually very lighthearted, very free spirited. And this is quite the departure from just about any Gundam series in existence save Gundam Build Fighter/Build Fighters Try and Gunpla Builders Beginning G. As a fan who really likes the dark atmosphere, this was kind of a letdown. 
 
The characters themselves though weren't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The Moonrace protagonist Loran Cehack wants nothing more than for his fellow Moonrace to come and live on Earth. And this creates conflict with some kind characters who hold racial prejudice against the Moonrace who violently emigrated to Earth. And this puts him in an interesting position because the story constantly wants him to choose between the Terrans or the Moonrace and despite fighting for the Terrans, he still manages to walk a very grey line. His two main companions, Kihel and Sochie Heim also play an important role. Kihel looks identical to the Moonrace Queen Dianna Soriel which proves to be a crucial plot point as the story progresses and Sochie reflects the maturation of the cast. She goes from being the spoiled daughter of a mine who is racist against the Moonrace for killing her father, to being a mature woman who becomes the head of the Heim household despite being the younger sibling. The Royal Guard Captain, Harry Ord, is probably one of the most interesting Gundam characters I've ever seen. His unquestionable loyalty and devotion to Queen Dianna shows itself multiple times over the course of the series. The rest of his personality is unlike any other character. He wears the strangest clothing and constantly tugs on his sleeve because he thinks it ""makes him look dandy."" Harry is definitely a unique character. 
 
The theme of the show was kind of hard to nail down for the majority of its 50 episode run. At first I assumed it was all about racism or coexistance, but that wasn't it at all. It's only in the stretch of the last 10 episodes of the show that the true theme comes out: Human Nature. Despite the Terrans and Moonrace having developed separately over the course of 2,000 to 3,000 years, they are both still Human at the core, and it is often said that fighting is in Human nature. Neither race displayed this nature for those thousand or so years that they had no contact, and when the Moonrace finally began to return to the Earth, it awakened Humanity's desire to wage war, and in turn awakened it within the Moonrace. And that is the theme of the show. It wasn't trying to hide it from you so it really isn't a spoiler. It's just that it isn't as readily apparent as it would be in most other series. That confusion took some of the enjoyment out of it for me because I like to see how they tackle the theme over the course of the series. 
 
I have to give praise to both the art and the sound though. The art was really good for a 1999 series. Very detailed, very fluid, and very vibrant. They shunned the use of newly emergent computer tricks and it was all hand drawn. So props where props are due. As for the sound, the soundtrack was composed by Yoko Kanno, which is an immediate win in my book. I've had ""Moon"" and ""The Third Advent"" on repeat for days now. The sound effects are entirely new as far as I can tell, especially having watched a vast majority of the available Gundam series. Most series reuse sound effects to avoid having to create new ones, and so it gets repetitive after a while of hearing those sounds since the beginning of time. Turn A was refreshing in that respect. 
 
And so looking back at Turn A Gundam, it is by no means my favorites as it didn't quite live up to what I expect a Gundam show to be. Many of my friends had hyped it up as being the pinnacle of Gundam stories, and they would know since they grew up with the first Gundam and so on, but to me it just didn't feel like Gundam. I had Mobile Suits and Gundams, it had a very Gundam theme to it, but at the end of the day it just didn't feel like the Gundam that I fell in love with. And so it's somewhat of a love/hate relationship because I liked the story, the character, the music, the art, and I did enjoy it, but at the same time it just didn't scratch that itch. And I noticed quite a few similarities with the currently airing Gundam: Reconquest in Gravity(Yes, that is the actual English translation of the name.). Both were conceived and written by Yoshiyuki Tomino and both are more lighthearted than their predecessors. Though this is to be expected since Turn A's Correct Century timeline is the destiny of all Gundam timelines, whether the show was made before or after Turn A aired. Correct Century is, officially, an actual continuation of the original Universal Century timeline from the original Gundam series, and therefore it is also a direct continuation of Reconquest's Reguild Century which comes directly after the Universal Century. This is made even more apparent because the country or continent of Ameria exists in both Reconquest and Turn A. 
 
I digress, Turn A Gundam seems like more of an acquired taste even for Gundam fans. Fans who have been around since the beginning will be able to pick Turn A up in a heartbeat because it's a Tomino series, but people who grew up on the alternate universe series like Wing, X, G, SEED, or 00 will more than likely find it hard which is to be expected. In fact, the same is happening with Reconquest at the moment. So really, I say give the show a try, but not even I can guarantee who will like it, who will say ""Meh"", and who will not like it. I recommend it to Gundam fans, but I can't really recommend it as a starting point to anyone.

9,290,143,5.219621956,A group of people living together,Seikai no Monshou,"In the distant future, humanity is under attack by the Abh Empire, a race of advanced humanoid beings possessing vastly superior technology. As countless worlds fall to the Abh, mankind establishes the Four Nations Alliance—a resistance faction made up of the United Mankind, the Republic of Greater Alcont, the Federation of Hania, and the People's Sovereign of Union Planets. 
 
 Seikai no Monshou  tells the story of Jinto Linn. When he was young, his father—the president of Martine—sold their world in exchange for a high position in the empire. Now a young count, Jinto must learn the ways of Abh nobility and live among those who subjugated his people. Helping him is Lafiel Abriel, an austere Abh princess whom Jinto quickly befriends. While traveling to Jinto's new school in the Abh homeland, their ship is caught in a violent space battle between the fleets of the Alliance and the Abh. Jinto and Abriel are thrust into the conflict, unaware that this skirmish marks the beginning of a full-scale war between the Abh Empire and mankind. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Romance']","Crest of the Stars chronicles how Jinto met Lafiel and the events that followed before the war.
When Jinto was a young boy, his world is invaded by the Abh empire. His father who was then president of the Hyde Star System, surrendered the system and earned for himself and his family a nobility within Abh society. Young Jinto is sent off to school in planet Delktou to learn the ways of Abh nobility and the story of Crest of the Stars picks up as he meets the young Abh princess, Lafiel who as a pilot trainee has been assigned to escort him to the patrol ship Gothlauth, a.k.a. Gosroth). Soon, they find themselves unready participants in the incident that would ignite the war between the Abh Empire and the Four Nations Alliance of Humankind — an anti-Abh alliance of the democratic nations of the United Mankind, the Federation of Hania, the Republic of Greater Alcont, and the People's Sovereign Union of Planets.
","Science-fiction has got to be one of my favourite genres. Some of my most beloved books are sci-fi, and it doesn't take much sifting through them to figure out what I like. I love the meshing of human and alien cultures; seeing how they interact with one another and how they compare and contrast is one of the most fascinating parts of those sort of books, in my opinion. Spaceship battles take a back seat – while they can be interesting, I have to be invested in the characters first. That's what psychology and the glimpse of a well-written and imagined society give me: grounds to care for the characters, relate to them, and become concerned for their fates. So when I heard that Seikai no Monshou, or Crest of the Stars if you prefer the English title, combined science-fiction, politics, and romance, naturally, I was sold. Unfortunately, the end result proved to not be so captivating.  
 
The series follows the main protagonist, Jinto, and his tribulations as he deals with becoming a nobleman of the Abh empire despite being a regular human. For the sake of simplicity, the Abh are basically space elves, although it's stated that they were descended from humans many years before. The second protagonist is Lafiel, a princess of the Abh empire and a full-blooded Abh herself. Naturally, one predicts they'll get together, but this is presumably reserved for later seasons. This one mainly focuses on the pair as they find themselves in the middle of a war between the Abh empire and an anti-Abh sect of humans.  
 
Jinto is a scholarly, reserved young man looking to fit in; Lafiel is a blunt but honourable young woman who also wishes to fit in. Both feel incompetent or useless in their respective societies and circles. As such, they are similar yet dissimilar, and that ought to be more than enough grounds for their interactions to be compelling and interesting. Unfortunately, they aren't; the way Seikai no Monshou pans out, their actions and turmoils are highly insignificant in comparison to anything else. I'm left feeling dysphoric and completely uninterested in what Lafiel and Jinto are doing – even bored. I usually have no problem whatsoever with slow pacing; indeed, I hardly notice it unless it is pointed out to me. Seikai no Monshou's pacing is almost as painful as trying to swim in molasses, and left me yawning distractedly as I wondered when the episode would end.  
 
One of the main problems the series has is that we have little to no reason to empathize with the main characters, partially because we hardly know anything about them. They simply react to the situations they are put into; as viewers, we feel detached from the action. To make matters worse, the anime pushes too many ideologies and too much information on us to be realistically manageable. This is usually achieved by a narrator at the start of each episode, reciting some explanations or historically significant event that seems, at the very best, loosely connected to the episode itself. I have no problem with politics and intrigue; in fact, I think it can be fascinating if done well, but Seikai no Monshou makes no effort to connect us to the information it is spewing at us.  
 
Let's get a book as an example, shall we? C.J. Cherryh's First Contact series is, in a superficial way, similar to Seikai no Monshou (part of the reason I was so eager to start the anime in the first place). The books are centred around a human male protagonist and his experiences and trials as he learns to coexist in a completely alien culture. Politics play a large role in this series, but it is interesting, because the main character is involved and affected by the goings on around him. Not to mention, he's also a pretty capable politician. Seikai no Monshou doesn't do this. Instead of making the main characters a part of the intrigue, allowing us to learn with them and make connections with events ourselves, we are treated to a cheap form of exposition that does nothing at all to make us empathize or sympathize with, well, anyone, really. There is far too much “telling” me things, and not enough “showing”.  
 
Luckily, episodes 9 and up are far more interesting and engaging than the previous ones. The sole reason for this is that Lafiel and Jinto actually get a bit of a breather and are able to interact with one another. In addition, they commingle with other people and have to figure out how to survive on a planet occupied by an army who does not like Abhs. That isn't to say that they didn't interact with people before; it's just that the majority of them were Abhs, and most of the interactions took place in spaceships. The problem, then, is that Abhs just aren't very interesting. I considered if this was because the Abhs can be thought of as quite “alien” and thus inaccessible, since they think vastly different from us lowly humans. However, upon further examination, I realized that this was simply not true. Plenty forms of fiction can make aliens different and perfectly strange, but still interesting. Thus, one's indifference to the Abh race can only be constituted as a product of poor writing.  
 
Despite all this, when the anime skips all the dreary exposition, the battles in space that just feel like a time filler, and the dull character interactions, it can actually be pretty good. It does a decent job of building up a general idea of the atmosphere in the first two episodes, and, as stated before, the final four to five episodes are truly enjoyable and do make me more interested in the rest of the series. Overall, though, it would be best not to get your hopes up too much. It's a childish and draggy show at its core. Hopefully, the remaining seasons will redeem it. Since the anime was adapted from novels, I imagine that they handle the topic and plot far better.  
 
Seikai no Monshou's soundtrack is quite good. Composed by Katsuhisa Hattori, it is very orchestral in nature and feels very “classical”. The opening theme is especially worth mentioning; it is a purely instrumental piece that is very pleasing to the ear and gets you excited for the episode to come, at least for the first couple times you hear it. The rest of the soundtrack, while more than satisfactory, tends to feel out of place in the grand scheme of things. It's rather as if the anime tries to feel more epic and sophisticated than it actually is. The ending theme is highly reminiscent of a ballad. Called Ushinawareta Aozora and performed by TimeSlip-Rendzvous, I personally wasn't too fond of it, but it's an acceptable bit of music. As for the voice actors, I didn't particularly find vexation with any of them, but I wasn't blown away, either.  
 
Sunrise's artwork is honestly very hit-or-miss. The colours are typically bland and not all that eye-catching. There are scenes where the drawings are beautiful, but those are fairly few. More often than not, the characters look awkward, overly kiddish (and by that, I mean the art makes it seem like the anime's demographic is six year olds), or just plain deformed. The spaceship designs are pretty nice, though. Simply put, the art does its job, and while it's mediocre at times, it can occasionally impress. 
 
Overall, Seikai no Monshou is an acceptable science-fiction show, and while it certainly won't have you on the edge of your seat, it's all right if you want to whet your appetite for aliens. What it doesn't offer is strong character relationships or an interesting plot, but it's all right for what it does. You could certainly do worse. Who knows, it might be the prelude to a truly epic tale that blows all the competition right out of the water – but for now, it's a pretty lacklustre start for the series as a whole. Tentatively recommended.

       Helpful Overview: Crest of the Stars is by far one of my all time favorite anime.  That said it is not for everyone.  The show is set far into the future were humans have colonized the entire galaxy.  The two main characters Jinto and Lafiel are well developed and entertaining to watch.  If there is a down side to this show it is that it is rather slow paced, and involves a great deal of dialog.  Although there are action scenes in the show, this is not for people with short attention spans. 
 
Story: There are two stories taking place in crest of the stars, both of which are connected and continue into the squeals.  The first story is that of Jinto and Lafiel, without giving to much away, suffice to say that a good deal of the show focuses on there journey as they are tossed around by the events around them.  The second story is that of galactic politics.  Both stories are well told, and they intertwine throughout the show. 
 
Art: Although it is a bit dated by todays standards the visuals are still as stunning as when i first saw the show several years ago.  This is a prime example of aged excellence. 
 
Sound: Crest of the stars simply would not be as good a show if not for the amazing orchestra in the background.  The opening theme song does get old after a while, but the music during the show is some of the best iv herd in an anime.  This is not to say the music in and of itself is superb, but rather the fusion of art, sound and context of what is happening on screen at the moment is masterfully executed. (But the music is the strongest part hear because it invokes powerful emotion in various parts). 
 
Charecters: All of the characters in crest of the stars are well portrayed and developed.  The show even hints at cast members back ground just to give you more feel for the world.  Also Jino and Lafiel are two of my favorite characters out of any anime. 
 
Enjoyment:  The reason why enjoyment is lower than the other areas is simply because crest of the stars is a slow anime.  It can in certain places drag on a bit, when a more modern adaptation would be paced a bit quicker.  Despite this all of the other elements that make up the show more than compensate for it.  (once again though if you have a short attention span you will probably get board before any of the really intersecting things happen).

","The Cyborg 009 series is an outstanding series, however this movie doesn't quite like up to that. Though the visuals and sounds were outstanding, I had a mediocre experience.  
 
I understand the apocalyptic theme and if executed well, the story works. However, there are a tremendous amount of holes in the plot that make the entire story make little to no sense.  There were many questions left unanswered about various points made in the story. The is especially directed toward the ending, which made no sense. How did they all end up on a remote island-ish type place? How did they survive? Where did this and that character disappear to? Who the heck are they all talking about? We never get real answers to any of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nice that it all worked out in the end.  I prefer happy endings, except when the story is still very much incomplete. Well, that's what it felt like to me. It could have been done better.  
 
Besides that, I love the action packed scenes. They were stunning. The dubs were very good and not hurting my ears, though I may try it in subs in the future. 

          
 
       Helpful Let me first point out that the old series was incredibly corny and flunky by today's standards. However, at its time of airing it had a lot of relevance, mainly due to the historical context of the Cold War and political climate, something this movie failed to include when adapting it for the current generation. Buildings being bombed in the name of God... it sure does seem like a subject that could make a point of modern terrorism and politics, but instead it turns into a pseudo-philosophical quest to search for God.  
 
The villain of the movie is illogical on every level. While the series had a running theme of questioning religion and often exposing them as frauds, this story instead decides to portray God as a real tangible thing, and not just as a tool used by humans to control the masses. I do not dislike it for being different, I am calling it out for going against the main themes of the franchise to the point that it might as well have been called something else. 
 
I like the new designs of the characters, it is a shame they weren't given more time to shine. I'm aware that they could not have fleshed them all out on such limited time, but I believe they still could have made them work together more often, rather than just make Joe the Tom Cruise of the team. 
 
It had a few action-scenes of note that I enjoyed, though they are few and far between, and finally the ending is nonsensical cop-out. If you're a fan, or have high demands of this, please skip it.

          
 
       Helpful After 32 years of the previous movie, Production IG took Toei place and did a remake of the series.  
 
This time around instead of mechanical monsters or aliens that are threatening the Cyborg team, its suicide bomber! 
 
Yeah.  
 
Let me just say the kid stuffs has been replaced with adult theme problems, as the cyborgs reassemble to fight for humanity in 21th century. I mean seriously, what do you expect from the studio who made Ghost in the Shell? 
 
When I start to watch this movie, or any of these movies, I try to keep an open mind so that my judgement wouldn't be clouded by what the series previous has shown. Especially for this one since people either thought this was a clever way of introducing the series to a newer audience or hated it for how gritty it is was. 
 
But let’s look at the good parts first. 
 
The action scenes in this movie are incredible. The CGI really does the work as the scenes looks much grander and more detailed than any other of the movies. Even if the CGI is used much during the movie, it ties in and doesn't become too distracting. 
 
As for the design, I like it. It fits with the mood well. Sure it doesn't look too cartoonish, but same time, it doesn't look too realistic. It’s a nice blend between those elements and the design does make the cyborgs look like real people, which is an achievement in itself. 
 
Now what about story and the characters? Well, if you expect this movie to be similar to the other movies I’ve reviewed, then you’re mistaken.  
 
I think there are two problems that people mostly see in this movie. One is that this movie is much darker than the other movies. And two, that this doesn't have much chemistry between most the members. 
 
People may argu that this movie is too dark and too psychological for the series, but if you have ever read the God War arc, then you know it’s not true. So it’s not about “if they can embrace darker themes”, but more “how they embrace it”. I mean, gritty remakes or re-imaging have been executed quite well. But there’s always a problem that it might not represent the original or keep it spirit alive, and here, it’s close to that problem.   
 
As for the characters, this movie felt like the watchmen all over again, with all the character questioning their moral and ending up fighting against one another. Even if this is a remake of the God arc, I wouldn't really call this a remake, as it feels like it’s already been built on a establish version.  Which why newer audience might not see the cyborgs much as a good team. 
 
Not to mention that all the character doesn't seem to have a fully develop personalities or have the time to do so. You will understand when you watch it. But for those who does have the time, it really contrasts on how much mature and serious the characters are from their counterparts. For example, 003 and 009 had a more innocent relationship in the first three movies. They are holding hands and hug each other times to time, showing it off in the most kid friendly way. But here, they DEFIANTLY have a sexual thing for each other. No use of hiding it, these two have gone beyond the first base. If you know what I mean. 
 
And for once, they even discuss the consequences of never ageing. Which is again very fitting and should be brought up as 009 always remain as a teen throughout the years. 
It might be going too much, but I think that the way the character acts are very fitting for a group who has been separated for years and been living in a grey yet subtle world. 
 
But what is not subtle is the symbolism. Religious symbolism is at full force in this movie, and it can get very tedious. It’s everywhere. Now I know that this is Production I.G. we are talking about, who usually show off their philosophical pattering thought Sci-Fi films. But I think they might could had been more subtle like they did in Ghost in the shell and not as hammered in. 
 
The antagonist in this movie, unlike the rest of the movies before, is actually an intimidating. Unlike Black Ghost who answered to all evil in heart of men, and Zoa who wanted to rule over the universe, “His voice” is a concept of justice and purity that could strike anyone. It could turn anyone who hears it be loyal to its bidding and commit horrible acts without them releasing it. That, is a scary concept as it has no specific form or shape. Although the pronoun game is very strong in this movie, the force seems to be one of the most powerful things that the Cyborgs has ever faced.   
 
As I said before, this movie isn't as light-hearted as the other movies. I will not further spoil this movie or bring up any other plot element, as it has to be seen to believe. Especially the ending, which is open to interpretation. 
 
People may be pissed off since they have been attached to the TV series, but I think it was worth it to see how the same concept could be handled with much darker. Beside, this is an adaptation of an unfinished arc which was supposed to be the last of the Cyborgs, so it might not be too bad as people claim it to be. But still, this movie has some flaws that won’t satisfy the fans. 
 
For me, you need to be in a right mood to watch it. Don’t expect this to be much of the traditional cyborg stuff. I mean, THIS MOVIE OPENS UP WITH SUIDICE BOMBING, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE? 
 
Watch it if you want to see more mature Cyborgs being hunted by angels from the unknown.

","Another Robert's Too Late Review coming atcha! This particular anime is an interesting one, and not for the best of reasons. As always I'm working from the dubbed version, which I'm led to believe is fairly significant, as the real life pop group, from what I understand, did the voices in the original Japanese. If the story was as convoluted and overbearing in that version, my assessment would stand just as firm. Another important note is this review is covering BOTH seasons of the show, as they do make for one (in)coherent whole. No matter how cute, there will not be a spot on the RTLR of idol anime for these girls. Let's drop it like it's hot. 
 
Story: 4 
Let me start by saying this: when it comes to idol and music anime, I'm very hard to disappoint. I have on my shelves right now all 9 Love Live! girls, all 13 Idolmaster season 1 girls, and even the entire K-On band. I love me some good idol anime. This is not one of them. Even at first blush, the show looked ultra awesome. I mean, c'mon, they have mic-sabers and flying platforms! But the more they moved into the series, the more disjointed and nonsensical it became. They pick up threads, get half way through them, and then just dump them outright for the next gimmick. Add to that the incredibly weird system of 'generations' and we're just in all kinds of a mess. 
 
For example, there are some girls in the actual main group that are like 11th or 12th 'generation' and are young women singing. Yet our main cast is primarily built around the 75th 'generation' growing and coming of age! How can we have a young 20-ish girl being SIXTY 'generations' older than the trainees in the current class? Even if you don't take 'generations' to mean an age group, and instead as nothing more than the most recent recruits, you still have to end up washing out dozens of 'generations' because there's only a handful of actual 00 members, and most of the trainees (our main cast) are from the 74th and 75th generation. Bout the only way it works is that they are churning out a generation every week or two, and even then it appears that the vast majority of the girls completely fail. This view is somewhat tempered by the fact the trainees are shown learning the ropes for a month or even more. This system is asinine and does not work.  
 
Then we have a plethora of plot points picked up and then just utterly dropped for no reason. Late in the second season an important character dies, one who should have had a huge impact on a cast member, along with the policing force because of his immense power and wealth, but naw, he's dead, who cares, let's all dance and sing. He is mourned slightly, but gotten over quickly, and they never bother to tell us who killed him or why.  
 
That's not the only flaw to come up. At one point they introduce an understudy position, of which there is competition and such for. They use the system basically once, and it's never mentioned again, for the most part. And why would this be an issue? Every performing group, from music to theater have plans in place to deal with unexpected absences. Why introduce the idea as something so radical and cause so much drama with it when it should have well been a given?  
 
Furthermore, we're given a 'Dr. Claw' situation in a character called, I kid you not (in the dub) Sensei Sensei. He's like a pair of eyes and that's it, only says a word or two at a time, but is approached by the manager of 00 and the other attendants in full shrine maiden garb, like he's some kind of god or  something. We never learn who or what he is. In fact he is rather redundant because we learn that it's the floating jellyfish things in their magical cave that make the decisions on who becomes a full fledged member or not.  
 
Then they throw nonsense at us like the idea of a general election, which logically should decide who is a full member and who isn't right? Wrong. Succession still comes as the flying jellyfish or the god thing decide it. Why elect anyone to anything if the deciding factor is some flying, glowing blobs? Exactly what were they elected to? If the election picked the group, then why does the succession phenomenon occur?  
 
They also go a strange route of having each girl that becomes a full fledged member take on the name of a retiring (or retired) former member. It's not absolutely outlandish, but it does cause a good deal of confusion as some girls move from being their given character name to being known as their 'new' member name. Also we really never see how retirement works for the group. There are a few characters that are former members, but they never explain if a girl is forced to give up the group at a certain age, or if she waits until her successor arises or anything. It's very random feeling.  
 
They throw in extraneous details that seem to make no sense as well. They have friendly rivalries between girls who never complete on anywhere near the same level. They have a trainee they put forward as having real potential for leadership that never leads. They just seemed to grab an idea, run with it, and drop it before finishing it out properly.  
 
All of these issues are set against the backdrop of entertainment being banned on many planets, which is utterly ludicrous. Who in the world thinks that sugary J-pop is going to destroy the fabric of society? I know there are those in the real world that live austere lives, but they do so by choice, not because they are forced into the lifestyle by the law. And of course we have an anti-entertainment military force fighting the group, along with a ragtag group of insurgents. If you really want to look at this way, the 00 group is kind of terrorists in a sense. They go someplace via spaceship, break the law concerning entertainment, and while they do not kill, they do destroy military equipment left and right. We have situations where the girls are singing their happy-go-lucky songs while beating the shit out of soldiers with their taser like mic-sabers.  
 
The biggest issue throughout most of both seasons is this thing called the center nova. Apparently it has to be triggered under exact circumstances to happen, and the last one to do it literally disappeared. It is shown later that she is either dead or in a different dimension or some such. Yet everyone wants to be the center nova. Why in the world would there be so much competition for a position that, as far as is known for most of the run, killed the last person that held it? They never adequately explain what the center nova truly is beyond 'special' and what it means beyond 'music is love'. It's this big thing everyone wants to be, but with no clear motivation as to why.  
 
I came into the series just loving the idea of Love Live! meets Star Wars or something, and I was completely let down by half baked ideas and nonsensical plots. I was more than ready to overlook flaws many would call out, but I just can't help but be utterly disappointed in what I saw, and the wasted potential they had and misused.  
 
Art: 8 
Wow, what a swing huh? The art is so cute it hurts. Most all the girls in the group or the trainees all have heart highlights in their hair and in their eyes. Other characters, especially former members, those hearts turn to diamonds. This is as cutesy as it comes, and I have to admit I did like the way the girls looked. There is one big issue though, in the concert mode, they kick over to CG and it is incredibly noticeable. This is really bad in the first season where we're not so familiar with as many faces, but even at the end of the second one, we still have this jarring transition between 'hand drawn' and CG animation that is absolutely irritating. It was the main thing that detracted from the score for me, as the 'moe' looks of the rest of the show work just fine for me.  
 
Sound: 7 
There's a lot of music to be had in this anime, and I found a lot of it catchy and fun. They don't hesitate to play music very often, sometimes playing a song in the climax of the episode just to turn around and play the end theme immediately afterwards. I liked the music well enough, none of it drove me wild, but I did tap my feet along with it many times. To me, if you're going to do a music/idol anime, you need to actually play some tunes, and this one does just that. Of course being based on a real life group I imagine helped a great deal in that respect.  
 
The themes were nice enough, though none of them really stood out to me. They seemed to fit the feeling of the show nicely and I have no complaints, they just weren't all that fantastic to me. They get the job done, and that's what we're looking for.  
 
The voice acting in the dub is a mixed bag. Some of the girls are absolutely ear destroying (the blonde in pigtails for exampe) while others, such as the main character sound just fine. A lot of them seem to be trying too hard to match up to the cutesy persona of the characters instead of working on putting in a good performance.  
 
Character: 4 
The entire cast seems to be overwritten. They try to shoehorn in too many elements such as the rivalries and other dramatic elements to the point it's just hard to keep up with. They seem to write each character with an arc in mind, but forget to make that arc match up with any other character, leaving each of them out in the wind, and making the whole thing disjointed. It's like they saw higher quality shows, and decided they wanted to use every element from those shows they could. But by throwing it in all together, instead of a delicious dish, we get just awfulness. Ambition for a project is good, but there is such a thing as overdoing it. They cross that line many times with most of the characters.  
 
The character types are cliche, have the shy one, the earnest one, the annoying one, the sad one, the one filled with determination, so on and so forth. And with them all over dramatizing the plot points, it just really doesn't come together very well.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I found moments of the show to like, but very few. The music was a highlight for me, and a character or two kind of drew my attention, but for the most part, I wanted so much more than it could give, and I couldn't bring myself to really get into it. If they would have stuck to a few plot points and fleshed them out, we might have had a great show on our hands, but instead we get so busy with this and that, that the show kind of loses it's identity. A fatal flaw for any form of entertainment, for sure 
 
Best Girl: Suzuko Kanzaki mainly because she's not over the top voice wise, she's quieter and more introspective, and very intelligent, knowing a great deal about the group's history and such. She doesn't seem to get caught up in the inane drama as much as the other girls do. Hence my vote.  
 
Really there are better things to watch out there. If you're needing idol anime in your live, check Love Live!, check Idolmaster, check Kids on the Slope, hell check K-On even. Just don't let the cool sci-fi bend to this one fool you, it is nowhere near as awesome as the first couple episodes make it out to be. If this was the people's only form of entertainment, I can see why they banned it. Pass for sure. 

          
 
       Helpful First, I’d like to mention that when I watched this anime a while back, I was unaware of how popular the idol industry was in Japan, let alone who the group AKB48 was. I came into this show expecting an enjoyable music-focused anime, and I was happy with what I got. 
 
STORY: 
The best thing about this show is the mixing of genres. It has a futuristic sci-fi setting, which lays the foundation for the universal ban on entertainment. The group of idols also serves as a group of rebels who are fighting to bring their music to their fans all across the universe. I really liked this premise and enjoyed the combination of their music performances and the fight scenes. That said, the plot about “saving the world” didn’t really go anywhere and could’ve been fleshed out more. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
It has a huge cast of characters, and all of them are likable for the most part. I liked the concept of succession, which ends up being a major point of motivation for the new idols. Since there are so many characters, only a few get proper character development (mainly Nagisa and Chieri). Unless you find some characters particularly annoying, it’s easy to ignore the unimportant background characters and focus on the group as a whole (especially during their performances). 
 
SOUND: 
I liked the songs. I don’t listen to J-pop much, but this style of music appeals to me and the music is the main reason why I enjoyed this show so much. There were a couple songs I found cringey, but combined with the dance routines and the fight scenes, I still liked their performances. 
 
ART: 
It’s colorful and fun. I don’t really have any complaints. I especially liked the contrast between the bright stage during their performances and the dull backgrounds: it emphasizes the futuristic setting and and gives it an ethereal look. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I enjoyed it. I was looking for a music anime, and the music is what made this show for me, combined with the unique setting and action scenes. It was a mix of everything, and though the actual story had its flaws, it was a very entertaining show to watch.

          
 
       Helpful This is a fun and bubbly show geared towards pre-teens and maybe teens. I like the music, its not really that bad. There are many characters and each and every single one seems to have a backstory that you get glimpses of. Character progression is pretty nicely done and it is nice to see how each one progresses from where they were to where they end up. The story is pretty far fetched but it keeps you intrigued with being more character based which isn't bad. For the adults, this show is not really for us, but it you have pre-teens and younger girls, I'm sure they would really dig this show and the music isn't bad to listen to so overall, for adults, its fine, for kids, its pretty good.

       Helpful So...... The first episode of this anime definitely left a big impact. One that gets you completely and utterly hooked, wanting answers. The way they structured the story was in a forwards to backwards layout, which can only really be pulled off (well) in pscyh anime... but they did such a magnificent job at using the FTB layout to recap the story. When we get post-apocalyptic stories, we generally dont question why its set in this era because its just as it is ... a post apocalyptic-anime OR they give a basic desciption when the MC shows up and gets told some tragic past of another dude (who probably dies by the end of the anime... lol) and that shuts us up and we continue watching. 
 
Gakkougurashi gave a simple reason, which I would have been satisifed with and then began to tell the outbreak story in snippits of each girls backstory, which I never knew I wanted to know until I knew why everything was how it was. Clever right? Confusing? not at all! Its done very well, along with beautiful animation and movement.  
 
The moe style isnt my everyday cup of tea but it adds to the overall effect they were going for combining horror with cutesy.  
 
Most of the characters get a nice development but they werent all in depth. Enough information was given for the right amount of knowledge to understand what was happening and I guess thats all that matters. You will enjoy Gakkougurashi!! 

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I'll start by assuming that you've read the synopsis on MAL for it and know what the series is about. However, if you didn't, you might have the opportunity of going into this series without having the first episode's twist revealed. So you might want to head in and check that out first. Like, you might like the whole twist, despite the rate I've given this series and knowing the theme is relevant to what I'll continue with. 
 
If you're reading this paragraph then I'll assume that you did. Do you like the theme that the anime has presented? Yes? Then you should give this adaptation's manga instead a try. I'll explain why, as I've done a check up on the differences between the manga series and the anime series. 
 
The anime's story tried to strengthen the cutsey/moe-ish factor of the show by a fuckton. To do that the show has done certain changes which left out a bunch of scenes where the conflict between some characters has been underwhelmed or totally removed, some events were changed to be more lighthearted or simply replaced with some more slice of life-ish moments. Some moments that define the mental state of the main character better as well as some mental breakdowns were removed from the show. Some events were rearranged to fit the cutsey aspect of the show better and make it be more lighthearted. And on top of all that since they thought the cutsey factor will sell and because we've got girls in the show, you like girls right???, they also added a beach (a pool episode but not really) to it. And due to all of these factors this, the anime will feel lacking and kinda skewered. 
 
In order to succeed in selling a character that lives in a certain state of mind, you've gotta detail their state of mind as much as possible and the anime's description of the main character's state of mind is simply... accepted by her peers. It is never really explained properly why. The explanation given to us is really, it cheers us up. But in the manga it actually is a little more complex than that. I can't go into more detail because of spoilers here, but note that the manga has given more important details to make her state easier to understand and accept. Her state of mind fuels the tragedy in the series and her struggles. All these things to give depth to her character, and even the characters around her since the effect and the impact her state has on them is also more explored in the manga, all of that, replaced with cutsey moments. 
 
The pacing of the series is all damaged, in order for the anime to get serious due to all the changes they've done to the source material it had for a good while to appeal to flashbacks in order to describe the current state of how things are, making it seem as the worst has passed and they're making the best out of a bad situation and living somewhat casually at the current time. In the manga, the pacing is better. And the worst part is that the pacing makes the final events of the series feel completely convenient, from a casual watcher of zombie series' standpoint. There are some things will feel awfully convenient happening. Like, no, stupidly convenient. Like, shoplifting something, being caught, and you asking ""Can I steal this PLEASE?"". And they're like, yeah sure. Then you leave, yay, free shit. I again obviously can't give details on this, because spoilers. 
 
So what can you expect from the anime itself? A story that doesn't describe its characters and the struggles they went through properly, banking on the fact it's cute and hoping that it's cuteness will be a catalyst to an impactful ending, banking on a couple things that are very likely to market. Is that the same case from the manga? Well, I can say the story takes itself more seriously, and things won't feel nearly as convenient there. There's some skipped content in the anime. (a bunch of chapters actually, consecutive even for a bunch of them) There's a character in the series (The dog) that is merely an episodic chapter in the manga series which in the anime is pretty much part of the main cast. The dog is anything but an integral part of the group. And something that will happen to the dog is explained way better rather than not at all. 
 
To put it quite frankly, the things the anime has done quite well are its intro that gets progressively more fucked up as the series progressed, which I thought was a nifty touch, but I can't say I am a fan of the moe artstyle, or the slice of life-ish moments that took away development from the characters and the group as a whole the manga had. Anything else? The serious moments were done mostly well, but the series is mostly killed by its pacing. As I've said, when it's not in flashbacks, it seems like they're living somewhat of a peaceful life and the worst has already passed, making it all the more ridiculous how by its end, everything that will happen will simply feel convenient. And while the manga also tries to look cute, it does not do it at the cost of telling a more complete story about the characters. 
 
If you want a more solid story with better characterization and better focus on the characters and of the theme this anime has, just go for the manga. The manga is decent, it explores the impact someone delusional and why they're delusional overall impacts the group, and the view of everyone on it and the impact this has on them. The anime tries to exploit this mental state as a tool towards building slice of life-ish moments that took away from the story. The manga tells a more natural, better paced, not nearly banking as much on the ""please notice me I'm cute"" factor. The problems of the group and characters are solved with less convenience even though there's some of that inside of the manga too. The world will be described better than in the show and in this particular type of setting, knowing the dangers of the world is very important. Overall I'd say the anime adaptation was an adaptation mostly ruined by marketing tactics. The manga series while not incredible, it still does a decent job with its theme and it uses its strengths mostly right. 
 
However, if you're not interested in the theme or just don't want to bother with the manga, you could just avoid this series entirely. The reason I compared it with the manga so much is to explain why the adaptation was bad and if you are really into the theme, you have a far better alternative. I can't recommend you going into the anime for any reason, in good faith, when you have a better alternative for the same story in a different format.

","To start this off I just want to say that I will attempt to contain any and all spoilers to the ""story"" section of my review. 
 
 
Story: 8/10 
The story is just as the synopsis states: Utawarerumono is based on a masked man with amnesia who wakes up in a strange new world. Just reading this synopsis may make some people think that Utwarerumono is simply your typical shounen story where the protagonist recovers his memory half way into the story and he broods over his past in which he did something he regrets to a loved one. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. I'm going to go out and say that yes, Hakuoro does recover his memory somewhere throughout the story but the main drama surrounding him is him struggling to grasp just who he was. I won't go into details here but there are a few twists in which the audience couldn't possibly expect surrounding just who Hakuoro is and what he was doing prior to being found by Eruruu. There are some things that aren't covered in the anime such as why Kamyu sucked Aruruu's blood and honestly you're better off not knowing since the answer is strange and may ruin her character for certain people. 
Right up until the ending there is information that may mess with your view of the world that Utawarerumono has created and about who Hakuoro is. 
 
Art: 9/10 
My view on the art of this series may differ from other reviews as I had watched the Blu-ray version in which animation studios fix mistakes and improve the overall quality of the animation at times. 
The art in this series looked fantastic all the way through from the backgrounds to the characters in the foreground. There were a few times when a character's face wasn't directly in view that the face or character looked like a blob of scribbles but the times this happened could be counted on one hand. The animation was smooth however once or twice animation was reused entirely. An example of this is in the later episodes in which Hakuoro is fighting off a few soldiers with his fan and less than five minutes later the exact same fight sequence is played again for whatever reason. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The music and sound quality for this series was very well done. During battle sequences it felt like you were there and could hear the swords clank next to you. The village scenes felt very serene and calming and the town scenes felt like you were in the center of a bustling street with street vendors talking over one another and everything. 
One complaint though is that there was only one opening sequence for every episode and it gave several major spoilers including all of the major villains for the entire show. 
 
Character: 9/10 
The characters in this show were varied and didn't all follow standard tropes laid out for them. Hakuoro who is normally the calm monotone person has several outbreaks of emotion and character. Of course some characters such as Oboro fit their character tropes to a t. My biggest complaint regarding characters though has to do with Mukkuru. Mukkuru is a white tiger and the pet/friend of Aruruu. However, Mukkuru displays the opposite behaviours that a cat would display. For example, when Mukkuru is happy he may wag his tail similar to a dog; however, when a cat wags it's tail that doesn't mean ""I'm happy"" it means more along the lines of ""I'm angry/annoyed"".  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I'm honestly a bit mad at myself for watching this show. I enjoyed it so much that I haven't been able to enjoy some shows that have been on my backlog as I can't help but say ""Utawarerumono did ____ better"". I'm not even sure how I came across this show but I am glad I found it as it is among my top 10 for sure. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
Utawarerumono is not perfect and thus it does not deserve a perfect score. However, the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone that likes fantasy or anime about war.

          
 
       Helpful What comes to mind when a visual novel gets an anime adaptation? Usually I think average guy, a bunch of overly cute unattainable girls and some kind of story arc surrounding each girl. However Utawarerumono disregards this overused high school romantic formula, with girls that require conquering like a RPG boss and goes for a more fascinating approach.  
 
Utawarerumono is an Action Adventure set in a world of Fantasy. Just think Lord of the Ring, but minus the Ring and Hobbits. Following the disturbing opening scene, we our introduced to our protagonist, a mysterious masked man with no recollection of who he is and why he has an immovable mask on his face. Now this amnesia plot device is one of the most over used but taking into account that this is based of a visual novel, it’s certainly a good way for the player to start off with a clean slate. Now as for the story, a good amount of time is spent bringing this fantasy world to life, in what looks to be a very mild mannered series. But soon after being lulled into a false sense of security, the story develops into that of a war between nations. So instead of harem filled romance you can expect bloody battle after battle, in an ever developing storyline. Sure it would have been better if more thought was put into how to kick start this warfare plot but as a whole, the series did prove to be very exciting to watch. If only it remained that way throughout however in the last batch of episodes you’ll witness one of the most thoughtless plot developments ever, which did a good enough job in ruining whatever impression I had of the series. 
 
The male protagonist did suffer from this drastic change but before that he was a really interesting and mysterious character. It’s a great thing seeing him develop from a nameless nobody to a charismatic figure and the other characters that gravitate towards him certainly have their own appeal or role in the story. Not to forget the female characters, who are what make it this an obvious adaptation from a visual novel but that isn’t really a bad thing. The only negative aspect is the few really stupid and annoying characters (the Emperors) that stifle the quality of this anime. 
 
The quality of the animation is really good as there’s a fair amount of detail put into the characters and environments with some good water, fire & smoke effects. Yet a lot of corners were cut, like when it came to animating the fight scenes. At times it just looked cheap, with a lot of recycled scenes and who could forget the poorly implemented CGI character models in the armies. At least the music is truly special as it manages to go well with the anime, especially during the battles or when it is building up to something epic and I am particularly fond of the ending theme (R.I.P Eri Kawai). 
 
Overall Utawarerumono turned out to be a great Fantasy, Action, Adventure that pulled off a tale about one man and his journey onto greatness. There is quite a lot going for this show to get anyone into it, like the way the characters interact with one another and how the battles & politics were handled. Personally I was disappointed by the number of flaws that plagued the show, from the corners cut in animation, to the terribly erratic pacing and the few stupid decisions the characters made. But none of that really compares to how appalling the last couple episodes were handled. If you can overlook these then you’ll enjoy it.

       Helpful All i can really say is that i didn't even realize it was a harem until someone mentioned it 
 
I HATE harems (mostly cuz i find all the girls really annoying and i hate excessive fan service) 
 
but i absolutely LOVED Utawarerumono and it may even be partly because it IS a harem. I loved all the female characters and i loved when more kept being added 
 
but its not just a simply harem because their are a lot of male cast too (Benawi, Oboro, the twins) 
 
then i love the OP theme (and the ED ones too) 
 
and the concept of slowly overcoming difficult hurdles and eventually leading and building an empire was very satisfying. The abilities of all the characters as well as the main characters background is truly gratifying  
 
the story was intelligently made and the art is cute and fun (we've got adorable characters, sexy characters, cool characters all the like) 
 
i think the best part is the fact the main character becomes an emperor and has many faithful companions. (its also funny seeing Benawi try and make Hakuoro work--a true slave driver) 
 
it had all the elements i needed. 
Lovable/memorable characters. (BISHIES!!! ...and Bishoujo) 
Cool abilities/skills 
Wealthy main cast (he rules a KINGDOM and lives in a friggin castle) 
Animal companions (Mukkuru-the tiger-thing and that rabbit-thing) 
Scenes that play on your emotions (i swear i was crying, laughing, smiling, all over the place) 
 
Characters die, characters meet, lots of fighting action (probably the best parts) 
Awesome anime. 
 
All 10s...except sound...cuz i don't really remember how good it was. Tho like i said i loved the OP and ED themes ^.^ Kimi ga Tame(ED 2)  is probably one of the most nice sounding themes out there

9,1085,148,5.17954495,A group of people living together,Interlude,"The unnamed main character has been having strange dreams, seeing strange things, and meeting strange people. He investigates these events and finds a strange girl named Aya. With her help, he discovers that his world may not in fact be real and many of the people he thinks he knows may not exist anymore. 
 
(Source: FUNimation)","['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Mystery']",none,"Look at the poster again - can you see 3 large women? Good. One of them, the long red-haired one is a question mark. While she does vaguely resemble one useless character in the plot, whether it is she on the poster or not, either way both in the anime and on its poster the viewer is left thinking who and what the heck is she even doing in there?  
 
In many respects this summarises the feelings you get after watching Interlude, whose plot doesn't fail to get you worked up with expectations but at the same time gives you a headach for the most part due to it being basically pointless. It is one of those animes where the authors tried too hard to twist things up but end up in the end getting twisted themselves with loose ends all over the place and leave the mess up for you to fill in the blanks, pretending all along there is somehow some great psychological logic behind it all which of course nobody grasped!

          
 
       Helpful My first review on an OVA so here it goes! 
 
Interlude, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is an intervening or interruptive period, space, or event. How this can be applied to this OVA is moot. We can conclude that the most likely meaning of the Interlude in this anime is the world of memory, in which all of our characters live their lives in this ""intervening pause"" of the apocalypse. The tautology of the word can clearly be seen in every intro where one of the heroines gives a monologue (or even a soliloquy) about an abstract idea concerning despair in regard to personal ambition, the point of life, or obliviousness to the world around us. I may mention the motifs and symbolism I see throughout the series, which may be full of praise, but this does not reflect my actual review of the OVA as a PRODUCT. 
 
Now the review: 
 
(5) Story: There is no true plot. Just an abstract outline of the apocalypse in parallel with a dream world that was formed to preserve the lives and sanity of a number of humans left in the world. Now the beauty of this lack of plot is that the director gives us a piece of his work, his art and we're supposed to see what is truly being expressed throughout his work. There are questions imposed here that make you really think. Just to name a few:  
 
""Is sacrifice really worth it if a person you're sacrificing for is oblivious to your efforts?"" 
 
""Could you live with yourself if everyone else died but you?"" 
 
""Does the power of love juxtapose with the shame of regret in times of extreme trauma or does the power of love triumph over the shame of regret in those moments?"" 
 
""When and where does morality end and begin?"" 
 
I mean you could go on for hours trying to see the symbolism within this short OVA and determine what the author was trying to get across. However, many of my fellow anime fans know that anime is used as a direct means to express a certain emotion, thought, or outlook on an aspect of life or human values. However, making this OVA abstract detracted heavily from actually making this OVA enjoyable for most viewers. 
 
(9) Animation: This is one aspect which the producers clearly did not fail in. The art in this work was very smooth, clean, and crisp within the memory world. The apocalyptic world is portrayed in a fuzzy, surreal manner, giving way to the feeling of shock; how the world became what it was never supposed to be. I can't say the detail was simply amazing, but they way the artists pulled it off did contribute to the sense of illusion and loss of reality within the OVA. 
 
(7) Sound: Again no complaints. Just as with the art, the producers did not neglect on the sound effects, voice acting, or music of the series. However, I can clearly see that they did not go out of their way to use sound as a tool to further convey the feelings and emotions of confusion and dark self-reflection in regard to the main character's interaction with his surroundings, which is why I gave it a positive, but not an outstanding rating. 
 
(6) Character: Again, in relation to to my story rating, I believe the characters are used as a kind of foil, not just to the main character, but to ourselves. The characters were not very well developed because the I believe the director made it his intention to keep his story abstract. The only person whom I believed was really was developed was Mutsuki Saegusa who sacrificed everything for a step-brother whom she truly cared for. I can look into the characters and begin to delve into the realm of philosophy asking questions about myself, humanity, and the surreal. However, this is an anime review so I'm avoiding any digressions when I can! ;) 
 
(9) Enjoyment: I can go forever about this one. Let's keep it short.  
I'm a very deep thinker. This OVA presents questions and innuendos that really made me think about values, morality, humanity, etc. Because of this, I enjoyed the anime a lot because it made me reflect on a lot of ethics we follow today. 
 
(6) Overall: Again this OVA is not for people looking for amazing action or getting blown apart in terms of psychological thinking, like with Inception (I know it's not anime but it's a good example). It's supposed to stimulate reflection and provoke some sort of response in terms of what symbols you can pull out of the anime and discuss with other viewers. I enjoyed it as provoker of deep meditation. As an OVA, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are into finding deep, hidden themes and meanings within the shows.

          
 
       Helpful This anime does a number of things really well ... and then flops in a number of other areas.  The very first thing to understand about this anime is that you aren't going to understand this.   
 
Story 
The entire anime plays out similarly to the end of Evangelion where absolutely nothing makes any sense.  This is an area that could have used significantly more polish.  Done properly, this could have been a mind-twister that really made you think about some important questions in life.  In stead what we have is a Half-life/Evangelion hybrid that just doesn't feel right about half of the time. 
 
Art 
This is by far the series strongest area.  The art is relatively well done.  There's better out there, of course, but this really isn't bad.  The characters feel individualized, well drawn, and well animated.  The backgrounds are rich and contrast well enough that the characters don't become drown out by it.  The environment overall feels believable. 
 
Sound 
I really don't have any particularly strong feelings about the audio in this series.  For me it was just ... meh.  It certainly isn't bad sound and the theme isn't too bad ... but it also isn't good either.  It's just there. 
 
Characters 
This is the low point of the series right here.  There are token characters everywhere in this one.  This includes the obligatory mostly-naked girl in all three episodes.  For me, this really took away from the story.  Some of the characters are, for the most part, believable.  They do their best to draw out the main character but even then he feels ... empty most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment 
Surprisingly, I still enjoyed this anime.  It certainly wasn't the best out there ... but it was pretty good.  It is, for all intents and purposes, average.  If you've got nothing all that great to watch, this is at least a somewhat enjoyable experience. 
 
The final verdict: OK ... I suppose.

","Hulaing Babies is a new short anime with a really simple not particularly compelling narrative about a hula club. What this show does have that makes it worth watching for me is a cool aesthetic I've never seen anywhere else some nice visual flow, creative animation and something pretty dang important for anything I'm watching on the basis of visuals, it has more than enough new visuals each ep to make it worth it. Whether it's some art style changes to something really cool looking for a scene, new characters with cool designs, creative animation, or something else, there is for me at least, always enough new things each episode visually to definitely justify the 5min watch time. And to round this out I'm going to mention the charming ED were this guy floats in the air spins and tells a kinda funny story while playing the ukulele. So in conclusion I would recommend checking this out to anyone who wants something visually fresh and cool. I can't say if you will like it it visually as much as me but it's not like you have anything to lose it's episodes are pretty short.  

          
 
       Helpful Man this show was Real fun 
I knew I can relay on digi's taste  
Although we don't agree on every thing  
But nine times out of ten if he thinks about 
An anime that it's really good big chance it is. 
 
And it was great I love the color scheme, the art style  
The stiff animation probably it's because it was made by 
Only four people not counting the voice actors. 
 
The story isn't that special but the characters are 
Outstanding especially Mona who's literally Urara  
From yes PreCure 5! I also love Nagisa and Shiina those  
Two defiantly have something special going between them 
I say love. 
 
Over all such an enjoyable ride I love it 


          
 
       Helpful Hulaing Babies is fun and nothing else. 
 
It's a psychedelic trip, crazy, wacky and ultimately meaningless.  
Narratively there isn't much going on than what's said in the synopsis, but that's hardly why it's enjoyable. 
 
Hyper condensed fun and aesthetically dreamlike. 
There isn't much animation in terms of frames, but the colour palette and editing make up for this. Its high energy editing keeps things moving and entertaining. The characters have personalities that bounce off each other - sometimes literally thanks to the editing. Everything looks fantastic. Character designs work in perfect synergy with one another whilst complementing the dreamy background art. 
 
The comedy is character-driven and visually spastic.  
There are mostly multiple things happening at a given time. 2 characters having a conversation about something random and in the background, other characters will be doing their own thing. Either playing cat and mouse or bouncing off the walls. At least 1 thing is funny. 
 
The ED is banter. 
Just some dad playing a ukulele sharing some humorously dark stories about his failed marriage and daughter issues, maintaining a light-hearted tone while laughing about it, that feels totally out of place and it's fucking hilarious. Simultaneously acts as a break to calm you down and prepare you for the next episode, do not skip it.  
 
Watch it, you'll like it.
