3,1208,0,26.89426918,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Tatsu no Ko Tarou,"Patterned after Japanese art and silk screens, Taro, The Dragon Boy is an animated feature about Japanese mythology and cultures, focusing on Taro, a young boy who has to make a voyage to a distant lake to save his mother, who has been turned into a dragon.","['Adventure', 'Historical', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy']","In the distant past of Japan, a lazy and selfish Taro loves to eat and sleep and wrestle with the animals. With no direction in his life, a Tengu appears that gives him a special potion. With this potion, he gains the strength of a hundred men - but he can only use it when he is helping others. After drinking the potion, Taro, day by day, begins to understand what it means to help others, first by fighting Akaoni (Red Oni) to save Aya, a young girl gifted with the flute, then by helping others in his village collect fire wood.
One night his grandmother tells him of his mother's transformation into a dragon. Taro then begins his search for his mother. Before his search for his mother starts, Taro again confronts Akaoni after hearing from the animals that Aya was captured by Kurooni (Black Oni). After a brief fight, Akaoni agrees to help Taro save Aya from Kurooni. After besting Kurooni, Taro finds out he has also saved a village terrorized by Kurooni and Akaoni, the latter bullied into the former's service.
Taro then aids Akaoni by throwing him into the clouds to serve the thunder god. After the village celebrates Taro's deeds, he starts his search. He comes upon an old woman and is tricked into service in her rice paddies. After a successful harvest year and learning the truth from a giant serpent living in the lake next to the old woman's rice farm, Taro takes the fruits of his labor and gives it to the old woman's former employees and others, leaving her with little.
During his conversation with the serpent, Taro learns that nine mountains over lives a yamanba that could point him in the right direction. Taro takes that information and finds the yamanba. The yamanba tells him what he seeks and lets slip she was responsible for the serpent. After narrowly escaping the yamanba, Taro is overpowered by yukionna.
The following morning, Aya finds Taro near frozen and able to revive him. With her aid, Taro finds the lake where his mother, Tatsu, now lives. Tatsu tells Taro why she was transformed; as a mother heavy with child fulfilling her duties to her unborn child, she needed to eat, but neglecting her duties to the rest of her village, she left nothing of her catch for the other workers.
Taro then proposes a means to make the lives of the villagers back home better, by making for them a new home with large rice paddies. Taro and Tatsu them attempt to break the dam that formed the lake Tatsu resides in. Although they succeed, Tatsu's body is broken, and after seeing the lake had emptied, Taro concluded she had died. Mourning the loss of his mother, Taro is relieved to see her life was returned and she is yet again human. Their actions are successful and the new flooded low lands enable prosperity for all the villagers Taro has helped, not only along his way but from his home village.
","This film was pretty interesting, if a bit odd... 
I don't know much at all about Japanese folklore, so I was probably missing something. I thought the art was quite pleasant; it reminded me a bit of ""The Last Unicorn."" The characters looked alright. I think Aya was cute, and the dragon looked cool. The little horse was adorable! The old woman in the woods was scary, though... 
 
As a person with minimal experience with Japanese folklore, I thought this movie was pretty good. At times, it really freaked me out...And some parts were a little awkward.....I'm glad he found a loincloth. 
 
This is definitely something I will show my future children.

          
 
       Helpful Unexpectedly good.  This is an adaptation of Japanese folklore, dating back to the hazy distant past of many hundreds (if not thousands) of years ago - when the people were much closer to nature and interacted with the local supernatural creatures.  A small impoverished village ekes out a living in the rocky mountains, so poor that they don't even know what rice is.  Taro is a lazy child that would rather play with the animals than help with chores, until he is given the strength of a hundred men by a wandering tengu - with the condition he can only use it to help others, not himself.   
   
His ailing grandmother informs him that his absent mother was actually turned into a dragon, and Taro goes on a quest to find his mother.  Along the way, he meets many other villagers, learns about growing and harvesting rice, and helps everyone along the way.   
   
As far as the plot goes, it's a fairly straightforward ""quest""/personal growth-type folklore tale.  The artwork (especially the backgrounds) is reminiscent of classic Japanese artwork styles, down to the stylized crashing waves, swirling clouds, and watercolor mountains.  Overall a nice little movie aimed at children but can be enjoyed by all ages.

3,1887,1,18.63927732,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Lucky☆Star,"Lucky☆Star  follows the daily lives of four cute high school girls―Konata Izumi, the lazy otaku; the Hiiragi twins, Tsukasa and Kagami (sugar and spice, respectively); and the smart and well-mannered Miyuki Takara. 
 
As they go about their lives at school and beyond, they develop their eccentric and lively friendship and making humorous observations about the world around them. Be it Japanese tradition, the intricacies of otaku culture, academics, or the correct way of preparing and eating various foods―no subject is safe from their musings. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'School']","Lucky Star's story mainly portrays the lives of four girls attending a Japanese high school. The setting is mainly based on the city of  Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main character is Konata Izumi, a lazy girl who constantly shirks her schoolwork and instead uses most of her time to watch anime, play video games, and read manga. Although she is lazy, she has also proven to be very intelligent and athletic.
The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move on to their second and third years. However, the anime starts the story with them beginning their second year, and the other high school girls that are seen in the opening are only introduced halfway through the series. The storyline usually includes numerous references to popular past and present manga, anime, and tokusatsu series.
The spin-off manga, Miyakawa-ke no Kūfuku, focuses on the daily lives of two sisters, Hinata and Hikage Miyakawa, who live an impoverished life due to Hinata's wasteful habits.
","I may be considered as a Lucky Star hater. The previous sentence is for people who click the ""Not Helpful"" button just because they disagree with the review instead of how well constructed the review is; I do not wish to waste their precious time as inhumane and insensitive beings to destroy other people's lives as reviewers. Even if I do talk about the good aspects of the work that I enjoyed, I expect about 10 of 1,500 people to find this review helpful so Lucky Star fans, make me proud. To everyone else considering this show and reading reviews because of how well-constructed they are, I implore you to continue reading. 
 
I am a big fan of slice-of-life shows. It is a genre that plays with the mundaneness of life and family; there is very little concrete story and shows tend to be driven either by comedy, moe, or relationship dynamics. Lucky Star is not a slice-of-life show, but a show that panders to otakus with a considerable amount of fanservice and random anime references that makes Family Guy cry in his bed and call for mommy. I do not wish to call such works terrible just because they do that; Pani Poni Dash does this as well and it's way funner to watch even if you don't get all the references because it feels like a sitcom. Lucky Star is not a sitcom. 
 
The show itself is inconsistent. Episode 1 is infamous because it is plain boring. In the Studio Shaft anime, Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei, the characters criticized episode 1's coronet scene for just being plain boring. Episode 1 is almost unwatchable. It makes FLCL's quotable line, ""Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary."", feel so true with the anime medium. People who plan to watch this show should note the actual work only starts at about episode 2. 
 
Other episodes involve the ""cute girls doing cute things"" mantra. I'm pretty cool with this -- as I said, I'm a big fan of slice-of-life works --; however, the main character cast is almost a letdown from the beginning. 
 
Konata, played by Aya Hirano, references to Haruhi and other famous shows from the past. If you know Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star and Initial D, then you are in luck. Most people don't; however, this show can still be watched without knowing the references. It's just that you'll be missing 80% of the show's ""appeal"", unlike Pani Poni Dash's which only amounts about 40%. 
 
Kagami is a tsundere who plays the straight man role. Tsukasa is moe and clumsy. Miyuki is moe and smart because she has glasses. If we judge them by character models, I think they're all pretty cute. As characters, they are terrible, bland, and boring. They don't offer a lot of interesting dynamics and they just feel flat as characters. Miyuki is one of the worst flat characters, changing very little throughout the show. 
 
Other episodes fared better with the addition of supporting characters. I enjoyed the supporting characters more than the main cast. Konata's dad, Izumi, is a perverted man who enjoys taking pictures of little girls and often asks his daughter to find the flag to get into the h-scene in eroges. Anime Tenchou is one of the most memorable characters and his over-the-top antics leave something to desire in the show itself. Akira Kogami's and Minoru Shiraishi's dynamics are just fun to look at; I look forward to their Lucky Channel segment a lot. 
 
There is an episode that I remember being actually good. It's about Konata's mother. To me, that's actually pretty good slice-of-life drama. Why the show doesn't follow this formula of success and go into moe pandering confuses me. 
 
While I am negative about the characters, the modeling as I said are great. The puni plush style is gorgeous and the backgrounds, as expected from KyoAni, are beautiful and photorealistic. If I view this as an art piece, it might get a B+ from me. 
 
The OP is one of those catchy atrocious tunes; the lyrics make little sense at all. Animation in the OP is pretty dynamic and wacky, unlike the show itself. I'm more of a ""meh"" when it comes to the OP. 
 
To call the show polarizing is an understatement; it's either a show that you love or hate. I am clearly at the ""hate"" part, but I see some good aspects of the work. However, there are too many problems that causes me to dislike and hate the work. I admit that this work is influential, but for the wrong reasons. People should not just watch for the work's influence, but whether they enjoyed it or not. That's how you rate and review a work.

          
 
       Helpful ""This is so BORING!"" is what most of you will say if you watch it. 
I'll admit, that is what I thought at first, and I stopped watching on the first episode when they were talking about which side is the head of a ""chocolate cornet bread""... But after a while, I gave it another try, and this time, I watched patiently and watched through the entire first episode. I was still not impressed, and still bored. I moved on to the next episode, and as you can tell by my over-all rating of a 10, I loved the rest. Now here is why: 
The story, is non-existent (as I will put no emphasis on story in this review). But that was one of the main reasons I loved it. There was no tension, no fighting, no drama, no heart-breaks. Just pure comedy.  
Comedy? Well, there's nothing that will make you roll over. But, there are countless moments where it makes you smile, many times even chuckles if you get the jokes.  
The comedy works in this anime by having the characters go through moments where you go like, ""OH I feel you!"", ""I totally know what you mean!, or ""Ah so glad I am not the only one who does that!"". That's why it's really funny in a way, making this the most accurate ""slice of life"" I have ever viewed.  
The English dub for this anime is pretty amazing (for once), the voice actor for Konata, the main character, does a wonderful job of bring her to life. The characters are all likable, but Konata is one of the best characters I have seen, and she manages to do all that without geass powers or sword skills, too. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will leave it up to you to find out more about why I find Konata so great. 
Also, it's a huge plus if you are exposed to Japanese culture (real life), because many of the jokes is about the daily life there and you will only get the jokes if you have experienced it (there aren't that many, so don't worry). 
To sum it up, Lucky Star is about the daily life of the girls, there won't be any conflicts like there are in many slice of life anime, this anime is very peaceful, and you can relate to many of the characters. 
Give it a try! Watch a few clips of it! Type in ""Funny Lucky Star Moments"" on Youtube and see for yourself! If you like it, WATCH IT. Don't marathon it, in fact, watch an episode after a long day, or better yet, watch it to calm your nerves after something like Code Geass/Death Note. Thank you

          
 
       Helpful Lucky Star is a 4-panel manga series by Kagami Yoshimizu that began publishing in 2004, and is still being published today. In 2007, Kyoto Animation, hot off the success of Haruhi, made an anime adaptation. I watched it. I also sampled the manga version. It was . . . okay, I guess. But let's elaborate on the anime some more, shall we? 
 
Story: In present-day Japan, a number of girls in high school live out their lives studying, making jokes about Gundam, being eccentric, making fun of cliches in fiction, and . . . that's about it, really. The four main girls are Konata Izumi, a self-proclaimed otaku (though fortunately one more functional than every real-life otaku I've met), Kagami Hiiragi, a no-nonsense ""Tsundere"", Tsukasa Hiiragi, Kagami's moeblob twin-sister, and Miyuki Takara, a really smart moeblob. There are many more characters than this, but they're the main focus. 
 
Because this is based off a 4-panel series, many plot threads, if you can call them that, often end abruptly, with little-to-no resolution. Some of the jokes from the manga don't translate as well into anime format. The show never veers into anything truly dark in terms of plot. It's mostly jokes and weird observations. Essentially, it's like Azumanga Daioh, but with characters with wild hair colors. And after the series and OVA sequel ends, there's no resolution of any sort. 
 
However, every episode also ends with a segment called ""Lucky Channel"", which features different characters and actually has an ongoing (and pretty funny) story. Sadly, these segments aren't that long. Yeah, Lucky Star is not something you watch for enlightenment. 3/10. 
 
Art: I'm gonna be honest; I don't like the artwork of Lucky Star. The character designs are meant to be cute, but most of them don't look cute, just childish. The coloring is often garish, and Miyuki's hair is so bright, it nearly blinded me on a few occasions. 
 
With that said, the animation is somewhat fluid for a tv series. So it's not a complete disaster on the visual front, but this show obviously does not focus on visuals. 5/10. 
 
Sound: The theme song is infamous. Some hate it, some love it. I find it . . . okay. The ending themes are renditions of earlier anime ending themes, most of which I didn't recognize. They're alright. The background music is just there, doesn't really add anything. 
 
I saw this in English, as well as bits in Japanese on random Youtube channels. Weirdly enough, Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I have ever heard. Its voice-acting is even better than most American cartoon shows I've seen! I'm not kidding! Look at this old quote of mine from tvtropes.org: 
 
""Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I've ever heard. Every character sounds exactly how I would picture their voices to be. None of the voices are annoying nor awkward sounding. They also match the lip flaps pretty closely, too. Wendee Lee especially displays great range in Konata's voice. It's impossible for me to watch the show in Japanese now; the dub is that good."" 
 
I still stand by that today. Also, Kari Wahlgren's version of Kagami blows her Japanese counterpart completely out of the water. Anyone who does English dubs of Japanese productions, be they industry professionals or fandubbers, watch Lucky Star and take notes; THIS is how you do an English dub. And you wonder why I worship every Bandai dub out there that's not Code Geass. 7/10. 
 
Characterization: For all of its faults, some of the characters are quite likable and amusing. Konata is silly, yet charming. Kagami's bewilderment is amusing. Many side characters, such as Konata's dad and Anime Tenchou are funny. The best characters, however, are the Lucky Channels stars Akira Kogami and Minoru Shiraishi. 
 
However, there's not a lot of depth to Lucky Star's cast. Also, several of its female characters are moe archetypes (or moeblobs) that don't really do much. Well, Konata's cousin Yutaka is adorable, but none of the others strike me as cute, just shallow. (Well, Tsukasa has a couple of funny moments.) And even the characters I do like don't have much to their characterizations. Look, Konata's comparing something to a game/anime again! Kagami is frustrated with someone's antics again! Tsukasa is clueless about something again! The characters aren't annoying, but I can only rate them slightly above-average. 6/10. 
 
Enjoyment: I will say this, there's usually only one funny moment per episode of Lucky Star outside of Lucky Channel, but that one moment is usually laugh-out-loud hilarious. Also, most of Lucky Channel is flat out hilarious. The English dub really helps with my enjoyment. 
 
But for a show focused only on comedy, it's not one of the better examples of anime comedy I've seen. Haruhi Suzumiya was funnier, and also served an interesting sci-fi plot. Soul Eater is way funnier, and also has cool action scenes and characters. Welcome to the NHK was funnier, and deeper and more dramatic. Sgt Frog and Gintama are both more centered on comedy, and also funnier. 
 
With that said, I do like the anime version of Lucky Star more than the anime version of Azumanga Daioh. And believe me when I say I've seen a lot worse than Lucky Star out there, too. However, LS is, at best, only slightly rising above mediocrity. 6/10. 
 
I do like the manga version of Lucky Star more, but only slightly. (I would probably give that a 7 out of 10, despite the lack of Lucky Channel in that.) I don't want to say LS is overrated. Yeah, it's not as good as I hoped it would be, but I've been let down by other animes a lot more. At least I was able to finish LS. It's not a classic, but if you're bored enough, you might want to check it out. Just mind the bright colors.

3,3038,2,17.33287894,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Senya Ichiya Monogatari,"Beautifully constructed, 1001 Nights stays true to the lush and mysterious backdrop of the well known and age old story. Tezuka remolds the story into an escapist fantasy where a 60s-era working man is transported back to an era of entirely fictitious Arabian details. Seemingly at odds with itself, 1001 Nights consistently unfolds in a way that combines Playboy graphics, Arabian rug design and traditional Japanese scroll paintings.  
 
Sound like a strange mix? You bet and along the way we experience some of the great cultural juxtapositions that makes Tezuka the unpredictable style it is.","['Hentai', 'Fantasy']","Aldin, a poor, traveling water seller, falls in love with Miriam, a beautiful slave woman on auction in Baghdad, but Havasalakum, the son of the chief of police, buys her. Before he can take her home, a sand storm interrupts the auction. Aldin uses the opportunity to steal away the slave woman, rescuing her from slavery. They hide from pursuing guards in a seemingly empty mansion. They have sex there, and are secretly watched by the master of the mansion, Sulaiman, who locks them in and commands them to continue. Havasalakum and his guards invade the mansion, where he finds them and capture Miriam. Badli, the right-hand man of the chief of police, murders Sulaiman. Aldin is tortured and sent to prison by mistake for the murder of Sulaiman. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Miriam dies in childbirth.
One year later, Aldin is set free and meets Badli in the desert. Aldin threatens to kill him, but shows him mercy and lets him leave. Aldin finds the magic cave where Kamahakim and the forty thieves hides their treasure. Aldin follows a thief inside, and as the thieves are asleep, he begins stealing the treasure. Madia, a young female thief, awakens and threatens to kill Aldin, who convinces her to see the world with him. The two fly away on a magic wooden horse. While they are crossing the ocean, living hair pulls them down.
Aldin and Madia eventually find themselves in the Lotus Island, which is home to beautiful Sirens. Their queen, Lamia, invites them to stay, but Madia becomes jealous and does not trust them. She leaves on the magic horse while Aldin stays and has sex with the sirens. Lamia forbids Aldin from following her into her house in the woods at night, but he still does so, and he is shocked as Lamia and the sirens transform into serpents. The serpents chase him, but Aldin flees from the island and is rescued by sailors. He travels with the sailors to a mysterious island, which is inhabited by a man-eating giant who eats most of the crew while Aldin survives. Aldin then finds a magical, sentient ship that will take him anywhere and fulfill almost any of his wishes.

The male genie, in hopes of keeping the other genie from risking death by being seen by the shepherd, brings a beautiful princess named Jalis, who is from Baghdad, but teleports her away when things start going wrong. The male genie, in a huff, leaves the female genie, as she transforms into a horse to help Aslan go to Baghdad. When Aslan and Princess Jalis cross paths in the desert, the genie disappears from sight.
Meanwhile, Aldin, now a rich man, enters a competition in Baghdad, the winner of which will become king. He wins the competition by tricking his opponent onto his magical ship, and by commanding the ship to take him to the end of the world.

We had a copy of the children’s version of 1001 nights at home and me and my brother would hang on every word as our mother would read them to us. When I grew older I watched all the movies and series based on these stories (e.g The Theif of Baghdad �C a must watch if you like the Arabian Nights) 
 
So when I came across this movie by Tezuka, Osamu I was ecstatic. 
 
Let me explain the story a little. Senya Ichiya Monogatari (SIM) tells the tale of Aladdin as he ventures into Baghdad as a water seller and falls in love with a slave girl. The girl is being sold in the market place and Aladdin, who fell in love with her at first sight, taking advantage of a sandstorm takes off with the girl and that is where our tale begins. I won’t dispense too many details here, because its very entertaining to watch the story unfold. Since the original 1001 nights is so vast the writers have chosen and used some elements of the different popular tales and infused them in telling the tale of Aladdin (like the bandits cave, the flying toy horse and the flying carpet). I loved seeing all the different elements come together to create a completely new tale of love, hate, power and insanity. 
 
The characters are very entertaining to watch. There is just the right amount of comic relief in the dialogues and there are also scenes that will bring tears to your eyes. A few scenes sent a chill up my spine too but they were just as entertaining. By the end of the movie I felt that I had actually gone through a long journey because the time span covered in SIM is that of years but it doesn’t feel rushed at all. 
 
The animation is old but surprisingly it complements the story very well adding to the majestic atmosphere. The scenes are very vivid and the imagery is very powerful. (I wouldn’t watch this after doing drugs :p) 
Overall I loved SMI. It reminded me how much I enjoyed the Arabian Nights tales as a child and its motivated me to buy the 1001 nights compilation translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons. 


          
 
       Helpful I've decided to write my first review on what I consider the best anime movie ever made. Now I doubt anyone else will agree with me on that statement but I truly feel this movie is a masterpiece. It was this movie that introduced me to the genius that is Osamu Tezuka. I expected to like this movie but I didn't expect it to be this good. It was excellent in every way, certainly better than any other cartoon movie at the time. With that being said its very sad to see this great film fall into obscurity the way it did. Any way on with the review. 
 
1001 nights is the first film of three films known as Animerama. The others were Cleopatra and Belladonna of Sadness. These films were among the first attempts at cartoons aimed for adults this one being the first full length animated feature made for adults. As you can expect their is quite a bit of nudity, sex, and Violence however it is not done in a sleazy way in fact it's quite light hearted feeling. The thing that truly makes this movie so great though is not as much the content as the Master story telling by Tezuka. This whole story is so deep and complex and even though at points it seems like it's going off the rails at times it all comes together perfectly in the end. The story is basically a twist on the story of Alladin with additions to it like Sinbad the sailor and the tower of Babel among other crazy stuff. It's hard to really explain the story without spoiling anything but it's largely a tale of rise and fall where many peoples lives intertwine. All the Characters are quite interesting and memorable and most have a strong amount of Character Development most notably Alladin. 
 
The art is also quite good for it's time and often mixes real in life images. There is is some nice psychedelic sex scenes which are quite mesmerizing. The music is awesome classic rock and proto-metal type stuff and is very catchy. The main theme often ends up stuck in my head in fact it is at this very moment. The whole movie is outstanding in everyway. 
 
 
Yeah that's my opinion and even though i'm plrobably alone on it I would suggest you watch this film if your cool with oldschool anime. It really is by all means a great film.

","Initially I was reluctant to watch this series because I thought it'd be depressing, but glad I didn't linger on that assumption.  
 
They did a very nice job balancing Benio's fresh personality from the first movie imo, while occasionally revealing her struggles and gradual changes in adapting to a new reality. It's done in a non-depressing manner and fits Benio's character really well; another thing I'm glad about, how they didn't just hop on the typical shoujo depression trend. There's some tropes that would've been annoying, but it's directed very straightforwardly so to speak so it's not dwelled on to the point that brings frustration.  
 
Just a heads up because I've been fooled way too many times by shows not having tragedy tags when it really should've been-- this isn't a tragedy.  
 
I wish they adapted more from the manga on Benio's interactions with other characters (minor or not) so we see a more wholesome image of her as an individual, but it's understandable they couldn't from the limitations of movies. Overall, it's very relaxing to watch, puts one in a good mood too (at least for me).

","I watched this movie at the Akibapass Festival in Frankfurt, Germany. First of all, I have to say that I'm not familiar with the original source (published from 1975 to 1979) or the older anime series, which aired from 1978 to 1979. As it is I cannot compare it to these works and watched it completely unaffected and without any previous knowledge, besides the information which has been included in the trailer. Though as it is written on the manga source page, Haikara-san ga Tooru won the first Kodansha Manga Award for shoujo in 1977, so likely it has been very good as well.  
 
The story is put-together enjoyable and the art of storytelling has been made in a very lovely way. The transition between different scenes was often in such a smooth way that you just had to smile at how it was done. As the genre allocation of this anime says Comedy, Historical, Romance, and Shoujo, you get exactly that. I laughed or smiled a lot, while I was watching this movie and as I experienced it at the cinema I was surely not the only one with this expression aka impression of this movie. The historical aspects are also depicted quite well and one or the other scene reminded me of pictures I've seen before (in preparation for a presentation I made) about this era. Also, I haven't seen such a pure romance shoujo for a while, which means some scenes have been worked out almost unrealistically perfect or smooth. But still very enjoyable and sweet. For sure something recommendable for romanticists. 
 
The art was clean, consistent and very lovely. I wouldn't describe it as the most artistic outstanding work ever, but it really was enjoyable. As I've seen this movie only once yet, I cannot further go into detail with this point.  
 
The creators have taken great care of this production. The character design and composition also make it very enjoyable.  
 
As it is Part 1 out of two movies, the story is not yet concluded but the first movie is in its own a great work and is not only the introduction to a bigger following story. 
 (Like some other multi-part movies have been created.) 

          
 
       Helpful Let me ask you: Have you ever heard of an old manga called Haikara-san ga Tooru? Yeah, me either. Not until this, at least. Anyway, the original manga by Waki Yamato, which ran from 1975 to 1977, actually had a bit of a rough history with animation. It was adapted into a TV series from 1978 to 1979 and received 42 episodes. It was apparently supposed to be longer, but from what I've heard, it got cancelled due to low ratings, and as a result, the anime had to end in a different way than the manga. Ever since then, it just sort of faded into obscurity, as nobody ever really talked about it. The manga and the anime series were never licensed in the US, likely due to their old age and old school artstyle. Considering all of these things going against it, it seemed that Haikara-san ga Tooru would be left into the darkness forever, never to be seen again. 
 
OR WAS IT?! 
 
Apparently, someone decided this story deserved a second chance, rightfully so, and decided to make a bold move: Revive the series! But instead of making it into another TV series, they decided to adapt it into two movies. Not only that, they completely changed the art style to make it appeal to modern anime audiences, with a new look and coat of paint. Having seen the first movie myself now that I have the first Blu-Ray, I can wholeheartedly say that whoever decided this anime deserved a second chance did an awesome job of bringing it back to life, even with its flaws. Because this movie is awesome and I absolutely can't wait for the second movie to come out! 
 
The story takes place in the 1910s-1920s, during the Taisho era, focusing on Benio Hanamura, a happy-go-lucky, ambitious young woman and the daughter of a high ranking military officer in the Japanese Army. She lost her mother when she was young, and as a result, has become quite the stubborn, individualistic tomboy, in stark contrast to the strict idea of the ""good wife, wise mother"" ideal of womanhood. She studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in Western clothes, and ardently believes that a woman should be free to choose who they themselves want to marry instead of being forced to accept arranged marriages. When she finds she's been betrothed to a man she knows nothing about, a handsome, sweet natured man named Shinobu Ijuuin, Benio tries everything she can to get out of it, from deliberately messing up her chores and housework (Which isn't hard, since she sucks at housework anyway) to trying to set him up with her best friend, who actually likes him. But things don't always go the way she wants them to, and circumstances might just make her realize that things might be better than she thinks. 
 
Now, the original manga is eight volumes long, so it can be hard to try and cram so much material into two movies, much less one. Many movies have tried this and failed miserably. As of this writing, I haven't seen the second movie yet (Though I do want to, and I'm definitely getting the Blu-Ray once it comes out!), so the review will focus solely on the first one for now. But even with the movie's overly condensed, compressed nature, there's a lot of things that it manages to do really well. One of those things is the animation and the character designs. As you can see, both the original manga and the anime from the 70s have VERY dated designs, with washed out colors, exaggerated sparkly eyes, huge lips, and some weird-looking, gonky faces sometimes. The producers for the new movies radically updated the character designs, making them sharper, cleaner, and more modern but still keeping it true to the shoujo aesthestic, with huge doe eyes, large eyelashes, and the men having some feminized features. The animation is beautiful, with smooth movement, lovely backgrounds and backdrops that really enhance the mood of various scenes, and it even has the characters make comedic, goofy faces like in the original Sailor Moon anime, and it works really well here. 
 
I'm kind of biased when it comes to the soundtrack, as it's done by one of my favorite anime composers, Michiru Oshima, who's worked on a lot of my favorite anime such as Nabari no Ou, My Sister Momoko, Fancy Lala, Snow White with the Red Hair, the live-action Sailor Moon series, and many others. But you probably know her for her work on the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia, Tatami Galaxy, and more recently, Bloom Into You. Yet again, she hits a home run with the soundtrack here, with oboes and violins that perfectly fit the quaint, romantic feel of the movie, but never to the point of getting obnoxious or overbearing, something that few soundtracks can boast. 
 
I do have some mixed feelings about the characters, which is inevitable considering this manga tries to cram several volumes of manga into one/two movies. I will say that Benio is a relatively good lead character: She has a lot of character flaws, such as being a little too stubborn and argumentative, which can make her come across as bratty at first, but the movie never takes these traits too far to the point of making her come off as obnoxious or a bitch. Plus, while she does eventually fall in love with Shinobu, she still keeps her self-sufficient, independent personality, taking charge of her own fate. She's an intriguing, three-dimensional character with plenty of strengths, weaknesses, and perfectly carries the movie, something which is sorely needed in the anime industry as of right now. The other characters, on the other hand, aren't as lucky in this department. They're all decent enough, and I love the whole ensemble, but because the movie rushes through everything, they don't get fleshed out like Benio does, so every scene they're in lacks emotional impact. Shinobu in particular comes off as way too perfect. His patience for Benio is saintly, he's always nice and kind, never pressures Benio into doing anything she doesn't want to, supports her in everything, and there isn't a bad bone in his body. Now, don't get me wrong, normally I love these kinds of characters, and considering that most shoujo manga/anime tend to give those kinds of characters the shaft in favor of portraying people who IRL would be considered domestic abusers in a romantic, sympathetic light, we need more characters like Shinobu. But the problem with him here is that he doesn't have any flaws. You can't make a character that audiences will like if you don't give him any flaws or traits that he needs to deal with or overcome, and the only time we see him have to deal with a character flaw is at the very end, so it winds up coming way too late. Eh, maybe the next movie will rectify this. I hope it does, because as much as I like Shinobu, you can't deny that he's rather vanilla and too perfect for his own good. 
 
But none of these things detract from my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. Many scenes had me on the floor laughing a lot of the time, and in a really good way. The animation is luscious, the music is great, I love all the characters despite the movie being unable to develop them and flesh them out, and I'm really excited to see the next movie. I guess all of the movie's problems can be attributed to its format: Movies are typically better suited for standalone stories, and trying to cram 10 volumes of manga into two movies won't yield very good results if you want to tell a whole story. Scenes have to be cut out and you have to compress other parts in order to tell the story you want to tell. As far as Haikara-san is concerned, despite its initial missteps, I think the producers did extremely well with what they had and did the best they could to do what they needed to do here. It's a sweet, heartwarming romantic comedy that's sure to get a laugh out of you and take you to a time long past. 
 
All in all, while made missteps in its presentation, Haikara-san part one is definitely one of the better romances I've seen this year, and I normally tend to dislike romance. Now to (impatiently)eagerly wait for the next movie to come out on Blu-Ray!

3,2406,6,16.01967581,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Sazae-san,"The main character is a mother named Sazae-san. She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to ""The Partridge Family"" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like ""Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost"". Such ""boring"" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered ""acceptable"" by adults.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","In the beginning, Sazae was more interested in being with her horse than dressing up in kimono and makeup to attract her future husband. Hasegawa was forward-thinking in that, in her words, the Isono/Fuguta clan would embody the image of the modern Japanese family after World War II.
Sazae was a very liberated woman, and many of the early plotlines revolved around Sazae bossing around her husband, to the consternation of her neighbors, who believed that a man should be the head of his household. Later, Sazae became a feminist and was involved in many comical situations regarding her affiliation with her local women's lib group.
Despite the topical nature of the series, the core of the stories revolved around the large family dynamic, and were presented in a lighthearted, easy fashion. In fact, the final comic, in 1974, revolved around Sazae's happiness that an egg she cracked for her husband's breakfast produced a double yolk, with Katsuo remarking about the happiness the ""little things"" in life can bring.
In current culture, the popular Sazae-san anime is frequently viewed as a nostalgic representation of traditional Japanese society, since it represents a simpler time before many of the changes brought by modern technology. Its social themes, though very liberal at the time of its publication, are evocative of a bygone and nostalgic era.","Why is a long-running show that is this popular in Japan, ranked 5919 ? 
I mean, most, if not all of the Japanese population knows Sazae-san, and likes it. (the same goes for Doraemon, Chibimaruko-chan, etc.) 
 
The answer is simple: this is a slice of life-comedy show made for Japanese people, not for Americans, or French people. 
 
In a sense, it is the Japanese version of the Simpsons. But the genre of comedy is different, and unlike the Simpsons, it needs Japanese cultural knowledge to understand, and it isn't oversaturated at all. 
 
Note: Sazae-san first started as a crappy show, much like all other 1970's animes. 
 
Conclusion: Don't watch Sazae-san if you're not Japanese, and either way watch the newer episodes. 
 
 
Story: 8/10 This is a show with no or little coninuity... but all the anecdotes are quite fun to watch, as a Japanese person. 
Character: Most of the characters are 1970's Japanese stereotypes, that have been commically amplified, but only a little. They aren't that unique, but their characteristics are well executed. 
Art: 7/10 The newer Sazae-san episodes' art isn't bad, it's unique, and it does what it needs to do. Before, it kind of looked crappy. 
Enjoyment: This really depends on whether you get ""it"" or not. If you do, you'll be pleased by this show, if not... well you won't enjoy it. I gave it a 9/10, but that's as a Japanese person.

          
 
       Helpful In the evening of October 5, 1969 I remembered tuning in to watch a show that had caught my attention. Its opening seemed funny and relaxing, similar to the shows of that time back when I used to live in Japan. I was about 12 at that time, my siblings and I would fight for what to watch (funny considering the limited options we had). After the 1st episode had concluded my siblings and I had some funny stupid looks in our faces. The show had become pretty close to us due to its relevance in our lives and its funny stories. We would tune in every single Sunday just to watch it. I will always remember the day our mother began to watch Sazae-san with us, she found it quite funny while our father had found it ""stupid"". This show was the perfect way to end a stressful Sunday evening, all of our family sitting in front watching Sazae-san. All of us knew that this unity would not last for ever. Our older sibling became tired of watching the same ""repetable"" stories and would deny to join us. He eventually moved out of the house and started a family of his own. The same happened for me and our younger brother. I had moved to the U.S. with the help of some friends in 1982. Traveling to Japan had become expensive for me, so I stopped visiting them during important holidays. After a lengthy time I had decided to finally visit my family. I was in tears after seeing my parents and siblings three days before shogatsu. After shogatsu I had found out that Sazae-san was still airing. An immense amount of nostalgia came to me as I was watching this old show along with my family and my kids. The feeling of unity had become stronger than ever, the laughs we had, the cheers we houled, and the tears we shared. This show will always hold a special place in the heart of my family.

This anime makes me see one color: RED! Just like the Nintendo Virtua Boy. There are worse made anime on a technical level, but this is for me the most rage inducing anime in existence. It pushes ALL of my buttons at once and does it again and again with infuriating glee! It is a historical fiction featuring: terrible understanding of history, military strategy, logistics, and anything that makes historical fiction interesting. It also is the most insanely nationalistic, militaristic, and virulently racist series to possibly ever exist. This is like a horribly written cartoon version of the Turner Diaries! Japan takes over the world and enslaves or kills all non-Japanese, which we the audience are supposed to cheer and possibly jerk off to! What I am about to describe is in my opinion the single worst anime of all time!  
 
Plot: 1/10 
 
In 1943, Isoroku Yamamoto is shot down and with no explanation ends up in the early 1900s just after the Russo-Japanese war concludes with the battle of Tsushima. Yamamoto despite being educated entirely in military strategy and having no knowledge of engineering is able to describe exactly how to built nuclear submarines, jet fighters, and other bits of advanced technology to 1910 Japan! By the time 1941 comes, Japan invades and beats the shit out of the United States. However, they don't actually invade the US. After destroying the US naval fleet and bombing Los Alamos, the president Hank Roosevelt (names are slightly changed for no reason) has a stroke and the US surrenders to Japanese domination of the US mainland. The overwhelming logistical superiority of the US and the fact America could crank out 15 ships and 20 planes for every ship and plane Japan could produce is simply ignored. The US was simply THAT dependent on the Manhattan Project to win the war. In reality, the US didn't need the Manhattan Project at all. It saved the lives of 100,000 more US soldiers, but it was in no way needed for victory. The primary reason we even used nukes was the threaten the Soviets and assert our global dominance. After beating the US, Japan conquers most of the world and eventually beats the shit out of Nazi Germany, who by 1943 had conquered the Eurasian continent! Japan allows Nazi Germany to keep all of Europe and Russia though, apart from a small chunk of Siberia where Japan ""nobly"" allows the last remaining Jews and Russians to live in a frozen internment camp! How did Japan beat Germany? By taking over Nazi controlled England of course! Let me fucking repeat that. GERMANY surrenders because Japan retook England! The anime ends in a celebratory manner with Japan ruling the vast majority of the globe and preaching about the superiority of the Yamato race. 
 
I can't even begin to describe all that is wrong with this anime. Consider that despite the nuclear submarines and improved aircraft carriers, Japan crushes Germany in a land war despite showing no drastic improvements in Japanese land war technology.  For anyone who as glanced at WW2 history, Japan SUCKED at land war when they weren't fighting 3rd world countries like 1930s-1940s China and Korea. The US ran up a 10:1 kill ratio EVERY TIME we fought the Japanese on land. Japan ""won"" the battle of Wake Island by suffering a roughly 27:1 ratio loss. The Soviets ran up a 9:1 kill ratio during 1945 in August Storm. The Soviets were NOT known for caring about kill ratio. If they run up a 9:1 against you then you SUCK! The Germans and Germany's allies like the Finns would have had a nearly 50:1 kill ratio against Japan. They would literally have to create a new word because slaughter wouldn't begin to describe the savage beating the Japanese army would take! It would be exactly like the Nazi vampires vs. London civilians in fucking Hellsing! This is a story where logic, logistics, and things of that nature simply die. It is all about ""rule of cool"" and wunderweapons. That is totally what wins wars! 
 
Overview: 1/10 
 
I gave this series a 1 because I couldn't give it zero. If you don't want to be angered to the point of foaming at the mouth and contemplating murder against the production staff do NOT watch this abominable piece of shit! I simply can't stress this enough!

Gattai Movie!!,"This double feature comprises of Gunbuster and Die Buster (aka Gunbuster 2) condensed into a single theatrical release told in two parts with a musical intermission in between. The first part, Gunbuster the Movie, condenses the six episodes of the original OVA into a 95-minute movie featuring a new 5.1 audio remix and a redub by the original Japanese cast. The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Top o Nerae 2! Diebuster follows the story of Nono, a country girl who dreams of becoming a space pilot (or, to be more precise, ""like Nonoriri"", the meaning of which is revealed as the series progresses) who, due to a chance encounter with an actual space pilot, finds herself becoming part of the elite Fraternity. Made up of teenage pilots called Topless, and armed with quasi-humanoid weapons called Buster Machines, the Fraternity's mission is to protect the people of the Solar System from attack by swarms of space monsters.
The series revolves around Nono's quest to become like Nonoriri, her relationship with Lal'C Mellk Mal, the first Topless she meets whom she immediately idolizes (to the point of calling her onee-sama, or big sister), and the hard work she believes she has to do to be ""worthy"" of Lal'C's attention. It also explores her interactions with the rest of the Idols, her efforts to fit in and, ultimately, the truth to her forgotten past.
After dealing with swarms of space monsters, and the personal conflicts of the Topless themselves, the empire discovers a threat of a real space monster when the Serpentine Sisters attempt to awaken something they call ""an eternal Topless"", which could destroy the space monsters for them and provide them with a way to keep from ever losing their Topless power. This so-called ""Topless"" is actually a true space monster, as Lal'C learns when she witnesses its vicious attacks against her comrades and, horrified, asks Dix-Neuf (her Buster Machine) what this creature might be. The fact that the monsters Topless had been battling up to this point were merely first-generation alternate Buster Machines, used to protect the human race from true space monsters in earlier generations as a Solar Defense Force, is also revealed.
During these events, Nono's potent powers as Buster Machine no. 7 awaken, she and the Topless do battle with the real space monster and are victorious. Nearing the end of the story, they encounter the last of the space monsters carrying a black hole and utilizing it as an energy source to warp from system to system. The empire plans to use Nono's Buster Machine powers and the artificial Buster Machines to destroy the final Space Monster. However, Lal'C and the Fraternity find themselves useless during this time, and one of the Topless is permanently put out of commission when he has finally reached his age. Nono attempts to hold back the monster, but to no avail. Lal'C then brings Jupiter 2 out of orbit and seems to summon it the way she summons Dix-Neuf, causing it to crash directly into the monster - which shows no signs of damage.
The Space Monster warps closer to earth, and Nono suddenly departs with the Solar Defence Force, seemingly vanishing from the system. The empire decides to use Earth as a weapon to destroy the final Space Monster to ensure their survival. Meanwhile, Lal'C, for the first time, delves into Nono's past; how she learned to idolize ""Nonoriri"" and the man who found her in the depths of Space. She and the remainder of the Topless prepare for the Space Monster's arrival and the timely intervention of Nono, who now becomes the mega android DieBuster. However, frustrated with Nono's departure, Lal'C batters ""DieBuster"" in a fit of rage. Just as she is about to land a finishing blow using Douze-Mille's reformed components as a Buster Machine, her Topless powers suddenly expire. ""DieBuster"" attempts to attack the Space Monster, with no effect. However, the monster vaporizes ""DieBuster's"" hands. Dix-Neuf moves on his own to help Lal'C access the true cockpit in his brain, activating his true form, and coaxes Nono to come out of the disintegrating ""DieBuster"" and fight with her. With the two girls together once more, and Dix-Neuf's new powers, they defeat the final Space Monster with a Double Inazuma Kick.
However, in the wake of their battle, the Black hole tears open due to the Space Monster's death. Nono and Lal'C share one last moment together, their hopes, dreams and futures if they had survived, and Nono finally gives Lal'C a piece of her generator, or singularity, in the form of an origami crane, before using the remnants of the Alternate Buster Machines that comprised ""DieBuster"" to warp the black hole and herself away from earth. Dix-Neuf saves Lal'C, and brings her back to civilization, where she weeps at the loss of Nono.
Ten years later, Lal'C becomes an environmentalist and her Topless comrades have moved on from their previous life. She stays on a hilltop in the Okinawan coast line, musing about Nono before the city's lights shut off. She stares in the starry sky, and it is revealed all along that Nono and Lal'C's timeline is the setting of the last episode of the first Gunbuster OVA, as explicitly said by Lal'C when she first muses about Nono. Its two pilots, Noriko and Kazumi, descend from the remnants of the first ever Buster Machine, and Lal'C vows to tell Noriko about Nono's life and her sacrifice.","Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.  
 
Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct here.   
 
Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort. With all the cutting they had to do, scenes jump around a bit more than they should. The brunt of the action's there, but the development to that action, and especially the reasoning for that action suffers in the movies. 
  
But please do try the original series!  They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.  Come back for these compilation movies only if you get the urge to rewatch both of these underground gems.

3,21267,10,14.76494797,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Go! Go! 575,"Go! Go! 575 adapts the Project 575 games for PlayStation Vita and iOS, which allow anyone to create songs using the traditional Japanese 5-7-5-syllable meter found in haiku and tanka poems. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Slice of Life'],none,"As part of their promotion campaign of ""Go! Go! 575"", Sega decided to create a mini-anime based on said title. With a fairly small budget, they managed to release 4 episodes, each lasting 3 minutes. It is quite understandable if you wouldn't want to call this an anime, but more of a series of commercials. The biggest downside is what it actually could've been, instead of what it is right now. 
 
""Go! Go! 575"" tells the story about 2 girls (later joined by a third) who want to sing songs based on haiku poems, and share them with the world. And that's it, really. After all, there's not much you can tell in 12 minutes worth of screentime. 
 
The main characters, Matcha and Azuki, are what you could refer to as ""your typical high school characters"". Matcha is the focused and composed type, whereas Azuki's the over-energetic childish type. Having characters like them together is like a yin-yang combination, meaning a nice balance while keeping the anime fresh. The third character, Yuzu, can be considered as even more average than the two, but there really isn't enough footage to define her. 
 
The art, even for a short anime like this one, was good. It wasn't anything special, but it was nice to look at, and didn't feel lacking in the slightest. The music, namely the OP and song in the last episode, were good as well, along with the background music. It was everything you'd expect to hear in a regular anime, except of course that it wasn't in a regular anime. 
 
To go back on the downside I stated earlier: This anime could've been something. The plot, simple as it is, could've been built on to produce a decent music (idol-like) anime. The characters were fun and quite enjoyable, and memorable if they had more screentime to work with. Heck, even the third character would've been far more fun to see, as she reminds me of Chizuru from Yuru Yuri in terms of personality. Even the artstyle and music were pretty great, even if the entire anime was only meant to promote the game. 
 
If you have 12 minutes to spend, go and give it a shot, and see if you share the same view as me. As a SoL comedy fan, I would've loved a full-fledged version of this anime. But alas, it was not meant to be. If only this project had gotten more attention, this would've been a nice addition to the winter season. If only.

       Helpful Story: Go! Go! 575 is about three young girls called Matcha Kobayashi, (Ayaka Ohashi) Azuki Masaoka, (Yuka Ootsubo) and Yuzu Yosano. (Minako Kotobuki) They have fun at a normal, every day setting, with a bath scene almost every episode. To be honest, the story ceases to exist, but I just tried my best to sum the whole series up in a few words.

Sound 
 
OST - There isn't really much of an OST in this anime, so I'll leave this blank. 
Opening - The opening was quite a catchy song indeed. 30 seconds is less than enough. 
Ending - This is one of the only anime where it doesn't have an ending song, so I'll also leave this blank. 
Voice Acting - You don't want unnecessarily high voices where they sound like 10-year-olds on helium? Well, this is the anime for you. It had great voice acting. Each character sounded different towards each other and each voice matched their personality. The voice actors were perfect for this anime.

Character: Matcha is a calm woman who's just there to please Azuki. Azuki is a happy-go-lucky person who is afraid of kites. And Yuzu? She's a Yuri fangirl! She ships Mazuki!

Enjoyment: Although you can finish this anime in less than an hour, I still like it none the less. I think it's an anime that can be enjoyable for everyone.

One day, after applying for a job in hopes of escaping his secluded lifestyle, he is kidnapped and transported to the Eldant Empire―a fantasy world filled with elves, dragons, and dwarves. Trapped in this strange land, Shinichi is given an unlikely task by the Japanese government: to spread otaku culture across the realm by becoming an ""Otaku Missionary."" 
 
To accomplish his mission, Shinichi has the full support of the Japanese government, as well as the half-elf maid Myucel and Princess Petralka of the Eldant Empire. Together with this ragtag bunch, he will overcome the obstacles of politics, social classes, and ethnic discrimination to promote the ways of the otaku in this holy land. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Fantasy']","Shinichi Kanou is a young secluded otaku who is offered a job thanks to his vast knowledge of anime, manga, and video games.  However, just after meeting his new employer, he is kidnapped, awakening in an alternate world with a fantasy setup. Shinichi is then informed that he was in fact selected by the Japanese government to help improve his country's relations with this new world by establishing a company to spread the unique products of the Japanese anime culture to this new, unexplored market.
","Comedy is, usually, a hit or miss genre for many people. Since there are several different styles of comedy, and several different opinions on exactly which style is the most humorous. Comedy in anime, from what I’ve experienced, usually falls into one of three styles: The slapstick style of comedy, where the humor comes from the clumsy and or stupid decisions and actions made by the characters, the more sarcastic and witty style of comedy, where the humor comes from the characters wit and sharp tongues, and will probably feature a decent amount sarcasm, and, finally, the parody style of comedy, which derives its humor from the many references it makes. Usually, those references refer to other anime. Outbreak Company uses the parody style of comedy, a style of comedy that I can’t say I’ve ever been the biggest fan of. Was Outbreak Company’s comedy spot on, or did it just miss the mark? 
 
Story:  
 
The story revolves around the Shinichi Kanou, a hikkikomori (or shut in) and otaku who, after a period of deep reclusion, has decided to get a get job. After acing an online test, and performing well in his follow up interview, Shinichi was offered a job. Right after accepting the job offer, he is drugged and wakes in an unfamiliar room. He discovers that he’s been transported to an alternate dimension, to new world, by the Japanese government. He has been hired as an ambassador to the Holy Eldant Empire, a kingdom in this new world. His mission is to bring otaku culture, anime, manga, etc., to the Holy Eldant Empire in order to strengthen its relationship with Japan. 
 
As mentioned earlier, this story is a parody comedy series, and it makes several references to other anime, manga, and other things in otaku culture. The series also pokes fun of, and pays homage to, several anime tropes. These references are not only funny, but they manage to always keep the series interesting. I not only enjoyed the references that Outbreak Company made in its dialogue, but I also liked the more subtle references, such as posters and figures of some of my favorite characters in the background. 
 
While this is a comedy series, it actually does have a pretty interesting narrative that touches on several different themes. The story addresses issues like racism, classism, and politics, which makes it that much more entertaining to watch. 
 
Unfortunately, the story doesn’t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While there is an “ending” it still leaves some things unsaid, and some questions unanswered. And the last couple of episodes did feel a little rushed, as they tried to kick the story into high gear. 
 
Animation:  
 
Outbreak Company’s animation was really well done, with well-defined characters and good-looking background scenery. There are some scenes, specifically some action scenes, that I would’ve liked to actually see the actions taking place, but they decided to just use a shaky background image instead of actually animating it. While the animation isn’t great, it’s definitely good, quality animation. 
 
Characters: 
 
While Shinichi Kanou is the star of Outbreak Company, the series does feature two other main characters, Myucel Foaran, Shinichi’s maid, Petralka Anne Eldante III, the empress of the Holy Eldant Empire, as well as several other supporting characters. Most of the characters in this series suffer from a lack of a proper background story and development, including our main characters. The amount of information we get about each of the characters varies. While some characters will have a fairly detailed backstory, others’ backstories will be only briefly mentioned and explored, if they are ever mentioned at all. Also, while there are some characters that do develop over the course of the series, others tend to either stay the same, or change very little. 
 
With all of that being said, all of the characters are very likeable and enjoyable to watch. The character’s interactions with one another are also entertaining. The relationships between the characters do have a decent amount of development, and it was entertaining to see how each of the character’s relationships changed over the course of the series. 
 
Sound: 
 
Outbreak Company’s soundtrack (OST) is large and varied. It features several orchestral sounding songs, some that are more epic and grand, and others that are more peaceful. The OST also features songs from other genres, from folk sounding pieces to march. It has a good balance of fast and slower paced songs, as well as a good balance between songs that are more grand and complex, and other songs that were incredibly simple. There are also some songs in the OST that are just, for lack of a better word, quirky, but very catchy at the same time. While watching this series the OST can get buried, and you might not even notice how many songs the OST actually has. This isn’t helped by the fact that there are plenty of songs in the OST that sound very similar to one another. But, all in all, Outbreak Company has a very good OST. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I had a really fun time watching Outbreak Company. Everything from the funny and interesting references, to poking fun at anime tropes, to the very likeable characters made this series entertaining to watch.

Outbreak Company is a very entreating series, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of anime and or otaku culture.

          
 
       Helpful Militaristic war can be a deadly thing with the loss of countless lives in the dominance over territory. However there is a kind of warfare that can be even deadlier when used over a period of time but yet doesn't take a single life. Cultural warfare. 
 
The story of Outbreak Company is japan introducing the culture of the ""otaku"" to a new world they found the portal to one day. Their many efforts had failed as the many managers lacked an immerse knowledge of the ""otaku"" way. So the hired a shut in with a life completely dedicated to manga and anime in hopes to reap a large profit from spawning a Japanese entertainment industry to this new, under developed world they've stumbled across. A very straight forward story with the occasional twist that keeps things interesting and never lacking in entertainment. 
 
Styles for scenery and background are astounding with detail that really capture the environment of a medieval style timeline. However for characters and other minor animated objects, the lack of detail with facial expressions when put at any distance, is very disappointing. even the use of cell shading is limited on things. 
 
Sounds for the use of magic are something to be credited for as they are well used and each spell has a very different sound to it. as for background music, its mostly either very faint or blends in to the scene so well you hardly notice it except for lewd/fan service scenes where the music is in your face to the point where the beat of it can ruin the humor value. 
 
Characters are played out and portrayed decent for the most part but as for back stories, not much at all is explained for anyone other than the single main character. Light topics of explanation are occasionally told but only in scattered spots throughout the 13 episodes and nothing really gives you a clear idea of how from there did they get to where they are today. Other than back stories, the play out of each character bar a few, was well thought out as everyone had their deeper purpose and some didn't find theirs until after other sinister ones were revealed. 
 
Enjoyment factor was, on a personal note, quite high for myself as the references to countless other anime and Japanese idols are so high I would almost think it impossible to count them all. It was played out perhaps too quickly in some parts but its the lesser parts are skimmed over as needed. Many times the main character see's himself as an anime's main protagonist due to all his years of being an otaku shut in, and tends to relate a lot of his experiences with moments from his excessive manga database. 


          
 
       Helpful This review is in parts. Part 1 With no spoilers. Part 2 With short and deeper look at the story - spoilers  - reader discretion is advised. 
 
Part 1.  
I wish more anime series would be like this. This is one of the balanced ones. I mean, not too much sexistic scenes (Ecchi), not too much weird scenes, its showing how it really was in times of king, knights, princesses etc. (Offcourse things like dragons, birds used to be horses werent in medieval times, but that is minor (i think)). One aspect I like about this anime is showing a real otaku culture (half of it), a lot of references to games and other animes. And when i say: a lot of, I really mean a huge amount of refenences (at least two in every episode). One aspect i didnt like about it is, the main point of this anime is revealed like nearly at the end, but I have to say in some ways its original (never saw something like that). Would I recommend it? Yes! Some viewers will like it some viewers will just watch it, say something about characters that are kawaii and go watch another anime. So yeah, watch it if you want... 
 
Part 2. As I mentioned earlier this will take a short look at the story. 
 
So, main character is taken, throught an magical portal, to the magical medieval world where he is tasked to popularize otaku culture, as it looks from outside. But from inside, Japan goverment have something other in their minds, but i dont want to spoil that, only thing I convinced myself to say, as I said in Part 1, is it will be revealed at the end. So our character Shinichi was met with circumstances, in other words, what he have to do. By his side is an maid Myucel (aaah so cute.... i meant KAWAII) what will do everything he want, but she started to be addicted on him, something like she felt in love with him buuuut there will not be any kiss (yes gents, there is no kiss... goddamn!!!). Some scenes are funny, some scenes are something between funny and normal (not too bad actually) and there is not much action sequences. There are a lots of good ideas, like: build a school where Chinichi and others will teach that enthusiastic elves, dwarfs, ware wolfs and humans  of Otaku culture. Soccer between elves and dwarfs etc... There is so much thing that makes this anime so good.                If you made it throught my english to this point... Thanks. But.... there is two goddamn things that wont let Chinichi get laid with girls: 1. That barely teen Majesty Petralka, and, 2. Circumstances...

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Steel Angel Kurumi 1: The story follows a young boy named Nakahito Kagura. He is pushed by a group of his classmates to go into a house that is rumored to belong to a mad scientist. While inside, he comes across in what seems to be a lifelike doll. At the same time, the Japanese Army carries out an attack on the house. During the attack the ""doll"" falls over and Nakahito accidentally kisses it, causing it to awaken.

After watching these episodes, you should come to a conclusion this is basically a fan service for all the Steel Angel Kurumi fans. They put more emphasis on the supportive characters, Saki, Karinka and all the other Steel Angels.  
 
And when i mean all the other steel angels, I MEAN all the other steel angels. The last  episode involves all the angels in a contest to win Nakahito's heart.  
 
The sound is standard SAK quality and the 5.1 surround is second to none. The japanese voices are your usual chibi-style voices but my favorite is the English dubbing of the show. The english voices are still chibi-esqe but they have a much bigger emotional range towards everything (i.e. Happy Karinka or angry Karinka) 
 
The Writer/Director Steven Foster (Ugly Yet Beautiful, Gilgamesh, etc.) Really does a bang up job for the entire Steel Angel Kurumi Series. Theres nothing funnier than a foul mouthed Karinka.  
 
If you Enjoyed the great story and antics of the first season and want to see more stories of your favorite angel, go ahead and get this ASAP. BUT if this is your first foray into the Steel Angel Universe, GO RIGHT AHEAD! theres no continuity issues at all (although the reccomendation is to watch this after S1 and before S2).  
 
ENJOY!

          
 
       Helpful They're back, and they've returned to their old ways. Kurumi remains the faithful servant of Nakahito, doing anything and everything it takes to please him. Saki's still in love with her sister for all the wrong reasons, and Karinka is just as bratty as ever. Steel Angel Kurumi Encore is a direct continuation of where Steel Angel Kurumi leaves off, so it's obviously catered to people who watched and enjoyed Steel Angel Kurumi and who crave for their next fix of Steel Angel cuteness. With that said, you'll probably want to sit through the first season of Steel Angel Kurumi before jumping into Encore, but to be honest it doesn't really make too much of a difference. While Steel Angel Kurumi Encore does indeed pick up where Steel Angel Kurumi left off, it doesn't really spoil the events of the first season much--if at all. Encore almost feels like a spin-off, where characters are put in situations that you would never expect to see while watching the first season, and in a way that's exactly what it is. None of the characters seem to have matured very much considering what just happened at the end of the first season, and everyone seems to have settled into their old grooves rather easily. Encore mostly works to provide fans with some of the old playful Steel Angel Kurumi charm that dominated the first half of season one. This is what I enjoyed about Encore, because personally I wanted to see how all of the characters were doing after the ending of the first season, and apparently they're doing just fine--better than fine, really. Saki becomes a film actress in a matter of days, which has to be a first for a Steel Angel. Besides that, Kurumi and Nakahito seem to have gotten closer, and Kamihito is probably on screen more in the four short episodes of Encore than he was in the entirety of Steel Angel Kurumi. Speaking of which, Encore keeps the tradition going with each episode only being fifteen minutes in length. With only four episodes, Encore is the type of anime that you have to watch with your eyes wide open, because if you blink you'll miss it. 
 
Even though the stories in each episode were short, I enjoyed every last one of them. It was just plain fun to see all of the characters back at their typical routine of arguing with each other and pining for one another. This is what I thought Steel Angel Kurumi should be all about. Forget the storyline; this is a robot maid anime we're talking about. Just give me humorous situations and quirky characters for my enjoyment, and I won't say a word. Steel Angel Kurumi is just the kind of anime that even if you could take seriously, you don't want to take seriously. Encore helped Steel Angel Kurumi feel fun again, so in turn I was able to have fun again. Episode four--or twenty-eight, depending on how you look at it--was easily my favorite episode of Encore. It was entirely nonsensical, but it was also entirely fun to watch. Seeing a bunch of women compete for a kiss from the shy and young Nakahito was a lot more enjoyable to watch than you would think. Kurumi trying to become a traditional Japanese woman was also rather interesting. I found it funny how the most powerful Steel Angel on the planet--faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound--has a total meltdown when she tries to become a prim and proper Japanese housewife. Now I know Kurumi's limits, and I also shed a tear for Japanese housewives everywhere. Like I said before, none of the stories really felt like they could fit into the storyline of Steel Angel Kurumi, but that's part of what makes Encore worth watching. It's too bad that, with Encore being so short, it had the misfortune of ending abruptly and leaving a bad taste in my mouth because of it. I was thirsty for more Steel Angel Kurumi sweetness, but I was left high and dry. 
 
Audio and animation-wise, Encore is on the same level as Steel Angel Kurumi. The intro song is the same as before, Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle, but the ending song is a new piece called Suki-suki-suki-suKisu Shite! and is a welcomed change from the original, as it better compliments the primarily comedic subject matter of Encore. Unfortunately I was forced to stick with the Japanese audio while watching Encore because I didn't have access to the English dub. This wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't already gotten used to the English voices, but I have to admit it hindered my experience a little bit. The Japanese audio isn't bad by any means, but I still prefer the English cast over the Japanese cast. Animation in Encore is exactly the same level as Steel Angel Kurumi. Lush scenery with bright colors, and very smooth animation. Character designs also haven't changed, but it is nice to see characters wearing different outfits from time to time throughout Encore. I especially liked the old fashion dress that Saki wore while on the set of her movie. Minor adjustments here and there perhaps, but nothing really noticeable in the audio and video quality of Encore when compared to Steel Angel Kurumi. 
 
There are few animes out there that are as short and sweet as Encore is. Most short animes leave you wondering what the hell just happened, while others make you ponder as to why such an anime needed to exist in the first place. However, Encore survives as being just another installment to a popular series, and it's sure to be a welcomed addition for Kurumi fans. Steel Angel Kurumi Encore is just what the doctor ordered if you're a fan of the first twenty-four episodes of Steel Angel Kurumi. Its short length and basic comedic content make it an easy watch for even the busiest of people. It's short, sweet, and fun to watch. If you can't get enough of Kurumi's trademark squeal, Karinka's constantly running mouth, and uh'Saki's incestuous obsession with her sister, then be sure to check out Steel Angel Kurumi Encore.

However, the group's ideas become a threat to the ruling Freyjagard Empire, who promote state atheism and social Darwinist belief that only the strong nobility shall rule and the weak commoners must obey the nobles or suffer punishment. The conflict with the Empire soon leads the Seven Prodigies to create a new nation with equal rights and democracy for the people.

Based off a popular light novel of the same name Choujin Koukousei tachi wa Isekai demo yoyuu de Ikinuku you desu which is more popularly known by its English title of High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world is a fantasy-themed anime that gives us the rather unique opportunity to see what will happen, if one day a plane that carried seven of the world’s top geniuses who are all masters of their respective fields despite their young age were to one day vanish from their world and be transported to a parallel world that was suffering from the same problems and crisis that they had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. Seeing the same problems that the seven had worked so hard to deal with back in their world once more manifest itself in this new world and once more cause suffering and pain to the people of this world the seven resolved to do what must be done to save the people from this world and in doing so transcend from being mere geniuses to saviours of a world as they make use of their collected intellect and use wisdom and technology to bring down an oppressive regime and in doing so deliver to the people a world where everyone is free and can perform whatever role that they so desire. A country where it’s the people that decide on where the country should be heading and not the arrogant lords and emperors that sit on the throne.  
 
Fantasy-themed series within the anime industry can be said to be one of the most popular ones within it due to the ease of which worlds can be fashioned and expanded upon by its creators and this is even more so within the vaunted Isekai genre that had experienced a massive surge in popularity in recent years. While the concept of Isekai itself is pretty standard as settings go what served to differentiate High school prodigies in my eyes and what served to draw my eye to it was the fact that unlike the standard series that made use of only one mc that was transported to the parallel world in the case of High school prodigies there are seven of them all of which had unique skills, quirks and personalities that made them all unique. In addition unlike most common Isekai series that tend to have overall goals that centre on individual matters that focus on the individual struggles of its characters High schools is the exception in that its cast, for the most part, operate as a single entity that operates in concert with one another to go about the task of inducing change on a global scale through not just displays of physical strength but also through introduction of new tech advancements that give the people, not just a better but also a fairer and more organized society to live in but also the weapons that they need to preserve their new way of life. This combination of not just entering a parallel world but also serving to repay those that have helped them by using their unique talents to change the world and overturn the cruel and oppressive regime that rules them and replace it with one that treats its people fairly and freely was what served to draw me to the series and convince me to watch it to the very end a decision that I felt was justly rewarded here.  
 
The overall story for the series follows the life of Tsukasa Mikogami and his six friends who despite their young age and only being in high school have as a result of both their intelligence and their own unique skills in their respective fields have enabled them to not only ascend the rungs of society within their own worlds but also create many great changes within their home timeline that’s served to improve the lives of many within their world. After being mysteriously transported to parallel world that for all intents and purposes was one that appeared to be one that was within the time period known as the medieval period Tsukasa and his friends find that not only had they been transported to another world entirely but that this world while certainly beautiful and full of interesting races that are both welcoming and generous in temperament was one that was ruled by a cruel and oppressive empire who instead of treating its people with respect, kindness and equality instead treated them with cruelty and silencing any detractors with the threat of capital punishment. While finding themselves in an entirely new world was a novel experience for Tsukasa and his friends the fact that this new world was one that was ruled by the same type of regime and whose people were oppressed by the same type of people that Tsukasa and his friends had worked so hard to displace in their efforts to change their world was something that created a sense of fury within their hearts. When the empire in both its arrogance as well as in its desire to avenge its humiliation at the hands of Tsukasa and his friends who had not only defied the empire’s standing orders to help demi-humans but also go about modernising them struck out and captured one of their own to both the villagers and Tsukasa and his friends this was the last straw and served to create a catalyst that began Tsukasa and his friends journey to go about changing the world and sweep aside the trash that had ruled for far too long within this world and finally bring salvation to the people of this new world.  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Aico Incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy that despite being only of a young age is already actively serving his country as its youngest PM to date Tsukasa from initial appearances is shown to be a calm, composed and responsible person by nature and is someone that can be seen to prefer to solve problems via diplomacy rather than with action and as a result was someone that was seen to be held in high regard by both his countrymen and politicians around the world earning him the title The world’s Top Politician. However despite boasting such a formidable reputation, Tsukasa was seen to be someone that rather than being overconfident and vain in his attitude was rather the opposite in that he was a quiet person by nature that made great use of not just his intellect but also his logical nature to divine the best path forward towards his goals while taking great care to ensure that such goals were ones that were realistic a skill that few within Tsukasa’s chosen field can hope to achieve. While a quiet person and someone that can be difficult to read by others Tsukasa was someone that was seen to have two traits that served to define him as both a person and as the PM of Japan in that unlike many of his field Tsukasa was someone that had both an immense sense of responsibility to both his friends and to his allies as well as surprisingly strong sense of justice as well traits that I felt while reflecting well of his role as a leader as a country also serve to reflect the kind of person that Tsukasa really was which was someone that will do his utmost to preserve peace and protect his friends and allies while still trying his utmost to maintain his core values of justice and responsibility a struggle that I really admired about him.  
 
As the series goes on and Tsukasa’s personality is gradually expanded upon his personality gradually starts to change as a result of the events that he and his friends helped shape. In the beginning of the series Tsukasa while noted to be someone that advocated peace, understanding and cooperation through the showing of kindness towards others was someone that can be said to be rather too logical in that he often didn’t take into account the emotional bonds that can result from their actions and the potential effects that this can have on both he and his friends and the allies that he had resolved to help a matter that is brought to the head during the height of the series first arc when a dear friend of theirs was kidnapped by the empire. While certainly an uncomfortable revelation for Tsukasa it can be seen that this revelation that while logic and being realistic about situations was an excellent skill to have it will be even so if this is paired with an understanding towards the desires and wishes of the people that you wish to protect was something that served to have a profound impact on Tsukasa as a person. While still retaining his quiet nature Tsukasa after this revelation was shown to have become more understanding of the feelings and wishes of others and more willing to consult with others on their own opinions rather than going for the most logical option that he would have done so in the past.  
 
In line with Tsukasa’s incorporation of emotions and taking the feelings of others into his equations was the reveal of what can be said to be the main driving force behind Tsukasa’s true struggle within the series which is the reform of the world. As a result of both Tsukasa’s core nature as well as his beliefs in what the people of any given land should have it can be seen that Tsukasa was someone that viewed the needs and desires of a lands people to be of paramount importance and was someone that believed that any land should be one where a ruler rules with both fairness and dignity and treats his subjects with both the respect that they deserve and more importantly be given the freedom and choice to live their lives the way that they want. As a result of this Tsukasa, more than any of the seven was shown to be dismayed by the fact that rather than doing this the empire instead rules through fear and oppression terms that were anathema to Tsukasa on a fundamental level and doing well in creating the groundwork for his goal on changing this warped world. While largely borne out of his desire to pay back his allies and friends for all the help that they had provided to him it can be said that unlike the empire Tsukasa while certainly the driving force behind it was not trying to create a world that will have him as the ruler but rather in line with his beliefs was instead trying to create one where the happiness of the people through equality was the priority and one where rather than having centralised control was one where the self-determination of the people was most important which is best shown in Tsukasa’s preference to let his subordinates handle things despite having the ability to do so himself. As a character, I felt that Tsukasa was a well designed and developed character that can be said to represent the ideal image of what a politician should be like being both a fair and honest person that treated his friends and allies with respect and at the same time being both intelligent, far-sighted and cunning in equal measure adept at creating grand and multi-layered plans as well as anticipating and thwarting the enemies own plans before they can even commence. While shown to be and acknowledged by his friends to be the leader within the team it can be said that he’s also the foundation that serves to support the team and keep them honest and in line with their shared goal of helping the people of this land.   
 
Ringo Oohoshi   
 
Ringo Oohoshi portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sao and Accel world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses and one of the seven heroes that have come to this world. A teenage girl that despite her young age is widely known as one of the world’s foremost inventors on account of both Ringo’s ability to not just visualise what is needed for a given situation based on local environments and resource requirements but also her ability to create tech that’s as deadly to the enemy as it can be useful to her allies. From initial appearances, Ringo is shown to be a quiet, calm and intelligent girl who while finding it difficult to talk easily with others is shown to a friendly, kind and caring person who tries her utmost to help her friends. While certainly gifted with great intelligence Ringo is someone that is shown to have little if any arrogance unlike many of her fellows and indeed is someone that works hard and tries to be useful to both her friends and allies something that is aided greatly by her ability to plan ahead. As a character Ringo through easy to overlook is someone that can be said to be just as important as any of her fellow geniuses for it is her intelligence that enabled not just Tsukasa and his fellow geniuses but also the members of the territories that they liberate to not just enjoy a higher quality of life but also have the means to not only defend themselves from aggressors but also fight them on close to even terms. Whether it’s the metal tools that enabled the villagers to farm more effectively, the power stations that served to give them their first taste of what comfort actually is, the rail gun and shields that enabled the villagers to storm the local lords castle to save their friend or the defence's that warded off Gustav’s assault it is to Ringo’s intelligence and her strong desire to help that the seven was so successful in their move to liberate and change the world.  
 
While each of the seven can be said to have been affected by the charisma that Tsukasa exhibits in his personality it can be said that of them Ringo is perhaps the one that was most affected by this as to Ringo Tsukasa while a very dear friend and ally is also someone that Ringo views as her savior due to the impact that his help provided her when her family situation got complicated when she was in high school. This while keeping her from developing standard levels of depression as can be expected from such dramas also served to allow Ringo to realise that there are many others throughout the world that require the unique skills that she has managed to gain in order to improve their lives a motivation that went on to become her sole source of motivation of wanting to help others no matter the task and requirement assigned. Arguably one of the more prominent traits of Ringo is no doubt her own creation which her AI Bearrabbit. While itself an excellent showcase of Ringo’s skills as an inventor Bearrabbit also provided an opportunity for the reveal of Ringo’s own inner feelings as unlike Ringo it was not restricted in its display of emotions and feelings something that I felt added a small window that allowed us to see the kind of feelings that she may be feeling as a result of events happening around her.  
 
Aoi  
 
Aoi Ichijou portrayed by new seiyuu Sayaka Kaneko is one of the main characters of the series and one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses that have come to save the new world in which they find themselves in. A teenage girl that despite her young age is shown to possess both the skill and figure of a veteran athlete but unlike standard athlete’s Aoi’s talent is something that is not used in competitions of prestige but rather on a field that requires all of her skills and reflexes that will enable her to triumph over her opponents this field being no other than a battlefield. For unlike normal athletes Aoi’s genius lay in her ability as a swordswoman and is rightly famed worldwide for her skill with the blade that can allow her to take on entire platoons at a time when needed. However, beneath these claims from initial appearances, Aoi is seen to be a girl that’s kind, positive, friendly and loyal to both her friends and to those that have earned her trust. While shown to be extremely skilled with the sword Aoi was also shown to be someone that can be said to have both the attitude and beliefs of the ancient samurai both in terms of her strong sense of honor and her strong sense of justice and was a strong believer in the fact that no matter how powerful one is their first responsibility is to protect the innocent from harm traits that I felt really suited Aoi. As a character, while Aoi is less skilled in leadership and planning that Tsukasa or at inventing tech as Ringo was Aoi was someone that was shown to be the perfect defender as her skill with the sword while considerable was also paired with Aoi’s strong desire to protect the innocent a combination that proved not just to be a potent one but also proved to be a perfect counter to the first serious threat that the seven faced within the world. At the same time with regards to Aoi, I was also particularly impressed by Aoi’s rather unique way of speaking as she makes use of a very formal method of speaking that I felt paired well with her focus as a swordswoman that’s based off the ancient Samurai.  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi portrayed by new seiyuu Natsumi Hioka is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the seven geniuses that came to this world with Tsukasa to save it. A teenage girl who despite her young age is known widely among the world not just for her cute catchphrases but also for her prowess as a journalist for Shinobu is known throughout the world as the world’s top journalist that’s capable of gathering info on any subject and target within the world due to both her skills as a reporter as well as her ability to seemingly materialise out of nowhere to provide both timely info and advice an ability reminiscent of the ancient shinobi something that I felt matched well with Shinobu given her skill set. From her initial appearances, Shinobu is seen to be a positive, curious and surprisingly energetic person that’s shown to have boundless levels of energy and approaches her role as a spy/journalist with great enthusiasm. While most people that are transported to a parallel world may be dazed somewhat by the unique circumstances to which they find themselves in Shinobu was not just able to take things in stride but also be able to assume her new role as a spy in this new world relatively quickly showing not just her fast-thinking nature but also her confidence in her own skills for she was able to easily convert them to suit her newfound station.  
 
While her positive and often overly enthusiastic approach to her work may give the impression that she was a rash person it can be seen that rather the opposite is true for Shinobu was someone that was not just intelligent but also a calm and perceptive person that was well versed at not just determining the best sources of intel within a given area or situation but also able to perceive minute irregularities within an area as shown during her infiltration of Gustav’s home territory. While the members of the seven can be said to be one that operates as a unit Shinobu true to her mannerisms as a shinobi was someone that was seen to prefer to operate solo when on the field not because she was averse to being with the others but because she determined that by being alone she was able to get more things done faster while still remaining a potent source of info for her friends a result that is shown well within the series in the amount of detailed info that she was able to provide the team that allowed them to neutralise many of the enemy’s attacks. As a character, I felt that Shinobu was an interesting one as while her role as a journalist/shinobi was one that presented her with arguably the most danger she was able to not just take these in stride by masking it with her positive and teasing nature but also help secure many notable victories that aided her fellows. This contrast between her base nature and her vital but dangerous role within the story I felt suited her perfectly and served to make her one of my favourites.  
 
AMV  
 
In terms of animation, I felt that the individual character designs for both the seven and the people that they encountered within the new world were both well designed and showed some great variety. While the designs for the seven did well to reflect their chosen fields within their former world the character designs for the people reflected not just their social class but also their relationships with the rulers of the world on a social level. However while effective at their given role I felt that the main highlight of the series animation was on the tech advancement that the seven embarked on within the series with it doing particularly well in showing the various advancements that have been introduced whether they were advanced tools that aided the people in their lives or weapons tech that allowed the people to defend their newfound freedom from the nobility. In terms of locations and terrain variety while the series did feature a good mix of locations in which the seven began their social uprising that was paired with some unique quirks with notable examples being the lords castle that represented both oppression and retribution and Gustav’s town that represented false promises  I felt that the locations featured were rather too standard and I felt that a greater variety of locations could have been used that would have allowed more expansion into the world’s social class. In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hajimete no Kakumei that was performed by Dialogue and Dear my distance by the popular up and coming seiyuu singer Akari Kitou. The former I felt gave the impression of both an unforgettable adventure to a new world with friends that will not only allow them to meet dangerous beasts but also encounter the same conditions in which all of them trained so hard to help eliminate as well as an opportunity to not just save but also help change the very social fabric of the new world by working together with not just themselves but with their newfound allies as well. In the case of the latter, I felt that in terms of feelings it provoked one of both finalities and of bonds that have been both formed and strengthened as a result of the adventures that had been shared together.  
 
In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. While this series like most animes these days featured a core cast of both veterans and new seiyuu’s I felt that due to the character roles within the series that many of the new faces were not just given an excellent opportunity to show the rewards of their labours but also get the opportunity to learn from the many veterans within the cast. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi, Rina Hidaka, Sayaka Kaneko, and Natsumi Hioka all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Tsukasa, Ringo, Aoi and Shinobu respectively. Natsumi’s portrayal of Shinobu in particular I felt deserve special praise as I felt that her unique voice paired especially well with Shinobu’s ninja and cat-like mannerisms.  
 
Overall conclusion  
 
In overall High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the more interesting anime’s that aired this season. Its main strong points, in my opinion, was its unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed core cast, excellent voice acting and its focus on using multi-vector strategies so as to deal with the trials that the team comes across within the series.  
 
The overall story and premise of the series in my opinion was one of the main highlights of the series and was one that I felt made excellent use of both the Isekai genre as a whole as well as the unique premise that comes from taking seven geniuses from the modern world and transporting them to a parallel one that was not just leagues behind them in terms of tech level but also is one that is battling the same kind of problems that the seven had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. As a genre the Isekai is perhaps one of the most popular ones within the anime industry due largely to its ease of use by both authors and animation studios but whereas the most common formula for such a series is to make use of the solo hero story type that follows the rise of a hero as they change the world with the support of their friends in the case of high schools it is different. What made High school prodigies different in my eyes was the fact that unlike its counterparts within the genre High school prodigies did not feature just one hero as its main character but rather it actually had seven people each while powerful in their own right and masters of their own respective fields were nonetheless confronted with both a task that was beyond their skills as one person but also one that required them to work with their friends in order to invoke a change that they all so wish to desire within the new world in which they find themselves in. While itself an almost impossible task I felt that the method in which the series overall story took to allow the team to instill change within the series was an excellent one that while making use of each of the seven’s unique skill sets to push back the corrupt nobility that held power within the world also did well to reflect that social advancement is not just about pushing evildoers back but also about giving the people both the power and knowledge that they have lacked to not only live their lives the way in which they desire but also have the means to defend what is precious to them as well. In this, I was particularly impressed with the fact that while Tsukasa and his friends sought to change the very social fabric of the world through both the promotion of democracy, fair rights and powerful tools and knowledge that served to improve the quality of life of its people it was done in a way that feels natural in terms of world consistently due largely to the fact that this advancement is done so via the introduction of a new religion that promotes this in the form of the seven-star faith that amusingly enough has Akatsuki as its god. While serving as an effective method in which to spread its teachings among the people of the land I felt that this also served well to show that while the seven’s skills made them formidable opponents for their enemies whether on a social, economic or military level even they cannot hope to change the world without the help of the people of this world and reinforcing the series overall theme that whether it’s the seven or their friends and allies that they are all working together to tear down the unfairness that has been plaguing this world and making it hell for those that call it home.  
 
Overall High school Prodigies I felt was an interesting anime that featured as its main strong points a unique premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting that was paired with some rather interesting themes that are rarely found within anime’s that served to make it one of the more interesting ones this season. However, I felt that its lack of an effective central villain that could match wits and intelligence with Tsukasa and the seven made the seven’s victories rather too easy with the magic knight Gustav providing an effective but brief trial for the seven to overcome while his fellow general within the empire while certainly more cunning and intelligent than Gustav was appeared too late within the series to have much of an impact on the overall story . At the same time while the seven were more or less represented equally within the series I felt that not all of them were expanded enough to make them effective characters with Akatsuki and Keine being the best examples of this. I for one would have liked to see the kind of effects that Keine a renowned doctor within the modern world would have had on the healthcare and medical infrastructure of this new world. Overall as a final score, I would say that High School prodigies easily deserve a score of 8/10.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the worst anime ever made. This also might be the worst piece of entertainment I have witnessed in 17 years of my life. Take in mind, I've seen half a season of 甜蜜暴击, I've seen Commonplace to World's Strongest (fucking today actually), I've seen School Days. Yet none of those colossal turds were as lazy, pandering, and fucking SHITE as this. This is the fucking lowest common denominator of entertainment, and if you think this is good or competent on any level I don't even want to talk to you. I would rather castrate myself with a rusty, dull butter knife than sit through this atrocious garbage again. So what makes this anime so fucking awful? ?? 
 
The premise: I'm sick and tired of Isekai. Isekai has given us some of the worst anime and content on the face of this Earth. It's given us Sword Art Online, aka Sexual Assault Online. It's given us the likes of Isekai Cheat Magician. I have nothing but pure and utter contempt for this genre. Obviously, with this piece of cancer, the premise is the SAME FUCKING THING. A group of elite highschoolers are transported to another world, and they're OP. The end. Actually, let's address that. These highschoolers are apparently ""tHe WoRlD's BeSt"". In what fucking world are the elites of the world all Japanese Highschoolers? One of them, is the world's ""Best Politician"". What the fuck does that even mean. There's no such thing as the ""best politician"". Politics is fucking subjective, you WHORES. There's always gonna be people who hate you, no matter how competent, caring, or logical you are. That's why Trump got elected, so don't fucking give me this ""Best Politician"" shit. The world’s “Best Magician” is a fucking kid. He can make the Eiffel Tower disappear with a wave of his wand. THAT’S NOT HOW MAGIC WORKS. MAGIC IS BASED ON FUCKING TRICKING THE AUDIENCE’S PERCEPTION. WHEN THERE’S FUCKING MORE THAN ONE AUDIENCE THEN THEY’LL BE SEEING THINGS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE. So he’s not a magician, but a fucking wizard? He can also make his head levitate? So let’s pretend if you were these characters, who entered another world. Would your first goal be: a. to get the fuck out of there, b. to look for clues on how you got there in the first place, or c. go around doing things for no reason and that doesn’t benefit you at all, such as making fucking mayonnaise. If you chose option c, congrats, YOU’RE FUCKING STUPID. Obviously, these characters chose just to do that. Actually, let’s address that too.  
 
The Characters: all the characters are razor thin. They’re so thin I could slice my wrist open with them. I can summarize every single one of them with less than three words and it’ll be a comprehensive description. Cat Ninja. Politician guy. Rich guy. Samurai Girl. Elf Bimbo. Furry Bimbo. Short dick. Adolf Hitler. Need I go on? Aside from not making sense at all, these characters are just boring. None of them have any personality beyond their stereotypical caricatures. There aren’t any nuances to their personality, or anything remotely interesting. They’re a bunch of walking clichés. Fuck me.  
 
The animation: the animation is garbage. There’s no real depth or anything visually appealing at all in this fucking anime. The laziness is apparent in the animation. It looks like shit! Obviously they decided to include some details for the sake of fan service, such as the Elf Bimbo’s bare nipples that are basically visible through her bra-less blouse. Yeah, didn’t that make you hard? No? Is it because it’s tame as fuck? Aside from useless fan-service, this anime has no attention to detail. All the character designs are one-dimensional, unoriginal, and boring, much like the characters themselves. The animation for the fight scenes are animated so horribly you’d swear it was done in Scratch. What else is there to say?  
 
The Writing: the writing is absolutely atrocious on all accounts. It is the most boring, lazy, stupid shit I’ve ever seen. Half the anime is just characters talking to each other, and providing exposition. If you cut those useless scenes out each episode will be less than 5 minutes long. We’re provided so much fucking information in the first episode, I thought I was gonna have a seizure. Oh wait, that’s because of the sheer fucking idiocy of this heaping pile of shit. Nevermind. The story is something that’s been done a million times, but fuck ‘em, who needs originality amirite? On top of that, none of the character interactions or dialogue are the very least interesting. It’s mostly just fucking bullshit. Although this is supposed to be a comedy, I didn’t laugh even once, not even in an unintentionally hilarious scene. I was too busy screaming. Even in a complete piece of shit like Commonplace to World’s Strong",0

","It's been a while since I looked at a series for kids. Usually the anime I get requests for are for a more teenage audience, if not older.

Story: 
 
In the great city of Edoropolis, a bunch of animaloids go about their everyday lives. Unfortunately for them, part of that life is mecha attacks from the crow ninja faction in their ceaseless efforts to overthrow the shogun and install the economic Minister Korn as the new shogun. Fortunately, they have the secret Nyanki ninja trio on their side. The Nyanki trio, comprised of Yattarou, Pururun and Skashee, shows up to wipe out the darkness and ensure another fine day in Edoropolis. The episodes generally follow the basic pattern of Korn and his right-hand crow, Gennari, sending their crow ninja and some variety of mecha under the command of Karamaru to execute some plan to overthrow the government only to have the Nyanki show up to foil their plan. The episodes do have an order to them, but it's largely unimportant since most of them are pretty self-contained.  
 
Let's start by discussing one of the odd things about the series. It's not really bad, it's just strange. Mainly, Edoropolis would probably be better off if the villain won. Here's the thing, Korn is transparently evil but the shogun is a blithering fool and Princess Usa sends people away to prison island because they mildly annoy her. If Korn knew how to use PR he could probably get the public on his side pretty easily, even while still being obviously evil. Something like: “Hello, Citizens. Our fair city has the potential to be one of the greatest in the world. Are you tired of being held back by an incompetent shogun? Are you tired of having to be on guard so that you don't get arbitrarily sent to prison island by his daughter? Edoropolis deserves better. We deserve a leader with a strong intellect. A leader who can't be bothered to send people to prison island unless they actually commit a crime. Support Ktulu in overthrowing the government. He may be an evil, eldritch genius, but he's also mentally stable and a genius. Ktulu, because evil is better at leading than stupid.” The point her is, it wouldn't be difficult to make yourself look like a better choice than the brat who sends people away on a whim and the village idiot. Plus, acknowledging that you're evil would be refreshingly honest for a politician.  
 
Let's talk about the things that the series doesn't do well. I'm not going to criticise it for being simple or even formulaic, given the target audience, however, there are still problems with it. First we have the narrator. Basically, he chimes in almost every episode to explain the obvious and repeat the same titbit about Yattaro's special attack. Hate to break it to you, but kids are not that stupid. They don't need this character. Admittedly, there are some funny fourth wall breaking scenes with him, but they're few and really not worth his dragging things out. Moving into the subject of humour, there are two reoccurring “gags” in this that really don't work. The first is that Korn cross-dresses. There are circumstances in which cross-dressing can be amusing. The “Some Like it Red” episode from Due South, and the whole Bob scenario from Blackadder but if you look at those you'll notice that there's more to the scenario than just a guy in women's clothing and that's the entire joke in this. Maybe they were trying to dumb it down for children, but in doing so they also lost the potential for humour. Let the dude wear a lady's kimono, it's not a big deal. The second is the dirty old man joke. After a while, the Nyanki go to enlist the aid of a “great scientist” named Nekomata and, it turns out, he's just a dirty old man. It's funny because he... gropes women and makes them uncomfortable? There are also way too many recap episodes in this. Why do they even need recap episodes in a series where there's no over-arcing story?  
 
On a positive note, the comedic aspects of the series do mostly work pretty effectively. I also like that they can make fun of themselves and that they try variations for most of their reoccurring jokes in order to keep them fresh. The series is pretty entertaining too. If I were watching this as a kid I'd definitely like it more, but even as an adult they have some clever and entertaining parts. I appreciate that every single member of the Nyanki group, including their non-combatant support, Otama, gets their own chance to shine and act as the hero for at least an episode.  
 
Characters:  
 
There's not much to most of the characters. They follow basic tropes or, if they're a side character, they might be used for a running joke or two. To be fair, that's adequate given the target audience. The major exception is Karamaru who, surprisingly, gets a story arc where he legitimately develops and grows as a character. Even the main heroes don't have that. When they need to power up they just go a place and acquire a thing. Their characters stay the same. I also like that Karamaru shows hesitation over what he's ordered to do and questions whether or not it's for the best. Honestly, it makes him the most compelling character in the series.  
 
Art:  
 
Let me start by acknowledging that the art is really dated by today's standards. Now that that's out of the way, let's try to look at it more from the perspective of its time. The biggest flaw is just that the studio is kind of lazy. There are a lot of recycled scenes in this series, and not just the transformation and special attack sequences. Maybe they just thought that kids wouldn't notice. In spite of that, however, there is a charm to the art style and a lot of the enemy mecha designs are pretty creative. The character designs are pretty interesting too, although this is one of those series where the characters don't bother hiding their secret identities except by slightly changing their clothes and that works, somehow. I'll still give them credit on those counts.  
 
Sound:  
 
They got a pretty decent cast in this. Yamaguchi Kappei, Orikasa Ai and Kosugi Juurouta take on the roles of our main trio and they all do well. The best performance comes from Yamadera Kouichi as Karamaru. He gives quite a splendid performance, but that's balanced out by Sawaki Ikuya's performance as Korn. It sounds like he swallowed something and its kind of stuck in his throat. I'm sure he was told to sound like that, but it's still pretty grating. The music is decent enough.  
 
Ho-yay:  
 
There's a little bit. It's implied that Korn has romantic feelings for Gennari. Especially towards the end of the series. This is largely treated as humorous, for some odd reason.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Kyattou Ninden Teyandee is a pretty decent series. There are certainly parts that don't work and are kind of problematic but it's still a fairly enjoyable series overall. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Next week I'll look at something a bit darker and more adult, Gankutsuou. 

          
 
       Helpful To start out with, if you didn't already know Samurai Pizza Cats and Kyattou Ninden Teyandee are two COMPLETELY different shows. When the producers decided to send KNT to America, they either didn't send the original scripts or they were translated badly before being sent.  
The result? 
Samurai Pizza Cats. 
The dub isn't a translation at all; in fact, the English scripts were made up based on what the characters seem to be doing as interpreted by the English crew. An ""interpretation"" is probably the only title you could give this show that links it to it's Japanese side.  No names were kept, and some characters didn't even end up being the animal they were supposed to be. The characters are insanely flamboyant and exaggerated. Fourth wall shattering jokes abound, along with re-used animation sequences and humor that is clearly geared to an adult audience, despite this show having been shown on children's cartoon blocks. 
Samurai Pizza Cats definitely isn't for everyone, and is barely an anime in the common sense. Overall, this show feels like its a bastard born from America and Japan's relations in the early 90's, and if you have any appreciation for the culture that arose from that union, you will likely enjoy what you see here. As the first anime I ever watched, it just about sums up my relationship with the media of my childhood, between english dubs of shows like Sailor Moon, Power Rangers, and Flint the Time Detective. And while this probably only appeals to a selective crowd, if you are looking for something off the wall and nostalgic, you'll probably be satisfied with gluing your eyes to this for a while.

          
 
       Helpful If you want to laugh really hard this anime is for you. 
This anime turns around 3 cats that work on a pizza store and fight against crime. 
Every episode has new jokes and different adventures. 
Even though there is not a lot about characters history is not like it was eventual for the story to grow. 
 
I really recommend you this show if you like silly, random stuff. And if you want to have a good time.

If you're a fan or just listening to the british band, Oasis, then this one's for you. 
 
Higashi no Eden: Falling Down can be described as a ""Thank You For Borrowing Your Rights"" gift from Production I.G., who also animated Higashi no Eden, to the british band, Oasis, who sang Falling Down and made it into an OP song to Higashi no Eden, by re-editing the OP scene into a lyric/abstract music video art style. 
 
This 4-minute, 27 seconds of this video is all about the whole song of ""Falling Down"" with a short abstract, yet artistic animation music video about the opening. Also, if you have plans to watch it and Higashi no Eden, but you're concerned about the spoilers, don't worry, there's no spoilers here. It's just a Music Video, no doubt. 
 
If the song convinces you to watch Higashi no Eden, then why not give it a try? It's a great anime nonetheless! ^_^

       Helpful After watching the series, ""Higashi no Eden"", I made sure I watched the music video.  This music video stays true to the uniqueness of the anime ""Higashi no Eden"" with animation identical to the opening seen in every episode. 
 
The animation is completely amazing and gorgeous; I've never seen anything like it before.  The images and lyrics of the song match perfectly.  There is well-chosen symbolism representing the events of the anime.  I still don't understand all the symbolism...  I like how they incorporate real-life images into the animation like the hand that represents Mr. Outside.   
 
Overall, this is a must-watch for fans.  The images of the video capture me every time.  Glimpses of the outlines of the two main characters are included just like in the opening for the anime.  Actually, a good bit of the animation from the opening is used in the video...I like that about the video, though.  I also like how the lyrics of the song is posted in creative ways throughout the video.  The only downside to the video is that I think it's a little repetitive, but the song is also repetitive which makes sense, I guess.

The Characters: 
There are some nice characters here and not so nice characters here like the stuck up Claude Claudel who seems always grumpy for no reason - probably because of his past. Yune, on the other hand is a very cute and kind girl, appreciative and enthusiastic in her little ways, living in the care of Claude and his grandfather in a metal-smithing shop somewhere in Paris. Another interesting character is Alice, the rich girl who finds Yune adorable and treats her really nicely, how she makes some difference to the mundane lives of the main cast. 
 
The Art: 
Backgrounds are superb. Very artistic, very scenic.You will love or at least appeciate Paris more with the art. 
 
The Music: 
Fits the art, it's relaxing, it's classical music,either if it's french or Japanese themed songs - it fits perfectly with the mood or the situation the characters are in. Which is usually mellow. I also love how there was a french narrator telling the Title and episode title every episode. 
 
Story and Enjoyment and Critique: 
It's sometimes boring to be honest, but at the same time the simplicity of the anime - it's art, music, and no-aggression story gives it some appeal. I think it could also be of the Josei category. The pacing is really slow at times and I feel there are some unnecessary parts that take too long or are slow. Some characters need to have more development. This is a show where there's a lot of questions unanswered. Lots of missing chances to get more character development or at least more clarity in relation with the character's behavior and his/her back story to make more sense to things. Lots are missing ad were replaced by cute moments like enjoying the day with Alice, or a show on the slide projectors. which should have been cut short because it holds no importance as a whole. 
 
This show makes you relaxed for some reason. Would add Josei to the category - more like a less touchy-feely josei genre. 
Similar animes that I feel that have a similar vibe to this anime are: 
- Victorian Romance Emma 
- Ristorante Paradiso

          
 
       Helpful Cultural differences can make it difficult for one to understand and get along with a stranger. But when two people are able to make it past this obstacle, their eyes become opened to the wonders and marvels of the other's world. Ikoku Meiro no Croisée is the story about a young Japanese girl adapting to life in the boisterous city of Paris in the second half of the 19th century.  
 
Art (8/10) 
This category is generally the hardest one for me to score given my usual lack of attention to fine, artistic details in the animation. Anyhow, the animation is on par with today's standards which, in my opinion, is enough to satisfy the mass majority of the audience. I also appreciated the fact that foreigners (i.e. the Parisians) were not shown to be ""different"" in terms of physical appearance. Since I haven't been to Paris, I can't really say anything about the accuracy, but I must say that the buildings and surroundings are quite detailed.  
 
Characters (7/10) 
Right from the start, it was obvious that character development would largely focus on Yune, the Japanese girl adjusting to life in Paris. Although she was not used to living the life of a Parisian at first, as time went on, it was evident that she learned to accept and adapt to her new surroundings. In turn, the other Parisians also got to know her better and worked on accepting this unique girl into their family. The difference between Yune's interactions with the people in the first and last episode is truly astounding. But aside from Yune, the other characters were more or less poorly developed (e.g. Even after the whole series, Oscar didn't really change that much).  
 
Sound (7/10) 
A slightly upbeat, country-style OP to ready you for an episode and a calm, soothing ED to end it - a great combination for a show of this genre. BGM was average and fit in well, though none of the soundtracks were particularly memorable. And even though there weren't any big-name seiyūs involved, the voice acting was done quite well. Don't expect anything grand and you'll be satisfied.  
 
Story (7/10) 
The story is honestly quite interesting. Although it seemed a bit slow (and slightly confusing) for the first two-thirds of the series, the last third picked up the pace and tied up all the loose ends, making the series as a whole enjoyable to say the least. The idea of a young girl travelling to and living in a foreign country by herself is intriguing, and is what caught my attention when looking through the plethora of anime series for Summer 2011. Although, at first, she faced many difficulties, most obvious of which was the transition from Japanese to French culture, Yune was soon able to enjoy her new life with the help of the other residents. Looking back, it is truly heartwarming to see how she came lonely and empty-handed but ended being so deeply cared for by others.  
 
Overall (7/10) 
While Ikoku Meiro no Croisée does appeal to a wide audience, it is not for everyone. Those who enjoy slice-of-life anime would most likely be more entertained by this than those who look for action-packed or psychological anime, for example. Nonetheless, it doesn't hurt to give this series a try; I'm glad I did. As a whole, it's not particularly outstanding but the story and characters make it a worthwhile watch.

          
 
       Helpful IMnC is one pink fluffy cloud of a BBC documentary. This is one of those soothing anime that delivers a slice of life where the drama is kept to a minimum and all is nice and soft and sweet. 
 
Story: 
A tiny teenage Japanese girl in the 1900s leaves her home and sails away to Paris to live with two grown men and keep house for them. Now, at first this sounds like it was written by Pedobear but nothing could be further from the truth. There is no fanservice and no pervy stuff, which can only be counted as a blessing. The story deals mainly with culture shock on both sides of the equation and comes to the inevitable conclusion that no matter how different we seem to be we can still find common ground. Don't read any romance into this, there is none. In general, the story is refreshingly innocent and all sorts of sweet.  
 
Characters: 
Yune is the diminutive Japanese expatriate. She is a sweet presence and in a miraculous manner she has been saved from the moe-tard stain. She may be soft-spoken but she's not an airhead and she has a will of her own. She is infinitely more charming this way and she does not need any cutesy antics to make us like her. I do wish more anime paid attention to this carefully balanced female character creation.  
Claude is one part of the French host family. He is a good sort of guy, if a little too broody at times. He is abrupt and outspoken and these elements play off nicely against Yune’s more reserved and polite Japanese nature.  
Oscar is the other part of the French host family and Claude’s grandfather. Always in the grip of wanderlust and a total flirt, he is nevertheless the sort of grandfather anyone would want. Kind, insightful and gentle. He is a sort of bridge between the two worlds, France and Japan.  
Alice is a spoiled rich brat with a fetish for Japan and determined to make Yune into her pet. A truly obnoxious character but who nevertheless adds an extra layer of comparison for Yune. There is the French-Japanese and then there is the rich-poor layer to the story. Necessary, I admit in retrospect, but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't gladly bludgeon her to death with any convenient spiky object so I could have the pleasure of seeing blood and brain bits flying…ahem, back on topic, back on topic. 
 
Animation: 
Simple yet above average. There is some repetition and most frames don't need any extravagant angles that would complicate things. The backgrounds are pretty and surprisingly accurate for the period and place. It so happens that Japanese animators are often baffled by the architecture of European houses and end up drawing a generic box with a generic roof and generic windows. This has been mostly avoided here since it is apparent the studio worked with references. Where references were not available the generic box makes a slight appearance. Character animation is soft and beautiful. 
 
Sound: 
Cheerful and fluffily melancholic. Feels like being in a French bistro so I guess it was spot-on.  
OP & ED: The OP is a very pretty travelogue of Paris 1900 and the ED is just pretty nonsense which I mostly skipped.  
 
Overview: 
This was a nice anime, a soothing slice of life. There are no stellar characters or elaborate plot twists; if you are to enjoy this you enjoy it for the simple sweetness and innocence. If you are fed up with the borderline hentai crap and moe-tard gimmicks and are in need of something genuinely sweet, pick this up.

Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.

They don't really add anything important, but it's fun to watch.  It's worth the watch just to see Holo again.  The first one gives a little history about the food they eat and the wine.  The second one is just an episode with.  Holo showing off how she stretches.  Overall, it's nice to see Holo again and it's a decent watch.  Don't expect anything major from these specials.  A 7/10 is a good score here, but don't take it as a bad thing

          
 
       Helpful If you notice the length of each episode, you figure out pretty quickly that these two mini-sodes are really just cuteness. The first is a neat one about the bread and alcohol in the show, while the second one is a fan-service of Horo showing how to stretch. No real story to speak of, and with that, not much in the character section. The art was done by one of the animators of the show, so  while it is slightly different from the main style, it's not particularly noticeable. They used the sounds that you're probably used to if you've seen the rest of Spice & Wolf, so no surprises there. 
Overall, it's pretty cute, but mostly useless fluff.

","I am not sure where to start my review for this one. The storyline compares and contrasts Japan and ancient Rome in regards to their bath culture. I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did. The two flaws in the story line are the fact that it is repetitive and the fact that despite the fact it makes the subject some what interesting I doubt very few people are going to remember that many historical facts from the show. 
 
I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me. 
 
Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time. 
 
I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. 

          
 
       Helpful _Thermae Romae_ is very much a one-note gimmick anime, from its basic plot style to its animation-style and Lucius's hilarious reactions to everything (I'd call the series a bit like _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ or _Yakitate!

The diversity and weird gems like TR is one of the reasons I love anime.

Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick.

It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

3,33820,20,12.94929239,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Ao Oni The Animation (Movie),An animated film series based on the  Ao Oni  game. It will feature a new story.,"['Mystery', 'Horror']","The story about the boy named Hiroshi, who is trapped with his friends, investigates a deserted mansion that is rumored to be haunted. Upon entering the mansion you and your friends discover that the mansion is haunted by a mysterious creature named the Ao Oni (青鬼 in Japanese, literally ""Blue Demon"") a tall creature with a deformed face that proceeds to chase you and your friends through out the mansion. Sealing all exits.
There are four different versions of the game, each with their own puzzles, maps and endings. Only the two latest versions have been officially translated.
","I'd like to start off this review with a few warnings. First and foremost this review will contain spoilers. Second; if you haven't seen the movie here's a tip. DON'T. 
 
I've been a fan of the ao oni game for a long time. I was excited for the short animated series to come out but unfortunately it was a flop. Then I heard there was going to be an animated movie. ""At least it can't be worse than the series"" I thought to myself. I was wrong. 
 
Story: 1 
 
The story(?) revolves around a club who finds out their town has a urban legend that's similar to the ao oni game. They get in contact with the creator of the game in hopes to find out more about how the two are connected. The first half is mostly talking. Just a bunch of students sitting around a desk talking. So exciting. In the second half we find out that the ao oni is living... under the school.... One by one the students start to get picked off but it's impossible to care since none of them have anything close to a personality. In fact I just found myself laughing every time it happened. Then somehow it turns out one of the students has been having sex with a plant, which caused his genitals to rot and fall off and turns him into an ao oni. I wish I was joking. I really really do. People keep dying and then the movie throws one last plot twist at us but honestly all I could think about at the time was how close I was to finishing the god awful thing. 
 
 
Art: 1 
Studio Deen why. The art is purely CG, which if done right isn't usually that bad. In this case though? It was bad. Real bad. You'd find better animation watching one of those stupid Vocaloid MMD music videos on YouTube. It was painful to watch.  
 
 
Sound: 2 
The only reason I'm giving the sound a 2 is because I'm in love with Shikata Akiko who does the films ending theme. The background music was bland and forgettable, but at least they kept the classic Ao Oni theme in there. The voice acting was nothing special and I honestly pity every voice actor who had to be a part of this. 
 
Character: 1 
The characters were unlikeable and none of them had a personality. It's hard to find a character death sad when you have no attachment to said character thus every single one of the deaths made me laugh. Hell I don't even remember any of there names even though half of the movie was them shouting each other's names not to mention the fact that I started writing this right after the movie ended. The character designs were bland too. It was just a horrible cast. 
 
Enjoyment: 1 
N O 
 
In all this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even worth a watch for the comedic moments and by that I mean character deaths. How can something like this even be considered a horror. Instead of watching this movie I suggest just going back and playing the game, or maybe watch a playthrough of it. All I can do now is wish for that hour of my life back and try to somehow cleanse my brain of this shitshow they tried to call a movie. Please love yourself and don't watch it.

          
 
       Helpful If you thought the Ao Oni comedy shorts were bad, wait until you see this - it's even worse. The comedy shorts are a masterpiece compared to this tripe. 
 
Story: This is apparently a story based off the game; too bad there is no story. The majority of the hour long movie is the characters sitting around talking and nothing happening. It takes place in a school, not in the usual mansion. There is a story there somewhere, but it's lost in the boring, awkward telling. 
 
Animation: Studio Deen, who brought us such animation fail classics like Axis Powers Hetalia and Higurashi, are the animators of this. I was hardly surprised when I found out they were responsible. Needless to say, Studio Deen have kept up their trope of animating badly, leaving the series looking like a slightly updated version of MMD. The expressions of the character are poor and almost ridiculous even by anime standards and the characters move slow and stiff like machinery. And the animation of the monster is just terrible. It's also in 3D, not that watching it in 3D makes it any better or easier to get through. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is pretty decent but not great. The music is irritating and drove me to despair. I had to pause every few minutes just to take a break. Honestly I wonder whether the voice actors will have careers after this. 
 
Characters: The characters in this movie aren't Hiroshi & co, but a bunch of new characters. There's zero character development, the characters are one-dimensional, boring and have the personality of a gnat. There's no way you can form connections with the characters or even like them. I don't even remember their names.  
 
Enjoyment: I hate every single second. I get more enjoyment from watching paint dry. There's no horror, no nothing. 
 
Overall: 0/10. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and if I could give myself amnesia so I could forget this, I would. Avoid this and the comedy shorts, watch something better.

Many reviewers are very harsh about this movie but they're just judgy don't you worry! 
Although the art style isn't perfect the overall movie was just amazing. 
It had me surprised, shocked and bursting out of laughter <--- at the end of the review I'll say why 
Many people say that the chibi anime was better but let's be honest it's not :3 
We don't know the story of Aoonie and the game doesn't need to be the only example of Its story, we don't always need to be in a mansion -_- (We're no Ricegum or Pauls) 
This story is amazing and it takes Aoonie to the whole other universe :P BUT I GUESS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THE AOONIE IS CAPTURED AND KEPT IN THE MANSION UNDER SOME MAGIC TALISMAN AND HAVE A SCENE AT THE END WITH THE 4 CHARACTERS FROM THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD FINALLY FEEL F*ING GOOD HUH? (Hey that's a pretty good idea XD) 
 
 
 
==SMALL_SPOILERS==== 
When we find out about the lady in the mountains and the whole Aoonie creation I was like BOI... BOI U F*ED A F*ING FLOWER  
And that whole SUCCing scene I was like WHAT THE F IS HAPPENING?!?! AND THAT FACE (XD) BRUH WHEN SPRING COMES U KNOW WHAT PLANS I HAVE... LILIES ""IM HARD AND IM COMING"" ~Counselor David

3,4813,21,12.90832881,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Lolita Anime,"The first ever hentai OVA, Lolita Anime was released in early 1984. Some of the episodes featured parodies of other famous anime characters (i.e. Lum). The series' main focus was bondage. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Hentai'],none,"Being the first animated hentai series, Lolita Anime is perhaps most often watched nowadays for its historic value. Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by. 
 
Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey. 


          
 
       Helpful First of all, I have only watched the first episode. This is is the first hentai ever so most people mostly watch it for its 'historical' value. This hentai is about rape and underage girls. 
 
Story 2/10 
I have only watched the first episode but here is the story for what I have seen: 
The first episode is split up into two 15 minute parts. The basic summary of the first part is a group of boys sexually assaulting a school girl. The second part is a bondage with some older guys abusing and sexually assaulting some young girls.  
 
Art 5/10 
The art is just old school anime art, I dont really like this type of art, but it wasnt horrible. 
 
Sound ?/10 
I had it muted the entire time since.

There is only one main character that reoccurs. There is no character development but that was expected. 
 
Enjoyment 1/10 
Boku no Pico is more enjoyable, and thats saying something.

I dont watch many hentais but from what I have seen so far this was my least favorite one.

The creature claims that within a year, he will destroy the planet next. However, he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate.
In class 3-E, the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, the creature starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ?10 billion to whomever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named ""Koro-sensei"". However, this proves to be a highly unachievable task, as he has several superpowers at his disposal including accelerated regeneration, visual cloning, an invincible form, and the ability to move and fly at Mach 20. He is also the best teacher they could ask for, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and prospects for the future.
As time goes on, the situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction, and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the school year. 
The series is narrated by Nagisa Shiota, one of the students in the class whose main strategy in killing Koro-sensei is making a list of all his weaknesses over time. At first, Nagisa appears to be one of the weaker members of Class 3-E, but he later emerges as one of the most skillful assassins in the class.","Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is basically a recap/epilogue of all episodes in both seasons of the original Assassination Classroom, so it is advisable to watch both season before coming over to the movie. 
 
(This is my first review, and I am a fan of Assassination Classroom sooo...) 
 
Plot: 
Nagisa, now older, comes to pay a visit towards their old classroom. As he explores the place with nostalgia, he recognizes Karma inside. I must say that it seemed a little rushed to get into that position, and maybe if there was more backstory towards all the others, it would have created much more feels. They find Koro-sensei's graduation book - creating the epilogue/flashback through the whole series. I'm glad that they nailed adding the last, emotional ending, which led me to tear up once again. I wish at least the whole class would have one last reunion to finish off the Assassination Classroom series, as it would make so many fans with tears, although they did show the class photo of 3-E 
 
Character: 
The movie focused more upon the clips within the series, however, I did enjoy those little moments between Nagisa and Karma,  as it felt heartwarming to see their friendship hasn't changed one bit, even if they are apart. 
 
There isn't much I can talk about the art-style and music since it is an epilogue, and they are using clips from the prequels. 
 
Overall: 
Overall, it was a nostalgic trip, and much I would cherish. It just reminds everyone how enjoyable Assassination Classroom was and how much that journey with Koro-sensei really meant for all - the students and the audience. 


          
 
       Helpful Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is a compilation film of the Assassination Classroom TV series. While the film is mostly a compilation, I strongly advise that you finish the whole series before watching this. 
 
There's not much to say about the Art and Sound since it's almost the same with the TV Series. When it comes to enjoyment, I couldn't say that I ""enjoyed"" it since ninjas are cutting onions in the film.  
 
So here's the question: Should you watch it? 
 
Definitely. One thing worth noting is that the film have anime-only epilogue scenes. Unfortunately, many details were left out since the film only has around 90 minutes of run time. I was also hoping for more epilogue scenes, or maybe some adapted scenes from Korotan D (search it if you don't know).  
 
Nevertheless, it still managed to give an emotional impact especially for those who loved the series.

          
 
       Helpful If there was anything most Anime shows are lacking, it's a solid recap to sell a rewatch out. In Ansatsu Kyoshitsu's case, that was exactly it, what you read in the title is what you get. A bittersweet heartwarming refresher that really takes you back. Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it. 
 
I really like the fact that they actually put in some work into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect. 
 
As a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort. Or at least, it was for me.

Overall, it's a fair-to-middlin' movie, with a story and animation that is aimed squarely at the pre-teen audience.  Even though this is billed as an 'anime' movie, most movies that were created in this time period still had a very heavy Disney influence and did not contain many (if any) of the normal anime tropes and quirks we are used to from today's anime offerings.     
   
Also, even though this is billed as a ""musical"", it's actually a bit light on the musical numbers. And nothing really memorable, either.

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the weirdest, funniest, scariest movies I have ever watched. I first watched it as a kid, watching it every time I went to my grandparents. I haven't watched it since then, and was recently reminded of it, so I watched it again and wondered what the hell the people were on when they made this!!! Apart from the epic backing music, the storyline is crazy and sometimes you're left watching the screen blankly. I unexpectically still love this movie. It's quite worrying at times but I suggest you watch this seeing as you'll never watch anything else like it!

While watching it, I felt like this was more of a recap episode without actually telling the viewer what is going on. 
We got a new song that was as good as the songs in the main serie. This song was playing during the recap feel like part. 
 
There isn't anything to talk about with this one. Those who watched the parent show should watch it, because it's short and had the same energy as the other one.

          
 
       Helpful Short little special inserted after the performance in ep13 of tari tari and runs in parallel time until the ending. Probably worth watching if you like Tari tari. 
 
Random personal rambling: I think i watched the tv series in 2013 and its quite an weird experience going back to this after 3 years. Makes me wonder why they bother making such a short after the anime's been done for quite a while. The short gets quite sentimental and reiterates the bittersweetness of graduation and parting ways, and it makes me wonder if I would've gotten sad had i watched it back then or perhaps that effect works better after the fact. Because, I was in university back then, and now I don't keep in touch with the friends i had back then i anymore, so in a way the timing in which I watched this short with 2 different perspectives time fits more appropriately.

I will explain the four current shorts briefly without spoilers, so you can get an idea if you want to watch these or not.) 
 
Edit: As this review was posted at the time where only four shorts under this franchise were released, I will update and review the other titles after I have watched them and caught up. Thanks, feel free to read the current four posted here. 
 
 
This is a very interesting set of shorts, and it's the first time I've every approached something in this genre. I've never written a review before, but I figured I'd make one because there aren't any on this site at the moment, so if this can help someone that'd be great. Let's get started. 
 
At the moment, there are four shorts: The Dragon Dentist ,Hill Climb Girl ,Me!Me!Me! ,and Carnage. I'm going to give my brief thoughts on all of these separately below. 
 
Dragon Dentist is a very interesting short. It has a concept on... well... a dragon, and some people who appear to be training to become the dragon's dentists. The short has an interesting concept dabbling in different realms of some sort, interesting and good, but not my favorite of the shorts. Moving on. 7/10 
 
Hill climb is about climbing hills, if you couldn't guess that. It follows the journey spanning about two days of a school girl who loves bicycles, and she seems to be racing her friend every morning to school. This short has a CGI style that is similar to that of RWBY, the characters don't look like your traditional or modern anime, but they don't look bad. If you like racing anime, this might interest you. 7/10 
 
Next is Me!Me!Me!, my favorite of the current four. It follows a story of the main characters inner struggles with a hallucination. This short has the most superior animation out of the group, and is actually quite impressive. The themes are very odd at first, but there really are some deep concepts here if you're looking for something to really interpret and think about after watching. I think almost everything is symbolic for something if you really look at it. It shoulders some themes of purity/diluted views and loss and regret. 9/10 
 
Finally, is Carnage. This is a very interesting short indeed. It follows the story of a girl in an old western setting who has lost her arm, and concerns the path she takes for revenge. I won't say much more, because anything else would pretty much spoil most of the plot. 8/10. 
 
Overall I give this an 8, being very good. I tend to rank things rather highly though; if I liked something, it usually scores high. Maybe I'm being a little generous with an 8, but the shorts are worth a watch although Me!Me!Me! and Carnage are both very graphic and contain nudity, so if you don't like that, just watch the first two. Those are pretty much clean, although do not have as heavy of an effect as the later.

          
 
       Helpful Now before we get into this I just want to take the time to say this is my first review so have mercy. 
 
Now if your wondering ""Yo what's up with this Nihon Animator Mihonichi?"" Well look no further as I'm hear to give you a general idea of what this collection of short films has to offer. 
 
Story: 
Let us begin with the stories of Nihon Animator, I feel that there is a special short film waiting for everyone in this collection. There is a huge variety of types of stories that are told here, some are just little fun shorts to watch while others have a deeper meaning. Some are happy and others are sad, some are simple and others make you think. I believe this is the best feature in this collection because you can connect to a bigger audience. There might be some short films that are not for you in this collection, there will be some shorts that just end without an explanation but this also makes you think harder about the film which is what I think they want you to do. I don't want to talk about any of the films, because first of spoilers and second off its interesting going into this with no clue what you are going to get. (Nihon Animator is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get.) So I will just let you experience the shorts for yourself.   
 
Art: 
The art of this collection is exactly how I explained the stories.  Each short film has its own unique art style put into it. It really comes down to the watcher's opinion on art whether they think it is good or bad.  I think this also adds to the feeling the short film gives off, so it makes the experience all the much more unique. 
 
Sound: 
I think the music will have a strong impact on the viewer because most of it captures the feeling of the short film its in. Also the voice acting was good so thats always a plus. 
 
My Thoughts: 
There were some shorts that I didn't care for but I understand that they were not meant for me so I didn't judge them too hard. Some of the music in this collection is AMAZING! *cough* ME!ME!ME! *cough* Girl *cough* There are alot of beautiful visuals in this collection. After finishing all of these short films it feels as if I've been on a journey. I had so many feelings felt when watching all these short films: happy, sad, confused, relaxed, and weirded out at some points but I'm glad that I watched all of Nihon Animator Mihonichi and I hope you feel the same way by the time you finish it. 

          
 
       Helpful Why do we watch anime? Some people for the characters, some for the stories, others for the culture. But hopefully all of us can get an appreciation for some gorgeous, if brief animation, right? Of course, that fails to do NAM justice. 
 
Nihon Animator Mihonichi plays host to a number of unrelated shorts with storytelling as varied as the artstyles of each piece. The one common factor is that the stories themselves are rarely direct and you'd be forgiven for wanting to watch it again until you have an understanding for what it is. This isn't a bad thing, as it's sign of the rare occasion where quality has been condensed into a brief seven minutes. Quite like the budget. The first short is about a girl who's hoping to become a Dragon's dentist (quite literally) and the requirements and training to be one involve her dying on the battlefield. Are you lost? It makes contextual sense by the end, but you'll want to watch it and a lot of the others (The infamous ME!ME!ME!) at least a second time or recall upon them in your memory banks a few hours later at work, school, or just while having a drink. 
 
The animation alone is why I personally keep watching. Even when a story doesn't invoke my attention enough or fails to impress me from a story level, the animation is always expressive in one way or another. Hill Climb Girl, for instance, utilizes pure CGI, but it's nigh flawless on its own, while Carnage is not done justice by words. Others utilize still images, these ones being those directly related to actual full-length anime, i.e. the Gundam and Evangelion franchises. They're interesting in their own right and, especially if you're a fan, should take a look at. 
 
This is where I should mention the naked breasts. 
 
Following the third and currently infamous ""ME!ME!ME!"", which uses so much sexual symbolism to the point of numbing the viewer to it within its short run time or bringing a more sensitive person to smash their computer, two of the next, and presumably some in the future, contain nudity. Quite a bit, in some cases. While I'd personally call ""ME!ME!ME!""'s breast turrets as enough a sign of satire as any, Carnage and 20 Min Walk should convince you with their artstyles that it is not so much along the lines of fanservice as an artistic appreciation for the human body, such as art used to contain before the idea of sexualization confused people on what ""offensively sexualized"" even meant. I digress. If you think you should skip the third, do it. You won't lose much except the chance to send a link to terrorize coworkers, parents, and normal people with. 
 
And after those two, the rest is pretty simple. The sound that is available is synched to the visuals in a way that works, though is rarely memorable. When it is, it usually has to do with the fact that it was designed around being a music video. See #10. YAMADELOID for an example. For character, well, with little dialogue I can't say you'll meet with complicated psyches too often, but the characterization certainly doesn't make these guys unlikable as the 6-7 minute video takes them through the one task they want or need to accomplish. 
 
And do I enjoy it? Christ, yes. The videos flow beautifully and I can't find a single time they're boring. If you were skeptical at first about watching these, here's a somewhat spoilerific synopsis of a few. 
 
1. A tale reminiscent of a military training video, with more than a few direct parallels, joined with fantasy elements for that much more intrigue. 
2. Training leads to success, as one schoolgirl and the daily challenge she holds with her friend encourages her to push herself to her limits. 
3. An otaku lies in bed as memories of his past and present torment him. 
4. A one-armed girl who seeks vengeance takes it to the church. 
5. A number of still frames taken from the animation studios of the original Mobile Suit Gundam team are put up next to each other slowly for the audience to observe the process of animation itself. 
 
If any of these interest you, I cannot give you a higher recommendation than to continue with the rest. Keep in mind, Studio Trigger was responsible for the animation of the 11th. It, at the least, is worth a gander.

3,25567,28,12.03990301,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,DRAMAtical Murder: Data_xx_Transitory,"Data xx Transitory is the thirteenth and bonus episode of the DRAMAtical Murder animation. It features all of the bad endings from the original game. 
 
(Source: DRAMAtical Murder Wiki)","['Sci-Fi', 'Psychological', 'Drama', 'Shounen Ai']","
Dramatical Murder is set in the near future on the fictional island of Midorijima (碧�u), Japan. At some point in the game's recent history, the island was privatized by the powerful Toue Konzern (�|江コンツェルン, Tōe Kontserun) and turned into a resort called Platinum Jail (プラチナ?ジェイル, Purachina Jeiru), with the island's original residents being forced to live in the Old Residential District (旧住民区, Kyū-Jūmin-ku). Protagonist Aoba Seragaki lives on the island and works at a store named Junk Shop Mediocrity (平凡, Heibon), hoping to live a simple life. However, after being forcefully dragged into the popular cyber game Rhyme (ライム, Raimu) with its virtual world and its use of Allmates (オ�`ルメイト, ?ru Meito), mobile devices that usually appear as if they are the owner's pets, and hearing rumors about disappearances involving Ribsteez (リブスティ�`ズ, Ribusutīzu), turf wars between groups, all semblance of a peaceful life for Aoba ends.
","I haven't seen the anime this OVA is coming after, but if you have played the game and you want to see animations of the bad endings, this is the place to come to. If you like horror and yaoi mixed together, come here.  
 
If you watched the anime hoping for it to be BL like the game, but you were sorely disappointed and wondering where all the L went, it's here, so come here.  
 
If you like yaoi come here, unless you hate blood (then don't come).  
 
If you want a riveting plot, no, leave, quickly. 

          
 
       Helpful THIS OVA INCLUDES GAY SEX, RAPE, NUDITY AND BLOOD - if want to avoid those, don't watch it. The anime doesn't have these, so you can just watch the anime without watching the OVA. 
This OVA shows what would happen to Aoba if things had gone wrong on episode 11 of the anime. It has good quality animation because it came on DVD and there isn't much of a plot to insert here. The voice acting is really good on it and it's a great adaptation of the bad ends. Excluding how short each part was (but I understand why it is like that), I have no complaints. 
So,  nothing I wrote on the first sentence bothers you - go watch it.

          
 
       Helpful I believed the idea for the DRAMAtical Murder anime was not really to give an accurate adaptation to the source material, but rather to try and milk a successful game series by putting a SFW-not-really-gay version of it on TV. With that said, I'm really confused as to why this OVA exists the way it does. 
 
The story of the OVA adapts all of the bad ends from the first game (mixed with some elements of the second game). The TV anime took every route from the games and mashed them together in a rushed, impersonal, poorly pieced together story, and the same can pretty much be said for this OVA, but this time they actually kept in the horror and gay porn? 
 
Like, if you're going to cut out a lot of what the fans of the game like for the anime, fine. I can understand wanting to try and attract a new audience. But then after doing that they make this OVA, which is obviously something made for fans of the games. I usually see OVAs as being something like ""You liked the anime, so if you want even more here's a little bonus for you!"" but this OVA brings back exactly what they cut out of the anime when they tried to draw in a new audience, so do they think that the new audience really wants this? Was it really made just to try and milk the fans of the games?? I really don't understand.. 
 
It may sound like I have nothing good to say about this OVA, but I actually thought it was interesting, the way they pulled off showing all of the bad ends together in a way that made sense in terms of what they did with the anime. But while it was interesting, it wasn't exactly well done. 
 
The animation was poor. There was limited movement in general, and whenever a character did move a lot, it looked a awkward and unnatural. The art itself was fine for the most part, but when it came to actual animation, it was a bit hard to watch. This was all made worse by the fact there were sex scenes happening. Everything looked jerky and weird, it wasn't good. 
 
There were also a lot of times when the mouth movements didn't match up well with words and sounds, again, made worse and more obvious by the fact there were sex scenes. 
 
After ragging on it that bad, it's worth saying that I did actually enjoy it, but I am entirely biased as I was a big fan of how the bad ends were done in the game. Even if this OVA was objectively a mess, there are still bits that take after the game pretty well and it made me happy to see them. 
 
Should you watch this? 
 
If you really enjoyed the bad ends from the games and REALLY want to see your favs animated (cough Shiroba cough) then sure, but don't go into it expecting it to be as great as you remember. 
 
If you liked the TV anime and like yaoi, then sure, but again, don't expect it to be anything great. 
 
If you just generally like horror and yaoi mixed together, sure, that's pretty much all this is. 
 
If any of those don't apply to you, then don't waste your time, you more than likely won't enjoy this at all.

3,37341,29,11.80307612,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Yuru Camp△ Specials,"Specials included in the anime's BD/DVD releases. The first disc release features ""Heya Camp Episode 0,"" a story before Nadeshiko joins the club. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Laid-back RETURNS! and it's as amazing as it has ever been. What I really love about this series is its outstanding atmosphere that warms you inside and it does so impeccably. I have seen plenty of other moe anime, but yuru camp is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to the overall experience of the show. 
 
These shorts are three episdoes. The first two being mainly about room camp that we sometimes saw parts of in the end of the episodes of the anime. 
 
The first one talks about the beginnings of the camping club when Aki and Aoi first started it. It is in the same style that we're used to and is basically a chitchat between the two about camping and its equipment so nothing new is introduced in it and nothing is missing either. 
 
The second episode is one after Nadeshiko joined the gang and is also a chitchat episode, but we are introduced to new things about the characters especially Aoi and the loli Aoi, her sister, who makes an actual appearance this time as well. Nadeshiko almost always undeniably adds to the experience with her adorable character and I usually notice that at the scenes without her, but this episode is mostly focused on her and her cuteness so if you're a Nadeshiko fan, you're in for a treat. 
 
Last but not least, the third episode which I would encourage you not to read my take on as the surprise factor is key sometimes so I'll start by vaguely pointing out that it isn't another room camp episode, but an actual camping one and it is one that stands out from the rest of what we have seen so far so if for any reason you don't want to watch the room camp episodes I would encourage you to at least watch this one. 
 
Now I start talking about the episode itself. This time, the girls travel abroad to camp, but due to circumstances I won't get into detail about they end up on an uninhabited island with no means of contacting human civilization. It's time for some survival camping! But not so much. This show is yuru camp, not btoom. Even if survival camping is a unique experience I still want what I signed up for. And so they give it to us brilliantly. I have seen survival games incorporated a lot in anime, but this is definitely one to remember. Despite being stranded on an island the girls still hold it together and live through the hardships of the island as a team. They still give us the exquisite experience I'll probably never see in any other anime with such flair. It was a bittersweet episode with the slightest glimpses of the girls missing their home while still smiling so brightly and having their lightly comic moments we love. 
 
And so this review comes to a conclusion. Bottom line, if you liked the anime just as I did, definitely give these a watch. The cute squad is here, the laid-back moments are here and the experience as a whole hasn't been demoted in the slightest, rather these shorts have added a little to what the anime might have missed and don't exist solely for the sake of it. 
Side note: Give me season 2 already!

          
 
       Helpful The specials include three episodes: Every episode is different, so I am gonna talk about every episode individually.   
   
Episode 0  
It's simply how Aoi and Chiaki got the clubroom. It has some nice backstory for Chiaki and some funny jokes, but it is probably the weakest of the three episodes. Not all jokes land and it is overal not on par with the usual quality of the show. Still you should watch it, just for Chiaki's backstory Visuals alone.   
   
Episode 1 
Nadeshiko's inteligence is here tested. This has some really funny jokes and the end joke was probably my favorite of all the specials. It doesn't really add anything, but it gives me a good laugh. Also mini Aoi is there, so it is must watch.   
   
Episode 2   
Without a doubt the best of the specials. It is also the longest, while the other are around 6 minutes long, this episode is double that. The girls go on camping in Australia, but after a misunderstanding they land in a unhabited Island. Now they have to survive and maybe even have fun surviving. The Visuals are pretty, the jokes are funny and it is a nice change of scenery. If you are going to watch any of the specials, then you should absolutely watch this one.   
   
Conclusion 
The specials are nice. I didn't had high hopes for them, but it genuinely surprised me how good they were. If you liked Yuru Camp and you want more of it, it doesn't hurt to watch the specials.

          
 
       Helpful As the last of the yuru camp specials has been released i thought i would give my thoughts on the specials and the show as a whole as i have really loved it. 
 
If i had to describe this series with one world it would be joyful. It doesn't have a great story or an original premise or even really original or different characters but it doesn't need that. The show perfectly encapsulates a sense of fun which i find rare in a lot of other anime. Each episode was just a different fun little camping journey or such like that was just a laid back and fun thing for you to watch and every week i looked forward to this little slice of enjoyment.  
 
The characters are also incredibly enjoyable. All members of the cast, especially the two main girls nadeshiko and rin, are so fun to watch interact with one another and the world around them and are endlessly fun to watch. 
 
These specials have up till the 3rd fine and fun enough but the final one ""survival camp"" felt just as joyful and fun as the main series. It was great to see the gang again on an adventure and i would definitely recommend this special to anyone who enjoyed the main series. 
Also if you haven't watched the main show and remotely enjoy slice of life comedy moe shows then give yuru camp a shot. It is brilliantly fun

Both the original director and series script editor will return to work on the new project. Gainax will also be hosting four events to celebrate this occasion at this year's Tokyo International Anime Fair, featuring voice actors from the anime.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha']","
Gurren Lagann takes place in a future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers in Giha village, finds solace in his best friend, an older brother figure who is an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen. Shortly thereafter, a huge Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko, who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann) and its drilling-based abilities. He successfully uses it to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through the ceiling to bring him and Kamina to the surface world.
Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen who are piloted by Beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle by one of Lordgenome's four generals. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, who is revealed to be Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her but they allow her to join them when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many who came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other teams of humans, who had captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace. As the palace itself turns out to be a gigantic Gunmen called the Teppelin and launches armies of other Gunmen, the human forces engage them while Simon, Nia, and Rossiu pilot Gurren Lagann against Lordgenome himself, who fights them in a similar Gunmen called Lazengann. When both Lazengann and Gurren are damaged, Lordgenome fights Simon in Lagann with his bare hands, and emerges victorious, until Simon uses his Core Drill to defeat him once and for all.
Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government in their new capital of Kamina City. As soon as the human population reaches one million people by the amount on the surface, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce their intentions: they have sent the Moon onto a collision course with the Earth as part of their effort to wipe out all life on the planet, so as to prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. It turns out that Lordgenome, having since been resurrected as a bio-computer, was once part of an intergalactic army of warriors that failed to stop the Anti-Spirals, and so forced mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals. With guidance from Lordgenome and help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, in the process revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension the Anti-Spirals had hidden it in, and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld. After a journey with significant loss, they rescue Nia, and in a one-on-one Gunmen battle that virtually spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away into nothing, as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals, a fate she and Simon accept. With his life in battle finally over, Simon hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and leaves his friends to spend the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant, saying his destiny was merely to ""dig the tunnel to the future"", not to travel down it himself.
In the epilogue, twenty years have passed since the team's victory over the Anti-Spirals. With many of Team Dai-Gurren having since finally retired, it is up to the new generations of pilots to prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. Other races across the galaxy, having contacted Earth upon being freed from the Anti-Spirals, have joined forces with President Rossiu of Kamina City and during the twenty years, created the Galactic Spiral Peace Conference. Yoko, now as Miss Yomako, has become the principal of the small school she worked as a teacher at during her seven years absence from the team. One of her students, Nakim, has become a representative of the galaxy in the Grapearl Squadron. Gimmy and Darry have used Simon's Core Drill to become the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Viral has become the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. Nia's memorial and her engagement ring are shown to have been placed next to Kamina's grave. Simon, still living as Simon the Digger, watches over them as a squadron of Gurren Laganns flies overhead through the night sky on their way to join their Spiral brethren in the stars.
","Don't get me wrong here. 
 
I fucking LOOOOVE Gurren Lagann! For the past 8 months, it's been my all-time favorite anime. Everything about TTGL is brilliant including the plot, characters, music, and art, which Gainax had done an excellent job of making sure all of these factors were amazing. However, beyond that, I love the themes about evolution and ambition, two values which hold up very high to me. This show inspired and uplifted me, made me think about my life in a different way and made me realize the goals and dreams I had deep within me, that's how powerful this show was to me! But, let's not beat around the bush, this is going to be a review on the first movie, NOT on the excellent anime. 
 
This movie is much like a recap movie of the first 15 episodes of the main series. But, it's not a recap movie like e.g the first two Madoka Magica movies. No, the Gurren Lagann movies include new footage and information that wasn't spread out in the main show. I'm going to try to spoil as little as I can, but an example in this movie was that they explored Lorgenomes backstory and how the world of Gurren Lagann came to be. There are many other things like that which get explained here. I think this is a great thing to do because even as amazing as TTGL was, there were still some questions left unanswered that left some wide gaps. 
 
The purpose of these two movies was I think to fill in those gaps like f.ex who was Lordgenome or how the world of TTGL was made while also recapping the most essential parts of the story, which I think these two movies succeeded excellently at.  There were quite an alarming amount of things that I hadn't noticed or forgot about in the main series e.g how Yoko came from an underground village with Dayakka, that the whole show was post-apocalyptic or that Dai-Gurren ship was originally enemy property which the gang had invaded. 
 
However, with all that being said, there's not much else to take home. What I disliked about this movie in particular in how rushed it felt. It felt like Gainax knew they couldn't pack in 16 episodes worth of material in a duration of just two small hours, but tried to anyways. It's not as though they only included the most essential moments and the new stuff. No, they also diverged from the main series for the reason to alter the story, which felt totally unnecessary. This was most clear towards the end, where they try to defeat the gunmen. 
 
To conclude, this movie succeeded in adding new and interesting stuff but failed in trying to bring its own thing, instead of just being obedient and faithful to its original source. The result was a mediocre movie which I won't revisit any time soon. But, wait! Don't watch this before the main series please! Watch these two movies AFTER the main 28 episode series, then watch these two moves. I would also recommend giving a lot of time between watching the series and the movies because then it will be easier to contrast and compare the two. Speaking of two, I will now go on to review the other movie! 


          
 
       Helpful *A failed attempt to surpass the “unsurpassable”.* 
 
“Men put their souls into their drills when breaking through!” 
 
Some obvious advices/facts before we dive into the review. 
 
1.	 
This is NOT a standalone movie thus having knowledge from the TV series is highly recommended and also beneficial to your mind. 
2. 
Do NOT compare the pacing of the TV series with the movie. One is called a TV series and the other is called a movie for a reason, k? Both the TV series and the movie are by the original director and script editor so they know what they are messing with. 
3.	 
Do NOT expect to see a lot of new footages. Does this mean this is a “recap” of the TV series? Not exactly. There are enough plot differences in the battles for this movie to be considered an adaptation instead of a complete “recap”.  
4.	 
Is the movie rushed? To a large extent, yes it is. There is simply too much material to cover in too little time. This is probably what most people are complaining about. 
5.	 
Is it worth your time to watch this? Only if you can distinguish what to expect between a TV series and a movie. 
 
The problem with trying to remake a masterpiece level of work (and that applies not only to anime) is that people will only be curious to see how the new work can surpass the previous work. Often people will have a pre-set level of expectation for these works and more often people will find themselves expecting too much and ended in disappointment. For example, after rating the original TV series 10/10, viewer X eagerly awaits the movie adaptation. But what can he really expect? That the movie worth 11/10? No, that is not possible. This is all thanks to something called human prejudice. Everyone who has seen the TV series first will consciously/unconsciously be comparing them. So please be mindful when watching the movie not to compare it bit by bit with the TV series. It is not fair for the movie. 
 
Those of us who have seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) will know what it means when I say the show as a whole defies the Laws of Physics. While there are plenty of examples for that type of shows, TTGL is by far the most outrageous, thus the term “epicness” is seen wherever TTGL appears. The story of TTGL is a prime example of the “underdog” battle. The main characters began with very little fighting chance but every time they seem to turn the impossible possible. And how do they do that? With a DRILL of course! 
 
The movie has some great new battle scenes. Animation wise it is the same as the TV series (for those who like to compare the two). Most scenes were pretty consistent but lacking in details from time to time which is to be expected from the sketchy and cartoonish-looking animation. What truly makes TTGL “epic” though is that the scenes match well with the “mood” at that particular moment of the show. This is partially due to the great soundtracks and theme songs by Shoko Nakagawa. Overall those of us who are familiar with Gainax’s previous works will not be disappointed in TTGL.  
 
Character wise, there was a slightly heavier emphasis on Yoko in this movie which is great for all Yoko lovers. Simon and Nia also have a decent character development throughout the movie. Unfortunately, because of time constrain, there was not much character building for the secondary characters like Rossiu and Kittan who ended up being quite hollow. Thus if all you ever care about is Kamina, Nia, Simon, and Yoko, then there shouldn’t be anything wrong for you. For the rest of us … brace ourselves for some disappointment here. 
 
The following is targeted to those who have concerns with regard to the pacing of the movie. Ask yourself this, how long as it been from the end of the TV series to the airing of the movie. Answer: 11 month and 1 week (give or take a few days). Do you honestly expect to see tremendous differences (next to what it has presented already) given the time? Do you honestly expect to see a whole new story with the same awesomeness produced in 51 weeks? Given the time, though of course we can argue that they could have delayed the movie if things didn’t work out, I think it was a fairly decent job. Hopefully you will find it a good enjoyable watch too!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so here what you should NOT do right before watching this: watch the series. The entire movie is just splicing of direct cuts from the series, to make it shorter. Now if you have not seen the series at all, or have not seen it in a while, then this movie, and its sequel could be enjoyable.  
 
I really enjoy the series, and feel that anyone considering watching this should instead watch the series.

(Source: MAL News)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo Ai']","Taking place at the fictional Nanamori Middle School in Takaoka, Toyama, the series revolves around the daily lives of the Amusement Club (ごらく部, Goraku-bu), consisting of Akari Akaza, her childhood friends, Kyōko Toshinō and Yui Funami, and her classmate, Chinatsu Yoshikawa; along with the school's Student Council which is made up of its own set of characters.
","Mini Yuri does as expected. Hyping up the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. It does it well. If you like the Yuru Yuri show in general, you'll love this. The usual comedy is there, and the usual fun and interesting characters are there too. So you'll love it too! It's short and sweet, but still provides good laughs. 
 
You can watch all four mini episodes within one entire episode. It's a great watch if you want something short and sweet to watch for a bit. Really gets you hyped up for the upcoming Yuru Yuri ten in general. 


          
 
       Helpful Mini Yuri is a mini-OVA series hyping the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. The OVA series is 4 episodes with a runtime of 3 minutes each and for the most part having the cast in some chibi hijinks. 
 
Mini Yuri essentially gives us four scenarios within the four episodes, be it a Yuriympics, a ""murder mystery"", the core cast going big on YuruTube and a tongue in cheek ""Opposite Day"" with the core cast. The comedy is pretty much as to be expected with these 3 minute skits with again tongue in cheek flanderization of the cast to the core cast going in same ""crazy scenarios"" but mostly enacted by Kyouko for heck all the episodes just for the lulz (seriously) 
 
The animation done by W-Toon Studio and DMM.futureworks is ehhh ok even for an all out chibi OVA comedy skit. Like the animation is mostly chibi's but they do like to shake it up a little bit for the meta-sense or just again for the lulz. The voice cast is back so there isn't much to say on this front. 
 
Really like every intro for Mini Yuri, these mini OVA's are a vehicle to hype things up for the 10th Anniversary for the Yuru Yuri and the Yuru Yuri Ten anime and really it did it's job, comedy was to expected from Yuru Yuri and brought Yuru Yuri into focus again for the next full anime soon to be released.

In the time it takes you to read this, you could have watched Trigger-chan and experienced euphoria beyond comprehension, achieved nirvana, and transcended this pathetically limited mortal form and ascended to an infinitely more powerful, unlimited potential in two dimensions. 
 
There's not much more to be said about the perfection that is Trigger-chan. The culmination of many lives' work, saving anime, and a universal appeal make this mere 30 second advertisement for Trigger among the best that the entertainment medium has to offer. The delightfully rough-around-the edges animations sets it apart from anything not made by trigger, and with the bombastic, dynamic displays of vivacity and fortitude through intense characterization, not to mention a mind bending, once in a lifetime thrill of a plot, Trigger once again shows why they're the best in the business.  
 
It's plain and simple. In no way at all. 
Thank you Based Trigger.

       Helpful Never before have I seen an anime that has packed so much energy, heart, and plot into a single movie.  Enter Trigger-chan.  From what I've seen, I've deduced this young woman has years of hardships to come out on top and sink the competition.  Above the ranks of MAL's greatest, Death Note and FMA:B, this show shows that you can overcome any obstacle, no matter how great- and have friends that will be there with you until the very end [of 30 seconds].  Trigger-chan is the anime that made me a man, and is essential viewing.

       Helpful I am surprised this thing is here, as standalone animation. It's a bonus to livestreamed Luluco. It's like adding anime openings as standalone animations. Reading this paragraph would probably take longer than watching the animation. 
But what do I know, eh? Let's give this girl a rating, for cheese sake. 
 
Story: 1 
There is none. What did you expect? 
 
Animation: 7 
Trigger delivers. I personally love their works for animations, its sketchiness, exaggerated expressions, crazy action shots etc. I only give 7, because other than characters themselves there is little to no design. That's understandible, given the animation's length, so I think 7 is a fair note, eh? 
 
Sound: 7 
It ain't bad. Fast-paced, fitting the action perfectly. I guess full version would be cool to hear out. Seriously though, 31sec. piece is enough for a demo sample, but way too short for soundtrack.  
 
Character: 6 
They ain't bad. Given the studio's gun-related logo and name, characters are named after lock parts. Seems to me they were drawn during animators' leisure time, or as practice for upcoming series. And it turned out well. Other than their looks and affinity with weapons, it's hard to tell anything else. They're not much more than cool-looking OCs drawn by pixiv artists. Let's be fair then, 6 is actually above the completely-average-5-rating, and so are Trigger, Muzzle and Spring. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
So my statements may sound overly serious, criticizing and biased, but hey, Trigger-chan was a nice candy. I liked it. The trio worked together to deliver a bullet from Trigger-gun. That was a metaphor. Not a spoiler. What they do is something completely different. 
 
Overall: 6 
As I mentioned before, 6 is still better than nothing-special-5. This animation definitely excels at not being boring. I think it's impossible to skip this one before finishing it. It's not another K-On season. 
 
So, now some of you may be wondering about the pros and cons of Trigger-chan. Let me tell you then, just watch it. Grab the first copy you can, there is no need for a translation, and just watch it. 
 
Why are you still here, you'd finish it 5 times by now!

I've watched many movies throughout my childhood. Namely the Pokemon movies, some Disney movies (namely Aladdin), and others. But none of them have really made a huge impact on me because of the limited time they have to get made. Characters aren't always developed, plots are too narrow, and some just turn out plain terrible...that is, until I stumbled upon THIS. I read about it on a blog and I thought ""This looks interesting. Maybe I'll watch it."" And right when I did...I WAS BAWLING LIKE A BABY AT THE END!!! I FOUND MY NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER!!! Movies I've watched in my lifetime never really made an impact on me, and I read good reviews about this one...and I'm glad to say, I never expected it to be THIS awesome and...THIS ONE MOST CERTAINLY HAS!!! This movie has left me an emotional wreck, and I am glad to say that this is my all-time favorite movie ever made! 
 
So the story's about Nello, a good-hearted young boy in 19th century Belgium who lives a poor but happy life with his grandfather Jehan. He saves a dog, Patrasche, from a cruel and abusive owner and keeps him as his own. They develop a VERY strong brotherly bond. Nello also has Alois (pronounced Ah-Lou-Ah in Flemish), a young girl from a rich family whose father doesn't like Nello for his poor upbringing. Nello wants to become an artist just like Peter Paul Reubens, but tragedy strikes Nello one after another and his bond with Patrasche is put to the test. Simple enough, yes? Let me tell you this: This isn't some cheesy Disney movie with a cheesy happy ending! This movie will leave you crying buckets at the end! 
 
Unlike most movie characters who don't always get explored, everyone in this movie feels complete, even the side characters who all have their own personality and contribution to the story. All of them have subtle backgrounds that you can easily figure out just by looking at them. All of them have their own personality and they're never incomplete. The soundtrack is also wonderful, always knowing when to be joyful and sweet and sad and heartbreaking. The music at the end left me broken to tears. The movie itself is just one big tearfest. When one grievingly heartbreaking scene ends, yet ANOTHER one comes right after! When will it end!? The end of course! 
 
The only things that aren't all that are the visuals and some of the voices in the Japanese version. But hey, the movie was made in 1997 so of course they're not gonna be pretty and sparkly all the time. But they do, however, do an awesome job at making the capital of Belgium come to life in animated form, more specifically the city hall with all the flags on it. And I will say this: When it comes to the voices and casting, I think I prefer the English dubbed version over the Japanese because some of them sound a bit shaky, like Mrs. Nulette. In the Japanese version she sounds like she has strep throat. Jehan sounded like he had a sinus infection. The only Japanese voices I liked in the movie were Alois, George, and Paul. They were perfect. But I hear that the Japanese version has scenes that were cut out of the dub, so in respect to that, I'll prefer the Japanese over the English version. 
 
Despite the slightly old visuals and slightly shaky Japanese voice acting, these should be NO reasons to NOT watch this adorable, beautiful, heartbreaking, and awesome movie! This movie shows that life is fragile and not eternal, and it deals with serious issues such as death, poverty, and classism. It also emphasizes the benefits of honesty, friendship, work ethic, creativity, and knowledge, and how the ignorance of various people's actions and thoughts can really shape the person. All of you MUST see this wonderful movie! I would love to own it myself, but it's both out of print and appallingly expensive! It's the best movie I ever saw, and the best movie ever made!

          
 
       Helpful This movie made me cry so much.. You can not help but fall in love with the main characters and only want the best for them always. The bond between a child and a dog is beautiful and the ending had me in tears and I literally could not stop crying- AND I DON'T CRY AT MUCH! The story plot was interesting and sweet in the beginning. The sound was like any normal dub anime and the voices looked as if they fit the characters perfectly. This was simply a beautiful movie. The movie hurts your heart but you finish learning a great lesson about kindness and helping those less needy. 

          
 
       Helpful Do not let the above synopsis fool you, while the relationship between dog and boy certainly is affectionate PLEASE do not watch this film expecting a light-hearted, heart-warming, Homeward Bound-esque story because this film is certainly far from it. ;-; 
 
Flanders no Inu (Dog of Flanders) is based on the book by Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e, it has been widely read and also adapted into several films and anime (MAL actually lists two series). This film is pretty much a compacted version of said series. 
 
STORY 
I found the story very... honest. It addresses poverty issues that occurred back in those days and it really doesn't beat about the bush. 
 
~~~SPOILERS~~~ 
The film was quite a downer, to be honest. His best friend's father keeps stopping his daughter from seeing him, Patrasche's old abusive owner tries to reclaim him, forcing Jehan to pay him off with their rent money. Jehan dies, Nello is accused of starting a fire, he loses an art competition for money that will save his life, no one wants his milk delivery business anymore, he gets kicked out of his home, he walks around in the snow with no shoes on and in the end he freezes to death in front of paintings that he has forever longed to see in a church with Patrasche. 
~~~END SPOILERS~~~ 
 
ART 
The art was very good, although it did get a bit sloppy in some areas, as is wont with many anime films and series. 
 
SOUND 
I found the sound very moving, it certainly made the ending scenes more hard-hitting. 
 
CHARACTER 
I feel that there could have been more character development with Aloise and her father, especially as to why he dislikes Nello so much. I think it would've been nice to see more of Nello's two other friends as well. But considering this had the time limit of a film, I'm sure there simply wasn't enough time. I haven't seen the series, so I'm also sure that there's more character development in there. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
It was a good film, yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes and no. I enjoyed it for its honesty. But overall... no. I'm not saying that I wanted a happy ending... but it could've been less... pathetic, to be honest. Not pathetic as in crap, but pathetic as in... let this poor kid go with some dignity, eh?! 
 
Overall, it's definitely one to watch if you can stomach VERY unhappy endings. But it's also nice to watch for those playful and fun scenes when things are still going right for our Nello. :]

Mina itself is a character homage which triggers back to the Daicon Animation done by GAINAX where a similar nameless bunny girl appeared. Densha Otoko futher featured an opening with scenes which were appearing back in the Daicon Animation.

Rabbit Force, a group of rabbit-themed henshin (transforming) girls, became responsible for enforcing the treaty and capturing any offenders.
","This is the dumbest show I've ever seen. 
 
""The writers must have been on drugs"" is a phrase used to describe a show that's bizarre or incoherent. Of course, drugs have the potential to alter the conscious mind, and many writers have created great stories under the influence. I fear, however, that the writers of Getsumen To Heiki Mina were not taking any vision-creating drugs, but were subject to the constraints and conformity of modern-day anime. And they had no ideas. 
 
The plot, if you can call it that, is an asinine collection of monster-of-the-week bits, where the monsters are actually space rabbits who want to interfere with Earth sporting events. 
 
Yeah, you read that correctly. 
 
The only thing this show has going for it, aside from its seldom-occuring humor, is the kind-of-cool characters and their stories - mostly the main character. However, with the short length of this show, the characters appear - and reveal themselves to be part of the ""good team"" - in less than a whole episode. Pretty much every female supporting character becomes a rabbit warrior, sometimes by such random means as being thrown into a tomato patch and having the fruit fall into their mouth (which happens to be the catalyst for transformation). Not that we're expecting realism from this show, anyway. 
 
The worst part of this show is that it's completely boring. The plot setups are always so farfetched and unnecessarily complicated that the audience's response will invariably be ""gee, I guess the writers didn't have any good ideas."" 
 
If you're planning to watch this show because it's a Densha Otoko spinoff, prepare to be disappointed. Otherwise... well, you can see for yourself.

          
 
       Helpful OK, my second review for the day :&gt; this time it's Getsumen To Heiki Miina. 
I think this series is overlooked by many. It's actually pretty good and entertaining, and has the ability to keep your interest for the whole season because it is somewhat different to other series in the same genre as it. 
And also, considering that it's a spin-off from a TV show, I think it did pretty well :&gt; 
 
Story 
OK, we've all seen it before: teenaged girl is generally failing at life, but through some strange circumstances she aquires superpowers and turns her life right around. Well, this series has that too, but it's not quite as dull and drawn out as in other series like it. Firstly, it is 11 episodes long, so there are no stupid and pointless filler episodes. 
Basically, because Mina, the lead female, is a news reporter and isn't a complete cry-baby (think Sailor Moon lol), Getsumen's story is nicely new and fresh, but also staying similar to what we know. Also, the girls are bunnygirls XD 
 
Art 
Standard. Not much shading on the characters, the eyes are usually too small for the face, the backgrounds aren't really noticeable.... but the transformation sequences are top notch. All the Miinas that get a transformation have really nice ones with a lot of detail in them :&gt; nice colours too, so we don't all get eye cancer ;3 
 
Sound 
The OP and ED aren't like most other songs used in magical girl series. I don't know how really, but they're a lot less... cutesy and j-pop, if you get what I mean :S they're really fantastic and fit in pretty well with the series, which quite a few series have failed to manage. 
 
Character 
Mina is kind of standard really. She is hard-working and often over-works herself for the sake of her job; this kind of character is commonly seen in shoujo anime so she doesn't stand out very much really. However, that kind of character is really needed for this kind of show, so I guess it can't be helped. Plus, she's loveable &lt;3 
None of the other characters really got any development though... the other Miinas, not including Ootsuki Miina, don't get any more screen time after their inital appearence. They might pop up like, twice, throughout the series for a couple of seconds, but apart from that the only time you'll see them again is right at the end of the final episode. That's all that disappointed me.  
 
Enjoyment 
I loved it. I patiently waited for months between each episode being subbed because I really liked the series; if it had been any other I would have given up and dropped it. You get a really lovely &quot;feel-good&quot; feeling when watching this, and that's just what I needed at the time ^^ I'll always accept a second season X3

After losing him in an accident, she decides to marry her childhood friend. However, Yoo Jin meets someone looking exactly like her lost love, putting her in a bind.  The program featured 23 members of the original Korean cast voicing the characters and was broadcast with Japanese subtitles.","['Drama', 'Romance']","The story begins when Joon-sang (Bae Yong-joon), the son of an eminent musician, moves to Chuncheon, a rural city in South Korea. As an extraordinarily talented student, Joon-sang is welcomed by his fellow students as well as his teachers, but remains a quiet, introverted teenager. As a result of the belief that his biological father is dead, and serious disagreements with his mother, Joon-sang believes that no one truly loves him.

","There is a sweet, succinct Korean word that sums up the core of this series: makjang. For the uninitiated, makjang is an element that infers the use of unbelievable, often extreme plot elements that are not limited to: incest, rape, adultery, and terminal illness. Korean dramas often utilize this to keep viewers in suspense, interested in the outcome of the storyline―and Winter Sonata is no stranger to venturing in this territory. If anything, it swathes itself in layers of these extremes, and yet despite sounding ridiculously unbelievable as a result, there is something addicting about the series. 
 
The plot plays out like a melodrama; star-crossed lovers who want nothing more than to be wrapped in the embrace of one another while the whole world is seemingly against them. If that seems too reductive it's because it's quite honestly that simple. While there is nothing inherently impressive about the setup, the payoff is obvious because Winter Sonata was not an international hit without good reason. 
 
This series knows how to lure you in with subtle appeal in the beginning, and while the setup isn't novel, it's refreshing in that it wastes no time in pairing our couple together from the outset. Winter Sonata is nothing if not efficient with its pacing, although it does begin to drag a bit near the end with supplemental material that seems to verge on being shoved in to drag on the episode count. Regardless, if you're concerned over whether or not the plot will catch you, if the synopsis has genuine appeal to you and you don't mind the makjang elements, then this series will catch you from the moment you start and you will be hooked. If you have difficulty buying into or enjoying some of the tropes that were mentioned above, then Winter Sonata will feel far too heavy, unbelievable, and clunky for you to enjoy. 
 
A defining feature of the main quartet of the series is that they are all obsessed with something, and as a result they are riddled with flaws. That on the one hand means they carry some measure of depth but they are just as equally frustrating for it. Yu Jin pines after her only love to the exception of all else; it's as though it is humanly impossible for her to consider the consequences and repercussions of her single-minded obsession with one man. She would sacrifice anything and everything―her childhood friend, the mother that adores her―if that means she gets to be with the one person she wants to be with. Yu Jin is just one example, however, and when I say obsession I mean these individuals verge into the very extremes of the word. 
 
One unique aspect of the series is the animation, which is decidedly different from many of its likeness (read: shoujo). It's a more realistic style that matches perfectly with the essence of the series. It's not flawless, but it has an undeniable quaint charm to it. For those unaccustomed to variant styles of animation and more adapted to the mainstream, it may be an adjustment with Winter Sonata―but once you sit through a few episodes, you quickly grow to appreciate how unique the art is. 
 
Sound is perhaps one of the biggest redeeming qualities of the series, as its opening is absolutely enchanting and perfectly describes the emotions of our main couple as they struggle to reconcile the past and the present. It is an added bonus that Winter Sonata stands out as especially unique because it's one of the very few Korean dubbed animations. The soundtrack helps set the mood, and the voice acting is done by the original cast of the drama. While that might not mean much to original viewers, its still an incredible enjoyment to watch on account of how talented the actors are at infusing emotion in each scene. 
 
Although I am a huge Korean drama enthusiast, and therefore accustomed to the manner of cliches and tropes―many of which are utilized in Winter Sonata, I have never viewed the original series. That said, I think the animated series pays a great tribute to the original. It is very entertaining with a suspenseful edge that has you waiting on pins and needles at the end of each episode as we are thrown yet another wrench in the fate between Yu Jin and Joon Sang. As much as I can laud the series with praise for being as enjoyable as it is, however, it is greatly riddled with flaws and not without cumbersome material that does tend to drag with a longer episode count. The quick, snappy pacing is a wonderful bonus as the material of the original had to be somewhat compressed―but that also means the emotional, poignant scenes tend to rush by too quickly and leave us unsatiated rather than appreciative of the true weight of the tragedy occuring on screen. 
 
The characters themselves are almost poetic in their anguish at least until we realize how ridiculously selfish they are being in their individual obsessions with little regard for any of the people around them. How the plot essentially boils down, at the end, to one person's obstinate mistake―and that is perhaps the most frustrating realization in the finale. It does little to reassure that the episodes of suspense were well-deserved. 
 
Having said all of this, Winter Sonata is indeed a unique series that warrants some measure of positive acclaim and praise for what it does accomplish. However, it is not a flawless series deserving of quite as much hype as it seems to have garnered with a small base of users. Perhaps it is something that has flown under too many people's radars―because as a love story, it is sickeningly addictive in the worst way possible and enjoyable as a result of that. In a way, it's almost like a cautionary tale because it displays the worst traits of human nature―a willingness to sacrifice everything in a single-minded, self-centered attempt to achieve self-satisfaction.

          
 
       Helpful I read some reviews of this show from other websites and though that maybe some poisnts need to be put down for viewers to choose or not to choose to see this anime. 
 
The anime is a remake of a Korean Drama of the same name. So comparsion of this anime with the original show is inevitable maybe for people who have seen the drama. (I havent). The story chronicles the hardships the main protagonists go through due to past mistakes of their elders.  
 
Story[10/10]: Very innovative story. Plus its a full romance series of unconditional love between the main male and female protagonist. And quiet an assertive one in expressing the exact rosy lines every romance series lover wishes to hear at some point of time while watching, in my opinion. I loved the series exactly for this point. Its not a typical high school romance or the normal slice of life genre show. It is a romance between two grown ups (25+ age) so many of the fans of teenager/highschool romance might not feel it very welcoming. But still I insist to watch this really nice story. There's a love traingle invovled but these relationships have been shown extremely well and every bit believable.  
 
Art[10/10]: The art again though not of the typical shoujo anime as simple yet beautiful. And I think the charm of each character actually is brought out nicely in the art. background scenes, though landscapes are not too many in the show are nicely done. 
 
Sound[10/10]: The language is Korean for the anime which is difficult to adjust to in listening at the beginning but you'll get a hang of it eventually. I only felt that maybe a younger sounding voice for the main male and female protagonists could have suited better. I mean they are grown up but not like 40-50. But the strongest point in the sound section definitely has to be the beautiful Piano peices and the OP, ED and insert songs. All again romance theme based which help out a lot in building the atmosphere even more in the episodes. Especially the OP is very catchy. 
 
Character[10/10]: Wonderfully developed again. Very strong and believable. Even the supporting cast has a good impact on the flow of the story for most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment[10/10]: I personally thoroughly enjoyed the show with some sudden twists in the plot executed aptly. Plus it was the first time I have seen an anime where the main characters are assertive about their feelings for each other. It really moves you to tears sometimes. 
 
Overall[10/10]: 1) Very innovative story 
2) Full romance series 
3) May not be liked by a younger audience below 20 since the story itself contains characters who are a bit older. 
4) Very soothing Piano pieces 
5) Well developed plot and good continuity of the story. 
 
Just loved this experience :)

          
 
       Helpful Winter Sonata revolves around a love triangle between Yujin, Sanghyuk and Joonsang. There are many one sided loves involved and the heartbreaking moments are constant. There was barely any down time for me to recover from all the sad happenings. 
 
Throughout the series, the love triangle creates the domino effect: hurting one after or another.  
 
The art is nothing to be amazed at, but it's nice enough to enjoy. The animations were a little rough, but overall, it's appealing to the eye. 
 
My favorite character would have to be Sanghyuk. In my mind, he suffered the most throughout the whole plot. *Light spoilers* He leads a one sided love with Yujin, trying to replace the shoes of her first love for 10 years...from Yujin's perspective, she dragged Sanghyuk through the mud knowing deep down she never once loved Sanghyuk while he's pouring out everything for her. She lied to him, accepting his marriage proposal. Even after all the confessions from Yujin, he always stood by her. For me at least, he was the bigger man and did all he could for her. Overall, his character hit me the hardest and despite the ending, I still feel he's suffering inside.  
 
So! Watch this if you want a romance story that will keep you on your edge, urging you to find out what's going to happen next!

3,2269,36,11.13253453,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Special Edition,"Three TV movies complied from  Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED  series. 
 
1. The Empty Battlefield (Kokuu no Senjou) 
2. The Far-Away Dawn (Harukanaru Akatsuki) 
3. The Rumbling Sky (Meidou no Sora) 
 
Much like the  Kidou Senshi Gundam  theatrical movies, the  Gundam Seed: Special Edition  movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series. 
 
These episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1�C21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22�C40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41�C50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.

If you want to find the answers, than these movies are for you.

          
 
       Helpful I only give this anime a low score because i have ONLY seen the first movie, but I am going to watch all 3.  
 
In all honesty I love Gundam SEED/Destiny, but I did not have the time to re-watch the entire series, so I figured I'd watch the movies. The first movie is....well terrible, in comparison to the actual series, the whole movie is just a bunch of clips from the series, with a few new scenes here and there. If you have not seen the series, I would recomend watching it instead of this movie only because they cut out so much from the story that you are not able to connect with the characters! Its seems that all these caracters have no depth to them at all, which is not the case! The story suffers much as well, with so much cut out. 
 
The only reason I finished the movie was to see then new scenes and see if I would learn something new about the characters or plot, but sadly that was not the case. 
 
This movie crams about the first 20 episodes or so into a short lifespan(95min), so what would you expect? 
 
bottom line, make time for the series if you have not seen it and skip this movie. You should really only watch this movie if you are a die-hard fan and you MUST see anything Gundam SEED/Destiny related.

          
 
       Helpful The main problem I have with pretty much all the Gundam series is that they are far too long for what they are.  The release of the movies pretty much guarantees that I can watch these shows without being bored by useless drama and filler.  All of the Gundam movies have done a great job of rounding out the series into a succinct bundle that allows a viewer who doesn't want to parse 50 episodes to sit down and watch a set of movies. 
 
That being said, I first was recommended Gundam SEED from friends who thought the anime was groundbreaking and excellent.  After watching a couple of episodes of the series, I could tell I was going to have to deal with the ""Gundam Drag"" in this show, as well.  Instead of writing off the show as too slow, I decided to watch the much more concise movies. 
 
I will admit, I wasn't terribly impressed by the story.  The plot was very much scripted from previous Gundams, which is pretty much understood to be the norm for any Gundam series, but I felt some of the character interactions let it at least stand alone as a separate entity.  If you have watched another Gundam series, except for a few of the lesser projects, then you will not be superbly impressed by this one.  Both the start and end of the plot are near carbon copies of other Gundams, only the culmination of events is slightly different. 
 
Even so, the films still seem to deliver.  In the little time that the series of movies has to capture your attention, it is easy to get attached to or disgusted with any of the characters.  As the events unfold, nearly every moment is enjoyable and feels somewhat fresh.  
 
As long as you don't start role-casting from other Gundams like I found myself doing, you should be able to enjoy these films in their entirety and not have to worry about far too much time spent watching the entire series.

3,240,37,11.09192095,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Genshiken,"Kanji Sasahara is an introverted college freshman just looking for a place to fit in. One day, he happens to stumble upon the club known as the Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture―otherwise known as Genshiken―that serves to bring the full spectrum of otaku culture together. His first visit to the club, however, does not end well as Sasahara's pride is crushed by his senior, Harunobu Madarame, and he leaves the meeting in full denial of his otaku nature. However, after befriending club member Makoto Kousaka, who turns out to be a hardcore otaku despite his looks, Sasahara becomes more involved with club activities which include obsessing over their favorite anime, reading doujinshi, and attending conventions. There, he meets other interesting people like Kousaka's vehemently non-otaku girlfriend Saki Kasukabe, who strives to turn her boyfriend into a ""normal guy."" 
 
While Saki struggles to understand otaku culture and her boyfriend's love for it, Sasahara finds himself enjoying his time at Genshiken, gradually shedding any denial he once had about being an otaku and immersing himself in an otaku lifestyle.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","BANG POW CRASH SMUSH , Genshiken avoids the cliches and focuses instead on the reality, this isn't a series about spectacular super human ninjas that were injected with magical fox semen,  it's about the otaku subculture in Japan, it's about the people that are the otaku's and the choices they make , there goals ambitions lifestyles failures and successes. Watching this series, which is hard to get into unless you've read the manga ( Doujin Work ) you really start rooting for the characters, when things happen you hold your mouth in shock, you feel the jealousy and taste the dislike in the back of your throat it's really an anime that pulls you in and keeps you there with humor , intelligence , games , hatred and love.

       Helpful College slices of life are rare in a medium prolific with high school romances, 15-year-old pilots in mecha, gargantuan harems, and everything inbetween. In comes Genshiken, one of the most laidback and down to earth shows I've ever seen. The heavy amount of realism is almost shocking, and the college club slice of life elements are fantastic. Picturing a life in an otaku club can't get anymore immersible than this, with a solid lead character that's relatable (much like Yuuta from Honey & Clover), and an all-around fantastic ensemble. You know you're in for a ride when your appreciation for Genshiken's comedy is directly proportional to how awkward your social skills are. 
 
Perhaps what's most striking about Genshiken is its crassness with the ins and outs of otaku culture. The show manages to hit the main crevices on otakudom―whether it be compulsively watching midnight screenings, purchasing doujinshi, cosplaying, or even building models. Genshiken intends neither to glorify nor criticize the underlying culture; what merely exists is prevalent, and Genshiken deftly and unbiasedly documents it. 
 
What's also admirable is how forward Genshiken is in its storytelling, particularly with not dodging borderline controversial material. Saki, for instance, constantly berates others with her sexually frustrated problems, and admits that one of the main reasons she dates Kohsaka is because of his looks. Frankness with sexual content is to be expected of in western shows, but is fairly commendable for one within an otaku-glorified medium. Even holding hands may take an anime multiple seasons! (Yes, Japan may not be so forward as in western cultures, but ""purity"" is nowhere even close to what's perceived in pandering anime versus real-life Japan.) 
 
Genshiken's unparalleled persistence to realism almost becomes one of its few flaws, as the show is practically uneventful―even for slice of life standards. This is where you have to wonder when the mundane is pulled too far. One episode could be so briefly summarized as, ""Saki reads manga in the clubroom while Madarame tries to strike up a conversation."" The work is almost Hyouka-esque in its banality, but fortunately, Genshiken is told in such a charming way that you often forget that nothing even happened in the episodes (and it's also not spoiled by silly ""mystery"" antics like Hyouka's first half). 
 
The ""new guy in the group"" manages to be an archetype served well here, as it grants viewers the insight into what would otherwise be a closeted (and hence alienable) culture. To divy the variety, the role is often placed among different members of the group (particularly with Sasahara and Saki) depending on the situation. However, Genshiken's cast performance is not all as great as the concept bears to mind. Certain characters are unfortunately pivoted towards the sidelines while the few with inherently more interesting premises take up the primary spotlight. Saki becomes the de facto main lead (while already the poster girl), and Sasahara is more or less forgettable during most of his screentime. He spends his idle time blending in and never doing anything that stands out, offering comedic reactions in uniform with the rest of the group. What makes this truly unfortunate is that given the ensemble's individual premises, each character offers a certain flavor of comedy to enhance every scene. Instead, we're served the same glops of behaviors and comedic variety each episode, which quickly diminishes one's entertainment via pure redundancy. Sure, the topics change and the group slowly mingles more and more, but the character dynamics and per-character screentimes remain relatively the same. 
 
The animation and artwork is dated and quickly shows its age from a cursory glance. A most noticeable resemblance would be to the often compared work, Welcome to the NHK!. In both, the visuals are frankly quite terrible, but this is mostly forgivable due to their comedy subgenre anyways. Works like Genshiken don't necessarily rely on compelling production values to ample its enjoyment, and there are never situations where you feel more detailed visuals would have benefited a particular scene. On the audio side, the soundtrack is practically nonexistent, which complements the laidback, relatable atmosphere of the show (especially with all the awkward scenes). Production-wise as a whole, things here are cheap as Mexican candy, but so what? It works. 
 
Genshiken is a fantastic, homey slice of life that places itself in a genre difficult to come across these days. The ensemble has its flaws, but overall the casual storytelling really takes center stage and makes up for this. The cast slowly yet noticeably grows with each other, and the uneventfulness of Genshiken really grows on you. This is certainly not a show to miss, and I look forward to its newest season. Hopefully it'll retain the same charm that makes the show so endearing.

       Helpful If you are an Otaku, then you should probably watch this series. You'll definitely find yourself identifying with one of the characters, if not most of them. And wish that you had such an inclusive club to develop your inner otaku. Its a wonderful study of Japanese culture featuring anime, plamos, games, cosplay, manga, and dōjinshi. I recommend watching a good fansub that includes definitions of various otaku slang, if you aren't familiar with them. As a fairly new otaku, I found myself learning alot of new things about the culture. So yeah this anime doesn't have magical girls, aliens, or giant robots, it does have various otakus willing to debate those subjects and brave an army of other crazy otakus, just to get the latest dōjinshi. If you have a favorite Gundam series and are willing to fight for it you may even find yourself siding with characters. Not to mention the various name drops and cameos of anime, and games. So take a chance and watch this ""realistic"" anime, you'll be surprised how much you have in common.

3,10500,38,11.03947872,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Ojiisan no Lamp,"When a young boy named Tooichi stumbles upon an old lamp in his grandfather's shed, he mistakes it for a toy and takes it outside to play. When his grandfather discovers this, he reprimands the boy and begins recounting the story behind the artifact―of how a small, traditional Japanese town became Westernized.  
 
In his youth, Tooichi's grandfather, Minosuke, made a living by doing errands and chores for the townspeople. After one errand takes him to a nearby town, he witnesses Western lamps―a technology unfamiliar to him―light up the streets, igniting a spark in the young boy. From that moment on, lamps became Minosuke's passion and profession, changing his and the townspeople's lives forever. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Historical']",none,"This is very cheesy and mellow-dramatic. People have been dealing with new tech out-dating old tech for centuries it's not something that's particularly unique to electricity or oil. Not to say there's nothing particularly interesting about the history of electric technology itself but based on the dramatic implications that this short film's narrative, which it definitely does not earn implies, it's very bare-bones surface-level take is supposed to suffice.  
 
As a result of the shallow narrative that doesn't get explored any more than some broad strokes emotional levels (of which we have about 10 minutes of screen time to soak in) the story feels woefully underwhelming.  
 
It doesn't feel particularly like movie about love, ancestry, devotion, the passage of time, the real, the supernatural, anything really. Rather it feels like an outline that could have one day been turned into something more cohesive. Even when I've seen these ideas explored better in movies with x4 times the budget, length, and aesthetic sense it still takes quite a lot for me to meaningfully distinguish them in my mind. 
 
Will probably forget about this one after a few days.

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
My quest to review the entries of the  2011 Future Animator Contest continues with the one shot anime that won the contest and was widely considered the best. That anime is Grandfather’s Lamp. 
 
The story starts in 1930s Japan when a young boy comes across an old oil lamp and is quick to discard it. This displeases the boy’s grandfather, who proceeds to tell the young boy the importance that the lamp played in his life. When he was his grandson’s age, the grandpa worked in a rice field rather than attend school and had to use flint and tinder to start fires. When the Western technology of the oil lamp was introduced to his rural farming village, he was enthralled with this revolutionary technology and decided to become a lamp salesman. His grandmother saw the oil lamps as demonic and frightening at first, but gradually grew to accept them. For the first 20 years, the Grandpa’s business did very well and he married a beautiful wife and had 2 children. Then to his utter horror, his business was rendered obsolete overnight when electricity was introduced to the town. He tried to scare the other villagers and told them that electricity was evil magic and basically reacted the same way his grandmother had to the oil lamp. Although he was initially furious and emotionally crushed, he realized that he couldn't be left behind and had to change his livelihood. He was then able to move on with a new dream. 
 
The theme of this anime is the passage of time and how we can’t stop change. We must learn to accept that things change and adapt along with them. This particular example uses the astonishingly rapid modernization of Japan in the late 1800s and its transformation from a technologically backwards agrarian nation to a modern industrial nation in just a single lifetime. History has seen a number of great jumps like this, but Japan’s post Meiji  Revolution jump is often viewed as one of the most dramatic and definitive examples. The anime wisely avoids the pitfalls of nostalgia and saying one time period is better than another. It instead looks passively and objectively at the fast flow of time and just how much the world can change in a single human lifetime. This anime is well animated, artful, and fairly thought provoking. Compared to the other entries in this contest, I can certainly see why this won. 
 
The only real flaw I could see as a critic was that it could be accused of getting a tad sentimental at times. I find it amusing that this entry was clearly trying SO hard to win the contest, while the other entries are just playful and goofy. This was competing against a folktale parody about a spider-demon loli! Imagine a film contest in which “Boyhood” was up against “Freddy Got Fingered”. It doesn't even seem fair, but rather like bringing a grenade launcher to a fist fight! Was Grandfather's Lamp guilty of being ""award bait""? 
 
The answer to that last question is difficult to answer because what constitutes “award bait” actually depends entirely on the specific contest and what its judges are like. For example, “Oscar Bait” is NOT the same as “Cannes bait”. What do I mean by that? A good example of something that would be great for Cannes, but have no prayer at the Oscars is Mushishi. The major American film critics all called the live action version of Mushishi “boring, pretentious, garbage!” In the world of cinema, American film critics are notorious for being what anime snobs on MAL and 4chan call “filthy casuals”. The most respected film critics in the world are people like Sights and Sound Magazine in the UK. If you look at their top 100 films of all time, you will notice that the vast majority weren’t even nominated for the academy awards. Mushishi is an attempt to create an anime version of a very specific style of Euro art film in which plot and characters don’t really matter and it is ALL about surrealist imagery and existential artsyness. An example of the type of film that Mushishi clearly wanted to be like is “Stalker” from 1979. European film critics went NUTS over it and proclaimed it a masterpiece while American critics called it boring and pretentious and snubbed it in every category of the 1979 Oscars. Instead the Americans nominated several mediocre films like “Unmarried Woman”, “Coming Home”, and “Midnight Express”. Of course the French and British laughed their asses off at how profoundly stupid and uncultured the Oscar judges were and said that Stalker should have easily won: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Camera Editing hands down! My point is that I don’t know what the 2011 Future Animator judges were like and if this was indeed guilty of being award bait. It does kind of seem like it though. 


          
 
       Helpful From time to time, there are anime which make us think hard and others which convey their message effortlessly. Ojii-san no Lamp falls in the latter category. It is about passion and attachment to the things we love and how at some point of time we are required to look beyond them and move ahead. It is about modernization and the pangs of sorrow which it brings to some people. The story told by the grandfather here to his grandson has a soothing tone. The emotions are conveyed effortlessly. A linear progression of storyline makes it easier to grasp the emotions felt by Minosuke, the lead character. 
 
The story is about an old man who one day finds his grandson playing with a decades-old floor lamp. He had completely forgotten that he still had it. That evening, he tells his grandson a story about himself, Minosuke,  from when he was a child. He then takes us on a relaxing ride through his life, right from his childhood to when he became an adult. He narrates how he first came to see the wonderous device called a 'Lamp' in a far-off town and fell in love with its glowing beauty at first sight. With his high spirits and optimistic nature, he decides to light up his own town with the lamps. In time, he grows up to be a successful lamp merchant. He starts a family and continues his happy life until a new technology, electricity, arrives in the neighboring town threatening lamps to become useless and thereby endangering his business as a whole. 
 
How he copes with the drastic modernization is what constitutes the rest of the film. Letting go of the things we love most is always difficult but sometimes it is neccessary to do so to progress. Embracing new things and ways of life is the way to move forward in life and that is precisely what Minosuke tries to say. It is painful but once accomplised, it brings a sense of peace. 
 
The animation is of good quality and complements the village scenes to bring about their true beauty. The voice actors did a fine job and at certain moments like in the ending scene, they manage to make you really feel the words being spoken. 
 
These days, I don't usually have enough time to watch an anime series so I decided to watch the anime movies. And this is one decision I do not regret after watching this. Of course, it is not as good as Harmonie or Kotonoha no Niwa or some other movies you may have watched but it does almost perfectly everyhing that it was supposed to which makes it a very good and satisfying watch :)

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Dementia']",none,"Pop Team Epic is the name. Offering jokes that make no sense its game. Like it or not, it's all the same. Your sense of humor is to blame.  
 
Philosophers, fools and shitposters all around the globe have been asking this question recently, but also since the dawn of tragicomedy: What makes a joke funny? Is there a single factor that answers to this question? Everything can be funny as long as it is presented in the preferred way. Much like with anime series, it is all about the execution. But this is still all about personal preferences, perspective and knowledge. How can a popculture reference deliver if one does not know what is is referring to? The original question has been answered already hundreds of times: The funny was inside you all along. #deep  #derp 
 
Pop Team Epic is a series thats target audience is the whole internet culture. Its jokes varie greatly from parodies to live action interviews. From original content to ridiculously bad coaxed into a snafu-tier memes. It's even familiar with taiwanese puppet shows, obscurities of all sort, and awkward elevator music. The series has a bit of everything, and for this reason its writing is full of quality differences. It's nearly impossible for every joke appeal to all viewers. Almost every joke in it can be understood in different ways and found to be funny/not funny for different reasons. This is quite original for comedy series and part of the reason why I found the series to be worth of my time so much that I watched it twice. There has been quite a few obscure comedies in the past, such as Masuda Kousuke Gekijou, Gag Manga Biyori and Tensai Senshi, but none of them successful.  
 
The actual idea behind the series production is fairly interesting. It shows us how much voice actors can change the tone of the series and the aspects of jokes. Every episode is approximately 24 minutes long, but in practice it is just 12 minutes of either identical or highly similar content. The main difference are the voice actors. Other half is presented with male seiyuus and the another with female seiyuus. The male version typically also comes with extras such as quest analysis, voice-over live action reaction to the joke, and whatever else.  
 
I enjoyed this series for its uniqueness, different approach, and scenes such as flip-cover live action music show presented by 2 members of the production team. There is simply no other anime in existence that would even try to do content like this. It alone is worth of something: worth of giving Pop Team Epic a go. 

          
 
       Helpful First of all, right after watching episode 1, I thought of dropping the series because I didn't find it funny. I only had small giggles here and there, and I had a lot of questions in mind about the series when I started watching it (i.e, ""Why is it Hoshiiro Girldrop? I thought it was Pop Team Epic"", ""I don't think any kinda anime would work without a solid story"", ""Do these 4-panel comedy manga's even work as a successful anime?"", etc. etc.) 
 
Luckily, I caught up with this series up until the release of episode 2. I wanted to give the series a chance (actually, because of curiosity), and LOVED it. The reasons were mainly because of the memes, parodies, and over-all randomness. Because of that, I waited in hope for the future episodes with high expectations to only sink in despair. It wasn't what I thought it'd be like. 
 
Despite my hype for the series dying down, it's still a pretty great anime. Would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who likes memes, Western pop culture, and just for the overall randomness. 
 
(I'll probably write a more critical review once the series is finished, kinda depends if it's a negative or a positive one, though)

          
 
       Helpful This was definitely an interesting one. In a way, it reminds me of an anime version of Robot Chicken, in the manner that it's a surreal animated sketch comedy block full of pop culture references and parodies. It's one of those series that's you'll either love or hate, and let me tell you, I loved it! Every episode had me laughing to the point of crying from start to finish, with my favorite segment of them all easily being the one with the Skyline GT-R. With the assortment of different art styles and over-the-top humor, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I also found it really interesting that the block repeated with two different voice actors, and that there were minute differences in dialogue in them that one might not catch upon first viewing unless you're really paying attention. That being said, this one's unique style puts it leaps and bounds in front of everything else in terms of uniqueness. And let me tell you, the experience definitely pairs well with a bottle of Absolut at the ready. ^w^

Art (7/10) 
Maybe the best part(?). It gives me cute and cheerful feeling. Character models are well-drawn and move smoothly. The background is colorful and detailed.  
 
Sound (7/10) 
The song is ""Ima koko kara"", also used in the full movie of the same name. It's about a girl with the dream to change the world. Very ear-catching tune and easy to understand lyrics. 
 
Character (5/10) 
Because this video itself a music clip, of course there's no character development. The main characters are from the lastest Precure series, Go! Princess Precure. They appeared first, then all older Precure made their appearance. 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) 
I hope Toei make more stuff like this. 
 
Overall (7/10) 
If you are a fan of Precure, this video is for you. Or you want to find a short, light-hearted one to watch, I'd like to recommend this to you.

3,4948,41,10.78703344,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke,"""Magic Boy"" was the first ever Japanese animation to be released theatrically in North America.  
 
Sasuke, a boy vexed by an evil witch, studies magic and uses his powers to defeat her.  
 
(Source: bcdb) ","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"Script - A boy learns magic to defeat an evil witch. It's a simplistic black and white tale that only children would appreciate in terms of writing. Historic anachronism isn't something I'm a fan of and the film surely had value for its time, where japanese people were still trying to restore their cultural pride. But it's simply unavoidable to not ignore the silliness in which the plot is based. The protagonist goes after the witch and means to defeat her because she harmed one of his animal friends, but instead of facing a specific struggle, everything is quite easy if you think about it. Apparently, he has the talent, the bravery and intelligence to do as he wants and, at the end, everything is solved without a drop of poignancy whatsoever. It has a way more natural dialogue than its predecessor Hakujaden and the pacing is also faster and will probably not bore one to death, but that also doesn't help beyond it not staying more than necessary. Some stories simply age better, some don't. Time is cruel and simplism is not by far my cup of tea, regardless of period. 
 
Cinematography - Considering its predecessor for some reason is more famous and regarded, I must say it's actually better visually than Hakujaden. The faces are thin and sometimes very weird, but overall the care is notable and impressive most of the time. It's a movie and it was surely ambitious technically speaking. The movements are more natural than Hakujaden as well and less idealized. Good stuff. 
 
Sound - The voices are ok for its time. They're less annoying and more tuned to the mood of the show. Forced, but not bad for sure. The soundtrack is fine, the sound effects are actually very good, and I was surprised. It's common to hear a lot of buzzes and outplaced tracks here and there, so it's a plus. 
 
1234 - I prefer not to nitpick about this, I feel like it's a waste of my time. Whatever I've noticed as flawed or weak is not gonna pass unnoticed by anyone else. However, something that always bugs me and for some reason persists until this very day is the lack of interest in subverting the trope 'ugly bastard'. Seriously, it's impossible to imagine a show from the time doing something out of the rule 'good is pretty, bad is ugly' and honestly, something like that is what could have made this show a lot better. Wanna make a faithful adaptation, cool, but you can change some minor details in order to surprise your viewers as long they make sense. Try it. 
 
This is a show you can watch and will probably not be a bad experience, but time has ruined its intent. Its moral values and messages are as poignant as the more mediocre Disney movie ever and besides the aesthetics, there's nothing to it at all. Still, I respect the ambition and understand the intent pretty well. The End.

          
 
       Helpful Following Hakujaden, this picture also begs the question of why the screenwriters couldn't simply mesh what was clearly meant to appeal to children and the actual storyline. These old movies can feel so divided between the gratuitous cuteness and what supposedly matters. I know the moral lesson, whichever it is, can only be absorbed by sticking to the latter, but that takes a lot of potential quality away. Like with Hakujaden, I'd rather spend one hour watching cute animals doing cute stuff than boring main characters fighting over something I don't care about that happens to be constantly discontinued for the sake of pleasing kids, which boils down to one request: make an actual children's movie god damn it! Japanese animators had such attachment to their folklore, but it was only when they started thinking outside the box the problem ceased to be. That could also have been avoided by making Sasuke's journey interesting to begin with, which sadly never happened. It's as boring as you get. The movie is an improvement on its predecessor and far more pleasing to watch given the fact being colored isn't its only concern. Here we also see the first semblance of accurately moving mouths. There really isn't much else to say. At least it's not as bad as Saiyuuki.

          
 
       Helpful I would like to state first and foremost that this is an extremely important anime historically. This was one of the first theatrically released feature films from Toei Animation. It was also one of the first colored anime features films. The impact that this film had on anime as a whole is huge. That said, this film has not aged very well. 
 
Story: 4 
The story is all over the place. It takes forever for the main conflict to get started. First we follow some woodland creatures until one of them gets killed. Then we follow Sasuke as he goes to train and learn magic. Then there's something about bandits. And then the bandits disappear for a bit. But then by the time Sasuke's done training, you've forgotten why he left in the first place. Then we have to worry about his sister that got kidnapped. The pacing is inconsistent, and conflicts are thrown around until you forget about earlier ones. Also be careful of which subs you watch. Sometimes the subs are flat out wrong. Even with my limited Japanese, I could tell that certain phrases were incorrect. This can lead to further confusion if you can't catch the errors. 
 
Art: 7 
The art on the other hand is the best part of this movie. The character designs suffer from weird anatomy and creepy faces. You could tell they were trying to copy Disney, while still making the film ""Japanese."" However, they hit a slightly uncanny valley in that regard. It's not too bad. But it does take out some of the immersion in some scenes. The animals on the other hand are done very well. The backgrounds are also nice. I absolutely love the way the animation things like fire, teleportation and liquid.    
 
Sound: 7 
Another highlight of the film. Aside from some inconsistent lip sync (which is more an art problem than a sound problem) the sound is integrated very well into the film. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about. But things like whip cracks, lightning and other sound effects are very well done. The soundtrack is appropriate and well done. 
 
Character: 3 
The characters have little to no character whatsoever. Sasuke is a generic determined boy. His sister doesn't even have a name (or at least in the subs I saw she didn't.) The prince and witch are generic as well. Oddly the side characters have more character than most of the main cast. There is a side plot about a girl that won't leave these two bandits alone after they stole her trunk. That plot point gets forgotten about. But the lengths the bandits go to try and make her go away were entertaining. The girl however was annoying as hell. Most of the animals have their own quirks. But it's not enough to carry a whole movie. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
In spite of this movie's flaws, I did enjoy it a bit. There was a final showdown between the witch and Sasuke that was very well done. The bandits and girl side plot was funny, even if it never got resolved. There was a scene involving a deer trying to follow Sasuke that I liked. There are things to enjoy about this movie. If you are an enthusiast I could see somebody being mildly entertained. The film is also made more fun by trying to point out all of the Snow White and Sleeping Beauty tropes that were probably being borrowed in this film. 
 
Overall: 5 
Like I said before, this film is historically important. If you are a film historian, then this will not be the worst film you've ever seen. However, this movie still has not aged well at all. You could tell a lot of effort was put into this film. And in some areas like animation and sound, that hard work has paid off. I just wish more thought was put into things like pacing, character and story.

3,63,42,10.72588155,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,DearS,"One year ago, a UFO containing 150 aliens crash-landed off the shores of Kasai. Because no one could fix their ship, the Japanese Government decided to bestow upon them the designation ""DearS"" and make them into Japanese citizens, teaching them the language, customs, and culture of Japan. However, in order for them to become more familiar with human society, a home-stay program has been enacted to allow them to mingle with other humans. 
 
One misty morning, a truck carrying a capsule that housed one of these aliens ends up dropping it into the riverbank, releasing her from her confinement. She is eventually found by a high school student named Takeya Ikuhara, who saves her from being hit by a truck and takes pity on her, despite being extremely distrustful of their race and wanting nothing to do with them. Upon being named Ren, she imprints upon him as her ""Master"" and serves as his personal ""Slave,"" leaving him with a ""DearS"" who wants to remain with him no matter what and bringing his ordinary, alien-free days to an end.","['Sci-Fi', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Shounen']",none,"Before i start the review. i want to let you know that i mainly focus on slice of a life anime's. I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime's i've seen so far, so don't mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime's and want to discover more>  
 
Ahh. Dear's. That's where it all began. Back when i was younger and didn't like anime. My older brother tried to convince me to just watch it. And dearS was the first Anime serie that i gave it a shot. I have to say. Most people wouldn't be happy if this anime would be their introduction / first anime ever to watch. After finishing it. I loved the story. The way the mc and the female grew together. Made me like the story. But then i discovered that it's not the story what i like. But it's the genre! I've seen this anime around 8 ~ 9 times. And then i wanted more anime's like this. Anyway's let's go start with the review!  
 
Story.  
It is just a harem.  Nothing more, nothing less. The story is about a guy that find's a naked girl on the street's and thinking, oh hey let's bring her to my house. Not really realistic. But if this anime was realistic then it wouldn't be an Anime. The story isn't really a story. But just random action's that happend's between the school and the mc with hes ''Slave'' (Yes according to this story an UFO crashed into earth and all the alien's are slave's, and ofcourse smokin' hot.) The action's between the MC and ''Ren'' (hes alien slave he picked on the street's) are growing more and more together. And ofcourse having the predictable ''porn hidden magazine's under the bed , oops i feel something soft let's grab it more oh my god it's a boob and even more perverted character's then hugh heffner situations''. Except that they grow closer to eachother every episode there isn't a big story line on it. But then in the last episode it get's interessting. But end's with nothing special. They hint to another season. But never come's because it's so impopulair.  
Because this was my first anime ever. And directed me to the other great anime's i've seen i give it a fair 6.  
 
Art. 
There's nothing wrong with the art. Even though the creator's want to make something ecchi and perverted. But also blur out thing's. I think that's a bit dissapointing. It's not that i'm waiting for drawn boob's. Either decide to make a ecchi Anime where you see something. Or don't do ecchi stuff. But a boob without a nipple just look's silly. Even though this Anime is pretty old. The animation's and background's are worth a 7.  
 
Sound. 
The intro is beyond annoying. And the music during the show isn't special. And you can clearly notice that there wasn't much budget to that. The only good ost i loved was the ''silly moment's music''. But that's about it. 6 for the music.  
 
Character's.  
We got the MC. We got he's slave. Another slave female that join's the school. And the typical not intressting best female friend. And some side character's that are either way to perverted. Or trying to fan service the viewer's. The 12 episode's are filled without any information.  They could have done better. I give it a 6.  
 
Enjoyment.  
I did enjoy this serie (otherwise i wouldn't have re-watched the serie that much) But on the other hand. Seeing how serie's like Chobits and Plastic memories does. Is this not really good. The story isn't special. It sure had some moment's where i laughed. But in the end. Thinking back it's just a serie that try's to get their credit's by doing fan services. (On a bad way) And I'm not a big fan of watching at animated boobie's.  So i give it a 6.  
 
Overall.  
Plastic memories, Chobit's , DearS have all the weird thing in common. A avarage human that love's something weird , Either if it's robot's or an Alien. I don't think it's the best one of these 3. Sure it's a fun no brainer to watch. It's decent enough to fill 12 x 25 minute's. But there's better out there. I give this serie a 6. but i want to thank DearS for introducing me in this awesome anime world. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, the reason I wanted to watch DearS is because it has received so many negative reviews. After viewing the series in its entirety, I do feel it has problems, but for the most part I found the show enjoyable. 
 
Story (7): 
 
The story begins with a spaceship full of aliens called DearS crashing on earth. The humans accept these aliens and they are allowed citizenship in Japan. It seems that most of society is obsessed with the DearS, offering them special privileges, and pretty much fawning over them. 
 
One DearS in particular who is considered malfunctioned is accidentally released. This DearS who accepts the name Ren meets a high school boy Takeya, who hates aliens, including the DearS. However, seeing that she is alone and in poor shape, Takeya takes her to recover at his house. Ren accepts Takeya as her master, a fact that he is not willing to accept. Nonetheless, Ren tries her hardest to make Takeya happy, many times fueling his anger and annoyance at her failures and misunderstandings. 
 
I think the story is pretty original. While it may come off as over the top in some cases, I think it adds to the overall story. I like the interactions between the characters.  
 
I like the majority of the humor in this anime. It's funny to see how hard Ren tries to please Takeya, only for her to continually mess up. Also the scenes of rivalry between Ren and Miu (a more dedicated DearS) is fun to watch. While on the subject of humor, there are random scenes with two middle-aged women haggling with a fish salesman, that has no relevance to the plot, but the exchanges provide some of the best comedy. 
 
There are a few cons with this anime. For one, it doesn't seem to fit into a specific genre. From what I viewed it can be classified as the following: science fiction, harem, romance, drama, school, ecchi, comedy, and magical. I also feel that the ecchi elements are overdone and unnecessary to the point that it distracts from the story. 
 
Another con is the fact that literally everyone, aside from Takeya, is obsessed with the DearS. I can understand being intrigued by actual aliens, but the level of obsession comes across as unrealistic and overdone. 
 
Also there is some confusion on the DearS' laws. I won't go into detail about this, but some of the rules, especially concerning their purpose for existence, seems to contradict itself.  
 
Characters (5): 
 
The characters are a hit or miss for me. There are some that I absolutely adore, and others that irritate me everytime they appear on screen.  
 
To begin with, the main character Takeya is a typical high school student. He lives on his own, requiring him to work a part-time job after school. He is portrayed as rude and abrasive. I like this character. This is a character I haven't seen very often in anime, so I applaud DearS for having someone with this type of personality as a protagonist. Takeya stands out from many other harem anime leads. 
 
I find the secondary character, Ren, to be likable. Due to her not having a formal DearS education, there is a lot that she does not understand. In fact, Ren actually says, ""Ren does not understand,"" or a variation of that phrase countless times in the anime. Despite her ignorance, Ren is shown to be trying her hardest in every task assigned to her, making for a few comical moments. Even with her failures, she can still win the audience's hearts. 
 
I like how Takeya and Ren grow together. While at first Takeya hates the thought of looking after Ren, it is cute to watch their relationship grow. It's clear that Takeya does try to protect Ren, and encourages her to think for herself.  
 
Takeya's friend Neneko is a supporting character who helps Takeya out with his unfortunate problem. She serves as a helpful companion for Takeya, strong where he is lacking. I think it would have been difficult for Takeya to get through the beginning of his relationship with Ren had it not been for Neneko's assistance.  
 
The other main DearS character, Miu, serves as a foil for Ren. Unlike Ren, she has been well taught, and is proud of her accomplishments. It angers her greatly to see how much Ren lacks, and how she is allowed to get away with her unorthodox behavior. At first it may seem that Miu is being unnecessarily mean to Ren, but in episode eight, the audience gets a glimpse at her backstory, which explains why she strongly believes good intentions are not enough. Of all the characters, I find Miu to be the one who develops the most throughout the story. Some of my favorite scenes are the endearing interactions between Miu and her host family. 
 
As mentioned earlier, the nameless side characters add to the comedy and ambiance of the show. 
 
However, there are three characters in particular that I found annoying. 
 
The first is the catlike DearS Nia. I'm sure she is supposed to be cute, and maybe in the original audio she is (I watched the dubbed version), but I found her to be a nuisance. For one, she's all over the place, always forgetting about her mission. I can't take her seriously, which makes me unable to take all of the DearS community leaders seriously. Secondly, the constant repetition of ""Nia, nia, nia"" during her dialogue gets old quick. It's not cute, just annoying. Again, I'm not sure if this exists in the original audio, but I cringed everytime she spoke in the English dub. 
 
As annoying as Nia may be, she is a mere speck compared to Takeya's little sister, Natsuki. I was ready for her to leave the instant she was introduced. Whereas Nia serves a purpose to the plot, Natsuki is completely irrelevant to the story. If she was omitted from what little screen time she gets, nothing about the plot would change. She is rude to Ren, violent towards Takeya, and won't allow anyone to get a word in before jumping to conclusions. In short, she is frustrating to watch. 
 
Then of course there is Takeya's teacher. I think she is meant for comic relief, however I feel uncomfortable watching any scene including her. Sadly, she had the potential to be funny, but she is so exaggerated that it ruins the ""humor"" for me.  
 
Art (6): 
 
The character designs are interesting. I like how there is a distinct difference between the humans and the aliens. The humans have a more neutral color scheme whereas the DearS are full of color. The aliens have the unnatural hair colors anime is famous for, they have the colorful cultural costumes. Their eyes are larger and on the whole are designed to be more beautiful than the human characters. Even the male DearS such as Khi and Xaki stand out from the earthlings. 
 
On the same note, I think it's an interesting choice that the protagonist is designed to look plain, even among the other humans. The other male characters in his class have more interesting designs (and personalities). I guess this choice was made so that by having him not stand out, he ironically does. Also, perhaps it was to give more attention to the aliens by comparison. It could also represent that he is the only person who is not enchanted by the DearS. Whatever the reason, I found it to be an effective decision. 
 
I also found the animation to be pretty.  
 
Sound (4): 
 
I watched the English dub of this anime, so I can't say much on the original audio. I found the dub acting to be decent. Aside from Nia's dialogue, I have no complaints with the voice acting. 
 
I found the opening song to be boring (both the tempo and the singing). The ending song is more upbeat, but nothing too impressive. 
 
Conclusion (6):  
 
In conclusion, I find the story of DearS to be enjoyable and original. The character designs are pretty.  
 
I also like the wide variety of character personalities. The fact that the main character, the one person who is indifferent to the DearS, is the one who is paired with one makes for an amusing plot. 
 
 I like the humor based on the misunderstandings, as well as the minor characters who get a fair amount of screen time.  
 
However, the overuse of ecchi in addition to a few annoying characters, and confusing concepts detract from anime. 
 
I'm glad I viewed DearS, but I probably won't watch it a second time. 
 
6/10.

          
 
       Helpful This review is coming from someone who goes gaga over cutesy anime with moe characters. I figured DearS would be a little cheesy, but wanted to give it a chance since the character designs were so cute. It was good to have low standards from the beginning.  
 
The story is a little bit recycled, but nothing criminal. You have a beautiful girl with no memories that gets put into the care of an uninterested male lead (i.e. Chobits) and you watch a handful of slice-of-life-esq episodes with plenty of fanservice before finding out the ulterior plot.  
 
The art in this series had so much potential. The manga's art style is painfully cute, and I just love the character designs. Unfortunately, it has some of the cheapest animation I've ever seen. They re-use scenes and animation, everything looks rushed and sloppy, people's faces are sideways, it's cringe-worthy. The music is painful 80-s esq elevator music, all computerized. Usually I can look past bad background music and moments of poor animation (because not everything has to be HD completely accurate all the time), but this was just too much. 
 
As stated before, I love these characters and their designs, but when you combined an over used plot with terrible animation and music, you get an anime not worth your time. If they had jut put a little more effort into the animation and music, this anime would have gotten a much higher score.

3,8986,43,10.68166049,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Supernatural The Animation,"Based on the live-action CW show Supernatural, the anime will be a 22-episode season that will cover the storyline of the live-action version's first two seasons. 
 
The anime project will not only remake the best episodes from the live-action version, but also depict original episodes not seen in the live-action version. Those original episodes will include prologues of the Winchester brothers' childhood, anime-only enemies, and episodes featuring secondary characters from the live-action version. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Demons', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']",none,"As many of you are already well-aware, Supernatural is one hell of a series and for those who know it, seen it, love it I believe the animation is also worth seeing. But for the sake of a fair review, I'll try not to compare it (-much-I do compare it) with the original series. 
 
So, the story is definitely interesting. Two brothers hunting down all kinds of monsters thought to be just fictions of mythology and legends does sound appealing. The series includes remakes of the original episodes and anime-only episodes, too. As far as the latter is concerned, I believe they fitted with the original series. But the 22 episodes just wasn't enough to explain the plot thoroughly. Many questions arise and, honestly, I am not sure if I would understand the story so well if I was not familiar with the live-action series.. Lastly found the ending fair enough, I repeat for someone who is not familiar with the original. 
 
The art was a real fit. I mean the intense black in the frames fitted well with the mysterious style of the story. And, the characters were decent. But, I cannot restrain from commenting on Bobby's appearance. Man, what did they do to him???? (sorry about that). 
 
I haven't watched it in Japanese so I'll comment on the dubbed version. Okay, the voice actors have risen huge complaints. Why Jensen Ackles is not in the show? What's wrong with the voice actors? And bla bla bla... Really, the voice actors were not that bad. They could have been better and having the original cast would be sweet but we should try being just a little objective. Also, the music and the sound effects created the mysterious-creepy atmosphere the series needs. 
 
What I found a bit disappointing were the characters. I can't be objective here because I know the potential of the characters. They are not as flat as the anime portrays them. They are more deep than that. Also, many characters and monsters had to be there. What about the guys from the Harvelle's Roadhouse and the shape-shifters? However, we cannot expect that much from a 22-episode series while the original is 10 seasons! If you are new to the supernatural world I think you will like them as they are. They are not some kind of heroes, they have flaws and make mistakes. 
 
If you like this kind of stuff -demons, vampires, werewolves, etc.- you will definitely like Supernatural. Even if you don't have a particular interest in those, I believe you will still enjoy it. It is a great anime and leave us, grumpy fans, complaint. It should be treated with respect and it is a great anime for the mystery/ horror fans out there! 

          
 
       Helpful This is a creepy show. Having not seen the live-action show before, I don’t know if it does justice to the show or not but I have to say, I really like it any way and it does make me want to see the original show. The episodes all have to do with someone dying in a gruesome way, then the brothers’ end up being at the right place at the right time. Each show is its own storyline without many things to link them together. The story is slow, and not really action orientated. Many of the shows act more like detective shows where something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end. There is a larger mystery that they have in this show about the brothers trying to find their Dad.  
 
The art style is rather interesting, almost a cross between anime and American comic book style. The characters are hard edged, and a lot of dark lines and heavy shadows that pretty much are black. Everything has a nice vintage feeling, sort of grimy in a good way. The characters look like the characters from the live-action as well which is what I would wish to see unlike some of them. Sadly, some of the images are pretty frozen, still images that feel like cop outs, especially when this was made in 2011. 
 
The English voices don’t feel up to par with the animation, and feels a bit forced and doesn’t match the lip sink most of the time. They talk when the mouths are closed and part of it might be to get information out since this is shorter then the actual show. Even then, it just feels rushed and makes it a little hard. I really love the ending song though. I never thought I would hear “Cary on my Wayward Son” by Naoki Takao fit so well. 
 
EDIT: I have now seen the live action show, I really like it as well. The show has the same creepy feeling and the same slowness that the animation has. The stories are altered slightly from the original but that’s partly because they were putting a 1 hour episode into a half a hour one. 

          
 
       Helpful STORY:  4 
The plot seems okay.  How Mary Winchester died is still the same as it was in the original series, but it wasn't as detailed.  The flashbacks that Sam had near the beginning of episode 1 made me go ""What?"" once or twice, so I had to rewatch that scene a couple of times before I went ""Oh... Okay"". 
 
The anime desperately tries to have the same feel as the original series.  Honestly, it did have the same feel, but there was just something lacking. 
 
ART:  3 
The character designs are simply pathetic, it's too over-shaded, the characters seemed poorly planned out.  Honestly, the background characters are more eye-catching than the two main characters.  Since Madhouse was in charge of the animation, I figured that it wouldn't be too bad, but I was sadly mistaken.  I put all this horrible art to a lack of a budget.  To say the least, I was shocked when the scenery was so beautiful.  The thing that should catch your eye are the characters NOT the scenery. 
 
All-in-all, they just needed more of a budget for art since it seemed like they didn't have enough money for it. 
 
SOUND:  6 
The sound is fine, but I just feel that they could've used more fitting music.  The English voice actors did put emotion into their lines, so it wasn't dead.  I have not seen the Japanese dub, but I assume they're similar.  The sound effects seemed fitting for the anime, but sometimes the sound effects just didn't fit 
 
For the English dub, the words don't exactly fit with the lip flaps.  The sentences don't go over, they go under the amount of flaps.  It wasn't enjoyable.   
 
The ending theme wasn't the greatest because it wasn't the original, but I suppose it worked.  I guess it's debatable depending on what you like for vocals. 
 
CHARACTER:  4 
Character designs left so much to be desired.  I understand that, no matter what, the animated characters won't look like the actual actors, but I just think they could've planned out the designs more carefully.  Dean's design reminds me of someone who was put in jail for a crime.  I have nothing to say on Sam's design since it was alright.  The extras, as I said before, were better drawn. 
 
ENJOYMENT:  3 
I really do NOT care for this anime one bit.  I don't intend to watch another episode unless I'm dreadfully bored and the only other option is banging my head against a wall or playing with matches... Even then I'd probably play with matches. 
 
OVERALL:  4 
Even though the idea of turning Supernatural into an anime is good, I believe that it could've been done better.   If they didn't jump into it because anime is the ""in thing"" right now, I honestly believe it would be better.  This is one of the worst animes I've seen to date.  If you plan to watch Supernatural:  The Animation, I suggest that you don't.  Just stick with the live-action series.

3,33840,44,10.61695272,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Kabuki-bu!,"Kurogu had a love of kabuki theater instilled in him from a very young age thanks to his grandfather. Now, as a high school student, he desires to create his own kabuki club in order to bring an appreciation of kabuki to a wider audience. He'll find, though, that with the weight of hundreds of years of strict tradition, it's not so easy to get high schoolers interested. A rough start is not enough to deter Kurogu, and he'll work hard to inspire in others the same burning passion he feels, until the day he can put on his own performance! 
 
(Source: Honey's Anime)",['School'],"Kurogo Kurusu, a high school boy who loves the art of kabuki, so much that it is annoying. He yearns to perform kabuki for a club, but his school doesn't have one. Kurogo decides to create his own and sets out to gather members.
","The way I would describe this anime is…half decent. There’s nothing really new here and nothing really terrible either.  
  I liked the idea of it. A boy named Kurogu really wants to start kabuki club as he sees it as dying art and wants to bring it to a younger audience. The thought of learning about a new bit of culture and seeing all the cool costumes for used for Kabuki was a nice thought. And the kabuki is interesting. From what I’ve gleamed it uses pretty simple stories like a band of thieves or too people in love and uses fantastic costumes, specific, almost dance like movements and sound effects to bring it to life. And all that was fun. It’s just the rest of it that fell flat. 
  None of the characters are that interesting. I can’t even really remember their names. Kurogu is the basic overeager boy who is always happy and lives with his mother whom he for some reason calls by her first name which is kind of confusing; I did like that he never let anything stop him from achieving his dream and he apparently sucks at the thing he loves so much and Tonbo is the quiet, nerdy, tech guy who just does whatever Kurogu asks of him. For the rest of the characters after the initial conflict of getting them to be in the club are just kind of there afterwords. Kaoru for example, is a great actor but she’s in the drama club and also a girl so they have to find a way to borrow her from the drama club and have a girl in kabuki which doesn’t really happen apparently unless they’re a love interest. And she’s shown to be an amicable girl who just wants everyone to get along. And you’d think after finally wrestling her away from the stubborn manager of the drama club and even going through a competition to get her in the kabuki club she’d be a bit more of a focus. But she almost never talks after that and other than one episode there's no more conflict between the two clubs. The same for Hanamichi. They work really hard to get him into the club even though at first he scares them and it goes through this whole thing of him being a tough guy who’s secretly a softy, but then he’s just a side character after that and they do nothing with him afterwords. He also changes from tough guy to gay stereotype so quickly, there was no really point to it in the first place. Maruko is my favorite character be far. She makes the costumes as well as cosplay outfits. She’s so sarcastic and just basically hates being there it’s really funny. But once again she stuck in side character land. It could have done so much more with them instead of just more focusing on trying to get the one guy to join the damn club he doesn’t want to join. 
Jin and Shin were the most interesting; Jin mostly because the show seems to be focused on his joining the kabuki club and he gets the most development due to it. Jin is really amazing at kabuki but thinks people in the club are just doing it for fun and looks down on them for not taking it seriously. He’s overly polite and a perfectionist which sometimes gets him in trouble such as when Kurogu and Tonbo show up at his house he can;t just kick them out and instead offers them tea which is kind of funny. He’s trying to work hard to be as good as his famous kabuki actor grandpa and gets into conflict with his father for the former not being around a lot and Jin’s not being a regular boy. As for Shin, he’s a good kabuki actor with a apparently famous kabuki actor as his dad who tragically died. But instead of wanting to be like his father, he wants to be a rock star. Shin is loud and obnoxious, basically you're typical anime rocker dude. Something that's stands out a bit is that he has to live with grandma because his mom married a man that lives in the U.S. and moved there. 
  That brings me to the second problem with this anime besides underdeveloped characters. Seriously issues are never taken seriously. Jin doesn’t get along with his dad and constantly fights with him? Never bring it up again. Kurogu’s mom is never home? Oh he’s fine! He has Tonbo! Shin’s mom abandoned for a man and moved to America which upset him so much that when she does come back to see him perform he wants nothing to do with her and gets depressed enough to not want to leave his bed? Get over! We have a show to do! And it works! These issues are brought up and then brushed aside almost immediately like they don’t’ matter but they do! It’s like the story writers wanted character development but didn’t understand how to deal with the fall out and it’s infuriating to see characters who are suppose to be friends say that the other characters problems are basically stupid and don’t matter. 
My last point is about the voice acting. It’s atrocious. Well two parts are really and that's enough to make me hate it.. Hanamichi’s voice starts out fine. It fits the design they gave his character. But then once he joins the club, he’s given this high-pitched girly voice that doesn’t match at all and starts acting like the gayest stereotype imaginable and it’s grating. I don’t know why he couldn’t keep his old voice. The second part is when they actually do kabuki. Every time the club started putting on a performance I dreaded it. Not because it wasn’t well done. The costumes were great, the sets were cool, the interactions backstage were fun to watch, but the voice they use for it made me want to jab a screwdriver into my ear drums. It made me miss the moments of them just talking about the plays or just hanging out eating lunch. Which those parts were fun, don’t get me wrong. I liked all of the characters practicing and figuring out what plays to do and who does which part, or having them just hanging out and being friends. Hell, the most interesting episode was watching them update a play so that younger audiences would get it. But kabuki is the main focus so it was just constantly me pulling my headphones halfway off so I would have to listening to it that much. And I get that it’s apparently the actual voice used for actual kabuki performances but my God, it felt like someone was yelling directly into my ear and doing it in such a slow, agonizing manner like people who think that the deaf will hear them if the talk slower and more exaggerated. It drove me insane. 
Overall I’d give Kabukibu a D. The setting is whatever, it’s just Japan, the animation is smooth, the characters are underdeveloped, I don’t really remember much about the music, the only conflict is getting Jin to join the club and every other one is brushed under the rug, the art-style isn’t anything new and the voice acting is annoying as all hell. I wouldn’t re watch it, or hope for a season two and kind of wish I hadn’t watched it in the first place; even if I did learn a bit about kabuki. It’s just one of those anime that you watch and soon enough, forget about.

Kurogo is really cheerful and sincere about Kabuki, giving his own opinion on things and advice for his friends. It definitely shows a bit of what Kabuki is about and you will be able to learn some of it. However, it started off with an overused plot of some typical school animes that shows the main character wanting to start a club being all positive about it and starts to recruit more people to join in. Also, I actually find myself not really focusing or remembering some of the lines in the script for some of the Kabuki plays, be it big or small as I got a bit confused with what it was talking about and don't find myself remembering it.  
 
Characters: 9 
The characters are really interesting with different personalities. The anime progresses and slowly leaks some family background in each episode about some of the characters which are not too difficult to understand and sometimes can be quite shocking.  
 
Art: 7 
Not the greatest but still pretty good enough for me, knowing CLAMP's art style. The way they animate Kabuki is beautiful and makes you appreciate this sort of culture that Japan has.  
 
Enjoyment: 8 
This kind of anime is for people who want to enjoy something laid-back and not about serious Kabuki. The first two episodes were kind of boring for me to watch but, I still continued to watch hoping it will get better which it did, thankfully. As I reach the last episode, it feels a bit incomplete for me as I feel there are some things which can be explained further. For example, for Ebihara. 
 
Actually hoping that there will be a Season 2 for this. Giving this anime 8/10

          
 
       Helpful I decided to watch this after rewatching Chihayafuru (both seasons). So, unfortunately, I can't help but compare the two? Why?  
 
Both MCs are obsessed with a Japanese art form that is difficult for most to understand and dedicate themselves to. It is about them trying to start a club and recruit members for people to partake in the art form. Kind of. Competitive karuta, which is what Chihayafuru is about, isn't an art per se, but it's based on Japanese poetry.  
 
I preferred Chihayafuru much more. Here are the reasons: 
 
STORY (7/10): Well, the synopsis and my comparison covered that. 
 
ART (7/10): Clamp isn't known for pretty. Which is fine because xxxHolic is one of my favorite anime. Chihayafuru is josei so... 
 
SOUND (7/10): There's only three tracks in Kabukibu: the opening, the ending, and this one instrumental piece. All of them are great, but only three?! Okay, there was this one scene where a different piano piece was playing, but it wasn't outstanding. It's only getting a seven because and op and ed were so catchy and the one instrumental piece that was being repeated was quite moving.  
 
CHARACTER (5/10): To continue with anime comparisons, the MC's best friend is like a mix between Kyouya and Mori-senpai from Ouran HSHC. He's taciturn, intelligent, diplomatic, and tech-savvy. I think my word count is higher than his in the anime. Two members are basically Mikorin and Kashima from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The one like Mikorin is a feminine male. The one like Kashima is also a female mistaken for a beautiful male and is also in Drama Club, has a fan club, and is the lead for most of the Drama Club's productions. The reluctant and arrogant character kind of reminds me of the Queen in Chihayafuru, like how she sticks her nose up at team tournaments, he believes that a kabuki club run by amateurs is insulting since he comes from a kabuki family. Overall, the supporting characters weren't too memorable. Also, it lacked a balanced focus on the characters.  
 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE MC. He's so dull! Yes, Chihaya was obsessed with karuta, and Daddy Bear, but she had character. She was an airhead in addition to being a karuta nut. Throughout the seasons, she encounters opponents who are basically her teachers. They help her grow. This MC though, I don't remember his name tbh, just cares about kabuki. He's not even good at kabuki. What the hell?  
 
ENJOYMENT (6/10): Despite my biggest complaint, it was still interesting to learn about kabuki. The music was decent. The anime wasn't comedic so that was a let down because my favorite genre is comedy and this could have easily weaved it in.   
 
OVERALL (6/10): To be fair, Chihayafuru had 25 eps per season so it had the chance to be fleshed out. This only had 12 episodes. Give this one a try if you're interested in kabuki. But afterward, totally watch Chihayafuru for some actual conflict and character development and a variety of good music.

3,35122,46,10.52885152,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Shingeki no Kyotou,"A special anime featuring a battle against the Colossal Titan screened at the Tokyo Skytree. 
 
In the short, the characters from  Shingeki no Kyojin  are part of the Sky Survey Corps, protecting the Wall Skytree, a section of the walled city that contains the Skytree. The Sky Survey Corps find that the Wall Skytree is under attack by an army of titans, including a giant 350 meter-class titan that has suddenly appeared next to the Skytree and remains motionless. 
 
(Source: Anime Now!)","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher-like weapons called Thunder Spears are also developed.
There exist different types of Titans. Pure Titans are the weakest and most generic Titans, whose behavior is easy to predict, making them easy to kill. Abnormal Titans are Pure Titans whose behavior is more difficult to predict, making them far more dangerous. The Nine Titans, also known as Titan Shifters (Attack, Colossal, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer, and Founding), are the strongest Titans; each is able to shift back and forth between human and Titan form to access their Titan's abilities. Many Titan Shifters also possess the ability to harden certain parts of their bodies at will, typically in order to make them virtually impenetrable, or to strengthen their blows during combat.
Pure Titans are created by injecting Eldians with Pure Titan spinal fluid. If a Pure Titan eats the human body of a person who possesses one of the Nine Titans, said Eldian will revert to human form and gain that Shifter's powers, whereupon they are cursed to live only 13 more years. If their powers are not inherited by another Eldian before their death, their powers will be inherited by an Eldian baby born shortly thereafter, regardless of distance or blood-relations.
As the story progresses, the true nature of the Titans and the existence of civilization outside the walls is revealed to the characters and the audience.
Eren Yeager is a boy who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the outermost of three circular walls protecting their inhabitants from Titans. In the year 845, the first wall (Wall Maria) is breached by two new types of Titans, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan. During the incident, Eren's mother is eaten by a Smiling Titan while Eren escapes. He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. Five years after Shiganshina's fall, the Colossal Titan attacks the city of Trost, located on the second innermost wall (Wall Rose). Eren helps to successfully defend the city after he discovers a mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Attack Titan. Additionally, he regains memories of his father giving him this ability shortly after the fall of Wall Maria, and telling him that the truth about their world can be found in their basement in Shiganshina. These events draw the attention of the Survey Corps and their commander, Erwin Smith, who intend to use his power to reclaim Wall Maria and reach the Yeagers' basement. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are transferred to the Special Operations Squad, under the care of Captain Levi Ackerman and Hange Zo?.
During an expedition into the forest between the walls, Eren and his companions encounter a sentient Female Titan, whom they later expose as their fellow military comrade Annie Leonhart. With help from his friends, Eren fights and defeats Annie, who encases herself in crystal and is put in custody. After the fight, it is discovered that there are Titans lying dormant within the walls (known as Wall Titans). Shortly thereafter, Pure Titans mysteriously appear within Wall Rose with no evidence of how they got in, accompanied by the sentient Beast Titan. Ymir, one of the new Survey Corps graduates, reveals that she can also transform into the sentient Jaw Titan, while Ymir's close friend Krista Lenz reveals herself as Historia Reiss, a member of the royal family. Two other members of the Survey Corps, Reiner Braun and Bertholt Hoover, reveal themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titan respectively. They attempt to kidnap Eren and Ymir, but fail. In the ensuing battle, Eren discovers another power within himself called ""the Coordinate"", that allows him to control other Titans, which he uses to kill the Smiling Titan and send a horde of Pure Titans to attack Reiner and Bertholt. This forces the two to escape, whereupon Ymir willingly flees with them, offering herself as sacrifice to prevent Historia from being targeted by the enemy. In the aftermath of these events, it is determined that the Pure Titans who suddenly appeared within Wall Rose were the inhabitants of various villages within Wall Rose, who had in some way been transformed into Titans. This leads the characters to the conclusion that all Pure Titans are, in fact, transformed human beings.
Eren and his friends join Levi's Squad while the Survey Corps is targeted by the Military Police led by Kenny Ackerman, Levi's uncle. In the occasion, they discover that by transforming into a Pure Titan via a serum made of spinal fluid and eating another Titan shifter, a person can gain its abilities, and that Historia and her father, Rod Reiss, are the only surviving members of the royal bloodline. Rod kidnaps Eren because he is in possession of the Founding Titan, obtained by his father Grisha upon eating Frieda Reiss (Historia's half-sister), and by Eren through eating his father. Rod transforms into a monstrous Abnormal Titan, but is killed by Historia (with the help of the Survey Corps), who is thereafter declared Queen.
Having resolved the political unrest, the Survey Corps lead a successful operation to recapture Shiganshina, fighting the Beast, Colossal, Armored, and Cart Titans but suffering massive casualties, wherein Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan, and Armin gains ownership of the Colossal Titan when Levi injects him with a serum given by Kenny, causing Armin to eat Bertholt. Eren and his companions return to his childhood home, where they discover the truth of their world: they are actually Eldians, sworn enemies of the conquering Marleyans who were enclosed within the walls after the original King Karl Fritz fled from the war. They are not the last humans as they were told, but rather an enclosed sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis. Because they are ""Subjects of Ymir"" who can be turned into Titans by being injected with Titan spinal fluid, the Eldians continue to be oppressed by Marley. In the year after the battle of Shiganshina, the Survey Corps kill all of the remaining Pure Titans on the island.

Three years later, the Survey Corps attack Marley's capital, Liberio, orchestrated by Eren and his half-brother Zeke, who is the owner of the Beast Titan. In the occasion, Eren kills Willy Tybur, an Eldian who (along with his family) had been controlling Marley from the shadows and gains ownership of the War Hammer Titan after eating its previous owner, Willy's sister Lara. However, Eren is imprisoned for acting against orders but escapes with a faction of extremist Paradis soldiers called the Yeagerists. Zeke is kept in Levi's custody but manages to escape, severely injuring but not killing him. 
Marley's air fleet, led by Reiner, launch an invasion of Paradis, and chaos breaks out in the ensuing battle. Eren and Zeke reunite, which leads them to the Paths―a series of gateways connecting all Eldians through time and space. There, they meet the consciousness of Ymir Fritz―the original Titan―whose tortured past led to her imprisonment within the Paths for thousands of years. Zeke attempts to convince Ymir to fulfill his wish to stop the Subjects of Ymir from reproducing via mass sterilization. Instead, however, Eren convinces Ymir to use her power to bring about the Rumbling―unleashing thousands of Wall Titans kept within Paradis' walls and leading them on a genocidal march to kill everyone outside the island.
The Survey Corps ally with remaining Marley forces, including Reiner and a now-freed Annie to stop Eren, and they defeat the Yeagerists before confronting Eren. After Levi kills Zeke and a mysterious creature that is the source of all Titans' powers, Mikasa kills Eren, causing the power of the Titans vanish, reverting all Titans to human form, and stripping the Titan Shifters of their powers, thereby freeing all Eldians from the curse. It is revealed that what transpired was part of Eren's plan to spare twenty percent of humanity, with Armin, Levi, Mikasa, and the others being recognized as heroes in the eyes of the world for killing him and stopping the Rumbling. 
Three years later, as Paradis and the rest of the world rebuilds, Armin and his allies begin peace negotiations led by Queen Historia. Mikasa buries Eren underneath a tree on a hill near Shiganshina District, which grows into a tree resembling the one where the organism that granted Ymir her Titan power lived. An unspecified amount of time after Mikasa's death from old age, a modernized Shiganshina is reduced to rubble in a war. The series ends with a boy bearing a striking resemblance to Mikasa approaching the tree, which has become surrounded by forest, indicating that the Titans may come back again.","“Shingeki no Kyotou” was one audition of a special of the series Shingeki no Kyijon screened on the Tokyo sky tree. I haven't attended it in person, I do think it would have made for such an experience to be able to. 
The context was simple, a bunch of official edits of the main series with fabricated dialogue to make up for a parody of the Titans attacking the Tokyo tower, while the main characters of the series are defending it. 
Don't think that you've missed out on a huge thing, because all of the shots used are featured in the series in a way or another, however, they didn't have to be all related, a thus, a lot of shots from season two are being juxtaposed with the ones of the first season and order to trick you into thinking it was the same thing, and it actually worked in a pretty cheesy, but cool way.

       Helpful To explain Blackout 2022 I best start out this quick review explaining what Blade Runner actually is. Blade Runner is a 1982 Hollywood science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott. Set in 2019 it depicts a dystopian Los Angeles under the influence of the Tyrell Corporation, who manufacture advanced human-like androids known as replicants. These androids were designed to work in the off-world colonies although a number have escaped back to earth illegally. Those that do so are hunted and ‘retired’ by a special police force known as blade runners.  
 
Blackout 2022 serves as a bridge between the original 1982 movie and the upcoming Blade Runner 2049 movie, depicting a significant event that occurred during the time between the two movies, and sets up the premise for the latter. Following two replicants Blackout 2022 briefly depicts the challenges and discrimination that replicants face and the lengths they’re willing to go in order to save themselves. Due to its short running time the episode isn’t able to go into much characterization, but it does enough to inform the viewer about the world of Blade Runner and provide them an understanding of who replicants are and their interaction with humans.  
 
Directed by Shinichirou Watanabe, the episode is a visual treat! The animation for the characters is crisp, the action sequences are fluid and artistic, while the environments are well detailed, especially the final scene which depicts the famous symbolism of Los Angeles in the original film. Overall it perfectly replicates (yes I went there, deal with it) the dark gritty environment of the original film. The soundtrack complements the episode well with electronic ambient tracks that capture the eerie futuristic feel of dystopian Los Angeles.  
 
Overall Blackout 2022 is short and sweet as it does so much in such a small amount of time. Fans of the original film will appreciate how the episode respects and replicates the dystopian environment of Los Angeles, while those who haven’t seen the film will enjoy the brief world-building that the episode provides. Even if you’re not a fan of Blade Runner you should still watch this just for the beautiful visuals and soundtrack.  


          
 
       Helpful The first time I saw Blade Runner, I thought, ""Are they just doing a Ghost in the Shell?"" It was not until later I learned that Ghost in the Shell had in fact been doing a Blade Runner on us the whole time. It seems quite fitting, then, that Blade Runner has finally wound up producing a work of anime. My viewing of this short came right off the back of my second time seeing the film, so I was already familiar with the setting. Even without having seen it, this still makes for an excellent way to fill your eyeballs with a concentrated dose of sci fi action. I found Blackout 2022 to be a gorgeous, enthralling short film, well worth the time it takes to watch. 
 
Blackout is simply a treat to look at. It utilizes more  animation styles than I can hope to analyze with any degree of authority, but suffice it to say that it looks very impressive. Conspicuous CG is everywhere, but that's not a bad thing! In every instance, 3D models are skillfully implemented to create environments and set pieces--It even looks natural when 2D characters interact with 3D objects! The backgrounds, whether modeled or drawn, are deep and rich with attitude. The streets of Los Angeles as imagined in the original film feel just as dank as before, but the visual callbacks don't stop there. Beginning with slides of expository text mirroring the film, it opens into a wide, sweeping shot of the city, emulating the original flawlessly. From the looks of it, similar layering techniques may have been used to create the landscape, but with 2D assets instead of scale models. I am not a filmmaker by trade, however, so feel free to disregard my perceptions if they are wildly inaccurate. 
 
Overall, character motion feels smooth, and designs are wholly inoffensive, if a bit uninspired. As one might expect from the director of Cowboy Bebop, the fight choreography is impeccable. The characters appear to move with fewer frames per second during the final action scene, but with the amount of money that must have been behind this I can only assume it was intentional. One thing that stood out to me was the lip syncing, which is honestly something that should NOT stand out. This appears to have been animated off of the English voice cast (Is there even a Japanese dub?), which leaves me disappointed that the lip motion is such a poor match for the dialogue. 
 
There are a couple of sequences done in drastically different art styles. The words that come to mind are ""surrealist,"" and ""impressionist,"" but I haven't the fine art knowledge to say if either of those actually apply. Regardless, the distinct visuals help make clear that these scenes are set in the past, and both portray very grim scenarios. To me, the overall visual style looks like a mix between GiTS, Avatar, and Disney's Atlantis. This combined with the production origin of this short really blur the line between anime and western animation, which is nifty to see. 
 
The sonic experience, while vastly overshadowed by the visuals, is nothing to sneeze at. Upon seeing Flying Lotus credited for music at the end, I had to take closer listen, even playing just the audio of the short in my car multiple times. His score alternates between ethereal and eclectic, changing to fit the mood of what's on screen. Lush synth pads evoke the film's OST, while eccentric drum beats highlight the action. I did find myself yearning for a bit more energy in the soundtrack, but what we get is certainly not disappointing. The voice work is unobtrusive, but a bit cheesy, the sound design is solid, and the ending song drives home the major themes of the story. 
 
Being only 15 minutes long, there isn't much time to flesh out a story, but it packs in as much as possible over its run time. A better understanding of this world can obviously be gained by having seen the original film, but the opening text does a decent job of setting the scene as long as you're paying attention. The motivations of the characters are solidly established, and easy to empathize with. After creating an absolutely dismal scenario, it lets loose with a bombastic action sequence which delivers an immense payoff. 
 
For the amount of time one must invest to experience this (For free, on YouTube), the amount of action, intrigue, and plain beautiful animation found within far exceeds what would be found in a typical half hour episode of anime. I have yet to see the new Blade Runner 2049, but you can bet yer biscuits I'm bitin' at the bit to. So who should watch this short? I think a better question would be who should not watch it. Please avoid this film at all costs if you despise excellent, stylized animation, action, sci fi, heavy themes of identity and discrimination, the Blade Runner franchise in general, or yourself.

While the restaurant is thought to be closed on Saturdays, the truth is that on this special day each week, its doors are instead opened to the inhabitants of other worlds.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery']","The Western Restaurant Nekoya is a restaurant situated in a mundane corner of an undisclosed Tokyo shopping district which offers a lot of Japanese versions of Western dishes. It opens during usual business hours but is closed during holidays and weekends; with its usual clientele being the working class of the city. But secretly it is also open on Saturdays, as on this particular day it creates doorways to another world inhabited by elves, dragons, beastmen and other fantastic creatures, who enter the restaurant and partake of its exotic food, with many of them becoming regular patrons. But while Nekoya mainly offers food, it is also a place where relationships are forged, inspirations made, and salvation for the needy is provided.
","How much do you love watching a hungry person shine with bliss as they enjoy an outstanding meal? Your answer is probably also how much you'll enjoy Isekai Shokudou. 
 
Most of the time when a story goes far off the tried and true paths of the countless already told it ends up tangled and stumbling but this is a wonderful exception. Seems odd how all it centers around is showing a glimpse of some human, elf, dwarf or other being and their struggles and joys in another world and culminates in their finding of a mysterious door that takes them to a fine but affordable little restaurant in our world where they can forget about their troubles for a while and have the most enjoyable meals of their lives. 
 
At first it just seems like a random bunch of customers but as their numbers increase so do their occasional little connections with each other. Giving a single side character the spotlight for much of a whole episode is something very few animes manage to do well but here they can grow on you amazingly fast and become a beloved part of the background in just 15 minutes. While the glimpses of the other world are spread too far and wide to overlap very often it still feels like they belong in the same world and it is beautiful, I found myself glued to the screen with far more enthusiasm than I had expected. 
 
There are occasional factual and continuity errors that could be annoying for really observant viewers, fortunately the mistakes are small enough that even if noticed they're reasonably easy to forgive. Lastly the voice acting and sound in general are terrific, which is probably an important part of why everything connects so well.

          
 
       Helpful While it may not seem like much as you start watching, it's actually quite a relaxing anime to watch. Though I will admit, after a couple of episodes in, it did make me get invested in the characters in general, which made me just to want to watch it more. 
 
It also gave me the want to watch more animes where the main plot is about or somewhat about food in general. I'd love to watch more food animes, and it's all because of this. 
 
Not to mention the food as always looks stunning, and the opening is just lovely. Lovely as in I would more than likely listen to it over and over again. A great tune. 
 
Would recommend.

---Description--- 
The show revolves around the restaurant, which is apparently located on earth and accessed via a magical door that opens in different locations throughout a fantasy world on Saturdays. Fantasy characters will usually encounter this door, travel to the restaurant, and be so awestruck by the quality of the food that they repeatedly visit and count down the days until the next ""Day of Satur"" ; Some have apparently even made a religion out of it. 
 
Story: 7 
The story feels a bit weak to me. However, I recognize that a large part of that is because this isn't my genre. It does a good job at what it's trying to do, however sometimes customers described food in ways they should lack a frame of reference for.  
 
The customers often get fleshed out backstories and their own little contained adventures that can make the show enjoyable to watch even if this isn't you're genre. There are also comedy and slice of life elements, but the main focus of the anime is definitely on the Restaurant and it's Food as experienced through the perspective of the customers. 
 
Art: 9 
I started to give the art a 7, because it's all well drawn but in an industry standard sort of way, but then I realized that the art work on some of the food is exceptionally detailed, and the detail of the restaurant went beyond my first glance impressions of it. Even though this isn't my Genre I respect it's commitment to what it does. 
 
Sound: 6 
The sound is about average for the industry and good enough to keep the anime enjoyable.  None of the music is memorable but the ambiance is appropriate for most scenes. The Anime does do a good job at allowing characters thoughts about the food and the restaurant to be heard clearly without obtrusion. Sometimes volume levels may be slightly inconsistent in places, but not enough for most to notice. 
 
Character: 7 
The characters get fleshed out through their own backstories and some of them are interesting but what the main focus is ultimately on how they experience the restaurant and the food, which it does a very good job at inexplicable frames of reference aside. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
I would personally give this a 5 because I did not enjoy it very much. I mainly just watched it because I had nothing else to do. However, I recognize that I am not the target audience for this Anime, and if I were I would probably be enjoying it a lot more. 
 
I estimate that if this were my niche, I would want to give it an 8, but I would subtract a point for the fact that fantasy characters have inexplicable frames of reference that they should not have. 
 
Overall: 7 
It's a good Anime, and if you like the genre then you should definitely see it.

Little Nemo - Adventures in Slumberland is the first Japanese anime to receive a national (wide) U.S. theatrical release. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","The film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel, Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed. Upon actually falling asleep later that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.
Nemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes ""the nightmare"". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, ""The Nightmare"" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.
Nemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him into the ocean. Genius discovers Nemo and tells him not to blame himself for all that has happened and that Flip is to blame, but Nemo accepting the situation pledges to find the King.  When the two return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon because he has a map of Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Oomps who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter but awakens in his bed instead. The Oomps appear in Nemo's room and the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently imprisoned in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter. Nemo soon uses the scepter to finally eliminate and defeat the Nightmare King but almost at the cost of Nemo's life. Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom. Camille escorts Nemo home on the dirigible. The two nearly share a kiss before Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window as he looks forward to his new day.
","Overview: 
 
Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children's movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn't re-watch this film until recently. 
 
Background: 
 
Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s, right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid's movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like  The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki's Nausicca, and America's Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy""  led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca. 
 
Plot: 5/10 
 
The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn't much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children's films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn't really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn't have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.  
 
Characters: 3/10 
 
The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan's favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn't dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that's...better? 
 
Sound: 5/10 
 
It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don't blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn't really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious.

          
 
       Helpful What an odd little movie. So bad, and yet such a colorful history.  
 
You may notice I generally gave some poor scores, but highly recommend this movie. Why? It's a perfect example of why communication is important. This movie has everything it needs to be amazing. It was worked on by some true animation giants. Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame, who invented many standards of animation that are used to this day. Ray Bradbury, writer of Fahrenheit 451. Music by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a ton of music I guarantee you know! Even Hayao Miyazaki, the man the myth the legend, worked on the film for a brief time. If you look closely you can see their influences. And there are some other big names linked to this project. 
 
So why do so many rights make a ginormous wrong?  
 
Lack of communication.  
 
Some are quoted as saying they asked the animators what they were working off of, ""we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing"" and when Bradbury was asked what he doing he said ""I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing"" 
 
Insert screaming melty man pop art. I highly recommend you watch this movie simply because it is such a piece of animation history with so many big names on it. You can see Chuck Jones' influence in the design of the squirrel Icarus. And some scenes, like them fancifully bouncing around the kingdom on balls while a song plays, are clearly worked on by Miyazaki. It's fun to watch and try to spot who animated what. 
 
This is definitely a film to watch when you're in the mood for a bad movie.

          
 
       Helpful ""Little Nemo"" is one of those movies where the backstory on it's creation is more famous (and probably more entertaining) than the movie itself. With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it's not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be. 
 
To start with the animation itself, it's actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It's smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...  
 
I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best. 
 
This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie. Cheers!

3,2605,50,10.28828909,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei,"Nozomu Itoshiki is a high school teacher so pessimistic that even the smallest of misfortunes can send him into a pit of raging despair; some of these ""catastrophes"" even lead to suicide attempts.  Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei  is a satirical slice-of-life comedy set in the modern day, covering various aspects of Japanese life and culture through Nozomu and his interactions with his students: Kiri Komori, a recluse who refuses to leave the school; Abiru Kobushi, an enigma who frequently arrives to class with severe and mysterious injuries; the hyper-optimistic Kafuuka Fuura, Nozomu's polar opposite; and several other unusual girls, all of whom are just as eccentric as their teacher. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen']","Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a sakura tree. He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees. She decides to nickname Nozomu ""Pink Supervisor"" (桃色�S�L, Momoiro Kakarichō), and offers to pay him fifty yen to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his homeroom class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.
Each chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of amakudari, the practice of ""descending"" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu ""descending"" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, omiai, normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the negative aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a non-sequitur gag or piece of fan service.
While ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the Taishō period, the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the Shōwa period. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taishō liberalism, Taishō Romanticism (see Japanese literature) and Taishō arts (see Hanshinkan Modernism). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a kimono and hakama (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the anachronistic appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taishō period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the modern girl trend, which is a break from the Meiji period and signifies the style of the Taishō period.
Chapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble karuta cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted kiri-e style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of katakana (rather than hiragana) as okurigana. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though Emperor Hirohito were still alive, such that Heisei 20 (the twentieth year of Emperor Akihito's reign, or 2008 by the Gregorian calendar) becomes ""Shōwa 83"".","Despair! I am in it. 
 
STORY - Story? What story? This is a slice-of-life series and it is based entirely around hilarious character shenanigans, though if you ever see characters like this in your life, I'd be a little worried. Still, there are a few reoccurring themes revolving around anime and otaku snark and satire of Japanese lifestyle, culture, politics, media, literature, etc. They also frequently make fun of themselves, which is incredibly amusing. It's all amazingly well done and highly entertaining, I assure you. A bit of warning through, if you try and pause to read every single thing written in the background for scenes, you will turn 20 minute episodes into 40 minute episodes. 

          
 
       Helpful Ah, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei! Before I begin, let me state that I watched this anime in two days while at a sleepover with some friends, which means some episodes were watched really late into the night/morning. This may have affected my perception of the anime to some degree due to severe sleepiness. Also, this sleepover happened about 6 weeks before I wrote this review, so I may not remember every little detail about what I am discussing. Forgive me. ^^&rsquo; 
 
Story- Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei&rsquo;s (SZS) story revolves around a group of schoolgirls (OK, there is one moderately important male student, but no one REALLY cares) and their suicidal teacher. Together the class and their teacher engage in everything from normal classroom conversations to stalking each other, to hibernating in their teacher&rsquo;s (Itoshiki-sensei) house for a night. Each student in the class has one dominant character trait and these traits are usually set up so that they make fun of or satirize some aspect of modern culture. For example, we have Kafuka Fuura, an overly optimistic girl who is so bent on looking on the bright side of things that she is completely blind to all the horrible things that may be happening around her. She embodies the popular notion that optimism is the best way to go through life, but this optimism made her so na&iuml;ve that she cannot even begin to comprehend the evils, sadness, or injustices in the world- including her own parents&rsquo; suicide. Another such student is Kiri Komori, a hikikomori (or shut-in) who has stayed inside and skipped school for so long that her skin actually glows white. She embodies the increasing number of young people in Japan who have become hikokomoris themselves and have thus isolated themselves from any form of human contact. Then, of course, we have Itoshiki-sensei himself. He is a man so pessimistic that he attempts to commit suicide on a regular basis. This is most likely not only satirizing middle-aged adults going through mid-life crises and such, but I also interpreted it as satirizing the increasingly popular &ldquo;emo&rdquo; movement in young people today which glorifies and romanticizes depression and angst (a disgusting way of life, if you ask me). As you can see, these characters have quite a bit of depth to them and the various situations they are thrown into are usually hilarious and funny to watch. However, these situations and stories are not always funny, most likely due to the content being lost in translation during the subtitling process. This makes for some fairly boring parts in the anime as well. 
 
Art- SZS is definitely unique and stylized. The artwork used in the anime makes use of more subdued colours that fit well for SZS&rsquo;s dark thematic overtones that serve as a basis for its comedic elements. A fair number of scenes in the anime were done in different styles of art, including scenes that made SZS look like an old silent film or some trippy video from the 80s. This range of artistic styles was both interesting and challenging to watch at the same time. 
 
Sound- It has been too long since I&rsquo;ve seen SZS to properly comment on its sound. Nonetheless, there are two parts of the show that I clearly remember in terms of sound/music- the two opening/ending themes (Ito toshite Jiku ga Bureteiru and Zessei Bijin). I enjoyed both these songs for the way they integrated 1940&rsquo;s swing music with J-pop (Zessei Bijin) and for their fast-paced hardcore melody and instrumental track being juxtaposed against the voices of young Japanese schoolgirls who will take over the melody of the song every now and then. Both songs make for great listens and I will often have them blasting in the car when driving long distances. XD 
 
Characters- I have already went to a good amount of depth with the characters in the &ldquo;Story&rdquo; portion of my review. Thus, in summary, the characters are interesting, diverse, and each play in an important part in representing various negative aspects of modern Japanese culture (even though they are taken to the extreme in the case of SZS). Awesome characters- too bad they don&rsquo;t develop much during the plot (not that it matters much in a comedy-esque anime). 
 
Enjoyment- SZS was a fun and enjoyable anime to watch, especially in a group of friends. It made all the funny scenes all the funnier to watch and then allowed us to take them further as we made up our own jokes based on the anime after watching it. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, I was fighting sleep during the later episodes which made some of them seem too lengthy and stretched out in some cases. That combined with the fact that some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny just didn&rsquo;t strike a chord with me brought down this rating to a 6/10. 
 
Overall, this hilarious anime rooted in satire is definitely worth a watch. However, if you aren&rsquo;t laughing or at least smiling after the first few episodes, chances are that this anime is not for you: many of the later episodes are similar in tone and style.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Im sure there are lots of people who would enjoy an anime such as this and unfortunately I am not one of those people. 
 
There are always people who feel like dying and would go so far as to write a note or go to the top of the building or prepare to hang themselves. These people usually aren't serious, those who are, are first of all cowards and stupid. They believe that it takes courage to die however, they are wrong... It takes courage to live. 
 
Now after sharing that with you let me say that this anime was rather boring for me. I king of forced myself wo watch two episodes a day just to finish it. 
 
From the first episode you can see this anime had a lot of potential but I don't think they used it properly. The whole thing is basically about a teacher trying to repeatedly find an excuse to kill himself and without serious intent. 
 
They only thing that I found remotely funny would be ""IM IN DESPAIR"". This phrase is what got me into this anime in the first place. 
 
There is no story mainly because it is a 'slice of life' anime. 
The art was good but for me it wasn't great. 
The voice actors are again descent but not great. 
Nozomu was the only character I liked. 
I didn't really enjoy this anime all too much. 
 
If you are a fun of comedy try this a recommend it however, if you hate soft, gentle comedy then avoid it. If you are someone who needs something strong to make you laugh then this is a no no. The comedy level here is rather weak. It's nowhere near compared to 'Gintama'. 
 
I hope you found this review helpful :)

That changes when she meets a boy named Arata Wataya, a talented karuta player. After becoming friends, he believes that Chihaya has potential to become a great player. As Chihaya takes on a new dream of becoming Japan's best karuta player, she is soon separated from her karuta playing friends as they grow up.

With her teammates and friends supporting her, Chihaya strives to become the best karuta player in the world and to one day be with Arata again.
","I don't really know how to review this OVA to be honest. It was a really fun experience to watch these characters have an off day and kind of joke around outside of the tense matches we see them in during the main series.  
 
Obviously, as an OVA, the quality isn't as high-caliber since this is just meant to be a side-story. However, I do think the little character developments for Taichi regarding Chihaya and Hanano were nice. It was a nice highlight for that small love triangle that sort of exists between those three. It wasn't something huge, but it was there, and I liked that.  
 
Other than that, the humor in this episode is very Chihayafuru, so if you enjoyed the main series' comedic bits, then you'll enjoy this episode. Like I said, it was fun to hang out with this characters in a completely comedic way rather than the drama that we get in the anime. We don't come to OVA episodes for quality, we come to have fun, and you certainly will with this episode.

          
 
       Helpful Well to start up with I guess the OVA didn't live up to the expectations that we generally have with Chihayafuru but all in all it was kinda good. The OVA basically focuses on Sumire's love for Taichi and her trying to snatch him from our beloved Chihaya. Chihaya has almost no screentime so you can guess that there is no Karuta played either. 
The good parts of the OVA were that it had a good touch of comedy and the art was beautiful. The ending was kinda hilarious too.  
Lastly I would like to say that if you are watching the OVA for seeing chihaya in action don't. The OVA is a comedy and a bit of romance. 
 
NOTE: Well I like Chihaya and Arata as a couple better. :)

North Korea acknowledges abducting her and at least 12 other Japanese residents during the 1970s and the 1980s, but the country has not provided any conclusive evidence on her fate and most of the others. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Historical'],none,"If to sort specifically, direction is bad. Close ups, delays, other director's counters are realized muffledly. Direction of this anime leaves much to be desired, but it is not because there are no ""juicy scenes with pants"", there is no silly humour, there are no heroes-adventurers who rescue each young lady who got to trouble. All the matter is that emotions are not showed especially plausibly. Really it was impossible to put a little more heart and soul and compassions in this work?  The history deserves that it knew, but the fact that an anime is removed not in the best way, remains the fact. 
 
Likely, the main reason for so mediocre work is that the task was to make an anime on this subject, to pay attention and quality of the movie was not among priorities. Matter in that, this anime has no the entertaining or art character; no ha-ha, no boobs, no girls taking a bathtub, no scenes of fight and other to what you got used in an anime. 
 
Essence of this anime is not to strike you with stunning posing and animation, not to show violence scenes (which someone love that you spoke ""thank God it doesn't happen to me""), not to strike you with masterly direction, not to surprise with something. This anime has the purpose to draw attention to a real-life problem, and to inform all about it. It is a history-propagation, which has the political character, telling without any lyrics about parents of the ordinary Japanese schoolgirl, about powerlessness of the ordinary person before the governments of the countries. And I deeply respect these unfortunate people who lifted such wave, what even governor admitted this fact. 
 
Sense is not in posing and animation, sense is in the general history and feelings of parents which 25 years look for the child despite of everything. About any highly artistic things can't be speech in this situation. Many of us already lose hope for such period of time, and the sincere love and loss pain here is expressed. 
 
Generally the verdict is that to whom is less than 20 years, I don't recommend for viewing.  You will not understand anything, only scribble here spiteful responses.  Don't wait for entertainments, something fantastic.  You receive a dose of the severe realism which has been buttressed up by facts.  It is not that thing which should be compared to a usual anime.  
 
I very much condole with those who got such destiny - to be stolen. But, I think, these people need more understanding than pity. And I admire those who could pass through such difficulty and live the rest of life as they would like. After all it is disgusting that political conflicts of the state level ruin lives of innocent people. 


          
 
       Helpful Not a fiction story, or even a proper ""story."" Megumi is one more appeal from her parents whose haven't seen her since 1977, when she was 13 years old. This short anime tells a little about Megumi, about how loved she was and then, how despairing it was when she vanished into thin air and reappeared inside of a country-sized prison. Her parents have been fighting since then to get their daughter back, even without the help of the government and the silence from North Korea. It's been, by the time of this writing, 41 years since Megumi disappearance and they still haven't heard from her ever since, and don't even know if she's dead or alive. This is a informative anime, or a propaganda anime if you prefer, not my first but still something interesting to see.  
 
Megumi, I just hope you get back well.

Shirobako. The show that defied my expectations so much, it changed my view on the anime industry forever. The anime industry is a harsh environment, that's for sure. Shirobako is the ingenious and simply brilliant show that delves into this harsh environment. The laughter, the struggles, the tears, and the sweat that goes into making an anime is expertly expressed in a way that I will never be able to forget.  
 
When it comes to pure entertainment, it's hard to surpass Shirobako. It drags you into a world that us anime viewers were always curious about, and it keeps you there with its brilliant depictions of everyday life. Shirobako is quite possibly the most educational show I have ever watched. Not only does it show you the behind the scenes work of an anime, but it also uses the hard life of an anime studio to teach you some simple yet useful life lessons. Very relatable things such as chasing your dreams, planning your future, asking yourself ""Why am I doing what I am doing?"", and that it's ok to rely on others and that teamwork is important. The show also gives insights on how to be a leader. The way this show weaves in these messages with the story and the character development makes the lessons even more impactful, and that is why Shirobako is such a brilliant show. 
 
In other words, Shirobako is a great example of a show-don't-tell series. 
 
Pros: 
- Characters, man. The characters in this show are all unique from each other and have their own distinct personalities. All of the characters. And there are A LOT of characters. 
- Art is gorgeous and the animation is amazing and creative.  
- Voice acting is super on fleek. It's fabulous. 
- Amazing messages and lessons are expressed. You've probably experienced these life lessons before, but Shirobako expresses them in a way that really engraves them into your heart. 
- Amazing comedy! Whether it be plain old jokes or parodies on real life anime titles (Neon Generation Avangaldon xD), this show will make you laugh! 
- This series has some really intense moments. Like a Thriller tag is applicable to some points of the anime. 
 
Cons: 
- Some of the main characters are underdeveloped, especially Shizuka, the redhead seiyuu. I feel like she deserved more love. 
- Some of the jokes won't hit home to some, as you need some knowledge about anime to understand them. 
 
Story: 9 
The story follows the life of Miyamori Aoi, who is a production assistant at Musashino Animation. It mainly follows her and her friends' daily lives as they follow their dreams and work hard. The overall story may not seem special, but it will surprise you. The way they go in depth to the professions that the protagonists experience really takes you to another world. This was a show where a LOT of research was done to pull it off. The character development was amazing and the dramatic and comedic moments were very well written. 
 
Art: 10 
The animation of animators animating their animations was spot on. The animation of this series was very creative, as it highlighted many different animation techniques used in anime (cause it's an anime about making anime.) The way the show switches between the animating style of ""real life"" and other anime within this anime (this is getting confusing) was really amazing. Also, incorporating CG animations to showcase the CG animators inside this anime was also well done. This was also one of the few anime where background characters weren't still images and you can see them going about their lives. Anime-ception is now complete. 
 
Sound: 10 
The OST was well suited for the series, and the OPs and EDs are all catchy! But it's all about the voice actors/actresses. Holy damn, they fit their roles and situations perfectly. The way they voice act a voice actresses in the anime who is voice acting for an anime within the anime (holy crap) was spot on. I felt like this show was one that required a lot of effort from the voice actors/actresses, and I feel like they pulled it off spectacularly.  
 
Characters: 10 
5 girls chasing their dreams in a way that only they can. This show is definitely a character driven show. Despite having a HUGE plethora of characters, they all have such diverse characteristics that make them very distinguishable from each other and very likable. They have their own ambitions and opinions and take shit from no one but themselves. They all have their nice and selfish sides. A lot of detail was put into their characteristics, even to the most irrelevant of side characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
An enlightening series that pasted a smile on my face and had me at the edge of my seat during the super intense moments.  
 
Overall: 10 
I'm totally biased, but there is no such thing as a not-biased review. So I'm going all out. This show was an experience like no other.

          
 
       Helpful Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless. 
 
You see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presented in a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, 60-40%. Well... maybe... erm... 
 
Anyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply ""moe"". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called ""Jiggly Jiggly Heaven"" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour. 
 
The reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions:  
 
Would you work under him?  
 
Now think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead. 
 
What would you do when you found out he's this way? 
 
Would you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would? 
 
Except that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: ""Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy."" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay. 
 
And this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a ""oh my god a setback"" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out. 
 
It looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through. 
 
That was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic.  
 
The art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: ""DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!"". Ugh. 
 
As you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them. 
 
If you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.

          
 
       Helpful Very rarely does an anime come out and I describe it as unique; Shirobako is an exception. I have a very hard time coming up with any anime that remind me of Shirobako, because it is just so unique. It's an anime ABOUT making anime, so it's almost as if P.A. Works knew they were going to have an instant success on their hands. Shirobako is much more than that. It is simply an amazing experience. 
 
Story - 9 
     
Shirobako is about making anime. And that's it. They story just goes from there, talking about everything from production problems to character designers to even 3D work. It's amazing how much detail they cram into only 24 episodes. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the story isn't incredibly strong, and relies heavily on its characters, which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that it isn't as strong as it could have been. That said, it is still better than 90% of other anime that came out in 2014/2015. 
 
Art - 7 
 
The art isn't the best P.A. Works has done (That would be Nagi No Asukara in terms of fluidity and Another in terms of art design), but it's still solid. It takes everyday situations, and designs them in fantastical ways that make it much less realistic than it could be, but that's part of it's charm, and I kind of prefer it this way. Also, the character designs are amazing and some of my favorite designs in a while, particularly the designs for Shizuka and Seiichi. Also, Ogasuwara. 
 
Sound - 7 
 
The soundtrack doesn't distract from the show, and there isn't much to talk about. I like the openings and endings, but they are nowhere near my favorites. The reason it gets a 7 is because of all the voices. Seiichi's voice in particular is so lovable, I don't know if any English voice actor will do any of the characters justice. Weird, because normally I'm not a dub hater, I rather like dub, in fact, but this might be one of the few shows that I won't be able to watch the dub for because I've gotten attached to the characters' voices so hardcore. They're that good. 
 
Characters - 10 
 
This. This is where Shirobako truly shined. I was gonna write a big long paragraph here, but I'm lazy, so let me just say that they are all brilliant and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen in an anime. My favorites are Miyamori, Shizuka, Seiichi, Iguchi, Okitsu(because she's a badass), and Ema(because of that dance in episode 16).  They are amazing. 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
 
The show gets one point of for enjoyment because the opening episodes didn't grab me as much as the later ones. Still, amazing overall. Thoroughly entertaining, I was almost never bored. 
 
Overall - 10 
 
For the longest time, I've been searching for an anime similar to the American version of The Office, and I finally found it in Shirobako. It's a workplace comedy that isn't just about the comedy, and all the characters gel so nicely with one another, it's insane. Most of all, though, is that after watching Shirobako, you gain an appreciation for every anime you've ever seen, because of all the hard work put into all of anime. This is why I consider Shirobako to be one of the 5 anime that I consider mandatory viewing for any anime fan, with the others being the anime closest to your other favorite TV show, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and School Days, all for varying reasons. But, those are reviews for another day. In the meantime, I'll just be here, in my room, waiting impatiently for Shirobako Season 2.

It's taken as gospel here on MAL that Ashita no Joe or ""Tomorrow's Joe"" was the first good anime ever made. I've decided to be even more of a hipster and go even farther back. This is Benkei and Ushiwaka from 1939! While Osamu Tezuka is rightfully remembered as the father of manga, there is far less appreciation for Kenzo Masaoka. Back in the 1930s, Masaoka was inspired by the work of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer to create cartoons depicting traditional Japanese folklore. Masaoka not only introduced sound to anime for the first time, but also introduced the concept of cel animation. Masaoka's apprentice was Mitsuyo Seo, who created the first full length anime film: Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors. It was this film that inspired young Osamu Tezuka to learn art and start telling stories of his own! 
 
The plot of the film is simple, since this is only around 10 minutes. It starts with the famous 12th century samurai, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, training under the tengu at the foot of Mt. Kurama. Minamoto then fights an epic duel against the warrior monk Benkei. This is the first action anime ever made and it looks pretty good for 1939! It's actually better than Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors from 1945, but this had the advantage of being shorter and not being made in the death throes of WW2. 
 
 
Art: 
 
 
In this film, we can see Masaoka is still being heavily influenced by American animation. It isn't really until his 1946 anime Sakura that Masaoka becomes confortable with his own style. The animation is relatively smooth for a 1939 cartoon. It's not Snow White, but this was made on a budget. 
 
 
Overall: 
 
It can easily be argued that without Masaoka there would be no Seo. Without Seo there wouldn't be Tezuka and without Tezuka, anime as we know it wouldn't exist. Masaoka is the grandfather of all anime and this is one of his better early works that still exists. Sadly, many of his early works were lost due to the bombing campaigns of WW2. If you're interested in early anime history, this short film is essential! 


          
 
       Helpful This is something that I think everyone should watch. It not only gives you a good representation of who we can thank for where we are today, but also how far we've come. With that said, here is a bit of a review. 
 
Story: 6  Without spoiling it, it's another historical animation, with a bit of good action and a story that you will at least find a bit interesting. 
 
Art: 7  It might seem weird giving this a 7, but for 1939, you've got to consider the limitations, and how what you are watching isn't so much about the shine or the sparkles, but about making something fun and interesting within the limitations allotted. 
 
Sound: 6  There was some skipping, but so what, have you seen some of the Anime today? There are some messed up voice acting in those as well, and what is their excuse? 
 
Character: 7  A rather likable ""hero-ish"" character that was someone you could understand more if you'd watched it back then and from the country where the source material was made. Otherwise, he is a character that you can at least root for. 
 
Enjoyment: 5  Although it is fun to see how far we've come, it isn't going to blow you away. It felt like a history lesson, fun for those who love history and wish to learn more about how we got here, but also a bit dull after realizing how far we can still go haha. 
 
Overall: 6  Again, worth the watch, if anything to be more grateful for the anime we have today. But if you go in expecting to learn something and still have a decent story, you won't be disappointed!

His dreams are much more ambitious than becoming a Japanese Baseball League player, so he instead decides to move to the birthplace of his beloved sport, America, in order to play in the Major League. 
 
However, Gorou finds that the Major League players are much faster, stronger, and more driven than he is. Nonetheless, he is eager to catch up with them. In order to do so, Gorou must first conquer the ranks of the Minor League, where numerous skilled players compete in the grueling rise to the Majors.

       Helpful The best sport anime i have ever seen. 
The best seasons are in my opinion 2 and 4. 
One reason is that they both have good openings. 
I like fourth season because it has a complete change in characters and other good thing is that he's finally playing in some other country than Japan. 
Season 2 well i don't really know how it is good apart from the opening.

3,3024,59,9.884868124,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Ribbon no Kishi,"Princess Sapphire is a girl raised as a Prince. Through the mischief of an angel, the princess is born with both a girl's body and boy's mind. Since there is no boy successor in her kingdom, Sapphire is raised as a boy, but evil ministers try to reveal her secret. Unable to put up with the kind of vicious conduct prevailing in the kingdom, Sapphire disguises herself as ""Princess Knight"" and wields her sword of justice. 
 
This is an animated version of the girls' manga featuring Sapphire's romance and adventure, which marked the first made-for-TV animated program geared towards girls in Japan. 
 
(Source: Official site)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","Taking place in a medieval European-like fairy tale setting, Princess Knight is the story of Sapphire who must pretend to be a male prince so she can inherit the throne of Silverland as women are not eligible to do so. As she is born, her father, the King, announces his baby is a boy instead of a girl. The reason for this is that the next-in-line to the throne, Duke Duralumin is an evil man who would repress the people if his son, Plastic, were to become king. Duralumin and his henchman Baron Nylon often scheme to take over the kingdom and attempts to prove that Sapphire is really a girl. Sapphire can keep the fa?ade because, when she was born, she received the blue heart of a boy as well as the pink heart of a girl. Because of this, God sent Tink, a young angel-in-training, down to Earth to retrieve Sapphire's extra heart. Sapphire would not let Tink remove her boy's heart, however.
Sapphire and Tink experience a variety of adventures, including encounters with Satan, a warlock who wants to steal Sapphire's special two-hearted soul and take over the kingdom. However, he is always frustrated by Tink and his fear of angels, and by his own daughter, Hecate, a demonic-shapeshifting witch who at first she appears to be evil like her father, but who covertly helps Sapphire foil her father's plans. Sapphire also dons a Zorro-style mask at night, fighting crime as the Phantom Knight, and gets involved with Franz Charming, the young prince of neighboring Goldland. Their relationship is multi-faceted; Franz is familiar with Sapphire as three entirely different people and has different feelings toward each. He is good friends with Prince Sapphire, in love with the unnamed princess, and despises the Phantom Knight, whom he believes is a rival for the Princess's affection.
As the story progresses, Duralumin stages a coup d'état to conquer Silverland, following the orders of Mr. X, a large man clad entirely in boxy red armor and the ruler of the X-Union, a neighboring, proto-fascist federation of nations that wants to conquer the three kingdoms (Silverland, Goldland, and Charcoal-land). The King and Queen are captured, but help Sapphire to flee. Duralumin is about to proclaim his son king and himself as regent when he is assassinated by Nylon, who has been driven near-insane by the Duke's constant abuse. The mentally deranged Nylon proclaims himself and welcomes Mr. X and his armies in Silverland. Mr. X, though, soon makes it clear that he has no intention of letting Nylon rule, even as a puppet monarch, and merely keeps him around as a churlish buffoon.
Sapphire and Franz try to prevent the King and Queen from being executed, but they are too late and the King and Queen are dropped in the sea. This culminates in the final battle, as Sapphire heads off to Silverland castle to confront Mr. X with the aid of three magic balls. Given to Sapphire by her parents, the balls represent the three kingdoms and are supposed to save Silverland: they are used at first to ring the kingdom's bells, magically giving to the people the will to fight the invaders.
Sapphire has the balls melted to form a magic ax which she uses to rout Mr. X's troops, break up the castle's walls, and confront X himself. Sapphire ends up dueling Mr. X, with the help of Franz, and manages to wound him. Just as the enraged Mr. X is about to chop Sapphire and Franz in half, Tink calls on God for help, and a lightning bolt strikes X. As Sapphire seems to triumph, Mr. X rises from his apparent death and begins smashing the castle with his bare hands, eventually causing it to collapse onto himself. Nylon, who was swaying through the halls like a raving madman, is also crushed to death. Sapphire escapes the collapsing castle and stands triumphant in the sunlight. Tink has been mortally wounded by the castle's breakdown and tells God that he is ready to sacrifice his life should Sapphire's parents be brought back from the dead. God then accepts to bring back the King and Queen to life, as Tink dies.
Sapphire and Franz end up getting married. Tink's spirit returns to heaven where he has finally earned his wings.
","Oh my god, is this anime dated. The animation is awful and the plots range from generic to ridiculous. But I love it. 
 
When you start watching this, you have to remember that Ribbon no Kishi is the Ur Example of shoujo. It was revolutionary and genre-defining for it's time; most shoujo series that came after have been inspired by or deconstructed the elements Tezuka introduced. To truly appreciate this anime, you need to watch it as a study rather than expecting something refreshing or deep. 
 
Like most classic anime, the animation was done on the cheap. Cells are blatantly recycled (even from the intro) and there are long, artificial pauses that make the characters look like they're spacing out between lines. The bad 70's English dub available on Crunchyroll doesn't offer any improvements, though Nylon's voice is fun to hear. 
 
All of the characters are idiots. Every single one of them! Most of the plots get rolling because someone missed something obvious and did something very stupid. But that's classic Tezuka, and there are moments where silly things happen just for the sake of silliness. This is fine; this is a kids cartoon from an era where animation was meant to be spectacle. It's a mishmash of fantastic tales where, even if the conclusion is obvious, the path the characters take towards it is unpredictable. 
 
If you already appreciate classic anime or are a huge Tezuka fan, definitely give this a watch. If you love shojo anime and want some insight into how it began, try a few episodes. Everyone else, well... you're probably better off checking out the manga or reading the plot summary on Wikipedia.

          
 
       Helpful Ribbon no Kishi is one of the earliest anime, made in 1967. It's from the period when Japanese animation hadn't yet gained its distinctive characteristics. It feels more like American cartoons of the period than modern Japanese anime. However, it preserves its innocence. 
 
The plot is cute. Princess Sapphire was born with a girl’s body and a boy's mind (whatever it is). She is the “prince” of Silverland. There’s an iron law in Silverland that only males can inherit the throne. Being the only child of the royal family, her gender is kept secret from the public to guarantee royal succession. Some cunning palace officers, especially the main antagonist, Duke Duralumon strives to reveal the truth in order to rule Silverland.  
 
But the poor princess’ problem doesn’t end there.  She was born with a boy's mind due to a mischief of an angel called Tink. The angel is sent back to make her feel and behave feminine again. Tink always accompanies her.  
 
This is a children's cartoon. It has the charming simplicity of characters, music, and art. Nevertheless, today's children wouldn't be satisfied with it. Its stereotypical characters with predictable actions may bore but if you're tired of convoluted and ridiculous plotlines, you should give it a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Princess Knight (TV) is an adaptation of a short manga series, by the father of manga himself, Osamu Tezuka. If you’ve been into anime long enough, you’re bound to know who I’m referencing, if not, he made Astro Boy. The anime version of Princess Knight is one of the most dated things that I’ve ever experienced and the English dub is comedy gold. 
 
	? Especially Choppy’s voice. Each episode of Ribbon no Kishi is pretty episodic and is reminiscent of any old Disney or Max Fleshier animation. Except, this one is extremely low budget. People and objects randomly disappear. Color palettes change. 
	 
	? Strangely enough, for all of you who are familiar with Gundam, this was one of Yoshiyuki Tomino’s first internships, if not THE first. I’m not exactly sure, but I know that Tomino had some kind of partnership with Tezuka Productions before going waist deep into the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise.  
	 
	? This series is not very good looking for its time, I’ve seen better looking Betty Boop cartoons from thirty years prior to when this came out in (the 1960’s). The 1960’s are not when anime became what it is today though, the 1970’s are the gilded, golden age of Japanese animation and most of their top-tier works started blossoming toward the end and into the 80’s. 
	 
	? There’s not much to say about continuity, there are even characters that supposedly die at the end, and the show pulls a JUST KIDDING! They’re still alive, because this is a children’s cartoon and we can’t show death. And then Ringing Bell came out… Overall, just skip the anime and dive into the manga. The manga has a similar fantastical feeling as Tezuka’s Unico comics.  
	 
	? This series also was a stepping stone toward female liberation and gender ambiguity in anime, that still holds up today. Sapphire became Utena and Revolutionary Girl Utena was a largely iconic series for females growing up in the 1990’s and so forth. I give Princess Knight (TV) a 2/10 and highly suggest the manga instead, which I rated a 6/10.

       Helpful Just for everyone to know: 
1. It's NON-CANON 
2. It's a PROMOTIONAL anime for Dragon Ball Heroes, so don't expect every week 20 minute episodes that are perfect  
3. Be happy that they will bring us thing Akira would probably never give us (such as ssj3 trunks and such) 
4. Just look at it as if it's a fan-service-only anime... so don't expect perfect quality 
 
It's not that I accept this all, of course I would want 20 minute episodes, but we can't change it from a promotional anime to a full-running anime like Dragon Ball used to be by writing hate reviews or being hateful to the makers of this anime. 
And to the people saying this anime is a waste of time, they also always complain about them being too short, or that it takes too long to publish another episode. If you don't want to wait for the next episode, then do things that are more important like an actual job, instead of writing reviews about hating the series. 
Besides that I do agree that the story isn't 'interesting' yet, and it lacks logics of the power between characters, but it was already messed up in DBS anyways.  
At least they don't rush things the first 6 episodes like DBS did with awful animation...  
 
This is not to be hating on the haters, but I'm just pointing out some obvious things. This is nothing to anybody personal, but I just see way too many over the top hate reviews on the series.

Super Dragon Ball Heroes - SO IF ANYONE WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE DRAGON BALL HEROES ISN’T A THING, GUESS AGAIN, HERE WE ARE WITH AN ANIME INSTEAD OF 1 MINUTE PROMOTION. 
 
For real though, I have nothing against the game nor the premise per say. What I am asking is this: Really? You think your fanbase is so addictive to your IP that they just can’t wait less than a year to get new content? You really want to milk Dragonball so bad that we need filler content just so that your audience doesn’t forget about it? 
 
This anime is one of those original net animation from Toei, which is basically Toei way of releasing their content very cheaply.  
 
What I am saying is that this anime is cheap as it comes with very underwhelming character interaction. You know how the people outside the fandom think Dragon Ball is? Just fight after fight with no thought outside of presenting the fight themselves? Well this anime is simply that. You get some fights and that's it. But of course we have a story to tell. 
 
Dragon Ball Heroes or Super Dragon Ball Heroes takes place some time after Super Dragon Ball has ended with Goku and Vegeta training with Whis once more. But uh oh! A new evil looking glasses character shows up and tells that his ‘friend’ Future Trunks has been captured in prison planet! I personally would call it planet less a dank place and more a planet with giant ass chains, but I digress.  
 
And from here on out we meet some characters which our heroes are thrown to and we get to see more fanservice. How come they are here? Well there are many reasons for each characters to be here, but to summarize it, it's because of Money and Fuck You. I believe that there are some people who want to see Golden Not-Freeza in all his might, but I doubt that it was Toei top priorities to make your wish come true. 
 
So about what I said earlier regarding how this show is just fights after another. I wouldn’t call this a bad thing per say. Considering how this is Dragon ball, you could make this the best feature by having the characters adapt the situation of their unique enemy. This is what most of the Dragon ball movies and special tried to do. The keyword was tried. Here the fights are just boring to watch. There is no weight behind each battle, nor any flashy animations that would make this at least look nice. 
 
To give you an example, watching these fights are like going to a fast food restaurant and only ordering fries from the menu after another. It's gives you a kick at first, it then start to tastes the same, and then you wish you had added something more. 
 
You might say this is just to be a promotional anime for the game, but we already have the commercials for it, and ton of them, so… what? 
 
I also most congratulate Toei animation. You somehow made it boring to watch Goku Goku action. I-I-I just can’t believe you actually rushed that fight. You even made fusion, freaking fusion something that lacks all of it excitement. Hmmm, maybe if you actually had some stakes or at least had some fun it might would had been enduring. Since serious Dragon ball nowadays is something that would not work due to how the series never gonna permanently remove any important characters, I was hoping that this would rather be comedic Dragon Ball. Alas, this wasn't a comedic entry.  
 
Okay but what about the NEW characters? We have evil glasses guy, Fuu, he's… eh. We have not-Broly/Raditz, he’s a saiyan, he's… eh. I can’t remember his name. I'm not joking, I know he's named after a vegetable, has the power to control people and turn into a giant ape, but he's freaking name wasn't even important to remember. Hell I remember his voice actors name more than his. You know, the more of these saiyans appear on screen, the more I appreciate Freezas genocide. I mean Jesus Fucking Space Christ, how many non trained saiyans were there to be over a thousands times stronger than Goku in this multiverse? 
 
There is one thing that makes this anime belong so far low on the list. Even if this anime is average at best, there's this attitude Toei has. Toei made this when we were going to have a arguably better Dragon Ball product very soon. Like guys, don't you think that you should spend these resources on the movie and not on an animated advertisement?  
 
This isn't strange for Toei to go all out on their current main IPs. Yet I also haft to ask this; why the fuck couldn't you spent this amount of resources on doing mini series for your other older IPs? You know, those others who are or had anniversaries? How about Sally the Witch? Fist of The North Star? Cutie Honey? Hell Teacher Nūbē? Or even Kinnikuman? You could do every episode on Kinnikuman day. Or even better, MAKE A GODDAMN CARTOON ABOUT YOUR MASCOT! IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS! But I will talk about that another time. Oooh do I have plans for it. 
 
As for this, eh. I got not much else to say about this show. It's a online video series made by Toei, what kind of quality did you expect? You get some good voice acting from the series standards and the newcomers seems to be doing a good job, but else seems to bland. 
 
If you want to watch Dragon Ball Heroes, just watch the commercials or play the game. You could skip this one okay. You ain't missing much from this. Honestly.

3,14131,61,9.863529355,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Girls & Panzer,"""Senshadou"" is a traditional sport using World War II era tanks in elimination-based matches. Widely practiced by women and girls alike, it's advertised as a form of art geared towards making ladies more prominent in culture and appealing to men. Becoming a worldwide phenomenon over time, the influence of senshadou leads to the creation of a world championship which will soon be held in Japan. 
 
Miho Nishizumi, who comes from a lineage of well-respected senshadou specialists, is at odds with the sport after a traumatic event led to her retirement and eventually a rift to form between her and her family. To steer clear of the practice as much as possible, she transfers to Ooarai Girls High School where the senshadou program has been abolished. However, with the news of the upcoming championships, the school revives their tankery program, and Miho is pushed into joining. 
 
Now, with the aid of some new friends, she must overcome her past and once again take command of a squadron of tanks in an effort to save her school from closure, all while proving to her family that the Nishizumi-style of senshadou is not solely about victory. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sports', 'Military', 'School']","
The story takes place in a world where historical World War II�Cera tanks are maintained for sport-style warfare competitions and large carrier ships, known as Academy Ships, support mobile sea communities. Of the many activities high school students can participate in, one of the most popular is ""sensha-dō"" (�檐�道, lit. ""the way of the tank""), the art of operating tanks, which is considered a traditional martial art for females.
Miho Nishizumi, a girl from a prestigious family of sensha-dō practitioners who became traumatized by a past event, transfers to ?arai Girls High School to get away from sensha-dō, as she presumed the school was no longer practicing the sport. However, shortly after Miho begins her new school life and makes some new friends, the student council announces the revival of sensha-dō at ?arai and coerces Miho, the only student with prior experience, to join. While reluctant to join at first, having practically been forced, Miho soon warms up to sensha-dō and they enter a national championship, facing off against various other schools, in a competition that becomes a serious matter after Miho and the others learn that their school will be closed should they not win.The spin-off manga, Girls und Panzer: Little Army, follows Miho in her elementary school days as she participates in sensha-dō alongside her friends Emi, Hitomi, and Chihiro.
","Girls und Panzer is a running joke that never delivers its punch line, and that is why the show is a masterpiece. One its surface, Girls und Panzer appears to be another ‘cute girls doing cute things’ anime with the cute thing this time being riding and fighting tanks. That’s the joke. The underlying premise is so ridiculous and absurd that you can’t not find it funny. However, this anime will play it straight faced for all 12 episodes, but it’s still a joke. This anime enrapture you with breathtaking tank battles, clever comedy and surprising drama, but it’s still a joke. The fact that Girls und Panzer transcends the joke that is at the core the anime into an amazing show makes this a must watch for those who love anime and especially those who love good storytelling. 
 
Girls und Panzer’s biggest strength is its tank battles. The battles themselves have good pacing that allows for the creation suspense that feels appropriate and adds to the entertainment value. Because tankery is a high school club in Girls und Panzer, it comes with rules in its conduct and victory criteria. These rules are simple to understand, internally consistent and clearly allow for upsets to occur. These rules allow the viewer to understand what the girls are trying to achieve in their battle plans and make the upsets that do occur completely believable. The tanks themselves are historically accurate. Tanks with heavy armor will have tank rounds bounce off, but they will also be slow because of that armor. Many of the WW2 era tanks are showcased at some point in the show and tank buffs will enjoy looking for their favorite tanks. 
 
The main characters are solid, though they do not stand out compared to other anime. But with Girls und Panzer’s focus being the tank battles, the main characters are developed well for the time they have and do add to the show. The side characters are ridiculous, but the show is inherently ridiculous so it doesn’t feel odd. They do add a spice to the show that is enjoyable to watch, especially in the first few episodes. The other teams represent various countries in both the tanks they use and the stereotypes of the people on it. Those characters are always fun to watch in the brief appearances they make. 
 
Girls und Panzer also resonates with me for personal reasons. My job is to command tanks in combat. This anime is able to capture the trill of firing the main gun of a tank and how awesome it is to maneuver tanks against an enemy force. Fighting in tanks is fun (at least in war games), and this anime shows that. It even shows how much it sucks to fix a tank when breaks down in the field. 
 
While I understand that not everyone will love this anime as much as I do, I’m sure that most people will enjoy watching Girls und Panzer and have no regrets doing so. 


          
 
       Helpful I honestly shouldn't have liked this anime. From the sadly large amount of anime I've watched, you'd think I'd know to stay away from something that I can only describe as ""moe tanks."" However, I gave into my friend's harping, and sat down and took this predictable yet intriguing show in all at once, and: I'd recommend it.  
 
Story: 7 
Hear me out. The show's story revolved around a group of high school girls (who go to school on some sort of floating town carrier ship?) as they try to win the tankery championship. This sounds completely ridiculous. It is. Yet, the staff managed to weave this completely...inconceivable...and ill-developed story into something that seemed fully plausible. By the end of it, I felt like I was watching any regular sports anime. I found myself invested in the concept of the story by one simple line in the first episode that goes something like, ""It's a bit weird to think of a guy doing tankery. It's so feminine!"" It dragged me into this world where nothing was really explained, and tankery was somehow exclusively female (like American football, I guess). I give this a 7 because the show managed to leave me thinking about tankery like it was an average sport, never mind the weird floating ships of schools. It was such a uniquely weird topic, that I became invested in learning about tanks, which I knew nothing of before. I paid attention, I learned, and I was dragged in.  
 
Art: 7 
The dimensions on the girls' faces when side-facing annoyed me to no end. Other than that, the art was generally moe. I would give it a 5 or 6 if I wasn't so impressed by the movements of the tanks and how they were animated. Seriously, I found myself staring at their almost-meticulous detailing rather than the girls' faces.  
 
Sound: 4 
I hate moe soundtracks, and that's exactly what this had. It was a bit forcedly feminine, but neither the OP or ED were what I'd call ""bad."" They were average. The background music throughout the series was also average. The only thing I found remarkable was this kind-of weird rendition of some characters singing a Russian war song...alright. 
 
Character: 6 
The character developments were all completely predictable. Common family in-fighting, get's resolved, everyone's more or less content. Some crying here and there. There were so many girls in this show, that the 12 episodes couldn't really explore any of their personalities or backgrounds in depth other than a few main characters. Even those were pretty surface level. Honestly, only one of the main characters stood out to me (the poofy-haired one), but I can't even remember her name, because, at the end of the day, the show threw so many names at me that I only remembered the protagonist's name. The protagonist, Miho, was a fairly average trope, but I enjoyed her more than I thought because the show didn't resort to all of the typical cliches with her, and she displayed great battle acumen by the end of the show. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
I KNOW. A 9. UGH. This seems uncalled for, and it is. The story really, seriously, drew me in. I ended up on, like, 20 tank Wikipedia pages and was Youtubing videos of M4 Shermans firing by the end of the show. The fact that I was pulled in from the beginning into treating the show like a sports anime made it, honestly, insanely fun to watch matches. I knew what the outcome of each of them would be, but the team who created this seriously researched their military stuff. The tactics were fun and realistic, the tanks moved in a captivating way, and the enemies were all unique. I felt the care that went into production for this show, and I loved watching it all unfold. This show presented a unique combination of something like a soccer anime and a historical war anime, and had me smiling in every match.  
 
Overall: 7 
Ultimately, though I seriously enjoyed it, the I think that this show failed to expand on the possibilities that it had to work with. The characters lacked depth, and the outcome of everything from the character drama to the match outcomes were highly predictable. Nothing was really outstanding other than the unique story. Still, the weirdness of the story managed to pull everything else up with it, and I found myself at the edge of my seat for the matches, even though I thought this would be some moe sports anime that was meant to appeal to military-game fans. 
 
Receiving a solid 7, I recommend this anime for anyone looking for a unique and somehow refreshing mishmash of sports, military, and moe.

          
 
       Helpful (THIS REVIEW HAS A FEW SPOILERS) 
 
Over the years there have been various hybrid series putting cute girls into situations you wouldn’t normally see (Gakkougurashi! comes to mind). Some of these series manage to pull off the interesting contrast and others fall short. Now we have high school girls doing moe things while driving around in tanks. How does this fare as a series? Well, as you can see by my rating, not particularly well, in my opinion. Read on, and I'll tell you why.  
 
The story here is pretty simple. Various schools from around the area take part in the influential sport of ‘tankwondo,’ which involves two teams going at it in tank warfare to show which school can come out on top. Our main character, Nishizumi Miho, has just entered into a new school that doesn’t have this sport, but lo and behold, they decide to bring it back right as she arrives. The student council wants Miho to join due to her family’s excellent track record with strategic command in tank battles, but she doesn’t want anything to do with it any more. When she tries to turn them down with the support of her new friends, the student council president threatens to kick her out of school. She replies with, “Tank battles it is then, I didn’t want to join the tea ceremony club anyways!” (I paraphrased that last part) From here, it’s all about coming together with her new group of friends and winning the tankwondo championship for the school. So, what we have is an underdog story with the focus on friendship and teamwork. It’s a style that’s been done to death, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used well. While the aforementioned theme works well enough in this series, it’s hindered by various other things, a few major issues in particular.  
 
The first issue to discuss is the mood of the series. I know that this series is meant to be goofy and fun, with the contrast of young girls operating large war machines emphasizing this. However, they also try to insert serious moments and themes that don’t work well, such as the school closing down if their team can’t manage to win the championship. The problem here is they take forever to even mention it, which creates pointless drama. Then there’s the main antagonist group, the final team, which happens to have Miho’s older sister in it. They challenge each other, but Miho will have to win against the other schools first. What’s the problem here? There’s no tension whatsoever. You already KNOW they’ll make it to the finals, the battles themselves don’t have many gripping moments or cliffhangers and, because of the goofy mood, the “We have to win no matter what!” moments fall flat. Not to mention, there’s no tense background music to provide a more stressful atmosphere for these encounters. It keeps playing the same silly tunes, for the most part, so you’re left unsure of how you should feel. 
 
The other issue worth bringing up involves contradictions popping up. “We have our knowledge that the school will close if we don’t give it our all, so let’s do our best!” All right, then why are you getting out of your tank during a battle to thank someone for help, when you could easily and just as sincerely do it over the radio like the other teams? Why was a new team of girls seemingly not trained at all for an extremely important final battle? Why was the final battle between the sisters declared a solo match among themselves but, when the enemy team came to assist, the older sister didn’t call them off? Why are certain harsh and spiteful opponents automatically friendly after a loss? Why are they allowed to fight in town and destroy it? Even if they get reimbursed, why don’t the townspeople feel it’s an inconvenience? Why were two characters disowned from their families for ridiculous reasons involving tankwondo, then suddenly accepted again without any kind of development? Things like this just don’t make much sense to me.  
 
Now, how about some GOOD things? The main characters are pretty likable, even a few secondary ones. Their kind relationship with each other is nice to see, and they get developed enough to make you care about each of them. Despite having a huge cast, I don’t feel it detracts from anything here. The tank battles, while being mostly uninteresting, do have some good bits of strategy, particularly during the last fight. The overall art is nice to look at, and the tanks are also extremely well modeled and animated. Aside from the lackluster normal soundtrack, the opening and ending songs are catchy and nice to listen to.  
 
I really wanted to like this series; in fact I usually enjoy quirky stuff like this. Unfortunately, the problems detracted from my overall experience. You could make the argument that tank battles aren’t really my thing, and I’m not into sports very much in general. Yet I’m a huge fan of Prince of Tennis and Kuroko no Basket. In the end, it comes down to writing and presentation, and Girls und Panzer fell short in both areas for me.

However, despite his father's pleas, Kokonotsu Shikada, an aspiring manga artist, adamantly refuses to inherit the family business. 
 
However, this may start to change with the arrival of the eccentric Hotaru Shidare. Hotaru is in search of Kokonotsu's father, with the goal of bringing him back to work for her family's company, Shidare Corporation, a world famous sweets manufacturer. Although the senior Shikada initially refuses, he states that he will change his mind on one condition: if Hotaru can convince Kokonotsu to take over the family shop. And so begins Hotaru's mission to enlighten the boy on the true joy of delicious and nostalgic dagashi! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']","Shikada Dagashi, a countryside shop selling cheap candy and snacks (""dagashi"") has been run by the Shikada family for nine generations, but Kokonotsu does not want to take over the shop from his father, Yō, instead aiming to become a manga artist. Hotaru Shidare visits the shop one day hoping to recruit Yō to her family's company, the sweets manufacturer Shidare Corporation, but Yō refuses unless Hotaru first can convince Kokonotsu to take over Shikada Dagashi.
","Dagashi Kashi doesn't really feel like an anime per se, more of an advertisement along with a history lesson. 
 
So the general story is that Hotaru one day appears at Kokonotsu's candy store to persuade You (his father) to join her company, but You will only agree if Kokonotsu takes over the candy store. And... that's pretty much where the story ends because from thenceforth every episode is exploring a different Japanese candy, how delicious they are, and their history, along with some light fan service. So basically, this is like Shokugeki no Souma lite. 
 
In regards to art and sound they're okay. The art is better than average so it's an 8 while the sound is an average of 7.  
 
The characters are pretty stagnant which would've been okay in a slice-of-life but I feel as though there should be a bit more to them. Kokonotsu also has a childhood friend who secretly likes him and for whatever reason she serves, we don't really know. 
 
Overall, the anime is okay. It's really something that's acceptable to watch while you eat to pass the time, but it's not something I would recommend you to go out of your way to watch unless you're really interested in learning about Japanese candy that you may want to try.

          
 
       Helpful Dagashi Kashi is for me the rare show that turned out to be different from what I expected, in a wholly positive way. No fanservice or wish fulfilment going on here, just unabashed dagashi nerdiness and fun slice of life. 
 
The premise is simple: An energetic girl comes to a town out in the countryside and tries to encourage our protagonist, Coconuts, to take over his father's dagashi shop. The story is full of nice people, the characters are pretty much all likeable and behave naturally throughout the show. I find Coconut's father, You(his mom's name must be ""Me"") to be an especially fun character, he is really energetic and caring, the kind of father you hardly get in anime these days. 
 
You have to be prepared though, the show throws a lot of facts at you which can get repetitive. Each episode is divided into segments that talk about individual snacks, which are chock full of history and small quirks about each specific dagashi. It helps to have a bit of knowledge about the kinds of sweets there are available in Japan, but for me I never felt lost, even when the jokes didn't hit there was usually something to learn. 
 
The show does however have a bit of a slow start. The character Tou comes off as pretty mean in the first episode but gets a lot more enjoyable through the course of the show. Some of the sound effects are pretty stock, and Studio Feel's animation doesn't flow very well at points, but these are minor issues in the show. If you're a sucker for anything related to history or Japan I'd say you'd take to this show very well, there's a lot going on in Dagashi Kashi even though it might not be the most complex show out there. Its smart and uplifting, the kind of show that will never fail to brighten up your day.

          
 
       Helpful Dagashi Kashi has potential, but fails in fully using it. Its cast is way too good compared to the rest of the show. 
 
I feel that the show could have been really good if it weren?t for its focus on the candy - the core component of the show. What we got is a series of 24 minute commercials for japanese sweets with occasional good parts, the moment when the focus was on the characters and not on the sweets. The cast consists of only 5 people with a strong focus on Kokonotsu and Hotaru. There is a reason that Hotaru has more favorites on MAL than the show itself, she is a great character. While it seems at the beginning that she has some sort of higher goal you realize later that while she certainly likes Kokonotsu, she will forever only have one love: candy. As the daughter of one of the biggest Japanese candy producers, she knows EVERYTHING about every candy in Japan. That?s why she wants Kokonotsu to take over the store of his father, he has to operate the store with his own big knowledge of candy. Because Kokonotsu has no intention at all to continue the store while still knowing a lot about it, the majority of the show consists of the two candy pros arguing about candy. That?s the reason why the show is rated so low: It can be quite boring at times to listen to them talking about chocolate for the twentieth time in a row. The real highlight are the times when they meet the rest of the cast, the siblings Saya and Tou: With Tou?s ability to be impressed by the simplest things and Saya?s crush on Kokonotsu and her being constantly annoyed about the childing behaviour of everyone, we have everything we need to have comedy. But the comedy of seeing everyone?s personality clash together is interrupted by candy commercials which can be funny at times, but often feel a few minutes too long. 
 
The character design is good, everyone looks like you would expect them by their personalities while the minimalistic art makes them rememberable(look at Hotaru?s pupils) and the animation is quite good. 
 
Dagashi Kashi is a show that I would recommend for the great characters and the comedy, if you can look behind the bad to mediocre story. Personally, I think that this season should have been a 15-minute short while the second season should have gotten full 24 minutes because they realized that people wanted more Hotaru and others and less of the candy talk.

However, new challengers are rising up left and right, claiming to have an answer for the move responsible for crushing his opponents. Will Ippo be able to step up to the challenge, or will the weight of his pride destroy him before he finds out just what it means to be strong? Meanwhile, fellow Kamogawa Gym mate Aoki Masaru is just a hop, skip, and a Frog Punch away from claiming his own belt, ready to take on the Japanese Lightweight Champion! 
 
 Hajime no Ippo: Rising  continues Ippo's quest to become stronger, featuring the same cast of loveable dimwits from Kamogawa Gym, as they put their bodies and hearts on the line to make their way in the harsh world of professional boxing. With a will of iron, Ippo steps into the ring once again. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Sports', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","Ippo Makunouchi was an extremely shy high school student, unable to make friends due to always being busy helping his mother run their family fishing charter business. Because he kept to himself, a group of bullies led by Umezawa got into the habit of picking on him. One day, when these bullies gave him a rather serious beating, a middleweight professional boxer who was passing by stopped them and took the injured Ippo to the Kamogawa Gym (��川ボクシングジム, Kamogawa Bokushingu Jimu), owned by retired boxer Genji Kamogawa, to treat his wounds. After Ippo awoke to the sounds of boxers training, the boxer who saved him, Mamoru Takamura, tried to cheer Ippo up by letting him vent his frustrations on a sandbag. It was then that they had their first glimpse into Ippo's talent for boxing. After that incident, Ippo gave the situation a lot of thought and decided that he would like to begin a career as a professional boxer. When he conveys this message to Mamoru Takamura, he gets verbally reprimanded: Takamura thought Ippo was taking professional boxing too lightly. However, Takamura felt that he couldn't outright refuse Ippo, especially since his feat of punching the sandbag much harder than anybody else in the gym (except for Takamura). Therefore, he challenges Ippo to catch 10 falling leaves from a tree simultaneously after a week of training, fully convinced that Ippo would fail, Takamura jogs away as he continues his roadwork.
However, after a week of tough training, involving nightly hours, Ippo manages the technique in the nick of time. He waits for the jogging Takamura to come by his usual path and surprises him by catching all 10 of the falling leaves and only doing so with his left hand. This impresses Takamura greatly, and he informs Ippo that the action required to catch all 10 leaves is called a boxing jab. Takamura invites Ippo back to the boxing gym for introductions.
When they got back to the gym, the coach, Genji Kamogawa, was not at all impressed by Makunouchi's lack of fighting spirit, and therefore, was challenged by Takamura to have a practice spar against a member of the gym. However, Kamogawa decides to give Ippo a severe challenge and tells him to spar with Miyata, who is 16, the same age as Ippo. Miyata is known as a boxing prodigy and is one of Kamogawa gym's future hopes. Takamura gets extremely worried with this prospect, as Miyata skill is way above the four-rounder pro boxer. As expected, Ippo loses by KO, but not until Miyata struggles dodging his punches and finally ends the match with his trump card: ""The Counter"". Coach Kamogawa decides that he has great fighting sense and spirit and decides to train him to eventually become the Japanese champion with a world ranking while Miyata became the OPBF (Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation) Champion. Both are expected to hit high in the rankings and, eventually, fight each other for the world champion's belt.
The story focuses heavily on character development―even during the matches something is learned about both fighters. Ippo has a habit of running into his opponents before matches, giving him a chance to learn more about their backgrounds and even sympathize with them. Ippo is an extremely timid and modest person who never assumes that he is strong enough. He instead draws courage from seeing the strength of his opponent and realizing that he is able to stand up to it. Ippo and his friendly rivalry with Miyata is the main draw in the early part of the series. That later changes to Ippo's path toward the Japanese Featherweight Championship and eventually the world championship. Along the way the audience is given glimpses into the other characters' pasts, motivations, relationships to others, and current boxing trials. A colorful cast of supporting characters and opponents as well as side stories concerning their paths in the boxing world rounds out the series.","This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here. 
 
Hajime No Ippo is a long running anime with about ~125-127 total. I first learned about it from a friend and this is probably the 3rd or 4th anime I've watched (the others were fairly short). At first I was apprehensive about watching this due to its length and it being only about boxing.. but now that I've finished it, I'm left wanting more. This series is what really makes me appreciate anime and its last episodes are always on my mind, along with all the good moments I've had throughout watching its run. This anime has amazing storytelling, hilarious comedy, THE best character development I've ever seen, great action sequences, and the most importantly; this show has a lot of heart. While there are many animes out there with some of these good elements, none of them pull them off as perfectly as this one does. The funny thing is, most people find their favorite animes through their favorite characters (whom they relate to), and while there are certain characteristics of the characters that are relatable; there are none that I can truly relate to entirely. With that said, there is no bias here. 
 
This speaks for the entirety of the series. Since this is on the Hajime No Ippo: Rising section, I may as well review this season specifically a little bit. I'm not going to lie, the first 2 episodes were ok, they're nothing special. The real enjoyment begins at episode 3 and up. Its hard to say that this season is the best one given how long the first season is, but this one is definitely the most memorable due to the way it executed the story, allowing you to remember the whole season instead of chunks of it (like the first season, which may be because of its length). Something that may be considered negative is the fact that Ippo is only the center of the season through the first half of it (maybe up to ep17?). But it makes up for it by paying more attention to some of the characters who have had less development in the last 2 seasons. After Shimabukuro, all of the main fights are good... of Bryan Hawk quality. Finally, this season just had so much heart, especially at the end. This piece is a minor spoiler, but the last 2 episodes focus on the past with Coach Kamogawa/Nekota and it is a MUST watch. Out of all the episodes of the series, the last 2 are a strong mix of sadness/happiness that will leave a mark in the hearts of anyone whos followed the series from the beginning.

       Helpful First of all a big thanks to George Morikawa because he did something nearly impossible with Hajime no Ippo. He managed to keep his story interesting and his comedy fresh even after all these years. Sure it has it’s weaknesses(for example some short chapters in the manga plus some repeated stuff in the story etc) but it is still a great accomplishment that only a few are capable of. 
 
The story is about Ippo a kid without any purpose in his life and fate decides to make a boxer out of him. This season focuses on his challenges to keep his special move sharp and fresh, the Dempsey roll. in the manga the reason for the focus on the Dempsey Roll is explained better but since madhouse tried to handpick parts of the story there had to be some changes so they could fill it all in their schedule which is still no biggie since Ippo is not the best part of the story for me anyway(cause most of the times we know he is gonna win so it takes the tension away for me at least). His coach Kamogawa and his hero Takamura are the best parts and both get to shine in this season. Takamura aimed to rule 6 classes and his fights are always exciting and we get to see his second conquest in this season with a classier opponent this time, Eagle. A man that is exactly the opposite of Hawk, not just in style but also in personality. This is specially for American  so mangaka could show better to them that he is not against Americans! 
 
Madhouse decided to put the best part at the end of the season of course and along with some changes they put the Kamogawa background story at the end of this season which is probably the best part of the whole story and it explains why Kamogawa and Nekota are in their current state(plus Dankichi). As for the other characters Aoki and Kimura are mostly for comical relief like most of the times (even Aoki’s serious fight was funny and unreal probably on purpose) and Manabu is yet to reach his best condition in the manga but he is not liked by many it seems so I guess it’s for the best. (I actually like his character specially his expressions during matches and his second fight with Imai but he seems to me just like an extra character just to extend the story and doesn't add anything meaningful. I get it that he is there to show the growth of next generation but if it is going to be the similar rivalry thing that happened in the previous generations then who cares?!...). as for female characters…sigh, Sport genre and good female characters usually don’t go hand to hand(there are some strong or useful ones in some stories still as characters they are not that interesting). also this season shows one of the key messages the manga has: the importance of rivals. 
 
The animation doesn’t seem too much improved to be honest specially when you watch Kuroko no baske’s second season and see the improvement there in the short time it had from it’s previous season(although they didn't keep it up till the end) but it still feels a little cleaner and sharper than before. voice acting is strong just like previous seasons although Kamogawa’s voice actor passed away (rest in peace) so they had to replace him. Sadly they replaced him with Miguel’s voice actor but many probably don’t even remember Miguel so who cares and they might not even adopt Wally’s story so he might not be needed since if there is going to be a fourth season they might go for another epic fight or something (Volg’s fight would be good if they could somehow include it too since they had to show Volg this time too so it would be cooler narrative-wise but guess for that reason they should go for Randy J too.). also Coach’s voice in his earlier days didn't fit him(it is done by Mamoru Miyano mostly famous for Light Yagami) it was obvious they were just trying to use a famous Voice actor cause he is an important character but to be honest the fact that it doesn't fit is not a bad thing cause not all characters should have voices that matches their faces or style and as long as voice actors do their job fine they are fine. As for OP and ED I didn’t enjoy them although they made a smart use of a front page of one of the chapters in the ED which I liked. 
 
2013 was filled with great sport anime like Yowamushi pedal, Kuroko no Baske Season 2 and Diamond No Ace and sport fans are hopefully pleased. Hajime no Ippo Rising doesn't lose to those anime of course and it is a worthy adaptation. also Hopefully George Morikawa will start another Takamura fight soon or something as epic so Madhouse gets more tempted for another season.

3,19383,66,9.623095846,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Yami Shibai,"The mysterious, yellow-masked Storyteller is a man whose true name and origin are both unknown. He appears at dusk where children gather and recites sinister tales based on Japanese urban legends, to which his young audience eerily intakes. However, the Storyteller is no ordinary teller of tales. He incorporates a kamishibai, a traditional paper-scrolling device, to add visuals to his already demented narration. 
 
A series of short horror stories,  Yami Shibai  begins with a bachelor who, after moving into a new apartment, immediately starts sensing a malevolent glare being pressed into him. A single talisman rests on his ceiling, but he has no way of knowing it is one of the few safeguards that separate him from a bottomless pit of suffering. Each story is more terrifying, more appalling, and more sickening than the last as the Storyteller's audience find themselves being sucked into the vicious world of his words. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (�芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.","Remember those ghost stories your uncle told you when your parents left you at his house for the night so they could have a good time? Well here are those very ghost stories in anime form. 
 
I would like to start with the anime art style yes it is quirky but it fits the mood of the narrating and actual story as well as that when the characters do speak the actors who play the characters sound like they are actually very terrified so all due props to them for doing such an excellent job at acting.  
 
If you are looking for a short 5 minute anime with quirky art style and great voice acting then this one is for you.  
 
As for scary ""meh"" i did not feel it to be honest but then again everyone is different and someone may get the jitters but that still does not make this a bad anime for 5 minutes of condensed anime it's a great watch.

       Helpful This is my first review, so please bare with me. Yami Shibai is a different kind of horror anime. It's not your usual 24 min per episode, but rather a 5 min per episode anime. Simply, it's a collection of short stories. 
 
--STORY-- 
The story was't anything special. Considering each episode lasts only for 5 minutes and the stories being standalone, there wasn't any sort of story development or anything. Some of the stories had something deep, while some were just about a quick scare. So, don't expect much. 
 
--ART-- 
I really liked the art style of this anime. It felt weird in the beginning, but it soon grew over me as I watched the show. It's very different compared to our usual anime out there. It reminded me of cardboard cut out characters with stop motion animation. It's simple but very effective. I would say, this really elevated the show.  
 
--SOUND-- 
The sound was really good. It was perfect for this show. Some of the sounds really helped in creating the tension and suspense leading to good scares. The voice acting was really good and was spot on. The emotions of the characters felt realistic thanks to the voice acting . 
 
--CHARACTER-- 
Like the story, there isn't anything special about the characters. They are there to complete the story. Since, it's a collection of short stories with new characters you can't really care for anyone of them, and there's no actual need too. Some were interesting and some were not. Also, some of the character designs were really weird and creepy. Which imao worked very well. 
 
--ENJOYMENT-- 
I really had fun watching this anime. It was totally a different experience for me. Some episodes scared me and some didn't. But all the episodes were outright creepy. I like being creeped out or scared. So, yeah. It was fun. 
 
--OVERALL-- 
This anime is for people who love horror and want something weird and creepy to watch in a short format. For others it's mostly gonna be a hit or a miss. Don't come here expecting a great story or characters. Because, it's not made for that. 

          
 
       Helpful Ghost story's have been told for generations, since the dawn of man. Its one of the earliest form of entertainment humankind engulfed themselves with. Before television electricity even before literature, people where gather around the fire to hear does chilling tales.Humans like to be frighten and immersive themselves in a world full of ghost goblins and demons .So lets gather around and i will tell more of about some horrifying Ghost story's.. Welcome to my review of Yami Shibai! 
 
 
 
Rather then one big story this is a collation of shorter ghost tales. And with only four minutes of time they are surprisingly well done, and being told in a creepy menacing way!!They are unique ominous and extremely well presented .Before I start watching this i thought the short time could be a problem but that was a misconception!!   The style itself may be extremely simplistic and first appears as child's play. Created by elementary students for a school projected,That is a mere deceitful illusion, that are fragmentized early in when presenting its true nature!. Its unsettling disturbing and very threatening.The art-style fits in tremendously well, and substantially adding to the scare-factor and give that eerie feeling  
 
 
The music is not that imposing. It's rather other sound effected that just add to its ominous atmosphere and making it feel even more sinister. Sometimes the sound effects are weird sometime creepy.And it always works with the scene itself . The voice actors are doing a monumental job.You can hear the distress and fear even hate in the characters voices .Witch brings life and credibility as a good ghost story should have!!!! To build a great and lovable character in such sort time is unreasonable and totally unnecessary. This is a horror and the character is mere cannon food for our sick enjoyment.The Ghost Stories are the star here. All the characters are support and their only obligation are to raise the fear factor!! And to die in the most gruesome ways possible 
 
 
 
When everything comes together we have collections of ghastly story's.That never feels monotonous or tedious. And it succeeded with its main purpose and made me feel uncomfortable!!  
 
 
I going to lock my door and sleep with the lights on tonight!! If you wonder why,watch this anime and you will understand better. Good night sleep tight, Don't let the ghost and goblin bite!!

But something was missing. In search of his family, home, and a place to truly belong, Leo traveled back to Africa and began his journey to become the King of the Jungle. 
 
Leo's adventure centers around finding peace between the animals and humans who live in his African home, often competing for space and resources. As he grows, Leo must survive both the area's harsh environment, dangers from other animals, and humans who hunt lions like him for sport. Only communication and mutual understanding can end the fighting, and Leo's knowledge of human culture may be just what the jungle needed. 
 
 Jungle Taitei  is the epic story of a young lion's struggles to survive in a dangerous land.","['Adventure', 'Kids', 'Shounen']","In Africa during the mid-20th century, as mankind encroaches, the white lion Panja (Caesar in the English dub) gives the jungle's wild animals a safe haven. However, he angers nearby villagers by stealing their cattle and their food to feed the jungle carnivores (in the English dub he merely frees the cattle). A professional hunter, Ham Egg (Viper Snakely in the English dub), is called in to stop these raids. He avoids directly attacking Panja. Instead, he records the sounds of Panja and uses them to trap his pregnant mate, Eliza, who then becomes bait in a trap for Panja. Panja is killed for his hide (but not before asking Eliza to name their child Kimba), and Eliza is put on a ship, destined for a zoo.
Kimba (Leo in Japanese) is born on the ship. Eliza teaches him his father's ideals. As a huge tropical storm nears, she urges her cub out through the bars of her cage. The storm wrecks the ship and Kimba starts to drown in the ocean. The fish help him learn to swim. As he begins to despair, the stars in the sky form the face of his mother, who encourages him. Guided by butterflies, he makes it to land.
Kimba lands far from his ancestral home and is found and cared for by some people. He learns the advantages of human culture, and decides that when he returns to his wild home he will bring culture to the jungle and stand for peace like his father.
The show follows Kimba's life after he returns to the wild, still a young cub, and how he learns and grows in the next year. Kimba soon learns that only communication and mutual understanding between animals and humans will bring true peace.","Critic's Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2012. Review #20: Kimba, The White Lion 
 
Back when I was about 5 or 6 years old, there was a Disney movie that I watched all the time. That Disney movie was The Lion King. I loved the animation in the movie and I never got tired after repeated viewing. Today, I haven't watched it as much because there are other movies I like and I have shows that I want to watch. I decided to do a little research on the movie and I found that it bears a striking resemblance to Kimba from the anime Jungle Emperor (Kimba, The White Lion in The U.S.) There was a controversy over The Lion King because of its similarity to Kimba, The White Lion. It's been 18 years since The Lion King was released so I have no comment about the whole comparison of both things. My theory is that Kimba, The White Lion was the primary influence for The Lion King. It didn't completely plagarized Kimba, The White Lion. I also want to mention that I am treating this review as a retrospective. With that said, here's Kimba, The White Lion! 
 
 
 
The basic premise of this anime is that Leo (Kimba in the American release), a young lion cub who becomes king of the jungle when his father was killed by a human hunter. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Mushi Pro production and this is an anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga of the same name. Don't know who Tezuka-san is? I'll tell you. Tezuka-san is a cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer, activist, and was best known for series such as Astro Boy (which was the first anime to come to the U.S.), Black Jack, and Kimba, The White Lion. Tezuka-san was often nicknamed ""The Godfather of Anime"" and often considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney, which made total sense. Tezuka-san was influenced by some of Walt Disney's work. Tezuka-san has a prolific output, and had pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres that earned him nicknames such as ""The Father of Manga"" or ""The God of Manga"". 
 
 
 
Before I go any further, I want to apologize beforehand that I dropped this series and I don't plan on finishing it. I will simply give out my retrospective of Kimba, The White Lion to the best of my abilities. 
 
First of all, I am going to excuse the quality of animation on this anime for a couple of reasons. First off, this is the first anime in color. Secondly, this was a 60's anime. The animation has definitely aged as time went by. 
 
 
 
 
The music by Isao Tomita may not be recognizable today but he often composes soundtracks of the anime adaptations of Osamu Tezuka's series. 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as voices go. This is going to be a bit difficult to talk about. I am assuming the Japanese cast is good on this show. The Dub is from way before 90's dub quality and the dub is corny but actually watchable and that's saying a lot. Too bad the American release never included the subtitled version. it's a Dub-only affair in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
The characters are simply introduced well but it was hard for me to latch on to the characters in this show. I don't have much to say on this matter 
 
 
 
 
 
Then there's the story, It is kid-friendly but it does challenge the audience with some mature themes. It has a simple premise that expands as the show progresses I should also point out that Rintaro (who went by the name Shigeyuki Hayashi during the making of Kimba) was the chief director. You might want to do a little research on this guy because there might be a few animes that he was involved in that you probably didn't know that he was part of. Also, Eiichi Yamamoto was also the director of this anime and he also did the series composition for Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US). 
 
 
 
After sharing those little tidbits, allow me to mention The Lion King once more. About the whole controversy about whether The Lion King homaged this anime or plagarized it. There seems to be some comparisons between the two and I can see some similarities.  
 
 
 
This anime was influential in Japan and might as well be a major influence to The Lion King. The Lion King might as well be an American tribute to Kimba, The White Lion. 
 
Kimba, The White Lion is available from Right Stuf. 
 
 
 
With that said... Kimba, The White Lion is an anime worth checking out if you are looking for an anime that is definitely worth seeing if you want to go as far as the 60's. This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However in order to fully appreciate this anime, you will have to overlook the flaws and technicalities that this show had to offer. This was a 60's anime, this anime was completely hand-drawn and not many sound effects were possible at the time. What you see is what you get when it comes to this anime. Many children in Japan grew up watching this anime and now are the key players in the anime industry today. I may not have a big interest in this anime, but at least I was able to give out my first-impression retrospective into the series. 
 
 
 
I give Kimba, The White Lion a 5 out of 10, it is SO-SO! 
 
 
 
feel free to comment, and give out a might roar!

Upon hearing of her kidnapping, Lupin rushes to her rescue. Additionally, Lupin receives a written challenge from a mysterious person named ""The Masked Count"" suggesting a contest: who can obtain the ""inheritance of Count Cagliostro"" first. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made. 
It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don't worry, there's still some of it"". 
 
So, what went wrong? 
The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki's film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie. 
Yes, they took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time. 
The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they're completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie. 
 
The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced. 
 
I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching. 
 
In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it. 
But if you're looking for a fresh tv special I don't recommand it.

          
 
       Helpful I can say I've developed a standard for my Lupin content, and this failed on the character development. One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like. 
 
The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don't know yet. And, the opening is too long. 
 
Speaking of the character development girl, I don't feel like she actually learned anything because her development was rushed and it felt empty. 
 
The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless. 
 
I don't suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general.

       Helpful A sweet surprise 
Especially for me, as a confectioner, this anime is extremely enjoyable and actually really rich in information. Within the Kodomo genre, this is a masterpiece. 
Characters: Personalities are common but likeable and fits perfectly within the anime, from the clumsy protagonist to the little fairies named after sweet flavors 
Story and enjoyment: Each episode becomes more addictive, especially after the characters begin to participate in contests, that make you get involved with the themes and solutions they come up with.  
Art: the sweets are gorgeous and the fairys are very cute. Although the art is not particularly striking, the colors, designs and creativity compensate.

          
 
       Helpful I was surprised by how much I'm enjoying this series, it's better then your average shoujo.   
 
Story  
Focused on the character's ambitions in the desert making industry. It flows quite well and although at times repetitive is entertaining. Has hints of magic and romance and the subplots are often as good as the main story. 
 
Art 
Not outstanding but not lacking either. 
 
Character 
This is where Yumeiro P?tissière excels. The main character Ichigo is cute and likeable (although her voice drives me crazy :l) and the 'sweet spirits' add a lot of the shows humour. The characters are starting to develop and its interesting to watch. 
 
Sound 
Some nice songs throughout, although yes they are repetitive. 
 
Overall 
I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something with some light romance and humour. Its very easy to watch but don't have high expectations, it wont win any awards ;)

 Hetalia Axis Powers  takes these questions and runs with them, personifying countries into characters. The show takes a comedic and light approach to politics and historical events while educating the viewer. 
 
Taking place primarily during the events of World War I and World War II, the story focuses on the Axis Powers and occasionally throws the spotlight onto the tumultuous relationship between the Allied Forces. The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests. 
 
Based on Hidekaz Himaruya's widely popular webcomic turned print manga,  Hetalia Axis Powers  is a historical comedy that pokes lightly at culture, examines the relationships between nations and breathes fun into history.

       Helpful When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

          
 
       Helpful First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story �C inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio �C is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

3,4921,71,9.264200155,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama,"A theatrical anime movie of the original story of the epic Indian classical ""Ramayana"" and a joint production between Japan and India.

A girl named Sita and Lakshman, Rama's brother, go with him into the forest. Ravana, the King of Demons, falls in love with Sita and kidnaps her. In order to save his love, Rama goes to Lanka with the help of an army of monkeys and friends of the forest.  
 
A feature film based on a story of true love, friendship, and trust, this anime is about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, with musical elements from Indian cinemas in between.",['Adventure'],"
","An adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayan. The story follows two brothers, Ram and Lakshaman,  as they try and rescue Sita, the wife of Ram, after she is kidnapped by the king of Lanka Ravan. Along the way, many legendary figures come to aid Ram, such as the great Hanuman. The story is pretty accurate to the original story told by Hindu people. 
 
The art is somewhat outdated but still very fluid and life like. The fight scenes are greatly choreographed and animated. 
 
The characters are greatly adapted and complex. almost no main characters moral in this anime is truly black or white. The characters are greatly written. They feel real since the bad guys don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, and the good guys have a motivation and reason to do good things. The antagonists can't be characterized as evil people, since they show emotion, empathy, and love. The protagonists are shown to kill, but also regret and  grieve even over the deaths of the antagonists. 
 
I enjoyed this anime greatly. I finished it in 1 sitting, which is more than I can say about other  movies. 
 
This anime deserves an 8/10. Definitely would watch again sometime in the future.

          
 
       Helpful In 1992, Japan and India were celebrating 40 years of strong diplomatic ties. A part of the celebration was this project. Which was worked on by Japanese & Indian animation studios alike and based off of the Hindu epic, Ramayana.? 
 
I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with the epic. As such, I probably won't notice if the film gets some details wrong. You'll have to wait for the anime versions of The Iliad, Beowulf & Journey to the West to see me get into heavy scholarly detail about adaptation differences. 
 
Story:? 
 
We open with a countryside being terrorised by demons. Or maybe they're just British imperials in funny outfits. In any case, a Hindu holy man beseeches Vishnu for guidance. A golden light tells him to go to Ayodhya and bring Prince Rama who can defeat the imperial demons. He does as he asks and Prince Rama handily saves the countryside and finds himself a pretty young bride, Sita, during the journey. Everything is looking up for him until his father sends him into exile to keep a promise and his wife is kidnapped by the demon Ravan.? 
 
The biggest issue with the film's narrative is that scenes don't always flow smoothly. Take Sita's abduction for example. We see Rama chasing a demon disguised as a golden deer. He seems to barely move out of sight when he shoots it. We then watch his brother, Lakshman, get fooled by the demon faking his voice. So, he pours holy... salt around Sita to protect her. He leaves. Ravan disguises as a priest tricks her into crossing over the salt and has time to escape before they return. The point I'm making here is that, as presented, this sequence doesn't work. It looks like Rama should have enough time to return about five times, maybe six, before Sita is taken. There are other scenes like that too. Hanuman's trip to the Himalayas is really abrupt. 
 
It's also a bit weird that there's a musical interlude in the middle of the film where all we do is stare at a vacant screen. I don't mind them having musical numbers but at least give us something to look at while they play. But on the subject of musical numbers, Hanuman gets a kind of weak song where he repeats that he's Rama's emissary for around three minutes and it's just kind of a boring, overly repetitive number.? 
 
That being said, the film is presented in a very old fashioned epic style that works pretty well. It comes complete with great, heroic deeds, imposing trials, fallen heroes and divine intervention. I'm not sure how accurate it is to the source material, but it does have that aesthetic and it is pretty interesting.? 
 
Characters: 
 
I can't say the characters are very complex. Rama and his people are those kind of generic, heroic characters you get in these old epics. His villains are demons who are there more to be strong imposing threats than fleshed out characters but some still get sympathetic moments. Kumbakharna when greeting Hanuman being the big example.? 
 
Art: 
 
The monster designs are pretty interesting and the action sequences flow pretty well. It is a little weird when they show Ravan flying a plane with a dragon motif or they show monkeys in mechanical siege towers. Somehow, I don't think that's fully accurate to the source material. And the ordinary human characters themselves don't have the most interesting designs. But I will credit the people who made this for picking an art style that does capture the feeling of an old epic.? 
 
Sound: 
 
The voice work is fine. They got some pretty well known Bollywood actors like Arun Govil, Amrish Puri & Namrata Sawhney. Their performances are good but there's an unfortunate issue that crops up from time to time with the sound levels being mixed awkwardly. Which can result in a character's speaking volume changing quite drastically from one scene to another or the sound effects overpowering the voices.? 
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Let the scenes breathe. Maybe this would result in a musical sequence or two having to be cut or just in a longer film, but it would help the pacing to have more build up in some key scenes.? 
Give some visuals to go with your musical numbers. Maybe something as simple as Rama's army preparing. You could even get away with a slide show if you had strong enough stills but when you have a five minute musical number give us something.? 
The sound mixing. I think the performances would come across as much better if not for the mixing problems and that would make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.? 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ramayana?is not one of the best children's films out there but it still manages to be pretty solid. If I was watching this as a kid instead of as a cynical adult, I'd probably be absolutely riveted. Still, I'll give it a solid 7/10.?

          
 
       Helpful It's an epic story based on the Indian epic poem written by Valmiki(Ratnakkardah).Lord Ram is beleived to be 7th incarnation of Indian God Vishnu.The joureny starts when Lord Ram was  just 15 and the devil King Ravan was at peak of his powers.The character shown By Lord Ram is definitely one to be thrive towards.The story is well written and every character is important.Story just doesn't revolve around Ram,Sita,Lakshman and Ravan.There is subtle importance  of all the characters.Sound effects considering the technology present are very good.It is overall very good story with happy but incomplete ending.Overall it is worth watching once in a life.

3,9521,72,8.91095634,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Tie Shan Gongzhu,"Adapted from the popular Chinese folk tale ""Journey to the West,"" and produced by the Wan brothers in the midst of World War II, Princess Iron Fan is the first feature length animated film produced in China. We follow the Monkey King and his friends on their journey to the west. As they reach Fire Mountain they are unable to pass because of the fire but learn that a special iron fan can quench the flames. However, the fan belongs to Princess Iron Fan and she will not willingly lend it to them.  
 
(Source: Amazon.com)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"When adapting a simple tale, all you can fuck up with is, well, the adaptation. The reason why Snow White is so acclaimed and memorable isn't because of its ingenious storytelling, but rather its audiovisual timelessness. By displaying so much prowess, it stood the test of time quite effortlessly. The same cannot be said about Wan Brothers' attempt to make animation on pair with Disney's high quality standards.  
 
Tie Shan Gongzhu is fluid with passable backgrounds... and as far as presentation goes that is pretty much it. On the negative side however, everything is kinda messed up. The positioning of cels is inconsistent throughout, the lighting is so poorly done it's sometimes impossible to distinguish elements on screen, characters go off-model when they shouldn't, vectors are all over the place making it a lot harder to discern directions, weirdly unseemly angles, numerous glitches, and depth during some scenes is pretty much nonexistent. All that combined is disorienting enough already, but honestly, nothing comes close to how annoyingly loud and erratic the sound recording is. It can deafen you, so beware. 
 
I really appreciate the ethos at play here and that various artists struggled through war to realize their artistic vision, but it's undeniably dated, to a degree it is almost an impossible watch. They wanted to make the first full-length Chinese animated movie, and they did just that, in a case I can only call sacrificing quality for historical achievement. With that said, I don't recommend watching it unless you're interested in what it represents rather than what it has to offer.

          
 
       Helpful After seeing Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in 1937, the Wan Brothers in China were inspired to created their own feature-length film in 1941. Princess Iron Fan was the result, China's first feature-length animated film.  
 
STORY - 7/10 
Based off of the Journey to the West from the sixteenth century, it follows the Buddhist priest Tripitaka and his three bodyguards Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy as they come across a cruel buffalo-headed king who controls a mountain of fire and his wife who has the only item that will allow them to pass - a magic iron fan. Monkey has to defeat the princess in order to quench the flames and save the villagers. All in all, it's a pretty predictable adaptation of Journey to the West, and nothing really stands out as creative.  
 
ART - 6/10 
For 1941, the animation is neither very good or bad. It features a odd mixture of rotoscoped animation (the tracing of live-action footage) and traditional, clunky and stilted animation. The rotoscoping was done to save time and money, and it was actually used to a pretty good effect in the film and the result is very smooth animation. The problem is that it sticks out like a sore thumb every time it's used because it contrasts with the clunky animation everywhere else. The backgrounds are beautiful though, and some of the effects animation with fire and wind is pretty impressive. 
 
SOUND - 5/10 
Pretty standard 40's soundtrack. Nothing spectacular. The voice acting could be better as well, as it's pretty much non-stop yelling. A few songs are thrown in for good measure (probably a result of Snow White's influence on the Wan Brothers) but they're basically just a stop to the story and don't really add much. 
 
CHARACTER - 5/10 
The Monkey King character was actually pretty likeable, despite being slightly predictable. Most of the other characters are pretty one-dimensional, however.  
 
ENJOYMENT - 7/10 
I enjoyed it, but I was watching for the historical aspect, it being China's first animated feature film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a film on its own, though, as it's not very interesting and hard to watch at some points.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Super Power']","Advent Children takes place two years following the events of the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, during which the antagonist Sephiroth attempted to absorb the Lifestream (the lifeblood and soul of the Planet) and be reborn as a god. He was defeated by Cloud Strife and his companions. Still, Sephiroth's final spell, Meteor, destroyed the city of Midgar. 
Since the end of the game, the survivors of Midgar founded the new city of Edge, where Cloud and his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart now run a courier service and are the caretakers of an orphan Denzel and the adopted daughter of Barret Wallace, Marlene. Due to feeling guilty for failing to save Aerith Gainsborough, Cloud has recently moved out and isolated himself from his friends. The story also portrays that many people, including Cloud and Denzel, are infected with a mysterious disease known as ""Geostigma,"" which has no known cure.
Cloud is contacted through Tifa and summoned to a meeting with the Shinra Company's former president Rufus Shinra, who was presumed killed in Final Fantasy VII. Rufus asks for Cloud's help to stop Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo. The trio is the physical manifestation of Sephiroth's surviving spirit. They are seeking to resurrect him using the remains of the extraterrestrial villain Jenova. Cloud refuses to help and leaves.
Meanwhile, Kadaj and his colleagues are recruiting children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight, and Loz kidnaps Marlene. All the abducted children are taken to the ruins of the Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren. He announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, Kadaj's gang overpower him but is saved by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Cloud then returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.
Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he possesses Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj saves it and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are caught in a blast along the way by an explosive planted by Reno and Rude. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud he will use the souls of Geostigma's deceased victims to dominate the Planet. He and Cloud then fight. Throughout the encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. Cloud replies that he cherishes everything and then uses his Limit Break, Omnislash Ver. 5, to defeat Sephiroth. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj.

In 1997, Square Enix released one of the biggest RPG’s for the Sony PlayStation. That game is Final Fantasy VII. To this day, it is a very popular entry in the Final Fantasy series. To me, Final Fantasy VI is my favorite entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. But there is no denying that I was one of the many that enjoyed the seventh installment. This game was so popular that it led to a movie, a sequel game, some prequel games and even a book. Before I talk about the movie, there is something I must do first… *ahem* there will be spoilers about the original video game and ONLY THE VIDEO GAME. The reason for this is so you can understand the movie a little bit better. With that said, Here we go… oh and if you haven't played the game yet, I suggest you skip this upcoming part unless you don't care 
 
Last Time on Final Fantasy VII...Cloud Strife is part of a group called AVALANCHE who is led by Barret Wallace. after the first mission, Cloud meets up with Aerith (or was it Aeris?) who is selling flowers for only 1 gil. Cloud then meets up with the rest of AVALANCHE at the 7th Heaven where we get to see Tifa and her gazongas. Barret then plans the next operation which would turn out almost for the worst when falls down to the church. Cloud then meets up with Aerith once again and she then joins Cloud. Aerith is being pursued by the Turks and Cloud and Aerith escape them and then suddenly they discover that Tifa is being taken somewhere. It turns out that she is being taken to Don Corneo who is pretty much a mix of a Mafia Leader and a pimp. Cloud and Aerith rescue Tifa while this being the only time that Cloud dresses like a woman. President Shinra of the Shinra Electric Corporation sends the Turks to obtain Aerith for specific plans, and they blow up Sector 7. Cloud, Barret, and Tifa set out to rescue Aerith from the Shinra Corporation and they meet up with Red XIII who happens to be a research specimen. Somewhere along that time, Cloud discovers a dark secret known as Jenova, but there isn’t much known about this at that time. President Shinra is seen dead with a long sword still impaled in him and it turns out that the one that murdered him was Sephiroth. After the President’s assassination, his son Rufus assumes the role as President and starts to go with his own plans himself. Cloud and his friends do save Aerith and escape the Shinra building in a crazy yet awesome escape method. Cloud and his companions then set out from Midgar to search for Sephiroth. In a nearby town, Cloud tells his companions about his past and Sephiroth. Along the way, they meet up with Yuffie, who is prone to motion-sickness, a dark and quiet man named Vincent, a (robot?) cat named Cait Sith who is riding a stuffed toy Moogle, and an airship pilot named Cid. Along their journey, Sephiroth as well as the Shinra Corporation are seeking The Promised Land, and Aerith just so happens to be the last surviving Ancient. Aerith heads off to the Forgotten City and Cloud and his companions go there only to witness Aerith getting killed by Sephiroth. Cloud ends up furious after witnessing that shocking death and he and his companions start following shortly after. They end up going to the Northern Cave and they find Sephiroth resting there. Cloud loses control and he ends up giving up the Black Materia they found earlier, After that occurs. Giant Monsters known as the Weapons are unleashed. But it is revealed later that Sephiroth has summoned Meteor which he aims it at the planet. Cloud and his companions then journey some more until everyone discovers Cloud’s true identity. They also discovered that Aerith was summoning Holy before she was killed. Cloud then finds his own self-discovery and resolves to defeat Sephiroth and live his own life. Cloud and his companions then go back to Midgar to stop the Shinra Corporation to end the wrongs they have committed. After they do so, they go to the Northern Crater to prepare for the Final Battle. They go to the planet’s core to confront Sephiroth and they end up victorious. Even though Sephiroth was vanquished, the Meteor was still coming down. Just when all hope was lost, the lifestream pours out and defends the planet. This stops Meteor from destroying the planet. The game ends there.  
 
 
With all the recap I wanted to bring up has been said, let’s go to the Reunion with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children 
 
 
Two years after the end of Final Fantasy VII, the world is starting to get back on its feet after Cloud and his companions stopped the Meteor that was summoned by Sephiroth from destroying the world. The world that has been saved is working towards a new future. However, there is a new threat from a new illness called Geo-stigma, and three men that seem to be seeking Jenova. Cloud and his companions must once again reunite to stop the new threat. 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Square Enix production and I rarely even talk about Square Enix when it comes to anime. Now, allow me to be perfectly clear. This may be a CGI film and some people may wonder why this is technically an anime. Well, it was from Japan and it is animated…Computer animated to be exact. This is one of those computer-animated films that can be considered as an anime, although I think most people don’t see it as an anime. This is kind of a pointless argument, but it is technically an Anime. It is however not the typical anime that most anime fans (or otakus) are used to. What I can say about this movie is that it looks amazing from start. to. finish. When it comes to animated movies, I am getting really annoyed that the animation I am seeing in theaters is the 3D animation. I really love the 2D animation style that was done for years. I do like some 3D animated films but I do hate it when that seems to be the new running trend. But with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, that is a completely different story. All the scenes are animated gorgeously and I can see there was a lot of effort put into this film. What also is implemented is motion-capture where the characters move realistically… for the most part and it makes the animation more appealing to look at. Just for this movie, the computer-animation is flawless and this movie should be an example to 3D animated movies these days. I don’t mind 3D animation as long as it’s done right. 
 
 
The music by Nobuo Uematsu is also a real treat, Nobuo Uematsu is obviously well-known for his compositions in the Final Fantasy series as well as other series he may have been involved in a little bit. Since I am talking about Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, expect some nostalgia when it comes to the music. Some of the old themes are back (in a different sound of course). There’s a mix of classical piano, rock, a little electronic, and even orchestral. Nobuo Uematsu is good for mixing things well and the soundtrack does not disappoint because it seriously kicks ass.  
 
 
In regards to voice acting, the Japanese cast is pretty damn terrific. Takahiro Sakurai is great as Cloud, Ayumi Ito is terrific as Tifa, Kyosuke Ikeda was great as Denzel in the original cut and so was Kazumu Izawa in the Complete version. Showtaro Morikubo is great as Kadaj. and Toshiyuki Morikawa is fantastic… Noteworthy seiyus include Keiji Fujiwara as Reno, Maaya Sakamoto as Aerith, Toru Ohkawa as Rufus, and Shogo Suzuki as Vincent. Suzuki-san doesn’t have a lot of anime roles, in fact,  this is the only anime role he’s played. He’s pretty good. Kenji Nomura is fine as Loz, and Yuuji Kishi was alright as Yazoo. As for Marlene and Denzel, they both have two seiyus. That is because the original seiyus were in fact children, when the movie got the Director’s Cut (Advent Children Complete). These two were re-casted. Kyosuke Ikeda was great as Denzel, and so was Kazumu Izawa when Denzel was re-casted. Miyu Tsuzurahara was pretty good as Marlene, Sumire Morohoshi will take a little getting used to. As with the English Dub, there is one major problem with the dub and it’s not even the cast or its direction. The English Dub suffers with awkward synchronization with the lip flaps in the movie. When I mentioned that there was a great use of motion capture, the lip movements were also implemented. If you can look past this, then the dub should be fine for you. Steve Burton is terrific as Cloud, Rachael Leigh Cook is also terrific as Tifa. Steve Staley is mostly great as Kadaj, but does have a few hiccups. George Newbern is also terrific. As for some noteworthy voice actors and voice actresses. Beau Billingslea is great as Barret, and the casting was perfect too. A black character voiced by a black guy. That sure makes some common sense. Chris Edgerly (even though he doesn’t do much anime roles) is great as Cid. Crispin Freeman is cool as Rude, Quinton Flynn is a lot of fun as Reno. Wally Wingert is great as Rufus, and Mena Suvari is pretty good as Aerith. The only voice I think was over-the-top was Steve Blum as Vincent. Hear me out! Vincent’s Japanese voice was deep, calm, and dark. Steve Blum (as a big name he is to anime and video games) was deep, was dark, but the voice sounds a little too unconvincing for me. I liked Vincent’s Japanese voice because it was just the right balance to make his character sound fitting, Steve Blum sounds like he’s playing a Batman audition. The role is performed well, but the voice itself didn’t sit well for me. Fred Tatasciore is great as Loz, and Dave Wittenberg was alright as Yazoo. As for Denzel and Marlene. Benjamin Bryan was good as Denzel in the original cut as well as Aaron Refven in the Director’s Cut. Grace Rolek is also good as Marlene in the original cut, and Ariel Winter also was good as Marlene in the Director’s Cut. Oh, and even though Red XIII has a good amount of screentime, Masachika Ichimura and Liam O’Brien only got one line. What the hell Square Enix. All the other characters got plenty of lines, you couldn’t give Red XIII more lines than just one? Come on guys! The Japanese cast is great, and so is the English Dub. I already mentioned the synchronization issue with the dub so I don’t need to explain again. Moving on! 
 
Characters like Cloud and his companions are the good same old characters you loved from the game. Except for Aerith, May she rest in peace. Cloud is a pretty good character during the game and this does continue somewhat in the movie. Tifa is like her old self in the game, which is nice and just like the game, her boobs are quite noticeable. Here’s the cool part, she wasn’t reduced to fanservice too much in the movie even and she can kick major ass. Barret makes an appearance and his badassitude is back. Yuffie is not as annoying in the movie compared to the game. Vincent is...well, hell if I know. He does kick some ass but not much. Cait Sith just sits on Red XIII and is just there for the comic relief. Red XIII does kick ass but only says a few words at the very end of the movie. Cid doesn’t do much but at least he contributed in some way.  It is nice that the characters are just like how you remembered them. It was nice to see Marlene develop a bit more since the game.  That is for a few movie-exclusive characters. Denzel was a little one-dimensional and a little uninteresting, that is until the Complete version came out. There were added scenes and these new additions made Denzel more than one-dimensional. Hooray! He actually is a little more sympathetic than the original version. Then there’s Kadaj and his lackeys. Oh Dear God, where do I start with these three brats. There isn’t much explanation to their personality but it isn’t hard to decipher. Yazoo is uninteresting and is pretty much there for the action, Loz is a little more involved and is a little disappointing in terms of development. Kadaj is heavily involved in the movie and he’s also far more interesting. Less in the original but far more understandable in the Complete version. The characters are mostly good, but there are a few characters that should have been taken care of more.  
 
 
As for the story of this movie, it is a damn mess. I can see why a sequel was to be made (in the form of a movie). The game was really popular, the story ends open-ended and the game was so successful that this movie was possible. The story is the most disappointing part of the whole movie. And you know what? Half of this can be excused. There is a plot going around half of the movie, and then the rest of the movie is all action-packed and it’s insane that it just keeps going and going with a few breaks as well. At least the plot was balanced. My problem with the story is that it centers around Cloud, but also the 3 silver-haired men who only stay in this movie. This movie also brings back an old memory. What does bother me a little bit is that it feels like Cloud’s “Redemption” chapter. If this was going to be built up to that, then the story should’ve been written differently. The major problem with the story is that it was rushed, this was fixed with the Complete version. The story still could’ve been written much better but it is what it is. But there is a very good reason to watch this movie. Despite the disappointing plot as a sequel to a big game. This movie’s computer animation is awesome and the action kicks a lot of ass. This movie is pretty awesome despite a major flaw with the story. I just don't think Tetsuya Nomura is meant to be a director. He can make good designs for sure.  
 
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is available from Sony Pictures. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete is also available by Sony Pictures but it is only for Blu-ray while the original cut is only on DVD. The Final Fantasy VII video game was available for the Sony PlayStation, but now these days, it can be found in the PlayStation Network and even in Steam. Crisis Core was available for the PlayStation Portable and Dirge of Cerberus was available for the PlayStation 2. To my knowledge, Before Crisis is a mobile game and was never brought into America.  
 
 
With all that said, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is an animation spectacle with gorgeous, jaw-dropping computer animation. kickass action scenes, an awesome soundtrack, memorable characters, and a plot that is disappointing but can still be enjoyed because of the animation and action scenes. If you haven’t seen this movie, do yourself a favor and do so if you are a Final Fantasy fan. If you are not a fan of Final Fantasy, it wouldn’t hurt to give this movie a try. But you may want to look up the game first to understand because this movie was made for the fans of Final Fantasy VII.  
 
 
 
 
I give the Original Cut of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children a 7 out of 10, it is GOOD! However, I am in more favor of the Complete Version. So with that said… 
 
 
 
I give Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children an 8 out of 10, it is VERY GOOD! 
 
 
 
 
Feel free to leave a comment, everything’s alright.

          
 
       Helpful Ok, thins movie doesn't get as much credit as it should due to the first one. This is a must see for anyone not just Final Fantasy fans. 
 
STORY 
 
If you've seen the first one, you know it has alot of fan service by having all their favorite characters in the movie. It still has that and more, it fills all the plot holes and unanswered questions and other things that made you think ""wtf?"" All in all the story is well told. 
 
ART 
 
CGI graphics have never looked better than they do in Advent Children Complete. Let me just say that Blue-Ray DOES make a difference. 
 
SOUND 
 
Is situational, I have a surround sound system that made it seem life like, but as I said before it's all situational. 
 
CHARACTER 
 
In Advent Children Complete, the characters are more developed then they were in the original. Take Denzel for example, in the first one he is a completely new character with no background. In Complete they bridge that gap by explaining how and why he's living with Cloud and Tifa. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
The fight scenes are amazing! They're extended a little more than in the original. The story is easier to follow and the graphics will keep you in awe the entire movie.

          
 
       Helpful This film is one of the few I like. 
 
The story is very good, the return of Sephiroth, caused by hidden molecules in the river and infects many people, it's nice, it's very true to the Final Fantasy universe 7. For me it is a 9/10. 
 
The graphic style is just sublime, 3D is perfect as can be hoped from Square Enix. Just lip sync is not perfect for foreign languages ??which is a bit disturbing. 10/10 
 
For sound, it's very good, very well, but still, as said before, lip synchronization is sometimes inadequate, but the music is beautiful and sometimes resumed in some winks flagship music games like mobile ringing victory music from enemies. 8/10 
 
The characters are good, even very good, but I do not know if it's because I am French, and so I looked in French, but Cloud gives me sometimes want to slam it so it may seem silly. 6/10 
 
But great overall, I still had fun watching this movie, action phases are more than adequate, and that's a big plus point, I really recommend it. 8/10

It does not take long before Ikki finds out about the world of Air Treks and is propelled into a fate he had not foreseen, learning about his past and making a number of storm riding allies on the way.
","The ova in air gear was amazing. I think it was made just to see how people would react to the ova and see if they wanted to animate the second season of air gear or not. It will definitely answer some questions for those who haven't read the manga but it will add a lot of more things to air gear where unless you read the manga you won't have any idea what the hell happened. 
 
Story: 8 
I am speaking strictly from the continuation of air gear it answered some things but still have lots of questions for those who didn't read the manga 
 
Animations: 9 
The animations was so much better than the previous anime but it could still be even better (might be because I have high standard in animation) 
 
Music: 9 
The music was very good and it was on point with the show, however I liked the music from the original air gear better 
 
Characters: 10 
Do I need to say anything all of the characters are amazing  
 
I would recommend you watch it 

          
 
       Helpful I really enjoyed these OVAs, the thing is they are way out of context. If you just finished watching the anime, read the manga until you get to this part otherwise you WILL be confused by this. If you read and follow the manga all the way through you'll understand this. Air Gear is a great manga and anime, but if you want to get the full enjoyment out of this you have to understand it, so i recommend before watching these catch up to the point in the manga before watching the first OVA, the next 2 OVAs jump like 80 chapters after that.

          
 
       Helpful ahhhh Air Gear: Break on the Sky.....on one hand, I like the fanservice, strangely, and found the battles to be quite enjoyable....on the other, I despise how poor the story is, how strange the are characters, and how this seemly came out of nowhere.  
 
Air Gear: Kuro no Hane to Nemuri no Mori or more awkwardly known as, Break on the Sky, is a collection of 3 OVA's that take place after the storyline of the animated series...I think; it looks like it is supposed to be more in tune with the manga which would explain why it didn't make a lot of sense. 
 
Essentially, it is about Ikki and his team, Kogarasumaru, trying to enter a tournament that will help them to reach the top of the trophaeum. Ringo, as a member of Sleeping Forest, is now an enemy of sorts, and the team, for some bizarre reason, has to fight the original Sleep Forest team.....in cyberspace...I am not joking. The story seems like an after thought because they clearly didn't bother to introduce the audience to a slew of new characters that I assume are from the manga. It feels like a vessel for a ton of pandering. 
 
Now to talk about something good, the art. The art is actually quite stunning and done infinitely better than the original, which is no surprise seeing we're comparing OVA's, made in 2010, to a series, made in 2006. The detailing of the characters looks great and where it really shines is in the aerial battles, which are undoubtedly the best part of the OVA's. Character's move fluidly, are well detailed, and fly around beautiful backdrops and settings. 
 
Music is typical, nothing that stood out really. It does fit into the whole ""Air Gear feel"" though which is nice. One thing I do have to mention is the laughably bad moments where the voice actors say a line like ""All for one and one for all."" in English; they clearly haven't had a lot of experience with English.  
 
It was strange for the producers to release an OVA that requires a fair knowledge of the manga. I've never read the manga, but I've seen all of the anime series; you would think that would be enough, right? The characters don't act like you would expect from the anime series because of this. Ringo is a lot more outgoing and Ikki is one giant douche....well more so than in the series. 
 
On a visual level, it is awesome and I'd definitely recommend it for that. I would say it's for the type of person that say, watches Highschool of the Dead for the reason it was made. If your looking for something deep and meaningful, avert your eyes.

Now the Flower Division must be able to survive on their own, with the help of their new American-cultured leader. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']",none,"Sakura Wars: The Movie is a very deceptive title. At first glance (and from what US trailers have been released) this movie is treated as a very open source for people to get interested in the Sakura Wars series. If you go in with intentions like that, I'm sorry to say Sakura Wars: The Movie will leave you dazed and confused. 
 
I'm not going to be touching upon too much of the plot for this movie as it's honestly coming off the chain of TV series, and OVA's released prior to this movie. However as a person watching this movie with only brief understanding of the series (Between walkthroughs of the game translated) it leaves a lot to be determined. Set in between the events of Sakura Taisen 3 and 4 this movie focuses on the Flower Division surviving on their own after Ichiro Oogami (Main character in the games and Captain of the Division) was transferred to Paris. As we see the girls not only maintain their roles as theater actors,a new threat appears as a conspiracy from the New York division strikes Japan forcing the girls into their Kobu's one more time to fight against the evil Kouma. 
 
This plot is not winning any awards, as it's played by the numbers throughout the entire movie. The big part that did have me interested however was the final sequence in which Sakura and Lachette have a very dramatic performance with each other. That's honestly the only scene that comes to mind that really stood out for me because the performance in Japanese was very good imo. 
 
The art for this movie is great, characters pop out with their color schemes, backgrounds look gorgeous, and the animation over all was very nice except for one thing. The CGI in this movie is very bad. It's not King of Thorn level bad, but it's getting there. This wouldn't be so much an issue but the action scenes in this movie are done with this CGI which causes you to lose the impact of what's going on since the mechs just look ehhhhh. 
 
Sound is great, Sakura Taisen has always been known for having great music and this movie fits the bill. A big shoutout to rhe musical numbers thrown in the movie, especially for the opening.  
 
Characters are already established prior to this movie, so if this is your first experience you will be missing a lot of backstory. You can piece together who exactly is who as you go through it, but I'd def either watch the prior anime or play through the games as you'll be very lost. 
 
Enjoyment is pretty much hampered by the mix of not well developed characters, predictable story, and jarring CGI. Even the grand conclusion for the battle is not very impressive when considering the stakes and the fact that one of the characters only comes in for maybe like 2 minutes in the final showdown (who is important to prior Sakura Taisen games) is just a punch to the nads. If it wasn't for the good character art/backgrounds and great musical numbers/perfomances I'd have most likely stopped watching this movie by the half way mark. 
 
All in all if you're a Sakura Wars fan I'd give it a shot if you're interested. As to everyone else who's looking for a first exposure to the series, either watch the first anime and work your way up or just play the games. Otherwise this movie will leave a bitter experience in your mouth.

          
 
       Helpful Let's cut to the chase. 
 
* Story (7) - I didn't know to expect from this movie in the beginning, it all randomly started with a show from the Flower Division and it left me confused for a while until I realized it was the opening of the movie.  
 
As the story further progressed we get to meet characters and such, and we learn more about their background stories.  
 
* Art (8) - Since it's a movie from the 2000, I suspect that the art will be something like that, it felt okay to watch but I had sometimes troubles with how the characters sometimes make faces. It's bugs me. There was also two characters that almost looked the same to me due to their hairstyle and the haircolor. But it was later clarified.  
 
* Sound (9) - I just love hearing the instruments during battle scene, it gives more the epic feel of slaying an enemy and such. (You will know which scene I mean). It had me confusing in the beginning but I noticed there weren't really an opening so that was automatically an opening song. 
 
* Character (8) - We see some serious character developments upon the arrival of the character named, Ratchete. And other two people that used to work for her on a team. Logically speaking, this movie is more about her than the Flower Division altogether. She was there to learn something out of it. 
 
The antagonist is not that special, I kind of miss the original ones because they have more deeper meaning why they exist, while the antagonist of this movie? He just randomly popped and say he will rid the world of Kobous and Eisenkleids. (Don't know I spell both correctly). 
 
* Enjoyment (8) - Well, even though I had those negative comments about the antagonist I still enjoyed the movie no matter, what. It just gave me the feeling that I do miss the original Sakura Taisen team. Bu it feels off for me, that's all.

He quickly becomes smitten with Hana and Naomi, much to their chagrin, while everyone tries to figure out why Shin-chan has managed to get on the DenLiner. Back in the Nohara house, Misae bangs on the door as the Fatmass Imagin tries to grant Misae's wish, which is to get Shin-chan to the bus on time.
Back on the DenLiner, Hana realizes that it must be due to an Imagin, which Shin-chan mispronounces as ""Himajin"" (ヒマジン, ""Bored Person""), including calling Momotaros a red Buriburizaemon, who Momotaros identifies (and summons) as the legendary Imagin. When Ryotaro transforms into Kamen Rider Den-O Sword Form so they can defeat the evil Imagin that has appeared, Shin-chan jumps up and manages to transform with him into Kamen Rider Shin-O. When the door opens on Misae, she is insulted by Momotaros just as the Fatmass Imagin attacks the group. Den-O takes a beating until Shin-O glues the Fatmass Imagin's three fat masses together, leading the Imagin to want to go back in time to erase any day Shin-chan was on time, only to find none exist.
Den-O destroys the Fatmass Imagin, saving Shin-chan and Misae who leave just in time to find that the bus has left without them. The Owner, impressed by how Shin-chan has helped them protect the flow of time, allows Misae and Shin-chan to go back in time to just before the bus arrived.

       Helpful I use the following system to calculate the final score: 
In each of the five categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character(s), Enjoyment), a score can get 2, 4, 8 or 10. 2 for something I find truly bad, 4 for something that just isn't good enough, 8 for fairly good and 10 for outstanding. 
 
The sum of the score is divided by 5 and the score is rounded to the nearest integer (More than or equal to .5 rounds it up, less than .5 rounds it down). 
 
STORY (2): 
The story is very simple and very bad. A kid running around yelling about his mom being constipated? Yeah, great fun. I may be a bitter and old, but I remember childrens shows being better than this. 
 
ART (2): 
Crayon Shin-chan's typical style. As dreadful as always. Truly, this is an insult to many other childrens shows. Even though kids don't care that much about this particular area, can't they at least try to do something good? Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it. 
 
SOUND (8): 
Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music. They do it all just fine. 
 
CHARACTERS (4): 
Would've been a 2 if it hadn't been for the Den-O cast. Shin-chan is intolerable and annoying. 
 
ENJOYMENT (2): 
Not so strange, seeing how I'm a TAD too old to be watching this in the first place. Not that I'd show this to my nephews. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 
18 * 0.2 = 3.6, rounded up to 4. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
I'm aware this is childrens show. I show my nephews (of mixed ages, the youngest one is 3 at the time of writing, the eldest is 7) various shows at times, this is not something I'd bother showing them. But if they enjoy either Crayon Shin-Chan or Den-O before this, sure, show them.

The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. 
 
A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals.

It is truly one of the classics of Chinese literature. It is an amazing story of war, bloodshed and honor. However, Souten Kouro seems to take this classic and make it much more uninteresting than it truly is. It stars Cao Cao, often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant, as the hero of the story. After watching the first 11 episodes of the series, I truly know what the Chinese idiom ""speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes,"" truly means. 
 
MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS 
 
Story: The story begins with Cao Cao's early life. The story itself generally follows the time-line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but takes on a different tactic of telling the story. An example I would like to use would be the Alliance against Dong Zhou. The anime follows history precisely but throws on a handful of encounters that aren't 100% historical. It is true that Cao Cao refuses to become Dong Zhou's right hand man, but in no way does history point out that he does it in such an articulate way. The story makes Cao Cao reign supreme, while throwing Lui Bei in the background as the ""villain"" of the Three Kingdoms period. 
 
Art: The artwork was very unimpressive. It was more like the manga was reproduced EXACTLY how it looks. They did not any special animation to the anime. When armies were slain, you'd only see blood splurting out of them, and no indication of how they were even cut. Surely production value could not have been so low for a manga that won the 22nd (22nd award every given to a manga, not 22nd place) Kodansha Manga Award in the general category? 
 
Sound: Beautiful is the only word I can think of to describe the sound of the anime. The music was incredible and fit each situation to the fullest. Mind you, the OP and ED are not amazing, but the soundtrack during the fights, and during every scene were astounding. The music is memorable and that to me, is what really saved this anime. 
 
Character: The characters were not very developed in the anime but what can you expect? It is based more on the history of the Three Kingdoms period than it is on Romance of Three Kingdoms. I will however give an honorable mention to Cao Cao's character portrayal. Throughout the anime, you can feel his character slipping slowly into the tyrannical warmonger we all know and love. 
 
Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime to a certain extent and I would have given it a 7 over the 5 because of it but the story itself progressed in a way that was a little boring. Mind you, if you love Chinese politics and the era of the Three Kingdoms in general, you'll want to watch this anime despite any review you see. However, it was not my cup of tea, and I lost interest very quickly.

Based off Luo Guanzhong's 14th century Romance of the 3 kingdom novel, which is considered one of the 'Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature', it's one of the most well known and most adapted stories in China. 
 
If you've seen John Woo's Red Cliff, played Dynasty Warriors, or any of Koei's ROTK games and enjoyed them, i'm sure you'll be familiar with the character names in the description, but just in case you missed it, well, now you know. This is ROTK, and you will most likely also be interested in this. Not much more else to say really, it's one of the most well loved and known stories of all time. I'm not too sure how far they will go with the story, but i really don't think they will do the whole thing in 26 episodes, seeing as i'm 9 episodes in and it's not even a quarter of the story told, and it is already moving quite fast. Time will tell i guess. 
 
Art: 
 
Overall high quality and unique style. I was kind of put off the first few episodes and i thought it didn't look realistic enough for such a historical title, but i got used to it soon enough and now i think that it lends itself quite well and fits the tone of the series, considering that some of the battles and scenes are especially over done to be epic and grand.  
 
As of episode 9, fight scenes have been relatively realistic, especially when showing epic war battles with thousands of soldiers. Formations, tactics, strategies from Sun Tzu's Art Of War are all discussed and shown. Catapults, castle sieges, are all done well, with no ridiculous super powered individuals like in Sengoku Basara. If that's what you are looking for mainly, i suggest you go somewhere else. One major gripe i have is with the way they depicted Liu Bei, but i might be biased since i already have a pre-conception of how i think he should look. Also, one character in episode 9(where i'm up to) has shown signs of static electricity circling his body when he made an entrance, and i hope that that is the most 'shounen' it's going to get. I don't mind that so much because that character is meant to be powerful, and i guess that it's just artistic license since no one else so far is like that, but if it does change into a shounen wankfest, i will update this review to reflect it. Also, on the MAL page, it says R rated - Mild Nudity, but be warned. There is also quite graphic violence and plenty of blood flowing, as is to be expected.

OP: Screamo rock/metal, which i think is ok even if that is not my cup of tea, it suits the animation well. 
ED: Some feel good pop song played over floating clouds, otherwise nothing memorable. 
VA is fine, and music/score suits the battles and tense moments well. 
 
Character: Based on real life figures, they are all heroes and based on larger than life figures. In fact, one of them is actually defied and worshipped as a god/deity in Chinese folk 'religion'(the main 'religion'), even in this day and age. Every chinese person would know this character. However, as of episode 9, it seems to focus more on one character, while it neglects the other two(or at least, for the moment). Also, i do not like how they portrayed Liu Bei, so purists be warned. Otherwise there is a huge diverse range of characters who all contribute in some important way or other to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: What else can i say? If you can't tell by now, i'm a ROTK fan, and i'm also a historical swordfighting/samurai buff, and i also love fantasy. This combines them all into one neat package. 
 
Overall: I would like to give it a 10 based on enjoyment alone, but i do have some minor gripes with it, and that is that it moves quite fast and is kind of hard to understand the story even knowing the story prior to watching since they gloss over some relatively important characters, and that the first few episodes were kind of slow, which might put some viewers off and make them not want to give this awesome series a chance. I think it really starts to pick up after episode 5/6 after it has done the basic character development, it moves into fast pace action epic mode.. If you enjoyed Legend of Galactic heroes like someone said in the recommendations, you would probably also enjoy this. This has more fights and is more violent, but both use quite a bit of narration and voiceover to keep you up to date with the current happenings, which is quite understandable to tell a story of this magnitude in just 26 measly episodes compared to 100+ for LOGH. 
 
Considering how cliche and unoriginal Sengoku Basara is, i'm really disappointed that not more people are following this anime, and that is has such a low rating. I guess it's the same way for LOGH however, which is a damn shame since this is one of the best series currently running. 


          
 
       Helpful Most adaptations of the Romance of Three Kingdoms portray Cao Cao as a power-hungry villain. Souten Kouro is a little different -- he is the hero in this version, and it makes for an interesting take on this ancient tale. The animation is really, really cheap at times but if you're willing to look past that, it's a great show. 
 
The other thing that makes this show interesting is that it talks about a few things that most ROTK adaptations skip over or condense -- namely, Cao Cao's childhood, the fall of the Ten Attendants and the Yellow Turban Rebellion. 
 
I wouldn't recommend this show as an entry point into ROTK because it is very different from a typical adaptation of the novel -- see John Woo's live-action film Red Cliff and if you like that, give this show a shot.

These specials have a crap ton of references to not only the special portions of the series and parodies them but also drags other anime into the mix as well. 
And it doesn't stop there, they even drag the voice actors into it. 
 
In terms of comedy and a job well done, these specials are far superior than the originals and I think I enjoyed the MC in this rather than the Holier-than-thou face-puncher-kun in the original series. 
 
rated the original series 6/10 I think, but the specials are a 9/10.

It reuses scenes from the anime, but it changes the navigation(I seriously couldn't think of any more words...)and made it like short comedy scenes. I like the VA jokes and it talks about the current status of this anime during the its airing. 
 
I'll keep it short and clear as always. It's funny, no actual plot, just comedy. Art style is the same but with a chibi Index. Character same as usual. I'll give it a 6.7 in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful If you're writing a gag special, then this is the one to beat. 
 
Gag specials usually suffer from overplayed jokes and poor art but not Index-tan. These two specials take scenes directly from the original anime and add comical twists to each one as their own independent skit. Along with taking scenes from the original series, the animation, sound, and voice acting are all just as solid too, if not better and more over the top at times. 
 
Index-tan is the first gag special that's truly made me laugh out loud, not just a few times, but over and over. The sound effects were one of the greatest additions to the humor, and added some fun off screen moments. 
 
Whether you enjoyed the anime or not, if you've seen the first season in full then I highly recommend watching these shorts!

","This is review will be base on the manga and the anime. and I gave a little recommendations to the makers of the Anime. 
 
Story. 
 
*The manga started from the start. How the characters met. and how did they form. and a lot of stuff while in the Anime. It is shorten. and a lot of few chapters  in the manga were not in the anime. Kinda disappointed. But i watched the anime first before reading the manga because i was caught up by the curiosity of each character and stuff about them. The anime ending in 12 episodes. It is kind bad for me and some reviewers out there. 
 
Art. 
 
*The animation/art was superb. because Minato Soft did themselves. So I'm not surprised. 
 
Sound. 
 
*Perfect. 
 
Characters. 
 
*Each character is very unique. but some character were not fully shown in the anime. and Kuki Ageha (From KimiAru) appeared and this anime/manga/novel is somewhere connected to KimiAru due to Ageha's same appearance and personality (Older). 
 
Enjoyment 
 
*This Anime is very enjoyable. From Comedy, Romance and Action. It is a much watch. 
 
Overall. 
 
*I gave this as an 8/10 due to the fact that is good in a lot of parts BUT the story is a fail for me and some character were not really introduced well. But still one of the good animes out there. I'm sure you will feel the romance, comedy and action of the anime. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE MAKERS. 
 
My recommendations to Minato Soft. If you will read this. 
 
PLEASE MAKE A REBOOT of the Anime. and they SHOULD FOLLOW the Manga. It is still a great Anime but lacks story and introduction of some characters (Unlike in the Manga). 
 
I wouldn't mind if you can make this around in Winter 2014. I will still looking forward for it to be REBOOTED. 

          
 
       Helpful Oh man, that ending.  
I won't be comparing it to the VN because I haven't tried the VN.  
I'll keep this review nice and simple.  
Majikoi is simply a fun show. I went into it not expecting much and got just that. There wasn't anything memorable in this series whatsoever. Despite that, the series was funny when it wanted to be, and the action was actually fairly good. Honestly, the only real problem I have is the story and the ending.  
Story: 5  
I honestly think this show would have been better without a story. Of course, one of my main reasons for being the anime addict that I am is the countless stories that anime is able to offer. If an anime doesn't have a story, then as long as it has great characters and good humor then I'm set. Majikoi is a funny show. They make a lot of sexual jokes, but that's not really the only basis of the humor. The story is simple yet also kind of stupid. Stupid is a sort of childish term, but it fits the story nicely. It tries to be serious, and really I tried to take it that way. The ending is what disappointed me. I didn't mind the stupid story because there were great characters to back it up. I'm just going to be straight and say the ending to this show is one of the worst endings I've ever seen. No closure. At all.  
Art: 8 
I gave the Art an 8 because it's fairly average, but at times it's a bit more than that. The animation is actually pretty good for the fight scenes, and there's plenty of fights to go around, whether they're a serious fight or not. It was fun to see. Other than that, there's nothing really notable to point out about the art.  
Sound: 8  
The soundtrack is definitely above average. It's good, though there are only about 2 stand-out tracks that I'd actually want to look for. None of the music was really notable. The opening isn't anything special, though after a few episodes it grew on me and I actually started to like it. The Ending song I never paid any attention to. (Though I usually would.) The BGM of the show fits fight scenes nicely and one track actually managed to make one of the fights seem fairly emotional. Only a bit, though.  
Character: 9 
This is where the show stands out to me. I don't really care for ""typical character types"", like when people point out the typical types of girls always involved in a harem. To be honest I have a hard time finding any typical character types here except for Momoya, the girl who only really cares about fighting. I'm not sure if that's typical, though. There were some unique characters, types I've never seen before, actually. Mayucchi, for example, was a great character who always talked to her keychain, which she also thought talked back but it's actually just a sort o split personality of hers pretending to be the keychain. There's Cookie, the robot, who was a fun character to see interact with people. The main character, Yamato, was actually pretty stand out too. He's a pervert, but not really to an extreme level like the main characters of ""So, I can't Play H!"" or ""Kenzen Robo Daimidaler"". He's not afraid to pull out his man-parts if needed, though. He also loves Hermit Crabs, which was a small yet somewhat entertaining personality trait of his. He's also extremely smart when it comes to being a strategist, and for that people admired him. The other girls in the harem, as well as the dudes who were Yamato's friends, were all fun to watch interact with one another. The strong point of this show is it's character, yes. I honestly kept watching this show for them solely. Plus, the relationship between Yamato and Momoya was one I rooted for. There's actually a good amount of depth to their relationship, too.  
Enjoyment: 7 
Really the strong points of this series is the comedy. If you watch it solely for that, you shouldn't be disappointed. Don't take it seriously. Watch it for the characters. They're fun. The story is dumb. It's there, and it gets in the way of the comedy, but it's something you can easily get past and back to the fun.  
Overall: 7 
If you're looking for a quick comedy to watch to pass the time, a so-so show with a lot of dick jokes, fun characters and pretty good action, I'd say try out Majikoi. It's only 12 episodes, so why not? I enjoyed watching it to pass the time and I feel as though if you don't take this seriously, you may enjoy it too. 

          
 
       Helpful ***This is a spoiler free review*** 
 
Never in my life would I expect myself to say, “Man I wish this anime would of stayed a typical stale harem story.” Well brace yourselves because Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!! biggest flaw is its attempt to combine harem, ecchi, and terrorist plot elements into a twelve episode season. 
 
Story: 2/10 
 
So the first two episodes of this anime actually lead the show on a promising path. Initially I thought this anime was going to be a school life/slice of life/harem type anime which even though as been done to death is sometimes good to go back to and just enjoy. The first episode showcased a class war while the second puts the characters on an odd job to find a lost dog. The flow between the characters seemed to be done very well but as soon as the third episode hits, they introduce a terrorist plot to the anime that completely…kills it (in a bad way). The anime tries to become super serious and add backstory to some of the characters but unfortunately it just fails. It’s a shame because I was really looking forward to a nice laid back anime. 
 
Animation: 7/10 
 
The animation on the other hand came out pretty good. I was lucky enough to get to watch this season on my friend's BD copy in 1920x1080 resolution and I have to say…ecchi. There are a lot of scenes where there are some suggested sexual content but nothing that pushes the bar too much. In terms of overall quality of the scenes, it is kind of a mixed bag. The scenes where not a lot is going on are filled with some impressive visuals, however I noticed that the action scenes are filled with some artifacting (which shouldn't happen on a BD copy of the anime...) and some loss of quality. Overall it’s a great looking anime so props for that. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
 
The soundtrack leaves much to be desired but the voice acting is recorded fairly well and also has pretty good actors to back them up. Each character has a unique and well done vocal track. The only issue that really bothers me about the sound in this anime is that the overall soundtrack is just bland and uninspiring. 
 
Characters: 6.5/10 
 
In terms of my overall enjoyment with the characters of this anime I have to say that I did love some of the characters. The ones that stood out to me the most was the sex crazy Shina, the main character Naoe, and the shy Mayuzumi who uses a keychain to communicate with others (thinking that it is a god). Everyone else however comes off as generic and, “Oh I remember someone like her from like five other anime.” Generic doesn’t always mean “bad” but for this anime it just seems like they didn’t try to push the character development enough to get these said generic characters out of the typical cookie cutter descriptions. 
 
Overall: 5.4/10 
 
Overall I really, really, really wanted to enjoy this anime because the initial episode really gave me hope and had me hooked. It turns out however that a weird and unneeded plot device can and will run an anime with subpar character development and average sound. It’s hard to recommend this to anyone but hey if you need to kill some time at least it’s not horrible. 
 
Enjoyment: 5/10

Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting,  Spring and Chaos  is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers. 
 
(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","The story follows Kenji Miyazawa through different periods of his life, centering primarily on his relationships with his sister, his father, his students, and the farmers in his area. The film opens with a sequence of Kenji carrying snow in his hands and chasing after a moving train containing his sister Toshi. Suddenly the ground splits and the train descends into the sea, as Kenji sinks to his knees and calls his sister's name. In the real world, Kenji's students sit in their classroom and gossip about the strangeness of their teacher. Kenji enters through the window and proceeds to tell the students to shut their books and close their eyes, explaining principles of heat and temperature to them. Then he leads his students on an outdoor excursion, demonstrating the eccentric teaching style that Miyazawa was known for.
Six years earlier, Kenji walks through natural landscapes with his friend, Kanai Hosaka. Looking at two telegraph poles, he gets the inspiration for his poem Telegraph Poles on a Moonlit Night. He talks about his dreams for the future with Kanai on a mountaintop while gazing at a beautiful field of stars. Upon returning home with an armful of rocks he has collected, he witnesses his father at work at the family pawnshop business, in the middle of insisting that he cannot give a poor farmer any more money for his goods. Kenji later argues with his father about the business, decrying the practice of profiting off the poor. However, he is cheered by his sister Toshi; he asks her if she has read his poem in Azalea, a reference to the magazine that Miyazawa started with his friends. Toshi starts to cough violently and Kenji rushes to her aid.
In 1923 Kenji moves to Tokyo out of depression, working at a small publishing out. He meets his friend Kanai again after three years, but Kanai now believes Kenji to be too idealistic, and says that they cannot walk the path they dreamed of together after all. Kenji returns shortly afterwards to Hanamaki to be with Toshi, who is very sick and talks about her fear of death. Kenji reads her a story of his and describes his writing methods and the inspiration he takes from nature. His creative process is depicted in an abstract sequence showing birds, bears, a winged Kenji, and numerous other images in varying art styles.
Kenji's father berates him for printing so many copies of his book, which no one ended up reading. Kenji declares that he doesn't write to sell books. In the classroom his students read his poetry collection Spring and Asura, but they all profess to not understand it. Kenji observes the farmers toiling slavishly in the fields and becomes overcome with emotion, hit with a sudden hallucination of being trapped and surrounded by water filled with skeletal corpses and fearful spirits. He comes to with his students worrying around him. They then tell him about a student who has been stealing from his classmates; Kenji catches the student and tells the boy to follow him, travelling a long way through difficult natural terrain until they reach a mountaintop. There Kenji asks the boy about his motives for stealing, offering selflessly to give the boy his entire salary and to get him however much money he needs. He learns that the young boy is from a poor family of farmers.
Kenji makes up his mind to quit teaching and to work the fields alongside the other farmers. He is unused to the work, and the other farmers scoff at him and view him as a weak amateur. As a sung version of Miyazawa's famous poem Ame ni mo Makezu plays in the background, Kenji works in the field in the day and teaches the farmers about art and literature as well as new fertilizing techniques during the evening. However, many other farmers still do not warm up to him, continuing to think of him as spoiled and rich, even sabotaging his crop while he is away.
He works himself to exhaustion farming and hallucinates once again, leading to a rapid series of flashbacks. He despairs and thinks of one of his last moments with his sister, when she asks him to bring her fresh snow and he feeds it to her in bed. As Kenji lies desolately in the field, all of a sudden a pair of trains burst up from the ground and towards the sky, referencing Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, the basis for which was said to be his sister's death. Seeing this, he is able to regain hope. He recites a segment of his poem Spring and Asura.","I came across this movie whilst searching around and I needed something to watch so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not very long, barely and hour but for such a short movie that would seem to be a child's animation, I was very impressed. I of course watched the dubbed version - it wouldn't have mattered to me - and though the voice acting was a bit shaky, it didn't take away from the actual story. I was very impressed by it's mix of CGI renders and animation, the effects taken on during one scenes left me speechless.  
 
This movie really isn't for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience. I truly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Miyazaki film or a Otomo film. 
 
I do say though with heart, the main character, Kenji, left me to wonder a lot of things about life and its surroundings. This movie can teach you something. 

          
 
       Helpful How do you make a fitting tribute to a great person? Well, this is how. It's EXACTLY how it needed to be in this case: poetic and extremely heartfelt. 
 
Spring and Chaos is a short parable on Kenji Miyazawa's life as an adult, directed by Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame. Of course, one cannot expect a comprehensive account in less than an hour's time―thankfully, this movie doesn't attempt that. Colorful and deliberately surreal, it instead relays the atmosphere of Miyazawa's works and the circumstances of their creation, the physical and emotional turmoil he was going through in his short life, and his unique and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand what this person is about. Surrounded by all kinds of misfortune, sadness, and misunderstanding, Miyazawa's noble soul shone through in his unrelenting dedication to comprehend the world and enrich the lives of others back when almost nobody―including most of his family members―could realize the extent of his talent, motivation, and self-sacrifice. 
 
The movie quite fittingly gives us a good taste of Miyazawa's writing and worldview by presenting his life as a visual poem―and does so by capturing the very essence of poetry in all of its splendor without focusing too much on worldly details; in a sense, taking an approach almost exactly inverse of the over-represented slice-of-life genre. Call it an ""essence of life"": the genre where you say a little to tell a lot. And yes, in its relatively short runtime it tells quite enough to overwhelm. Just like good poetry should. 
 
Many of you know how it feels to rewatch something you first saw many years ago. More often than not you fail to recapture that first-time experience. But Spring and Chaos is one of those very rare pieces of art that doesn't only stand the test of time―it also actually becomes better on a subsequent watch. I was about 20 when I saw it the first time, and, while it certainly did seem inspired and engaging the first time around, I couldn't say I was moved very much. I have, however, rewatched it multiple times since, and by the time I hit 30 it managed to completely floor me. Almost every scene, especially in the second half of the movie, is so unbelievably powerful despite its subtlety, it can move you to tears without ever becoming a forced tear-jerker. This is especially prominent considering the movie has very little actual dialogue and relies predominantly on visual storytelling. All in all a mark of an outstanding work that transcends its medium and succeeds at its ultimate task: to introduce the viewer to the marvelous world of Kenji Miyazawa. The lamp is lost, its light forever preserved. Sleep well, Kenji-san.

          
 
       Helpful A truly unique and enjoyable anime.It tells the story of rich businessman son: Kenji Miyazawa who tries to find deeper meaning to life and his place among society. As the son of a rich businessman it would be easy to undertake the role of the family business and live in relative comfort and splendor.But kenji yearns for adventure and so tries his hand at different jobs to see if he can find any answers to life. 
 
The main character  Kenji Miyazawa is a bit of an oddball,his idealistic view of life and carefree attitude is a point of contention between him and his father and a source of amusement among children.He's immature while at the same time convincing in his lead role. 
 
I really like the animation,the drawing was done with great detail,the like of which is rarely  seen among today CGI animation. 
 
Overall not an anime everyone will be able to appreciate but i found it enjoyable non the less.

3,3359,85,8.194001365,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Amatsuki,"Tokidoki Rikugou is a history-hating student who flunks out of his Japanese History course; his high school forces him to make up for his failed grade by attending a special museum lecture. Its star exhibit, a vast recreation of the Edo Period, promises to alleviate the delinquent student's poor grades with an elaborate simulation of the Tokugawa Shogunate: the Edo Bakumatsu Walking Tour and Exhibition.  
 
Knowing next to nothing about samurai culture or the times he's walked into, he is quickly surprised to learn of the superstitious nature of Japan during the 1600s. Quickly dismissing the existence of gods and demons, he is shocked when confronted by a demon on a bridge, who attacks the unsuspecting high-schooler. Saved by a mysterious swordsman named Kuchiha, he discovers that he can no longer escape the simulation at the history museum. 
 
Meeting another swordsman named Kon Shinonome, he discovers another contemporary that was trapped in the simulation before him. Quickly adjusting to his new home, Tokidoki must now help protect the village from demons, while uncovering the mystery of both the simulation and the company that created it. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Demons', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Shoujo', 'Supernatural']","Tokidoki is a Japanese high school student who, when he fails his history class, is sent to a high-tech history museum that virtually recreates the Edo period to do make-up work. However, what was supposed to be a simple school project becomes much more complicated when he's attacked by two supernatural beings known as ""the nue"" and ""the yakou"" and loses the vision in his left eye. After he's saved from the nue by a girl named Kuchiha, he realizes that he's no longer wearing the simulation goggles, and is trapped in the virtual Edo. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sensai Corporation, the virtual reality company who made the virtual museum Tokidoki is trapped in, is seen throughout the story.
","I'll start by telling you that the manga this thirteen-episode series is based on, has been running for over three years now. From this alone, you can deduce that it's too short, and doesn't end properly. That's very true, and these thirteen episodes seem like an introduction arc to something much more grand. But despite being too short, it showed so much potential that I'm gonna read the manga. And hope for a second season. 
 
Read the sumamry, and you'll have the basic premise of this show. Rikugou Tokidoki gets trapped in an alternate world, where demons and the like isn't an unsual thing. After getting trapped here, he is suddenly confronted with a lot of things; he has to change the way he thinks about and lives life, and he's the one person in that world who doesn't have a fate, which has resulted in him possessing a special power. Amatsuki also begins to explore the relations between demons and humans: are either good or evil? Is there something else behind it all? 
 
As I said, it sets the base for one helluva great show, and then stops. Fortunately, they didn't try to resolve things that much during the course of the thirteen episodes. I say fortunately because this definitely leaves room for a new season to continue the show, something they might not have been able to if they tried to close up the ending.  
 
The characters are all okay, with some great supporting characters and a new kind of main character in Tokidoki. He's not the completely laid-back type, and he's definitely not the overly rash type of guy. He's just a kind guy who cares for those around him without having to show it by killing everyone around him. 
 
Studio DEEN did a great job on the animation. The coloring is good, shading effects are good too, backgrounds are great, and characters designs are fine, with the exception of their eyes; the pupils are a bit large compared to the size of the eyes. I don't know about you, but I'm not a big fan of it. Nevertheless, the animation's great. 
 
The soundtrack is really great, though a bit unvaried; it was the same few background songs that played during the series, and I noticed that one of them was just an instrumental version of the ED theme, which in its original vesion is astounding. The OP theme's good too. The soundtrack did a decent job for this series, but it lacked a few things to become truly awesome. 
 
One more thing to note is that things may happen a bit quickly at times; this is most likely a product of its short length. I've noticed other people complaining about this, and true enough, I didn't quite catch what was happening without pausing and/or rewinding a few times to think over things. 
 
All in all Amatsuki is a series that may leave you a bit confused, and it'll make you long for a second season, but it's definitely good, and it holds the potential to become truly great. It just needs a second season! 
 
To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)

          
 
       Helpful Passed during a mysterious parallel thought of Edo period, Amatsuki is a very interesting anime that explores the relationship between the basic religious classes of Shinto: Demons, Humans, Kami and the Heaven.  
 
The first thing we have to remember to be able to fully enjoy this is that these &quot;classes&quot; are completely unrelated to anything you may find in the montheist Western religions we're used to. Demons, Humans and Kami (the spirits of things, if I am allowed to simplify) live in unrelated worlds, bounded by thin bridges, while the Heaven is a higher place where everything belongs. It is in Heaven (Ten) that the destiny is forged and inserted in matter. Everything is ok in Amatsuki, the Edo mirror, until this young man Toki appears. Happens that young Toki also has the ability to forge destiny! Which dwells into the desire to change it. 
 
The story is absolutely interesting because of this setting. Some of the characters know what the destiny will be and will want to change it, while the main character is driven through a madness of a world that he does not know, trying to fit himself, please everyone and keep up with the people he loves. 
 
The art is not refined, but appropriate, and the portrays of demons are very amusing. It fits well the characters: an assortment of hot guys (for my fangirl pleasure), original designs for the paranormal beings and delicacy of clothes for the girls. The personalities of the characters are also very interesting, from the lazy demon boss to the shy and short tempered possessed girl. However, the main character fails them. A boy that never had any problem, has no reason for being kind, accepts everything just because... Too ideal. 
 
A beautiful world surrounded by a beautiful musical score, with the great defect of being too short. The secondary story (heart-taking and inspiring, for what matters) took all the time, while the primary was left open with a declaration of war to the Heavens. This outrageous ending makes Amatsuki deserve its fair score. All we can hope is that a second season is written in our destiny.

          
 
       Helpful Story (7.0) - For me, the story is a decent one. In my opinion, the story started very well in the first episodes, but as the anime came close to the end, it started to look a little confusing, with some episodes with almost no advance in the storyline. 
The last episode was not bad, but could also have been better.  
The story itself has some interest, also has some action, but there are some flaws like slow progress, confusing aspects,... 
Interesting, but no more than a 7 here. 
 
Art (6.3) - in a short sentence: Not impressive! Design and animations doesnt look that good as they should, so just a 6 here. 
 
Sound (6.0) - Although it isnt bad, i didnt like it very much. The opening is acceptable, the ed i didnt like it, the background music and voices aspect are not fantastic, this aspect is just an average aspect, that&acute;s why i give it a 6. 
 
Characther (5.0) - This aspect is not good. During the anime, i cant understand the role of many of the characters. Some vanish after 1 or 2 appearences, others rarely appear, even the main ones almost do nothing during the series except for tokidoki. 
In my opinion, this aspect was not develloped as it should be, and this makes a big impact in the anime. After watching amatsuki, i dont know a thing about most of the characters, and i can say for sure that all of them are far far away for having chances to be in my favourites. 
 
Enjoyment (6.2) - It could be interesting indeed, but it has major flaws. The lack of action in some moments, some confusing aspects in the story, episodes that come out of nowhere and lack of logical sequence is what i can point this show as mistakes. So, the show turned out to be just an mediocre show. 
 
overall (6.0) - I could say for sure that this show had potential to be better. The first 2 episodes were interesting, but then it started to miss in some important aspects and turned out to be confusing, boring in some moments and slow.  
with a better organization could have been much better, as it is i cant give it more than a 6.

3,37374,86,8.186983535,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Pastel Memories,"The story takes place in a future Akihabara where otaku culture has declined. Players play as a shopkeeper of an otaku shop. Together with the heroines who are in fact otaku girls, the shopkeeper start helping people claim their lost otaku memories back.  
 
(Source: QooApp)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure']","In the year 20XX, manga and anime culture has been gradually disappearing from Akihabara. This is the result of a mysterious malicious virus that infects the worlds of various fictional works and destroys them, along with anyone's memories of them. Standing against this are the members of the Rabbit Shed Shop café, who possess the ability to travel into these worlds in order to stop the virus.","Pastel Memories is one hell of a cheese ride. It caught my attention when I got a used issue of Megumi magazine (only because it had a BanDori insert, but I gave that to my friend), I found Pastel Memories being promo'd as both a mobile game and a anime-spin off. Its art for that game is much nicer in a sense, but the premise is ratter ""standard"". At least the colors stand out and probaly live up to its ""pastel"" from the title name.  
 
STORY - Not the grandest. If anything it borrowed the ""world/monster of the week"" formula from typical child-friendly anime like Precure or Pokemon. It is interesting to see the girls interact with worlds inspired by other beloved anime/manga/light novel/games, without having the IP to being shoved in... Due to possible copyright I guess. From 1 to 12, it is honestly underwhelming. But, I won't diss to much because this anime serves as cheese fuel to be enjoyed without over-thinking to much.  
 
CHARACTER - Each girl is a archetype (dere switch, quiet loli, gun hobbyist(?), etc. etc.) that has been done in many of the ""moe blob fuel"" anime I have seen so far. There are some girls that I do honestly like and would be happy to scout them (or their costumes) if I do ever play the game. The only girls that I somehow like/relate are Machiya (damn cat puns and that cat-like personality...) and Komachi (future avatar girl? Maybe?). The costume designs to me are probably the strong point of Pastel Memories. I am a sucker for the mahou-shoujo steampunk aesthetic and I think that's their initial selling point.  
 
ANIMATION - Its not bad, nor good. And on the Chutaro episode, I feel like it intentionally went downgrade due to a lot of children's' anime had mixed quality (to a laughable level), so I guess that's a plus? I'm not to nit picky at that department, because I have seen worse on specific episodes of Precure that makes Pastel Memories look tolerable.  
 
OST - Not as memorable? But I think I herd a few tints of a OST that do sound good and helps amcompanying the mood of the anime. I'm not a OST buff since I do have specific tastes, but once again: it gets the job done. 
 
OP - I like the lineless animation, which I think its a nod to a specific movie director, but I can be wrong. Its not the most catchiest song to the point I would play on loop, but it had that right ""pastel"" feel to its name.  
 
ED - DAT FANSERVICE. Okay the art for the girls' and their beach bods are a eye popper! The song feels like a typical beach moe song, and not one I would listen in repeat. But it did capture that said-beach look for the bikini girls, so I guess it got its job done. Otherwise: I am genre nit-picky and my own picks would probably ruin Pastel Memories before the virus affects them! xD 
 
I don't know what other points I should mention, but if anyone wants to toss me questions or opinions, feel free too! Otherwise, I think its an okay anime with a easy story to follow if you have a tired day.  
 
Would I recommended it? Yes and no? Yes if you like junk food anime, but ""no"" if you can't stand repetition of plot formula like the classic Pokemon or Precure episode. If you like to view for the memes (because I am sure there are some), then go for it! I do wish I can play the mobile game (in English) to judge and compare to the anime... 

          
 
       Helpful While this anime really isn't the best, it is quite clear that it could be enjoyable for kids who don't want a deep or complicated storyline. It is enough to entertain a bored child but has almost nothing more to offer. 
 
This anime has a large cast of characters; none of which have any personality whatsoever. There are too many characters with not enough time spent on each of them. I cannot recall any of the characters names and I will most likely forget about all of them once the spring season starts. 
 
The animation isn't amazing either, it's satisfactory at best. 
 
There seams to be a minimal amount of thought put into explaining the reason things are the way they are. There is a large amount of plot holes and things that seem to have no reason for being a part of the show. 
 
The show had no conclusion and left me confused way too often. 
 
This entire anime seems to be nothing more than a mess of plot holes, unexplained events, boring characters and a semi-decent outro.

Repetitive... 
…probably this unique word resumes the anime. 
Yes, the anime is very repetitive, seriously, basically every episode is a manga infected by a virus, and they save the manga, but it is in every episode. 
In the beginning, the anime looks like very cool, but it is only in episode 1 and 2, as I said, the others episodes is basically the second episode, but in a different manga. 
In my opinion the art of the anime is very beautiful (this is one of the reason that decided to watch it), and I like this style, but probably this is the unique good thing in this anime, and it isn’t a good reason to watch it. 
Seriously, don’t waste your time with this anime; there are so many betters anime than this one.

I consider this AMV being one which compliments the song and not the other way around therefore i will not focuse on the lack of ""plot"" and other things otherwise if it had been the other way around. 
 
This one is kind of special, it is made purely by traditional pencil work which gives it a very special artistic feel to it and which contributes to the dark feeling of this song. The song itself when translated is a bittersweet somewhat dark song which has a nice melancholy feel to it without being too much. The video itself does not have that much of an plot but being a symbol of the meaning of the song.  
 
You might not like it for its experimental metal music and also the artistic use of pencil. I do really think this should be watch if you are in the mood for something more bittersweet. 
I myself found the music above average, nothing did really stood out but it was quite enjoyable ^^

3,691,88,8.103629469,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Yawara!,"Yawara! is a sports anime laced with comedic and romance elements. It starts off with Yawara Inokuma, a high school girl who is most interested in doing the things that your average Japanese high school girl does; however, she has been trained in Judo for years by her grandfather, Jigorou (A former Japan Judo Champion), who has much grander plans in store for her as a Judo superstar. He manipulates matters so that Yawara ends up having to perform in matches and tournaments. His final plan is for Yawara to ""Win the Gold Medal in the Olympics and be awarded the Nation Medal of Honor.""

Because of the pressure from her grandfather she generally has a bad attitude about judo, avoiding it as much as she can. However, over time she comes to understand why her grandfather loves judo and appreciates it more.","This is not a sports anime really. The story is about a Judo prodigy named Yawara, who doesn't really like the idea of doing Judo. But it is sort of the family trade and she doesn't have the - I am going to go with the word backbone here for the lack of a better description - to put her foot down so she does Judo even though she strongly dislikes the idea. But hey, everybody else seems to love the idea that she does it, so she does it.  
Story: 
This is the whole plot of this anime. It is said in the description on many websites that it is a sports anime but in my opinion it is a shoujo'ish slice of life anime with the touch of sports in it. The plot moves along the same track over and over in an eternal loop, ""She dislikes Judo, she is going to stop, something happens, she does it, and she wins."" Then the circle starts again.  The sport Judo is not the focal point, it is the reason. At the end of 124 episodes you are left with the impression that she doesn't hate the sports that much anymore but that is it. That is all the real satisfaction you get out of the whole plot of a 124 episodes long anime. 
Art: 
The art reminded me a little of Itazura na Kiss. I am not a giant fan of that style but I don't hate it either. At least they do have ""real"" bodies and no matchstick limbs with watermelon sized chest area and giant heads with triangular noses. All the characters are distinguishable and no two characters look the same.  
Sound: 
All I can say is, it didn't bother me. There was nothing outstanding for me, no piece of music I started tapping my foot to or started mumbling the words unconsciously.  
Characters: 
If I tell you they annoyed the hell out of me to the point where I started assembling assassination plans for imaginary drawn people, it is an understatement.  
 Inokuma Yawara: Is the main protagonist. She is a whiny, indecisive, weak and a not very smart girl who wants to have a boyfriend and thinks she cant have one unless she doesn't do Judo. She gets older but does not really evolve in my opinion during the whole 124 episodes.  
The Grandfather Yawara: A manipulative old Judo ""God"" whose only objective is to gather certain medals through his grandchild. Said grandchild could be Male, femaie, plankton or alien. He is not really prejudiced. As long as that holy Judo family genes and -name bearing being practices Judo. To meet his objectives he is not above or below anything that could help this purpose. Admittedly he does provide a comedic relief now and then. 
The mother and the father: Each a piece of work. Father up and left. We really do not know exactly why, even though there are two theories, both Judo related. Apparently he is a wimp and a wuss and a sore loser. He left, either because a five year old bested him once or he lost a practice match to one of his friends/rivals. ONCE. After that, he left his wife and daughter and vanished. He is like yeti, they hear stories about him but he is always elusive. And the mother is the yeti hunter. Whenever there is a story of the yeti-father the mother runs to check it, and doesn't come back until she knows more. This could be a day, a month a year. Who knows. We don't.  
Love interests.: There are two. One is a playboy, the other is a fan-boy. The playboy gets engaged to the rival. And lo and behold, the Miss goodie 2shoes-protogonist doesn't really see anything wrong still going out with an engaged man and hanging on to him. The fan-boy gets at some point a bo..bie-wonder attachment, a co-worker who decided they are in love. The guy doesn't really like her. He says he likes Yawara, but doesn't really tell the annoying co-worker off, they go on dates, but hey, the guy likes the main character. Same goes for the playboy by the way. But at the end of the day they are both very lukewarm in their pursuit of the girl. 
Friends are more or less interchangeable.  the main rival is annoying and repetitive at best. And there is no real tension in the air, because she is too mediocre and too lukewarm to be a real villian and yet she is too villainous to become a friend. Oddly enough the only characters that evolve in my opinion are the ones from the judo clubs. Both High school and the College one. But the main characters and the first string supporting characters are always the same. Yawara is whiny, Grandpa is manipulative, mother is a doormat, father is, well, I don't have a polite word to describe him. So think your own words. The rival and the lover-boys also are always the same. Really, I could go on this raging negative review for 50 pages and I would still be annoyed. And this is coming form somebody who actually got over middle-aged looking middle school boys with supernatural tennis shots and glowing, flying bodies for over 178 episodes with giant plot holes.  
 
In episode 1 Yawara is in high school. She doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she wants to quit Judo. 124 episodes later: Yawara is in college, she doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she is kinda sorta maybe ok doing Judo. 124 episodes. And that is all that there is. 
Altogether, this is NOT a sports anime. This is a shoujo, slice of life, useless personal angst and drama anime, where sports play a role. I am guessing at the time they were trying to create a hype for the upcoming Olympics in Barcelona but apart from a countdown and an honorable mention at the final arc (About 30 days before the Olympics they START training to join the team. Yes you read it right. I said 30 days and start)  
 
That all said, before I got this anime I checked all around and there are more glowing reviews of this anime than not. I am apparently odd ball out here. Still, if you are searching for a sports anime, watch the first couple of episodes before obtaining the entire series. You know, just to be on the safe side. 

          
 
       Helpful To think I've been dragging my heels over completing this one the past several months. I was surprised to discover that this was one of Naoki Urasawa's earlier works considering his work on mystery/ thrillers like Master Keaton and Monster. Yawara is a bit more lighter in mood as a sports rom-com in its focus on our titular heroine being dragged into the world of judo competitions due to her natural talent and life-long training for the sport, despite not wanting anything to do with it. The series follows Yawara from high school to her time in the working world as her natural skills as a judoka lead her to become an international sensation due to her abilities. 
 
On the plus side, Yawara does a mostly solid job with developing Yawara's character throughout the series as she seeks to live her life normally. But due to circumstances regularly turning against her and her grandfather's manipulations, her regular life and participating in the judo world blur together as she encounters a number of characters throughout the series who come to befriend or rival her due to her talents in judo such as reporter Matsuda, rich girl Sayaka, the Canadian judoka Jody and the cold Soviet judoka Anna. These help Yawara slowly mellow out of her desire for normalcy throughout the series and her reasons for not wanting anything to do with judo get further explored as the series progresses. 
 
In regards to supporting characters to the series, they are a bit hit or miss. Some get a decent amount of fleshing out and make for interesting characters to see develop like Matsuda and even Fujiko, Yawara's college friend from later in the show's run. Others don't get much fleshing out being reduced to archetypes and exist either as opponents for Yawara to overcome, comedic relief or showing off their more obnoxious habits. While I did not mind those serving as Yawara's opponents or comic relief, those who were more obnoxious and self-absorbed (mainly Yawara's grandpa Jigoro, Sayaka, womanizer Kazamatsuri and photographer Kuniko) did press my buttons at points as I watched the series, especially if the show chose to devote a good deal of time to focus on them. 
 
The anime also does a great job at believably showing off the various rules and applications of judo for tournament competition. The normal weight classes, rules and point systems for competition; as well as the different grapples, throws and submissions utilized in spars and matches are authentically explored as such where judo enthusiasts will appreciate the authenticity. There is the occasional dependence on drama tropes in some shoddy attempts to create tense moments and Yawara being mostly unstoppable against her opponents kills some of the intrigue of her matches, but this doesn't get in the way of the authenticity of judo competitions that Naoki Urasawa shows off for this series. 
 
While having some hiccups, Yawara is a mostly solid sports rom-com exploring Yawara trying to juggle her life as a normal girl and gifted judo-ka, while also doing a great job at believably portraying the sport it focuses on. While sports anime mostly struggle at finding an audience due to heavy focus on their sport of focus, Yawara does a decent enough job to balance focus between judo and the ongoing storylines involving Yawara and other characters within her life. This is one of the better sports-themed anime titles to watch if the genre grabs your interest. 

          
 
       Helpful Naoki Urasawa's an interesting fellow. An award winning mangaka, he's probably best known in the English anime fandom for ""Monster"", a dark, psychological manga from which sprung an anime of the same name, an anime that critics often trot out when compiling their ""Best Anime"" lists. (Disclosure: it's also on mine, though whether I count as a critic is debatable.) Given Urasawa's crendentials, you probably wouldn't expect him to have also written a manga that gave rise to a bright and chirpy long running sports anime adaptation about a young girl doing judo. That anime is ""Yawara!"", or to give it its full title, ""Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl!"" 
 
Wait! Come back! Before you dismiss ""Yawara!"" on the basis of its silly title and sports premise, remember this is Naoki Urasawa we're talking about! While he did write ""Yawara!"" early on in his career, you don't need to look hard under the hood to see the interesting details that distinguishes ""Yawara!"" from a typical lengthy sports anime. 
 
In many ways, ""Yawara!"" is a subversive take on the sports genre. A typical sports anime would start off by introducing some total n00b that gets attracted to some sport, and it would turn out that The N00b(TM) is immensely talented in the said sport. Early on, The N00b(TM) would meet a rival who is far ahead in terms of skill level, The N00b(TM) would be inspired to work very hard to catch up with The Rival(TM) and they would form a rivalry that runs throughout the show. Etc. 
 
Well, ""Yawara!"" mostly dumps this formula on its head. 
 
Yawara, the titular character, just wants to be a normal girl. Unfortunately for her, she comes from a family of elite judo athletes. While both her parents are alive (which theoretically puts her in a better position than most anime protagonists), they're both AWOL so she's being raised by her grandfather (which effectively puts her in the same position as most anime protagonists). Her grandfather, being a famous judo champ, has trained Yawara hard from a young age in the hope that she'll also be a champion some day and even win an Olympic gold medal. But Yawara would much rather go shopping and date boys than do judo, and the story essentially revolves around her grandfather and a bunch of other people pushing Yawara towards greatness in spite of her reluctance. 
 
The first thing to note is that this is not a zero-to-hero story: despite not having participated in any tournaments, Yawara's power level at the start of the show is well beyond even those of a typical rival character in a sports show. Rather amusingly, the show then proceeds to find a n00b rival who has to catch up to Yawara! You can even say that ""Yawara!"" is a sports show in name only: it takes about five episodes before we even see the protagonist participate in a proper fight. And while the matches are well animated and executed in their action sequences, they're often over quickly, rarely dragging its feet across multiple episodes as sports anime are wont to do. To top it off, the protagonist doesn't even like judo, and spends most of the series trying to get away from it. 
 
So what do you call a sports anime that's not very sporty? In the case of ""Yawara!"", I'd probably call it a sitcom. Like all good sitcoms, ""Yawara!"" provides good entertainment value and comfortable viewing; its comedy brims with warmth and its characters quirk and charm. I find Yawara's grandfather Jigoro to be especially amusing: a lot of the show's running jokes involve him, such as his habit of inflating his judo rank and his tireless and shameless promotion of his book. What tickled me the most is how unexpectedly far the anime managed to take his habit of ending all his sentences in ""ja"". Amusements aside, many characters of ""Yawara!"" are also infused with depth, with ""Beanpole"" in particular going through an incredible amount of development in the course of the show. 
 
Unfortunately, the generally strong and endearing cast of characters only ends up highlighting Yawara herself as rather unlikable. Her constant rejection of judo is taken so far that the show can be teeth-clenchingly frustrating to watch. That said, it does end up providing a lot of food for thought:?for the longest time, I couldn't make up my mind whether the anime's views about women are progressive or outdated. After all, not only does Yawara harbour no ambitions of becoming a champion, her own lofty dreams consists of going shopping, finding a boyfriend etc, and one of the reasons she rejects judo is because she thinks it makes her less feminine. Also, considering Japan isn't exactly a shining beacon of progress when it comes to attitudes on women's role in society, and it's easy see ""Yawara!"" in a cynical light. On the other hand, the female characters of ""Yawara!"" tend to be more successful than their male counter parts, and it's the men who are playing the supporting parts. For an anime to make this role reversal in the 80s - or arguably even now - it has to be making a pretty powerful feminist statement, right? Is Yawara's lack of ambition perhaps meant as a critical reflection on a society that nurtures women to do nothing beyond dress prettily and start a family? Whatever the anime's intentions, this is the aspect of ""Yawara!"" that fascinated me the most, and I find myself continuing to ponder back on it long after I finished the show. 
 
""Yawara!"" also has other aspects that sets it beyond a light-hearted sitcom. Not dragging out judo matches means that the show actually ends up covering a lot of ground in its characters' lives over the course of its 100+ episode run. Yawara starts the the show in school, then goes to college, then ultimately graduates into the job market. Along the way, the anime takes its characters down surprisingly mature routes such as job hunting and parenthood. Judo may be the topic, but ""Yawara"" is at least as much about its characters' hopes and fears, dreams and ambitions, and general lives. However, with so much development going on in so many areas, I was all the more frustrated with the fact that the only notable aspect of ""Yawara!"" that settles into the status quo is the main romance. 
Don't get me wrong: Yawara's romance thread isn't exactly bad, and there are even pockets of tenderness worthy of a great romance anime. The problem though, is that in the big picture, the main romance is locked in a boringly familiar dance of two step forward, one step back, then one step forward, two steps back, never quite going anywhere significant. This displays in stark contrast against other side characters' love stories, which, like the general trend in ""Yawara!"", go further and faster than what you would expect.? 
 
It's a shame, really: the main strength of ""Yawara!"" is built on its quiet, thoughtful, delightful unconventionality. But the few aspects that remain conventional is what holds ""Yawara!"" back, and ultimately those are what end up preventing the show transcending from merely being very good to being great. 
 
Personal rating: +1.5 (very good)

Just after arriving, he is killed while trying to help a young half-elf he befriends, Emilia, who is a candidate to become the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica, only to revive some hours in the past. After dying some times, Subaru realizes that he has the power to turn back time after his death. After successfully helping Emilia, Subaru starts living in one of the Mansions of the Roswaal Mathers as a butler. Out of gratitude and affection for Emilia, Subaru makes use of his newfound ability to protect her and help on her ambition to be successfully appointed as the next queen, also providing assistance to other friends he makes along the way, while suffering due to the pain inflicted on him every time he dies, and carrying along the memories of everything that happened before his power activates, which is forgotten by everybody except for him.
","This is my first review and I've decided to review Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time because I'm lazy and don't want to tackle an anime that requires thinking or a lot of typing to review. These are essentially just 2 minute shorts based on the currently airing show Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu so the target audience of Break Time is people who are watching and enjoying Re:Zero and can't wait a whole week to get their next Subaru fix. The shorts are humorous in nature and occasionally add a little bit to plot points that were tackled in Re:Zero but are generally unnecessary and are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary. 

          
 
       Helpful Yes, character and voice actor deserves a break, in other words, just for fun, but also feels like trying to add something beneath the middle of the episodes.  
 
For example, how Subaru confuse as Apple in real world (Ringo) and Fantasy World, Appas (Ringa), Beatrice hate Subaru calling her Loli, and just small random stuff in the whole episodes. 
 
Other than that, is just for your pleasure 3 minute break time after done doing voice acting the main series. 
 
Indeed its funny but not from what we expected from short video.

Released as a special.,['Kids'],"True Tears revolves around a high school student named Shin'ichirō Nakagami with a high artistic ability. He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home.
Shin'ichirō has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shin'ichirō knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shin'ichirō teases her.
After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box, and he finds out from her that she ""gave her tears away"". Shin'ichirō also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endō at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns, and she helps out at the shop too. Shin'ichirō juggles all of these problems on a day-to-day basis as he learns about love and the sadness of those around him.
The opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in Nanto, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality Nanto is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping center from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop and the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the series―Isurugi, Kurobe, and Takaoka―are place names in Toyama Prefecture.
","If you are interested in the ending of the book which Shinichiro wrote in the original series you will find out from this short. For me it was the only reason to watch it. Wasn't disappointed. The story ends really comforting. There is no music at all, so I just gave it the half of the score, beacue there is nothing to rate.

However, an incident in which other kids accused him of being girly for liking Sanrio characters made him ashamed of his attachment to Pompompurin.  
 
Through a series of unexpected events, Kouta ends up meeting others at school who also like Sanrio characters―Yuu Mizuno, a flashy boy who is popular with girls; Shunsuke Yoshino, a member of the soccer team; Ryou Nishimiya, an underclassman who is a library assistant; and Seiichirou Minamoto, the student council president.

The characters were so well-received that they received their own line of character merchandise starting in June 2016.","Sanrio Danshi is like Free! if instead of swimming they bonded over commercial corporate mascot characters. It's weird. 
 
It's super weird how there’s SO MUCH commentary on this show is about soft masculinity or something because of how much ANN/etc hates harsh masculine men and not on the weird emotional connection to corporate products that is MADE by that same corporation in order to push MORE emotional attachment.  
 
Listen, I'm not the type to preach to you that capitalism is evil, but a show that's entire purpose is to attach sentimentally to corporate product is weird. And I kind of hate how good the character design, art design and color design is for it. It's great. It's absolutely beautiful to look at. 
 
Man, it's weird seeing a show attach real emotions to straight up corporate products. Attaching positive feelings of your dead grandma to a corporate product. At least when it's The Products Are Characters, you're attaching sentimentality to the product THROUGH character. You like the keychain because you like the character.  
 
This show is just straight 'here's characters who have entire emotional journey and emotional attachment is to Straight Up the product itself.' It's weird. I'm going to KEEP overusing the word weird because I can't find any other way to describe it. 
 
They cement their bond by going to a real world location store and they tell you what it is I think. It's just. Weird. 
 
Episode 7 was an okay ad for Puroland I guess.

          
 
       Helpful If you took a show like ohshc or free!, crammed it into 12 episodes, and sucked everything likable or exciting out of it, you would be left with Sanrio danshi. While nothing is particularly egregious about Sanrio danshi, the lack of passion and cliche dependency is glaringly obvious.  
 
I don't want to say Sanrio danshi is bad just because it's essentially a glorified advertisement.  Pokemon, one of the most beloved anime of all, is basically an ad to sell the games and merchandise. What sets Sanrio danshi apart is not that is an ad - but that it is ONLY an ad. Without sanrio, absolutely nothing sets sanrio danshi apart from any other show ever. It feels like a robot made sanrio danshi, which was able to make a story but not able to give it feeling. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Sanrio Danshi has a simple plot. Boys meet, bond over Sanrio, make a play. Story beats are hit methodically, and of course the old favorites are here: a beach episode AND a school festival. Nothing stands out, and the plot is pretty boring. A pet peeve of mine is when something happens, and we are shown the reaction of every single character, one at a time. Pointless, boring, and annoying filler. 
 
Art: 3 
 
Sanrio danshi's art manages to be repulsively adequate. Character designs are forgettable (besides perhaps Yuu), backgrounds are plain and there is very little detail. Almost all action scenes are replaced with slowly panning still shots. Weirdly, whenever the characters take off their shirts they become hideously muscular and just kind of gross to look at. Fanservice gone wrong, I guess. Some backgrounds look like photographs, which was cool, but this was only for Sanrio backdrops - so instead of being an artistic choice, this was all about the advertising. Ultimately underwhelming. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound is fine. The OP and ED fit the theme, the background music sets the tone well enough, and the voice actors are nice. I was expecting Shunsuke to have a deeper voice, but his voice actor was fine nonetheless. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. 
 
Character: 3 
 
Even calling them 'characters' feels too kind. Nobody in sanrio danshi feels even a little bit real. The MC kouta has No Character Traits besides he likes pompompurin, and uhh..... yeah, that's kind of it. When compared against a main character like, say, haru from free, his blandness becomes even more apparent. The only character I liked was Yuu, but that's just my soft spot for romantic long-haired bishis. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
 
I wanted to like sanrio danshi. I will continue to watch it to the end. But man, it could be so much better. 
 
Overall: 3 
 
Sanrio Danshi is boring and uninspired. While technically adequately drawn with good sound and music, there is no soul to the series. Instead it feels like a paint-by-numbers cash grab. Which it is.  
 
TLDR: Don't watch this show. Go watch cute high earth defense club love instead. Or literally anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Now this is the peak of marketing, using bishounens and gap moe to sell your products, Sanrio sure know what's up. I'm not complaining, well I am, where's Gudetama?? Arguably the best existing Sanrio character {even though he was 5th in the 2017 ranking [Slightly mad that he dropped a position from 2016 (what about KIRIMI-chan who ranked no.1 beating Gudetama in the food character election)]} sorry I'm going off track. 
 
You see, this is nothing but a huge Sanrio ad trying to increase merch and sales. However, I do appreciate the message behind this, it's true that you can love cute things and still be a MAN surprise surprise masculinity is weak. 
 
Can you believe they chose Little Twin Stars who ranked 6th over Gudetama? I'm sorry I can't.

3,5032,92,7.986922274,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Cobra The Animation,"This Cobra adaptation features short arcs of Cobra saving the world, his friends or himself.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Sci-Fi']","In the far future, an office worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporation―a company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.
In his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes ""Cobra"", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.
On his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about ""Cobra"" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.
Johnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as ""Cobra"". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.
Johnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.
","Cobra is a show that is very much out of place in today's world. It is a pulp sci-fi action comedy that is ripped directly from the 1980s, and is a fantastic throwback to the days when anime was fun, over-the-top and testosterone-fueled. Gun arms, impossibly proportioned women, and comedic one-liners. 
 
If you sat down to Cobra for the story, you would be sadly disappointed. As with most shows that could be described as pulpy, the plot is more a way to give Cobra things to do to be a badass. It does that well, and that is really all the show asks. There are a few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots. They're entertaining enough, but hardly memorable. 
 
The animation is fairly good. There's no glaring animation errors, and the entire production has a low-budget, old school feel to it that lends a lot of flavor to the show. The CG is (intentionally?) fairly poor, but is perfectly suited to the throwback style that the show is trying to cultivate. 
 
All in all, Cobra will a bit of a hard sell to most anime fans, looking for the next androgynous pretty-boy protagonist. However, if you yearn for the days where men were men, women were ""dames,"" and arms were guns, against a backdrop of cool jazz... well, I think I have a show for you.

          
 
       Helpful Being the latest installment to the Cobra series (2010), Cobra The Animation feels more like its original anime of 1982 as it follows the episodic storyline with the occasional story arcs.  
 
If you seen everything Cobra related, then this series does deliver the same content we gotten before, perhaps even manlier than ever. We see Cobra fight in an illegal underground fist fight, battles a gladiator which briefly turns into a DBZ fight, dives under the sea, climbs a mountain which may not exist, explores a planet filled with the most disturbing plants with faces & ends the series with a King's rescue mission.  
 
While the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series. In my opinon, the women somehow look at their sexiest in this series. The stories featured here are more tragic especially episodes 8 & 9 as it goes in a much darker route than Cobra usually goes to. Out of all the episodes I'd say the mountain story arc (6&7) is probably the best one in terms of mystery & suspense. As for action, it never really peaks or stays engaging all the way through, it instead has some action highlights in bits & pieces rather than a full episode.  
 
Overall, the same fun is found here although 13 episodes feels way too short. I also felt it wasn't as creative when it came to exploring the universe of Cobra(again comparing it to the first anime). Not a bad addition as the episodes are based on certain manga chapters, but the original series still remains the best of the Cobra franchise.  
 


          
 
       Helpful There are two ways you can look at this series:  
 
1) It's something that's trying to be a serious action series and fails because it's terribly cheesy, 
or 
2) This is ~meant~ to be a throwback to cheesy cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, and the cheese is, at least in part, self-satire. 
 
Personally, I lean more towards the second interpretation, and find that the series is accomplishing what it's set out to do. If you don't like cheesy old-school or satire, you're really not going to like this series at all, I'll give you that as a fair warning. 
 
First, you've got the typical daredevil macho hero with an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there's the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I'll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled. (I want to say again, but this is only the first episode so far) 
 
Second, you've got what looks like a pretty typical plot - keep the key to the Universe from the bad guys while you get it to where it needs to be. Nothing fancy at all here. 
 
So, why the (somewhat) high rating?  
 
Maybe it's just that something feels almost nostalgic about this, or maybe it's that this type of ""typical"" is actually pretty uncommon in anime. I'd say the main character almost feels like He-Man with a gun arm, and certainly seems like he'd belong more in an American-style cartoon rather than an anime. 
 
I also appreciated a couple of satirical bits in the first episode: Normally, when the hero blasts away a vehicle as it races towards him, the flaming debris that should remain seems to conveniently vanish. This wasn't the case with Cobra, as the flying vehicle speeding towards the hero simply became a flaming flying vehicle speeding towards the hero instead. 
 
Given that we're only at the first episode right now, I could be wrong and this could turn out to be a terrible series, but so far I'm leaning towards believing it's satire and am enjoying it thoroughly.

To keep from losing control of this power, he constantly lives a life under an emotional shackle. In order to help learn how to control his abilities, Mob works as an assistant to con-man Arataka Reigen, a self-proclaimed spirit medium. Mob wants to live a normal life just like those around him, but a barrage of trouble keeps coming after him. With his suppressed emotions growing inside Mob little by little, his power threatens to break through its limits as he eventually encounters other espers like the Claws.
","Let me be frank, this is essentially a recap episode (and we all know now well those go down in the anime community!), a 60min recap episode at that. 
 
The gimmick here is that it is a retelling of the events of the 1 season from the perspective of Reigen, embellished for the purpose of making some profit. I call it a gimmick because it doesn't take very long for it to wear on the nerves. Reigen's manipulation of Mob is an essential aspect of the story...but an entire episode of it is far more than I can take. 
 
Regarding all other aspects, apart from few additional scenes to move the recap along, it is a highlights reel of all the best fights from season 1, nothing more.  
 
I'm a big fan of Mob Pyscho 100 but a would strongly recommend seeing the highlighted scenes from this recap in context, they certainly suffer from being ""retooled"" in this episode. 
 
Easter Egg...apparently Reigen has a Saitama screen saver on his mobile phone.   

          
 
       Helpful I give it a middling score because it's executed very well, but I don't think it's worth watching. Maybe peeping if you're curious. It's just a recap of Season 1, but it's framed as Reigen using it as a plot to write his book. This results in him narrating the story and inserting himself in scenes or even over characters (say, if they're doing cool fighting stuff) to make it about him. It's definitely a funny twist for a recap  (especially when it's just Reigen's giant head superimposed over other characters') and it's entirely befitting of Reigen. 
 
However, it's not ENTIRELY Reigen-ified. There's much more time where the anime is the exact same (even down to characters' thoughts being heard), so I was skipping ahead a lot until there was a Reigen or two, then went back to skipping. Eventually I stopped because the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. 
 
I guess you can watch it just to see what Reigen does to the recap yourself, but don't expect to strap in for the whole thing unless you want to rewatch Season 1 in an hour.

          
 
       Helpful Story: Recap of season 1 but in a whole new twist~ HILARIOUS! I won't tell spoilers but haha.. those ""encounter"" stories.. a little delirious but hey, who wants to just see a boring recap when you can have Reigen's version of it instead? 10/10 
 
Art: No changes there. So.. yeah.

Fantastic! Hilarious OVA! They did well on it! I recommend people to watch this if they wanna see a summary but hilarious version of Mob Psycho 100.

3,28735,94,7.967943517,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu,"Yotarou is a former yakuza member fresh out of prison and fixated on just one thing: rather than return to a life of crime, the young man aspires to take to the stage of Rakugo, a traditional Japanese form of comedic storytelling. Inspired during his incarceration by the performance of distinguished practitioner Yakumo Yuurakutei, he sets his mind on meeting the man who changed his life. After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice. 
 
As he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific Rakugo performer, passed away. Through her hidden passion, Yotarou is drawn to Sukeroku's unique style of Rakugo despite learning under contrasting techniques. Upon seeing this, old memories and feelings return to Yakumo who reminisces about a much earlier time when he made a promise with his greatest rival. 
 
 Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  is a story set in both the past and present, depicting the art of Rakugo, the relationships it creates, and the lives and hearts of those dedicated to keeping the unique form of storytelling alive. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Josei']","A man is released from prison and becomes the apprentice of a famous rakugo performer, Yakumo Yurakutei. The story focuses on the backstories of the performers and their struggle to gain popularity, following Yakumo's apprenticeship and rise to fame and his friendship with fellow performer Sukeroku.
","The first time I watched Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, I turned it off ten minutes into the double-size first episode. It seemed dry and unengaging. Other anime from the same season had, in the best attention-deficit traditions, included some big dramatic hook or reveal early in their opening episode to grab the viewer. Set against them, Rakugo felt tedious. But I dropped almost every other anime from that season, and I picked this one back up, finishing it in two days.  
 
What I realised was that Rakugo is unique among anime, in that it's a novel. Its strengths lie in the naturalistic rendering of human behaviour and situations as well as the detailed evocation of a historical period. It draws you in by slowly revealing fascinating, damaged characters locked in a poisonous stalemate: Konatsu, an orphaned girl who loves rakugo and could never perform it, and the foremost rakugo artist of his time, the former rival of the girl's father - Yurakutei Yakumo, who I will call Kikuhiko. Konatsu hates Kikuhiko enough to want to kill him, but lives in his house; he treats her with indifference and condescension, sometimes shading into irritation, but he never throws her out. Why? What debt does he owe her, and why does she hate him so much? How did her father die?  
 
Animes tend to be driven by very different questions, which are forward-looking. Usually, the protagonists are either striving to fulfill their dreams or trying to deal with a situation which provides the impetus for the plot. Rakugo is unique, and more like a novel than almost any anime, because it's about the past, and about how the combination of your circumstances, your personality, your desires, the people you meet, and the society you live in, shape your life. Which is an excellent thing to be about when the subject of your questions is Kikuhiko. 
 
A diffident, strait-laced neurotic with a deep loneliness at his centre as well as a bitter determination to not give up and be abandoned again, Kikuhiko is one of the all-time great anime protagonists. He is deeply flawed and often cruel, but an innate idealism and a wounded innocence at his heart keeps him sympathetic. His psychological development is profoundly well-realised. Kikuhiko's foil, Sukeroku, is jolly and uninhibited, a supremely talented rakugoka who has a gift for drawing people to him and making them laugh. It would be predictable for Kikuhiko to simply hate him, and for them to be contrasted as dark and light, but Rakugo is far more intelligent about its characters than that. They may contrast, but they also inform each other. Sukeroku's lack of inhibition leads him to debauchery and a disregard for proper conduct which comes to hurt his career even as Kikuhiko overcomes his lack of talent with obsessive study to develop his own style of art, and his rigid decorum makes him the preferred child of the rakugo establishment. But they don't become enemies; they like each other too much.  
 
The strange relationship between Kikuhiko and Sukeroku, with love and mutual artistic appreciation and jealousy and resentment all tied up in it, is at the core of the anime: their introvert/extrovert opposition shades into its depiction of the paradoxes in the art of rakugo - a totally solitary performance which requires a rakugoka to know and truly understand people, and be able to impersonate many at once, to succeed. It is steeped in tradition, and rakugokas must conform to strictly conservative standards of behaviour, as if they represent the old values of Japan. But at the same time, rakugokas are working stiffs with an especially precarious occupation, and socially speaking, just lowly entertainers. Kikuhiko cannot be in a relationship with a geisha if he wants to advance in rakugo, but the stories he tells are often bawdy; overt sexuality is in fact his specialty, despite his personal frigidity. Sukeroku's enthusiastic caricatures are at first depicted as the gold standard, but they lack the subtlety of Kikuhiko's art; it's to the anime's credit that you begin to notice and appreciate rakugo enough to realise how their art reflects who they are. The fine layering of detail combined with the naturalistic development of the characters, all scored spectacularly by a traditional shamisen-and-taiko-drums soundtrack, makes Rakugo as satisfying on a sensory level as it is intellectually fascinating. 
 
These contradictions and the way the protagonists navigate them while being inevitably changed in the process, give a deep thematic richness to Rakugo, which uses the rise and fall of Sukeroku and Kikuhiko both as a way to examine artistic obsession, jealousy, love, and brotherhood, and as a way to depict the cultural shifts in Japan after World War Two. Here, its insights are not as sharp; it's more a character piece than social commentary, but the thirty-year canvas on which the story is painted allows for a sense of epic scope to the stories of the characters. Much like rakugo itself, the anime combines acute observation of humanity with a slightly artificial shape to its narrative. Its tragic end, where Kikuhiko and Sukeroku's selfish mistakes result, with karmic symmetry, in two always-expected and yet shocking deaths, feels more melodramatic than naturalistic, and yet it is brutally sad and horrifying. This anime can make what should seem false and contrived into something that hits you on a visceral level, and that's appropriate: it's what rakugo's all about.

          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !! 
 
I did not know anything about Rakugo, and when I went to see this anime surprised me a lot, I started to like Rakugo and I was looking on youtube about videos in Japan of people seeing Rakugo as much as I liked. 
 
(Story = 9,5/10) 
I like it a lot when you explore the past of a character who suffered with certain losses in life and how he got that way. And the way they explored was excellent, the story is very rich and captivating with their main characters who are: Bon and Shin. Rakugo was something very well presented to those who do not know and his presentation of Rakugo with the characters were very well directed, it was not boring, they were creative and very interesting and sometimes funny depending on the kind of story they told. In the dramatic moments they were very well consistent to the scene with each perspective of the character very well presented during the plot, with certain moments very sad, but very realistic within his narrative. A pity that did not present Yotaru very well, but this season was made to show more of Bon's past. 
 
(Characters = 10/10) 
 
I loved the characters of this anime, even though they were few, were very well developed. The dialogues during Bon and Shin were a lot of fun, it's cool the interaction between them, and they developed their relationship very well during the journey, which is very nice when they recognize the work and style of Rakugo of each one during the work and how they are perfecting the skills to make a better Rakugo. The conflicts they had with these characters were essential, with good messages of lives, often exciting. The Miyokichi was a character who had a good importance in the plot, focusing well on the main drama about this character, managed to convey well the emotions to the viewer during the scenes with her. 
 
(Art, Animation = 9/10) 
I loved the art, color palettes well selected, design of very well made characters. The background are very beautiful as are the used clothes. Now what struck me was how well used were some well-heeled Rakugo art scenes, also used in certain dramatic scenes to increase the weight of the scene. About the animation is very good and consistent but nothing spectacular. 
 
(Sound = 10/10) 
I love Jazz as in Baccano, and a well-done jazz like this is appreciated, it was very well used during the scenes of Rakugo that gave more immersion to the work, besides the fun moments that became very cool. During the dramatic scenes they used the violin and piano very well done, leaving the scene more dramatic still. The sound effects with the instruments of ancient Japan contributed much with the immersion experience. The dubbing was something that impressed me, they did an excellent dubbing, combined the voice with each character, and during Rakugo they managed to convey a sense that the story was real, with the voice acting of each person told during Rakugo. 
 
(Enjoyment = 9/10) 
Rakugo was a unique experience, I hoped it would be a rather dull journey with some interesting things, but good thing I was completely wrong, I loved the stories of each character and his conflicts, very well done, and had a lot of fun during Rakugo. Every aspect like sound, art, animation, direction contributed even more to the experience that was Rakugo. 
 
(Overall = 9,5/10) 
This show probably will not please everyone, but if you are looking for a work with a unique premise and a well made storrytelling with slower pace this work is for you. It lacked little to be masterpiece, I think that if it were a little more impacting would have my maximum score, I hope it in the 2 season will do it.

          
 
       Helpful Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn’t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is. 
 
Coming into the series, I had little knowledge about rakugo. It’s a form of Japanese art performed on stage using creative dialogues, expressions, and body language. Quite frankly, it’s very entertaining once you get the feel of it despite the performer being stationary. Most of the time, the performances involves a comical act that goes along with a story. Sometimes, the performer brings in drama and bittersweet emotions but the bottom line is that it’s described to entertain. That’s what this show has done: bringing entertainment in a rarity form. 
 
The story takes place around the 1970s. However, the show does a lot more background storytelling than what most viewers may be accustomed to. Thankfully, the series knows how to transit into the past to bring the story into the present. From the beginning, we meet Koji, a guy who got out of prison but later follows a goal to make himself into a professional rakugo performer. This sets up his encounter with Yakumo Yurakutei, a man who he looks up to and wants to learn from. After many exchanges and work, he does earn himself a spot as Yakumo’s student. This is where transition comes in and we take a look at the past. 
 
In essence the storytelling brings in a lot of relationship dynamics and characterization. The relationship between Yakumo and Sukeroku is a prominent example of this as we see their connection. Furthermore, the show makes us realize how different they are after examining their personalities. Yakumo is the stoic type with a cyclical personality and little intense of the opposite sex. Meanwhile, Sukeroku is just the opposite who often seeks girls in his life while maintain his hyperactive personality. Despite this, the two seems to get along as good friends and strives to become rakugo artists. There’s quite a difference in their performance skills though as we can easily see how much Sukeroku is better than Yakumo. Throughout the series, Yakumo struggles at first to make a name for himself but does manage to pick up the pace once he realizes it.  
 
At some point in the show, we should realize that Yakumo really strives to become an artist. This is evidenced by his lack of interest in Miyokichi, a beautiful geisha who seems to have quite an affection for him. However, they do connect in some ways. While romance isn’t a prominent part of the show, it does play a role as we can easily see some budding romance between the two. Furthermore, there’s also Sukeroku who seems to be smitten by Miyokichi. Get the picture? What this brings is how complex the trio’s relationship can be. Yakumo and Sukeroku has become close to the point that they almost seems like brothers. When Miyokichi enters the story, it almost feels like she’s a wall between the two. Meanwhile, Yakumo seems to only be in love with rakugo and strives to be better, something that he actually succeeds later on in the series. To say the least, love in this series is beyond dramatic and even has a tone of tragedy to it. I also find it amusing that the show mixes in some gender bender at one point to spice up the sexuality vibes. However, it’s mostly played down as a form of art to get viewers comfortable with the style of the show; in that being artistic with its storytelling. 
 
What I find very capitalizing about the show is the personalities of the characters. Yakumo seems to have a dual personality, one that’s stoic with his reserved behavior while other times behaves like a gentlemen to entertain the audience. On the other hand, Sukeroku is more like the guy who seems casual all the time and easy to make friends with. Miyokichi has perhaps the most complicated personality as she seems to want certain people like Yakumo but her motivations aren’t truly clear. Is she manipulative? Maybe. Is she fragile? In some ways, yes. Is she a bit too hopeless to be romantic? Who knows really. However, it should be noticeable that she realizes about Yakumo’s personal feelings and unfortunately, she isn’t really part of what he has in mind for. The show capitalizes on this emotional drama and later really makes a climax out of it, something that is very memorable. Later on, we’ll also see how other characters enters the show because of their tragic relationship. 
 
Despite the insightful storytelling and characterization, the rakugo performances are also quite entertaining. The first episode (being double length) gives good insight about what rakugo really is like with the style, body language, dialogues, and storytelling of the performer. Despite the performer being stationary, it’s fairly interesting to see how they act out each play. The stories themselves each contain a theme but always prominent characters that switches between tone and mannerism according to the story. While Yakumo and Sukeroku does differ a bit between their performances, it can easily be observed that the two strives to be the best at what they do. And that’s something really inspiring. 
 
DEEN actually puts on quite a decent effort into the artwork for this series. I’m honestly surprised but the visual quality is stellar. It’s also realistic to portray the 1970s with the backgrounds and simple structures. Furthermore, characters are dressed in the way that is believable. Between character designs, the rakugo performances is also an art in itself and the choreography for the show is really well delivered with clever camera angles. This is even enhanced by the creative body languages. Character expression is important and this show nailed the coffin in that not just on stage but also between character interactions in real life. From Miyokichi’s emotional breakdowns to Sukeroku’s joyful acting, it’s quite something to look at. 
 
Soundtrack has more of a Japanese feudal tone to it, like something from the past. It’s able to capture the feel of a performance with the character voice mannerisms. In addition, the show isn’t shy to deliver dynamic dialogues especially with characters like Miyokichi. The OP and ED songs also has an unique feel that adds more to the show. 
 
Ah how I wish this show could have lasted longer. But from what it’s worth, the series really attempted t do something refreshing and unique. It capitalized on every theme and way a story should be told and it damn well delivered. Characterization remains strong while we get realistic human emotions that is easily recognizable. From the clever delivery of the dialogues to powerful chemistry between characters, it’s a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.

I liked it so much I made a wiki for it in 2011 but sort of stalled on ep 10 
 
The fansubs that exist are nice and small and good for watching on low-res computers that can't handle all that 1080 stuff coming out nowadays. 
 
There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility. 
 
Pink for the woman is a little stereotypical following after Beast King GoLion (pretty sure Voltron preceded power rangers) but it's manageable.

          
 
       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

Hikaru's spoiled attitude irritates Naruto throughout the journey and the team quickly discovers how incredible Michiru's wealth is when he nonchalantly buys an entire circus for Hikaru because he wanted to befriend its star attractions, a saber-toothed cat named Chamū and its monkey partner Kiki. Hikaru's attempts to befriend Chamū ends badly with Chamū attacking him, forcing Naruto to rescue him.
When Michiru's caravan reaches the port that will take them back to the Land of the Moon, Michiru and Hikaru visit Michiru's ex-wife Amayo. Though Amayo is happy to see Hikaru, she dismisses Michiru's attempts to reform their marriage because of Michiru's materialistic perspective and the fact that he fails to understand ""what really matters."" During the ship ride to the Land of the Moon the ship gets caught in a storm and the crew in forced to secure the circus animals that were brought aboard Hikaru, bitter about Chamū's aggressive attitude towards him, becomes indifferent about the safety of the animals and Naruto expresses his disgust at his disregard for the animal's lives and his selfishness. Desiring to prove Naruto wrong, Hikaru assists in securing the animals and gets Chamū and Kiki to safety with Naruto's help. After the storm, Hikaru becomes friends with Chamū and Kiki and he and Naruto apologizes to each other and become friends as well.
When the ship reaches the Land of the Moon, everyone discovers the streets are empty and that Shabadaba, a greedy minister to the king of the Land of the Moon, Kakeru, has overthrown the king and seized control of the Land of the Moon. Shabadaba orders the kingdom's guards to kill Michiru and Hikaru, but they manage to escape with the help of Naruto and the others as well as guards still loyal to Michiru led by the captain of the Land of the Moon military, Korega. Korega takes the group to a refuge in the mountains where the meet Kakeru, who is mortally wounded, and Korega reveals Shabadaba had been planning his coup for a while and that Kakeru sent Michiru on the tour of the kingdoms to keep him out of danger. However, Shabadaba had hired three mercenary ninja to back him up and their leader, Ishidate, used a mysterious gauntlet to mortally wound Kakeru by turning his lower half into stone. Sakura is unable to treat the petrification because it can only be treated immediately after it happens and before dying, Kakeru tells Michiru that happiness and wealth are not the same and proclaims Michiru the King of the Land of the Moon.

Hikaru is heartbroken at his father's kidnapping, but Naruto encourages him to protect ""what really matters"" and the group rallies to save Michiru. Shabadaba decides to have Michiru executed by tying a noose around his neck and forcing him on board that can't support his large weight for long so when it snaps, Michiru will be hanged. Remembering his late father's words and finally realizing the error of his materialist ways, Michiru manages to hold out until the group tricks Shabadaba into letting them into the palace courtyard with the help of the circus Michiru bought and Kakashi launches a surprise attack along with the circus crew and Korega's men. Hikaru and Naruto sneak into the palace to rescue Michiru while Lee and Sakura fight and defeat both of Ishidate's underlings, Karenbana and Kongō. As Naruto battles Ishidate, the board holding up Michiru snaps and Michiru begins to hang, but Hikaru manages to save him by firing an arrow that cuts the rope. Naruto manages to overwhelm Ishidate at first, but the latter manages to petrify Naruto's leg and petrifies Shabadaba when he tries to get Ishidate to kill Michiru first. Michiru and Hikaru help Naruto fight Ishidate by carrying him so Naruto can attack with the Rasengan, which is further powered by the Land of the Moon's unique moonlight, and Naruto manages to kill both Ishidate and Shabadaba when the former is distracted by Chamū and Kiki. After the battle is over, Michiru thanks Naruto for helping him understand ""what really matters"" and both he and Hikaru promise never to forget what they learned.
In the aftermath of the battle, Kakashi's extreme exhaustion from overusing his Sharingan forces the team to stay at the Land of the Moon where they enjoy a vacation before they eventually leave to return home. After the team leaves Michiru reveals to Hikaru that he will try to reconcile with Amayo now that he understands ""what really matters.""

After the improvement of the second Naruto movie surely there is a chance for the next Naruto movies to get better right? WRONG!!! That chance I was hoping for got drop-kicked out of the window as soon as I saw this movie. This movie is TERRIBLE!! and now I will make a review on it to hopefully take out all of my stress I have obtained after my view of it. 
 
Story: (2/10) 
 
The story of Naruto movie 3 begins with Naruto, Sakura, Lee, and Kakashi walking towards their next assigned mission that is meant to escort a very rich man named Michiru Tsuki and Hikaru Tsuki all around the world but there will be a suprise waiting for them as soon as they get to the Moon Country. Ok, so first off imagine the story of the first movie and make it 2 times more stupid and the result you will get is this movie's story. The pacing of the movie is terrible, it moves at a snail's pace and it is worse during the early half of the movie and all this time is dedicated to the characters so we as the viewers can relate to them but they are all so unlikable that I just want to stab myself the whole time. In the middle part of the movie it introduces a new conflict that just seems comes out of nowhere and it totally feels like it is out of place because there is no buildup to it in the whole early half of the movie at all. The final fight scene of the movie is supposed to be really dramatic but I just found myself laughing the whole time it was on! I mean, really? A crescent moon rasengan? 
 
Art and Animation: (4/10) 
 
The art in the first half of the movie manages to stay good but when the later half of the movie begins the art just takes a nosedive in quality. The character designs look inconsistent all the time! The backgrounds don't look as good, and the special attack visuals don't look cool at all. The animation in the movie is the same as the art in quality. The bad animation starts to look really apparent during the final fights in the movie and I would even say that the animation from the anime is much better in comparison to this. 
 
Sound: (3/10) 
 
If you thought that the soundtrack for the first movie was generic and forgettable, wait until you hear the soundtrack to this movie. The only thing I liked about it was that after 2 other movies they finally put ""The Raising Fighting Spirit"" song into a Naruto movie. The voice actors did a fine job voicing the characters except for the person who voice acted for Hikaru because at moments his voice would seem off. 
 
Characters: (2/10) 
 
I would say that the characters are the worst part of the movie. Naruto is still his same stupid self and him being motivational when the time calls for it. Sakura's whole role in the movie is just to fight 1 out of the 3 villains and to punch Naruto and call him a baka for any stupid things he does. Lee is supposed to be the replacement for Sasuke because of how Sasuke left with Orochimaru in the later half of the anime. Lee barely contributes anything to the story to the point that Lee could have just been not in the movie at all and all he does in movie is to fight 1 out of the 3 villains. The sad thing about Lee is that on the page of this movie and in the characters & voice actors section he is called the supporting character. Michiru had the potential of being a good character with the conflict of him wanting to get his wife back but this is quickly pushed away. Then, we have Hikaru which to me is one of the reasons why I thought the movie was bad. In the early half of the movie he is just very unlikable with how he acts and I'm sure he cried at least 10 times in the movie and I know that he is a kid but I think that that is a little too many times for him to cry. He soon learns to have more courage in one of the conflicts he runs into in the early half of the movie but after that he quickly reverts back to being a cry baby even thought the situation he was in before could have been the death of him. Finally, we have the villains. These villains are the most one dimensional villains I have ever seen because they are very undeveloped due of how little backstory they are given and the only thing they care about causing chaos. 
 
Enjoyment: (2/10) 
 
The movie was just only 1 hour and 34 minutes of suffering. 
 
Overall: (2/10) 
 
Naruto Movie 3: Dai Koufun! Mikazuki Jima no Animaru Panikku Dattebayo! is a movie that could even be an insult to the fans of the anime and for everyone else it is a piece of trash and should be forgotten as fast as possible.          

          
 
       Helpful I watched the third Naruto film having watched the anime series. The first half hour was basically plotless, and when plot did develop it was unintresting. However, I would say this film was really saved by the art. 
 
The graphics in this film were outstanding for a Naruto production. I sometimes paused the movie just to look at the outside imagery of the sunset or whatnot, it really suprised me. The sound was also unexpectedly good, it wasn't the music used but more the way they used it, the timings were spot on and I liked when they paused the sound once in a while to create a dramatic effect. 
 
Another positive thing to mention was the fight scenes. I really enjoyed them, I liked the wide range of jutsu's and the quick movements, it made everything fast paced and exciting. You don't need good plot to have good action scenes and this film is an example of that. 
 
I guess, a part of me gave this a 7 because it had a lot Kakashi Hatake and I just love that man (I'm only human) so maybe I'm a little biased too. It's not a great movie by any means but it did manage to kill of some spare time.

       Helpful Naruto and the Crescent Conundrum reminded me a lot of the Pokemon movie Destiny Deoxys, both for its liberal use of CG and depth of its plot. Neither are very impressive films, but I did have a blast watching this one. This particular Naruto flick sets itself apart from the rest primarily with its look, but not much else. 
 
Crescendo Kingdom stood out in my memory among the Naruto movies I saw as a kid for its distinct visuals. Most notable are the breezy summertime outfits our main characters don for the adventure, but even more striking are the vivid color palettes and wicked cool action scenes. The motion is accentuated with ample distortion of character models, much like Naruto's fight against Pain in Shippuden. There seem to be fewer frames overall during these scenes, giving it an almost surreal look which may have been what made me think it was so cool as a young lad. 
 
Of course, this is a Studio Pierrot production, and that level of quality can NOT be maintained for long. A variety of cost saving measures are applied generously throughout the movie, to what I think is great effect. Digital effects are used on many otherwise boring shots to supply visual intrigue, sometimes by rotating cameras or by scrolling 2D backgrounds mapped onto 3D surfaces. I was tickled by the shameless CG incorporation, especially early in the movie. For a while I was convinced nobody at the studio could actually draw a horse, because every single horse and carriage in the caravan our characters follow is rendered from the same computer models. Strictly speaking, this probably looks bad, but it also facilitated sinking more money into those wicked cool action sequences. In short: THIS is how to most appropriately spend a Pierrot budget. 
 
If you've ever seen Naruto before you should know what to expect soundwise. Naruto still sounds like he smokes too much, and the soundtrack pretty well mirrors that of the show. Masuda-sensei knows how to get you pumped for ninja action with his mix of oriental blues jams and high energy dance music in the soundtrack. The music (Or lack thereof) is expertly tailored to enhance the mood of each scene, and I can't really find anything to nitpick in the audio overall. 
 
The movie character plot was not terrible, nor was it surprising or thought provoking. There were a couple of Naruto-centric moments that pulled at my heart strings (And elicited a few tears T^T), but there isn't a lot of substance overall. On the fan service front, Lee has one of THE MOST epic fights he's ever been in, and Sakura actually has an opportunity to be useful! Of course Naruto makes a special movie version Rasengan, and sadly Kakashi is pretty well sidelined after he rescues Sakura a couple times. I suppose our two movie protagonists, the prince and his son, are decently developed, but I didn't find them very compelling. The movie teases and implies a character arc for the prince, but doesn't show us any demonstrable growth based on his actions. On top of that I thought it was silly that his entire gag is that he was fat, but then I remembered Choji. We'll just leave that one be. 
 
You might enjoy Crescent Roll Crusaders if you're a longtime Naruto fan like myself, or just want to laugh at and critique anime production budgets in action. Even though this movie is not really good, I wish I would have seen it more as a kid, and as with Pokemon Heroes I think that's one of the highest praises I can give an anime.

These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

Mou Hitotsu no Sekai extra episode featuring Yue.,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Magic', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Shounen']","While looking for clues about his missing father Nagi, Negi Springfield becomes the English and homeroom teacher for Mahora Academy Class 2A (later 3A). Negi soon becomes acquainted with most of his new students including his roommates Asuna Kagurazaka and Konoka Konoe. Negi faces his first real challenge in his student Evangeline A.K. McDowell who is an immortal vampiress and one of his father's enemies. To help Negi confront Eva, Asuna agrees to become his temporary partner by performing a ""Pactio"", a kind of magical contract sealed with a kiss.
After dealing with Evangeline, Negi takes the class on a trip to Kyoto while searching for more information on his father's whereabouts but is forced to fight against Eastern mages aiming to kidnap Konoka with the help of other students who also become his partners including Nodoka Miyazaki, Konoka's childhood friend Setsuna Sakurazaki, and lastly with Konoka herself. The arc also introduces Fate Averruncus, another mage who looks to be around Negi's age but proves himself to be far stronger than him. Seeing his own weakness after the events in Kyoto, Negi begins to train with several students in order to become stronger while Kotaro Inugami, one of the foes he confronted there unexpectedly reappears and finds himself a family with Negi's students Natsumi and Chizuru. Kotaro also joins Negi against Wilheim, an old evil from the past who like Fate Averruncus, seems to be a pawn of an even stronger enemy.
During Mahora's cultural festival, Negi manages to partake in simultaneous events thanks to his student Chao Lingshen's latest invention, the time machine Casseopeia. One of these events is the ""Mahora Martial Arts Tournament"" where he confronts a series of increasingly stronger enemies including a former member of ""Ala Rubra"" (Crimson Wing), a legendary brigade led by his father. After the tournament, Negi takes part in more activities at the festival until Chao she reveals herself as a time-traveler who claims she must change the present to avert a great catastrophe in the future. Despite that, Negi and his allies confront Chao and stop her. After giving, Chao bids farewell before returning to her own time.
After the festival, Negi decides to go to the Mundus Magicus (Magic World) to look for his father. His partners decide to accompany him and together they form their own brigade, the Ala Alba (White Wing). They are joined by Negi's childhood friend Anya and accidentally by other students who are oblivious to his secret. As they arrive, the team is ambushed by a group of mysterious enemies led by Fate Averruncus, leaving Negi and his group defeated and scattered across Mundus Magicus. After meeting Jack Rakan, another member of Ala Rubra, Negi decides to train in order to become stronger and specializes in Dark Magic, like Evangeline. Meanwhile, Negi's lost companions start to learn the ropes of their new environment and eventually reunite with him.
During another clash with Fate and his companions, Asuna is captured by the enemy and held captive along with Anya, with a body double posing as the real Asuna. Later Negi has an encounter with Kurt G?del, a former member of Ala Rubra who reveals to him the story of his parents including how his mother was unjustly tried and sentenced to death before being saved by Nagi at the brink of her execution. He also learns that the Magic World is actually a magically created, inhabitable version of Mars, and just like the world itself, the majority of its inhabitants are created by magic. During another clash with Fate, Negi also learns that the main objective of his group ""Cosmo Entelecheia"" is to make use of Asuna's secret powers to erase the magically created inhabitants of Mundus Magicus and transfer the rest of its population to Earth before it eventually collapses.
By joining forces with the various armies of the Magic World, the members of Ala Alba storm Cosmo Entelecheia's stronghold where Asuna and Anya are being held captive, to stop their plans. During the confrontation a magic gate is opened to Earth just above Mahora, having Negi's remaining students who stayed behind along with the academy's faculty members joining the fight. After rescuing Asuna and convincing Fate to accept a plan to save the people of the Magic World without the need of any sacrifices, Negi discovers that the true leader of Cosmo Entelecheia is none other than his father Nagi, possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who vanishes after asking his son to look for him and release him once and for all.
After being celebrated as heroes for stopping Cosmo Entelecheia, Negi and his friends return to the academy, but instead of resuming his duties as a teacher, Negi leaves Fate as his substitute and with the help of some of his students he starts working on his plan to terraform Mars for the people of the decaying Magic World to relocate there. The plan involves sealing Asuna's body for one hundred years, and she bids farewell to Negi and the other students after she graduates from middle school. Waking up 30 years after the estimated time, Asuna finds that Negi's plan was a success and that Negi and all her classmates had happy and bountiful lives, but had long since died, all except for the immortal Evangeline, and Chao who exists in this time and has since invented a device to jump between realities. These two appear before Asuna to take her back to the present so she can live out her days with Negi and the others.","Esta review también está en espa?ol. 
 
At the time of this writing, this is (sadly) the latest animated incarnation that integrally adapts the Mahou Sensei Negima manga. As you can infer from the title, this OVA is about Yue and what happened to her after separating from the rest of the members of Ala Alba. Just like Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba and Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, this was created for the people who read the manga. Still, from the three OVAs sagas, this is definitely the more self conclusive, and if you are willing to take it as an elseworld, fans of the first two animes can watch it without much trouble. 
 
Story: After the incident in the Mundus Magicus's portal, Yue is transported and instantly broom-hit by Collet Farandole, a student at the Ariadne academy of magic. Yue ends losing her memory, and to keep an eye on her, she's accepted in the academy, where, with Collet help, she'll study to become a magic knight. During one class, the name Nagi Springfield is invoked, and Yue feels it have something to do with her past. But Nagi is not only a historical hero: right now, a young gladiator with the same name (and same appearance) is causing a great commotion in the annual Mundus Magicus's fighting tournament , whose final will be held in Ostia. And this last thing is important, cause the academy has a contest where the winners will travel as guardians of that event... 
 
Animation: Outstanding, like the other OVAs, though here the computer effects/drawing are a bit overused, especially in landscapes... They're well done, and maybe it's just a personal preference, but the two-dimensional drawings seem more beautiful. 
It sometimes happened with magic, too. 
And just a little detail, when a pactio card is activated, the transformation is similar to that of Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sound: Both the opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, which has the most comical animation of all the adaptations) and the ending (Good vibration!) are interpreted by the four Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily, and Beatrix. Both songs are very good, and the work of the seiyuus is impeccable, as we are used to these OVAs (and that's admirable, since the entire cast, with the exception of Yue's voice actor, are new to the series). 
 
Verdict: Yue fans, rejoice! This is more than you could have ever imagined, a special devoted entirely to the Blue Baka Ranger. Despite being just one chapter, I have to say it did the best job in this whole manga adaptation project: the story makes sense all the time, no sudden jumps between scenes, and although the end is open, the story itself (of this special) is completed (as opposed to Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, which sadly ends up in one of the very best moments of the manga). This is the only Negima OVA that i could recommend to fans of the first two animes, and not only to the manga readers. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you take it as an elseworld (which it isn't, since is part of the main story, but it could have been one), you can actually see it without much confusion (obviously there will be details that aren't gonna be understood, but the action in general can be appreciate). 
And the usual recommendation: If you didn't read the manga, then read it! It's one of the best things going on right now, if you don't mind the obscene amount of fan service in its early chapters (later... I wouldn't exactly say is attenuated, but certainly the focus of the series changes to the fights). 
-------- 
Al momento en que escribo esto, esta es (tristemente) la ultima encarnación animada que adapta de forma integra el manga de Mahou Sensei Negima. Como podrán deducir del título, este OVA trata sobre Yue y que fue lo que le paso después de separarse del resto de los miembros de Ala Alba. Al igual que con Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba y Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, esto está pensado para que lo vean las personas que leyeron el manga. Así y todo, de las tres sagas de OVAs, esta es decididamente la mas auto conclusiva, y si están dispuestos a tomarlo como un elseworld, los fans de los primeros animes pueden verlo sin muchos problemas. 
 
Historia: Luego del incidente en el portal de Mundus Magicus, Yue es transportada e instantáneamente atropellada por Collet Farandole, una estudiante de la academia de magia de Ariadne. Yue termina perdiendo la memoria, y para cuidarla, es aceptada en la academia, donde Collet la ayudara a estudiar y a convertirse en uno de los caballeros mágicos. Durante una clase, el nombre Nagi Springfield es invocado, y Yue siente que tiene algo que ver con su pasado. Pero Nagi no solo es un héroe histórico: en la actualidad, un joven gladiador con el mismo nombre (y misma apariencia) está causando estragos en el torneo de lucha anual de Mundus Magicus, cuya final se celebrara en Ostia. Y esto último es importante, porque la academia tiene un concurso en el que las ganadoras viajaran como guardianas de ese evento... 
 
Animación: Soberbia, al igual que las otras OVAs, aunque acá se abusa un poco de los paisajes hechos con computadora... Están bien hechos, y tal vez solo sea una preferencia personal, pero los dibujos en dos dimensiones me parecen más bonitos. En la magia también pasa esto.  
A modo de detalle, cuando se activa una carta pactio, la transformación es similar a la de Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sonido: Tanto el opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, que tiene la animación mas cómica de todas las adaptaciones) como el ending (Good vibration!!) son interpretados por las cuatro Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily y Beatrix. Las dos canciones son muy buenas, y el trabajo de las seiyuus es impecable, como estos OVAs nos tienen acostumbrados (y eso es admirable, dado que todo el cast, con la excepción de la vos de Yue, es nuevo en la serie). 
 
Veredicto: Fanáticos de Yue, regocíjense! Esto es más de lo que podrían haber podido imaginar, un especial dedicado íntegramente a  la Baka Ranger azul. A pesar de ser un solo capitulo, tengo que decir que es el que mejor adapta el manga: la historia tiene sentido en todo momento, no hay saltos bruscos entre escena y escena, y aunque el final queda abierto, la historia en si misma de este especial, es concluida (a diferencia de Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, que tristemente termina muy cerca del momento máximo del manga). Esto es tan así que es la única OVA de todas las lanzadas que podría recomendar a un fan de Negima que vio los primeros animes, pero no leyó el manga. Como dije al principio de esta review, si se lo toma como un elseworld, realmente puede verse sin mucha confusión (obvio que va a haber detalles que no se entienden, pero la acción en general puede apreciarse). 
Y la recomendación de siempre: si no leyeron el manga, léanlo. Es de lo mejor que hay dando vueltas en estos momentos, si no les molesta la cantidad obscena de fan service que hay en sus primeros capítulos (esto después... no voy a decir que se atenúa, pero decididamente el enfoque de la serie cambia hacia los combates).

3,1813,99,7.89890429,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Genshiken OVA,"It's the start of a new year for the Genshiken crew, and that means recruiting new members. Always a dreaded task, The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture manages to get Chika Ogiue pushed onto them from the Manga Club. With her introduction of ""I'm Ogiue and I hate otaku,"" this year certainly will be anything but boring. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Parody', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","This OVA links together the first and second season of the series and introduces the new members of the otaku circle known as Genshiken. It goes without saying that it's almost mandatory to have watched the first season prior to the OVA and while it isn't a catastrophe to skip it and just watch Genshiken 2 right away, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Not only because this is a direct continuation of the story. Moreso because it is pretty darn good; these three episodes are among the best entertainment that the series as a whole has to offer. 
 
Genshiken follows the daily lives of the members of a university-based club consisting mainly of otaku. They watch anime and read manga (Kujibiki Unbalance-related doujinshi mainly), play hentai games, put together Gundam models and visit the big fair known as ComiFes twice a year. Genshiken does not offer a quasi-philosophical storyline full of twists and riddles. There are some serious moments, but all in all we're talking pure, awesome comedy. 
 
New to the club is Ogiue Chika. For some reason, she jumped out the window from the university's manga club and the chairman suggested that she'd join Genshiken instead. The first thing she says when she enters the club room is that she absolutely hates otaku. However, it is soon revealed that her secret passion is drawing and reading yaoi and it's hard for her not to imagine indecent scenes starring the male members of the club. Every time her secret passion is talked about, she gets flustered and starts blathering incoherently in her Touhoku accent. Ogiue alone makes Genshiken OVA (and season two) worth watching. I love her. 
 
Another new member is Manabu Kuchiki. He made an apperance in the first season, but for some reason, he didn't join Genshiken. Kuchi, as he wants to be called, is one of the most crazy and whimsical characters I've ever encountered. In real life, I would hate him. However, together with Ogiue he adds a batch of randomness that the first season lacked and I can't help but love his frequent and crazy outbursts. 
 
Genshiken OVA isn't impressive audiovisually. The art and animation are decent but far from marvelous. This being a comedy anime, it doesn't matter that much, in my opinion. Same goes for the music: it fits the mood and is rather enjoyable. 
 
Genshiken's main strength is the characters and the two new members of the group add a lot of humour of the kind that the first season was lacking. The OVA is a great introduction to the second season and offers some of the best laughs I've ever experienced watching anime. Wathcing these three episodes of pure awesomness is an hour well spent.

          
 
       Helpful After the lofty standards set by Genshiken, I found the OVA's to be a big fat disappointment. The gulf in quality between the first series and the OVA was comparable to the difference between ""Seikai no Senki III"" and the rest of the Seikai no * franchise. I guess I should just be thankful that at least Genshiken OVA did not kill off its franchise like the way Seikai no Senki III did... 
 
What can possibly go wrong in 3 episodes of Genshiken, which had previously shown so much consistency in the first series? Quite a lot, apparently. 
 
The failings of the OVA's cannot be attributed to the lack of new content. In fact, the OVA contains the introduction of two new characters, both of which feature in ""Genshiken 2"", so skipping them isn't really an option if you intend to watch the second season.. Well, I say they introduce two new characters, but one of them is a returning character, and it's one that I would have preferred to see the back of, because he happens to be one of the most annoying characters in the first season who, thankfully, only appeared in one lone episode. His presence was fine enough in that one episodes, but having him as one of the regulars really tested my patience. 
 
The second character, Ogiue, is the more important one, because she is one of the central characters in ""Genshiken 2"". Her introduction isn't exactly the greatest, as she became a member of the society through some really contrived event. I don't really get the whole otaku hating part of her character either. But other than that, Ogiue does show some promising potential, and can probably be considered one of the few successes of the OVA, albeit a rather moderate one. 
 
The returning characters provide one of the main reasons why I found ""Genshiken OVA"" so disappointing - they were just all so different from the ones I knew and loved in ""Genshiken"". Kasukabe seem to have lost her edge and become tame. I know she was supposed to have mellowed slightly in the club, but still, the change is so large when measured against what she was like at the end of ""Genshiken"" that she barely feels like the same person. What Kasukabe lost, Ohno appear to have gained. In ""Genshiken"", she was a very timid character, only expressing enthusiasm where cosplay is involved. In the OVA however, she has become a lot more aggressive and confrontational, almost unrecognisable from the Ohno in ""Genshiken"". Even Madarame, while not changed too much, appear to be going back through old ground by mulling over the feelings that was already subtly hinted but dealt with during one episode in the original series. Though it was never fully resolved in that one episode, I always felt that its unresolved state was probably the best conclusion of all... but now they've gone and dug it up again needlessly just to make more of a meal of it. But some things are best left alone, especially since in the case of the OVA, this exercise of repeating what was already done doesn't exactly throw up any new conclusions. The subtlety in ""Genshiken"" was one of the reasons that made it so good, and it's a quality that is sorely missing from the OVA. 
 
And it's a feeling prevalent throughout that the OVA is a completely different beast from the series. Even on surface, the differences are clear from the style of the animation. In ""Genshiken"", the general feel of the art is suitably mundane for a slice of life, despite the odd moment where the SD (super deformity) effect is used. In the OVA however, the colours are brighter and everything seem more cartoony, more comical, with the feeling that the characters are more prone to suddenly go into SD mode. Being someone who likes his slice of life anime to be mundane, I preferred the old style. 
 
Just about the only point during which I felt the charm of the old ""Genshiken"" within this OVA is at the ""that's a definite fail!"" moment at end of the ""makeover"" episode. I'd watched the original series several years before I watched the OVA. With so much of the anime's feel modified, and most of the character consistency thrown right out of the window, it probably would have been enough to make me doubt my memory of the original series had I not rewatched it before the OVA. The worst thing is that, due to the OVA being an essential bridge between the two seasons of ""Genshiken"" as opposed to standalone stories, I can't even pretend it doesn't exist, so it's left as a permanent blemish on the franchise. 

          
 
       Helpful Genshiken OVA's are the continuations of the 1st Series.  
 
Story  
Story wise Genshiken is amazing but you can really say much because there are only three OVA's, but it&rsquo;s really the same awesomeness of the Genshiken series  
 
Sound 
The music is the same which give it a Familiar feel. The opening and ending are great giving it more of a feel like Genshiken. 
 
Art 
The Art is what really let these OVA down; the backgrounds are fine it&rsquo;s just the characters. After the great art we had with Genshiken I thought it would be just as great but it is a real let down the characters look really retarded and their expressions are even worse it looks like someone drew the characters in paint. 
 
Characters 
The characters are the same crazy otakus doing what they do best: be otaku. Some more characters are added and their lives continue.   
 
Enjoyment  
If the like Genshiken then you will like the OVAs. If you hoping for the same art then you will be disappointed. 
 
Overall  
You will like the Genshiken OVA's if you&rsquo;re a fan of Genshiken. It would be really hard not to like Genshiken unless you are a Shonen junky. You might find it hard to find the OVA's but you will find them eventually.

3,38889,100,7.848827468,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Kono Oto Tomare! 2nd Season,"The Tokise High School Koto Club has courageously pushed through their fractured and unsynchronized performance at the Kanto Region Traditional Japanese Music Festival. Clubmembers Chika Kudou, Satowa Houzuki, Takezou Kurata, Hiro Kurusu, Kouta Mizuhara, Saneyasu Adachi, and Michitaka Sakai are devastated to learn the negative results of their performance, leaving them crushed. Nonetheless, the group recognizes their potential and enthusiastically agree to collectively sharpen their skills, improve their flaws, and develop higher caliber playing to succeed in the upcoming national qualifiers in winter.  
 
With the help of their now willing club advisor Suzuka Takinami, the group's goal gradually becomes achievable as they begin to grasp the foundations of good music and refine their koto-playing abilities, with the suggestion of performing more often to gain what they lack most―experience.  
 
However, as their journey to nationals is underway, the koto club members face challenges that obstruct their focus and progress. Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","The story focuses on the Koto club of the Tokise High School in Kanagawa Prefecture. Takezo Kurata, in his second year, is the only member left in the Koto club, after all the senior members have graduated. While he is trying his best to recruit more members into the club, Chika Kudo submits his application. But, since Kudo is known to be a delinquent, one who destroyed his own grandfather's koto shop, Takezo is apprehensive about him. Things change when he discovers the truth. Also joining the club is the Koto prodigy, Satowa Hozuki, who has her own agenda. More members join the club in time, holding their own reasons for joining. However, in the end, they all have the same goal - to play at the Koto Nationals competition.
","2019 has been a blessing for musical anime, not so much on the Idol side of things, but purely on the sensational rides of emotional feels. With the introduction of Kono Oto Tomare's 1st cour in Spring to set up for the lesser of things, then in Summer, Given's Shoujo-ai outclassed adaptation of a masterpiece, and then back towards this series' 2nd cour to finish up the race that has been built up from the 1st half. And I'd have to say that the experience is totally worth it from start to finish, I can still readily and heartily give this a 10/10 just like the 1st half for the same exact reasons it hooked me in the first place: the musical scores of the Koto and its players' many diverse skills that create lasting impact in tears. 
 
The series overall had such a good story plot and better characters for the lack of namesake, NOT a single character is there for comedic relief nor just there for placement reasons, everyone works together as a team, even in the most insignificant of changes and at times being the weakest link, just as implied in this quote by Henry Ford: ""Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success."" 
 
Assuming that you haven't watched Season 1, the story in a recap is about the Tokise High School Koto Club, on the verge of collapsing after seniors failed to make results. Takezou Kurata, the only member left, has to recruit members for the sake of keeping the club alive, while Chika Kudou, the delinquent grandson of a prolific Koto maker, and Koto prodigy Satowa Houzuki, who was exiled from her family due to fear and repulsion from family members, both come into terms with their suffering and atoned for their sins to understand their anthem of the heart for what they do and the inspiration of playing the Koto. Along with Takezou's bitchy classmate Hiro Kurusu and Chika's band of ""The Three Stooges"" friends, the 1st cour takes them to Preliminaries to see where they stood with rival schools and improvements are definitely on the wall (not to mention the romance ""ship"" between Chika and Hozuki which grows stronger overtime, along with Kirisu's contending crush towards Takezou). 
 
If that was Season 1, you're definitely NOT prepared for what Season 2 has in store for you, as it takes what Season 1 has laid the foundation with, and gradually refines with the club's failure in making a stand-out dent in the Preliminaries, as a stepping stone for the Nationals to proceed within the upcoming span of months. Suzuka Takinami, the Koto Club's relenting ""failure preacher"" of an advisor suddenly sees the improvement in them, but with the Nationals requiring a whole different set of high-standard caliber, he adopts someone whom Hozuki knows that infers the bad blood of family relations further: former middle school rival and current Hozuki Family heir Akira Doujima. Slowly and surely, the relations of both Hozuki and Akira worsen from the get-go due to how much complacency that Hozuki's excommunicated mom and manipulative grandmother have cast a dark shadow within each other's lives. Even to the point that the current situation of the Koto Club has to be on the upper echelons of unrealistic expectations set by Akira, to which Takezou knows that with the lesser of experiences they had, it was a tough uphill race to improve, reflect and practice like hell. But practice they did, and to an extent, Hozuki opened up Akira's heart to see the majesty of playing the Koto while the tightening-down of skills and expertise are still required as focus for the Nationals, for the sole purpose of one aim: to give their best and perform admirably. 
 
To summarize, the 2nd cour had better pacing than the 1st cour, along with the intense character drama, mostly between the rival schools that have made their mark and strive to be better than before, all in the purpose for reconciliation and reformed hearts of determination. 
 
As I've said in my 1st Cour review, this series has been studio Platinum Vision's Magnum Opus of a production, but to think that the 2nd Cour has managed to improve and refine on what the 1st Cour lacked, is a tremendous improvement on its own. Kono Oto Tomare would forever be anchored as the ""Platinum"" status that the studio has ever achieved, it's vision being so remarkable with loopholes from the get-go and what has been done here is nothing short of impressive. The highly detailed light-shaded visuals got significant upgrades that hid the lesser of the animations in this 2nd half, and it's a delight to have the improvement needed. 
 
The music itself is a WHOLE OTHER ballgame, as the Koto pieces get more rich-sounding but skillfully hard in technique, the combination of the two brings a whole new world in the music that plays and for every musical piece, it just brings nothing but feels, emotions and most importantly, teas of joy. I cannot emphasize enough that the music in Kono Oto Tomare has always been its valiant strength of why we say that ""music is the universal language of mankind"". If nothing touches music, nothing ever will, and in this case, emits that music to great effect. Same goes with the OST, with Shouta Aoi and Yuuma Uchida's respectively new OP and ED, both are equally as great songs as the 1st Cour, I'd say that while I liked the former OP more than the latter, its ED is infinitely better than the former, so much that I love it on repeat.  
 
The music genre has its fair share of good and bad anime, but I'd must say that Kono Oto Tomare as a series overall is just splendid, bar none. Instant recommendation for music lovers and those of the (lesser) romance and completely Shounen aesthetics. 
 
I sincerely can't praise this series enough, truly one of the best anime of 2019 that's no AOTS, but rather, a dark horse for the year.

          
 
       Helpful 2019 has been a blessing for musical anime, not so much on the Idol side of things, but purely on the sensational rides of emotional feels. With the introduction of Kono Oto Tomare's 1st cour in Spring to set up for the lesser of things, then in Summer, Given's Shoujo-ai outclassed adaptation of a masterpiece, and then back towards this series' 2nd cour to finish up the race that has been built up from the 1st half. And I'd have to say that the experience is totally worth it from start to finish, I can still readily and heartily give this a 10/10 just like the 1st half for the same exact reasons it hooked me in the first place: the musical scores of the Koto and its players' many diverse skills that create lasting impact in tears. 
 
The series overall had such a good story plot and better characters for the lack of namesake, NOT a single character is there for comedic relief nor just there for placement reasons, everyone works together as a team, even in the most insignificant of changes and at times being the weakest link, just as implied in this quote by Henry Ford: ""Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success."" 
 
Assuming that you haven't watched Season 1, the story in a recap is about the Tokise High School Koto Club, on the verge of collapsing after seniors failed to make results. Takezou Kurata, the only member left, has to recruit members for the sake of keeping the club alive, while Chika Kudou, the delinquent grandson of a prolific Koto maker, and Koto prodigy Satowa Houzuki, who was exiled from her family due to fear and repulsion from family members, both come into terms with their suffering and atoned for their sins to understand their anthem of the heart for what they do and the inspiration of playing the Koto. Along with Takezou's bitchy classmate Hiro Kurusu and Chika's band of ""The Three Stooges"" friends, the 1st cour takes them to Preliminaries to see where they stood with rival schools and improvements are definitely on the wall (not to mention the romance ""ship"" between Chika and Hozuki which grows stronger overtime, along with Kirisu's contending crush towards Takezou). 
 
If that was Season 1, you're definitely NOT prepared for what Season 2 has in store for you, as it takes what Season 1 has laid the foundation with, and gradually refines with the club's failure in making a stand-out dent in the Preliminaries, as a stepping stone for the Nationals to proceed within the upcoming span of months. Suzuka Takinami, the Koto Club's relenting ""failure preacher"" of an advisor suddenly sees the improvement in them, but with the Nationals requiring a whole different set of high-standard caliber, he adopts someone whom Hozuki knows that infers the bad blood of family relations further: former middle school rival and current Hozuki Family heir Akira Doujima. Slowly and surely, the relations of both Hozuki and Akira worsen from the get-go due to how much complacency that Hozuki's excommunicated mom and manipulative grandmother have cast a dark shadow within each other's lives. Even to the point that the current situation of the Koto Club has to be on the upper echelons of unrealistic expectations set by Akira, to which Takezou knows that with the lesser of experiences they had, it was a tough uphill race to improve, reflect and practice like hell. But practice they did, and to an extent, Hozuki opened up Akira's heart to see the majesty of playing the Koto while the tightening-down of skills and expertise are still required as focus for the Nationals, for the sole purpose of one aim: to give their best and perform admirably. 
 
To summarize, the 2nd cour had better pacing than the 1st cour, along with the intense character drama, mostly between the rival schools that have made their mark and strive to be better than before, all in the purpose for reconciliation and reformed hearts of determination. 
 
As I've said in my 1st Cour review, this series has been studio Platinum Vision's Magnum Opus of a production, but to think that the 2nd Cour has managed to improve and refine on what the 1st Cour lacked, is a tremendous improvement on its own. Kono Oto Tomare would forever be anchored as the ""Platinum"" status that the studio has ever achieved, it's vision being so remarkable with loopholes from the get-go and what has been done here is nothing short of impressive. The highly detailed light-shaded visuals got significant upgrades that hid the lesser of the animations in this 2nd half, and it's a delight to have the improvement needed. 
 
The music itself is a WHOLE OTHER ballgame, as the Koto pieces get more rich-sounding but skillfully hard in technique, the combination of the two brings a whole new world in the music that plays and for every musical piece, it just brings nothing but feels, emotions and most importantly, teas of joy. I cannot emphasize enough that the music in Kono Oto Tomare has always been its valiant strength of why we say that ""music is the universal language of mankind"". If nothing touches music, nothing ever will, and in this case, emits that music to great effect. Same goes with the OST, with Shouta Aoi and Yuuma Uchida's respectively new OP and ED, both are equally as great songs as the 1st Cour, I'd say that while I liked the former OP more than the latter, its ED is infinitely better than the former, so much that I love it on repeat.

       Helpful In short if you liked the first season and rated it 7-10 you will forsure want to watch this season. 
 
You're probaly here after watching the first season which was amazing, kono oto tomare 2nd season will continue with that casual romance theme with the ""sports/music"" while adding an extra crisp with the small alone times with each character.  
 
Story:8 
The story is pretty much flawless but keeps out a few characters backstory which could be good for some people who prefer the main story more than the side stories. The story gets its 8 from the indepth in detail with the main characters and having a straightup goal to make the viewer kindof expect what is going to happen 
 
Art:8 
The background is less thought of and is lesser detailed than the characters making it slightly unbalanced esspecially when characters are upclose 
 
Sound:9 
Some animes songs just catch the ear. I myself don't enjoy most music animes because of the terrible cheap sounds but this one did well! 
 
Character:9 
Very good detail in characters aswell as stories connected to the most of the characters. 
 
Enjoyment:8-9 
After watching the first season of kono oto tomare you will realise there is no real ""Boring episode or two"" in the anime which is usually a case for animes in my case making me leave them half watched due to boredom. 
 
Overall:8 
Worth to watch season if you liked the first one.  
 
Extra: 
This is like many school sports animes but just has a different vibe to it making it good.

","Well I started watching Urahara because of the art style and animation and I had high hopes for it so I kept watching it.  
 
Well honestly the anime didn't reach my expectations and you need to be really patient for the plot twist that occur throughout the series. It follows the normal trend about magic girl's anime and I recommend you to watch it if you enjoy those types of anime with moe design. The art and animations is pretty good and I found it unique from the anime I have watch, but the characters and story seem typical and I personally couldn't like the characters that much. It has some good points with the story and art design but I couldn't enjoy it that well.

       Helpful This synopsis gave me same feeling as Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and that is the only reason i started watching this. I was not wrong. 
 
Story: Nothing is explained, you are completely lost,no plot, nothing just girls doing random stuff thinking its cute, AND IT ISN'T DAMN DANIEL. 
 
Art: I will probably get epilepsy till the end of this show. It feels like they didn't even try to make it look nice, it was like fu*k it, lets just make some bad art cause we know from this synopsys its gonna be retarded.So we can maybe go intro history defeating Yoshiteru Satoru masterpieces. 
 
Characters: Now this is what makes this show bad, i don't even know what to say to these characters, probably writter didn't know himself what to do so he just randomly put girls that eat whole day and do stupid things. 
 
Sound: This is only thing that is good in this show and i meant good compared to other aspects of this anime. 
 
Enjoyment: This is torture, not a single thing of enjoyment, i keep watching this show only cause im not the type that drop shows, just a few. 
 
Overall: Honestly i feel bad for the writter that will get roasted cause of this show, combined with all that was in this show it got its max with overall 4

          
 
       Helpful I honestly have no idea why I stuck on watching this, knowing that the 3 episode guideline has already broke down since Episode 1, and am feeling like now's a good time to drop this travesty of an abomination. 
 
Story: 
Have you watched Akiba's Trip The Animation? (Spring 2017 season) 
 
Take that, add the CGDCT moe factor with the sugar, spice and everything nice, you'll get Urahara. One obvious thing to get out of the way, there is ABSOLUTELY no originality towards the storytelling (well, aside from what the creators intend to do anyways). 
 
Characters: 
Moe girls? Check. 
Insane amounts of food just to get their attention? Check. 
Having a fried ebi as your Master? Check. 
BUT YET, somehow the characters are easy but also difficult to understand at the same time. Unappealing (don't say appalling) and uninteresting, nothing much to say about the cast. 
 
Art/Animation: 
If there's a good thing about this show, EMT Squared has envisioned the help of the studio Shirogumi with its art and visual designs to help along with the animation, and I gotta say that the environment of Harajuku is made within a 3D space that looks lush and watchable. Even during boss fights with the Scoopers, when they burst after defeat, candy starts to form from the waste, so you know where the focus lies in its attention to detail. 
 
Sound: 
The OST ends up being decent at best (aside from the cheesy OP which is by far the best for the show), and they were made like ""you know, we have to input this to get our desired result"" and such nonsense. 
 
Verdict (after Ep 4): 
Need I say more? Even with the good looking art and decent sound, the story just outright EPIC FAILs for me, because what I got out of this show is nothing but the feeling of watching another clone Akiba's Trip (of which the former was WAY better), and just wasting close to an hour's time watching this and catching up with other promising shows this season.

In an attempt at species integration, normal children begin attending school with paranormal creatures who are quite humanoid. Shingo Ohashi finds himself developing feelings for Hatoko ""Petoko"" Fujimura, a half-youkai half-human girl whose powers are: uncontrollable cuteness to enchant those around her (similar to a low-power succubus), get stuck to any other person who touches her bare flesh (cured by her falling asleep), and the ability to disappear even at the molecular stage (which she can for the most part control). 
 
(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Romance', 'School']",none,"Petopeto-san... a short and quirky 13 episode series about the racial divide that's prevalent in a society with youkai (monsters) and ningen (humans). Think Kamichu! without the god, but with the same age of the characters dealing with everyday problems. 
 
Animation: The budget for this anime wasn't very high, and it shows. Some panning here and there, and low framerates of some of the scenes make me dock 2 points off. It's not BAD, per se, but the animation could've been done a lot better. Episode 10-11 suffered a lapse in character design consistency, as all their faces look distorted. Great backgrounds though, and the last episode brought the animation up a notch. 
 
Sound: Brilliant opening/ending combo. When I first heard the opening, it sounded very hoary, but it gradually sticks on to you. The ending song is a peaceful ballad sung by the same singer as the opening, and fits the theme well. Sprinkled background music throughout, and a great use of enka (old style music) to convey a feeling of poverty for the Fujimura family. All in all, music added to the experience, and didn't distract from it. 
 
Story: A great start with a slice of life opening and a brief explanation of the world Shingo and Petoko lives in. The first episode might seem ecchi, but it's actually a very innocent show. The Little Sister Heaven ruined the story though, since it brought the anime off focus and into the bizarre. Satisfying ending that gives to open interpretation and goes back to the story's monster racism roots. 
 
Character: The characters made this show. From the monsters Petoko, Jeremy, Sekiya, Kugugu and Chochomaru, along with the humans Shingo, Yuri-sensei, Petoko's father, all of them were very memorable. YUG's character designs shine here, and they're all drawn very distinctively. Petoko is a ero-ero monster, and Kuguru and her sister are Kappas. Sekiya is an undead samurai, and Jeremy is a faceless monster. A bizarre cast, but one that meshes very well. 
 
Value/Enjoyment: Petopeto-san is a good short anime series which caters to the moe crowd. (Note the awesomely cute designs of the concrete sisters, Konuri and Nuci-chan). There's also a little romance sprinkled in, so fans of that genre will find what they like here. I also enjoyed this anime tremendously, having fansubbed its entirety.

       Helpful I usually never watch specials since they are mostly fillers, but depends. This one is kinda weird, captains and guests get asked questions about certain parts of the anime. It was kind of a reminder of the previous parts that took place before.  
Nothing special, but the ending was really nice. Loved the characters breaking the 4th wall as if the creators / studio was talking to the viewers.  
 
Other than that, there's nothing of much interest other than silly questions and moments. Unless you want to attend the quiz yourself or something.

art:some songs are sad(country/slight pop/some classical/ mostly opera, grabs tissue). While some are angry(heavy metal, some rock). This being what i saw as comecial matched the song. You have a goofy main character and his somewhat wacky antics. Not only are you getting some listening pleasure but a small show worth watching. Which is mostly why this got a 6 for me. If you can make a song slightly better with video you have done your job on the music video. Take Mc Hammer of example. good songs but his video ""can't touch this"" was superb!.

       Helpful To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Aruite Mikka. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also GlassesBoi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Aruite Mikka truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in GlassesBoi's existential catchphrase “Ochinchin sugoi desu,” which itself is a geniusly outplanned reference to humanitys downfall. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as i touch myself with GlassesBoi in thought... What fools.. how I pity them. ?? 
 
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Aruite Mikka tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ??

","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around. 
 
(Source: aestheticism.com)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Shounen Ai']","The story focuses on comedy, primarily the wacky adventures of Patalliro himself and the entire kingdom of Malynera.
","Writing: I really enjoyed the shounen-ai and espionage aspects. However, any part of the comedy mostly fell flat for me. I think this show might be too old and Japanese for me to fully appreciate. There are some parts that legitimately made me lol out of sheer WTF. The shounen-ai aspects are bizarre and fascinating when considering the context of the show. 
 
Characters: The part of this show I disliked the most is the titular character. Which is extremely problematic, as he takes up most of the show's screen time and focus. Maybe this is a result of my expectations, but I would have much preferred that Bancoran and Maraich be the main focus of the show. 
 
Art/Animation: This is where this show gets the most points from me. I really enjoyed the bright color palette and some of the psychedelic imagery. I can definitely see how this show might have influenced other Shoujo like Sailor Moon in this regard. I also really loved the character designs. It's obviously influenced by ukiyo-e or kabuki-style aesthetics. The visuals were striking enough to keep me watching as long as I did, but not enough to save this show from forgettable mediocrity. 
 
Music/Sound: Nothing really worth mentioning in this department. Nothing stood out at all, either in a bad or good light. Has an OST that is extremely dated, but also charming in an incredibly old-fashioned anime kind of way. 
 
Overall this show is frustrating because I want it to be better than it actually is. It's interesting enough for it's unique art style and it's history as being the first shounen-ai anime on television. But beyond that it doesn't have much else to offer. The main character is irritating and really detracts from what would otherwise be a 7/10 shounen-ai spy show. I give this show a 6/10, closer to a 5 than a 7. 
 
Tl;Dr Not worth anyone's time unless you're interested in this show for it's art and/or history. I can't understand this show in the context of the fucking annoying kid being the main character. Honestly kind of a guilty pleasure for me and it's surprising I watched as many episodes as I did.

          
 
       Helpful I will forever recommend this to anyone who is into a good laugh, pretty boys, has a long hair fetish or wants to have some good fun with something easy to watch. 
 
You might look at the year it has first aired, the episode count and the fact that it has shounen-ai listed as a genre and think this is not a show for you. To be honest, I had the exact same thoughts when I first discovered it. I haven't really watched old anime (at that time I think the oldest series in my list was Sailor Moon) but I wanted to give it a try, and stumbling upon Patalliro! I decided to give it a chance and let me tell you, I was hooked in by the time I finished the first episode and I binge watched all the episodes available. 
 
Patarillo! is essentially about a ten year old boy, Patalliro, who happens to be the monarch of a very rich kingdom, Marinera, a major producer of diamonds. The conflict is triggered by the involvement of the Diamond Syndicate, a criminal organisations that wants to control the entire diamond supply of the world, a goal to which Patalliro does not comply with. Mix in a very handsome, eye shadow wearing, MI6 agent that has the power to seduce pretty boys with his eyes and their adventure begins.  
 
Of course, Patalliro! isn't all about a kid and a gay agent running around trying not to get themselves killed by some shady organisation, but so much more. We have time travelling and fortune tellers and cursed diamonds from the Middle East and so much more. What makes this show so great is the fact that Maya Mineo combined all of this so perfectly and so fluidly that despite its randomness, the show manages to stay constant and not lose its seriousness when it is needed. Patalliro as a character is a joke and you can see that with all of the tasteless puns he makes, all the random costumes he pulls out at the worst times and his memorable cock Robin dance. He simply drives everyone crazy with his randomness and apparent stupidity, so much that you wish someone'll punch him (it happens eventually, don't worry) but all this gives the show great comedic value and makes it enjoyable. 
 
Now, the gay is there and it is not subtle at all. Major Bancoran is gay, Patalliro weirdly tries to flirt with him and each episode features an amazingly good looking boy that either falls for the agent or crosses paths with a solitary MC. This might make you cringe or satisfy you, depending what you're into. A great thing about the gay themes this show has it that it can be easily taken as a joke or as an extremely serious topic. What I advise you is to try and overlook it when starting to watch Patalliro. Just forget it's even there if it bothers you, and eventually, when it happens, it will seem pretty humorous and natural. 
 
I'd now like to point out some aspects I did enjoy about Patalliro and some that I think the average watcher might not. 
 
The good: Great humor. Amazingly pretty boys with great hair. Fast paced story with very few boring parts or episodes. Gorgeous backgrounds and scenery. Great voice acting and catchy music (even nostalgic at times). Gays. 
 
The bad: The animation and character design is very odd, and not odd like oh this is 80's anime what do you expect, but like, truly odd with amazingly cringy profiles and extra sparkly eyes, but you'll eventually get used to it.  
You can't find the whole series with English subtitles (I presume it has to do with the lack of popularity it has).  
The presence of gay characters and themes might not be for everyone. 
 
I'd say go watch it and see for yourself.

          
 
       Helpful Mineo Maya's PATALLIRO, about the adventures of a young but hyperactive monarch, is one of the longest-running manga comics in history, having started in 1978. The series, released in 1982, adapts only a few of the adventures of the comic, but captures fully their psychedelic and vibrant tone.  
 
The show has a surreal blend of drama and humour, to the point where debate is on about whether it's a comedy or espionage series. I would call it the former, since the show belongs to Patalliro. There is danger, drama, intrigue... and then Patalliro, this chubby goblin- like infant, drops in like a spanner in the works, shocking and exasperating all around him. It could appear jarring and jerky, but Maya possesses wonderful comic timing: whenever Patalliro appears he makes sparks fly and laughs flow. However, Maya also gives him dramatic stories where he reveals his great heart and wisdom. Indeed, Patalliro is the heart and soul of the story; without him it would most probably feel very generic.  
 
The show also boasts a wonderfully baroque aesthetic, featuring wonderfully ornate and elegant designs, as well as a rich instrumental score. This aesthetic includes bishonen (boys with feminine looks); in fact, the show is one of the first ever to introduce bishonen. Thus there is a wide cast of men with female characteristics, a gallery of scenes filled with roses and love, and some implied coitus scenes... It's tastefully done though and for the most part it only serves to accentuate the uniqueness and surrealism of the show.  
 
It's definitely a unique piece of work. Beautiful, bizarre and berserker-level funny. It's a must for an anime fan.

This movie will bring you love, respect, life, music, soul, frustration and the inevitable death.  
 
Overall all I have left to say is 
-10/10-

          
 
       Helpful Afro-Ken is certainly a weird little OVA; it's not really about anything in particular, and yet still manages to be entertaining. Based on a line of toys by the people who brought you Hello Kitty, Afro-Ken is about a cute dog with an afro and all of his friends, most of whom are also cute dogs with afros. The &quot;story&quot; introduces the different dogs and features silly little elements of their lives... and that's it. It's not really a story at all, but it does what it needs to do: look cute and advertise toys. 
 
And look cute and advertise toys it does. Afro-Ken covers dozens of unique character designs, but features little else in the way of characterization. On that note is the way these characters appear: the entire OVA is done in 3-D, but rather than going for a more realistic look, the animators appropriately chose a simplistic, silly style. While not particularly remarkable, (the movement of the dogs is often choppy) again, it does what it has to. 
 
That's not to say that Afro-Ken is without it's merits. The first lies in the music: the one prominent song (used for both the opening and closing) is fun and extremely catchy, with silly lyrics such as &quot;there is a dog with a big afro / that follows me around wherever I go / my daddy says it don't exist / but I can see it in the sky and even in my rice bowl dish&quot;. You gotta love it. 
 
The other good point of Afro-Ken? It is dang fun. You can't help but crack up at the jokes or &quot;awww&quot; at the cute little dogs with crazy hairstyles and their antics (my personal favorite is probably Afro-Ken swimming across a photo of the Statue of Liberty). As a matter of fact, this is one of the only anime that my three siblings and I all enjoyed, and it left us all wanting Afro-Kens of our own. It's certainly a pointless experience, but it's one of those shows that satisfies your need for the bizarre and the cute all at once, without confusing you or making you feel like you need more. And at one episode of less than thirty minutes, how can you deprive yourself of that?

          
 
       Helpful One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

Can Azuma be any help to her? Why is his relationship with Saijo in such turmoil? The story combines little everyday problems and joys with an adventure that is out of this world.
","To keep this review short, the anime is very average. The story two kids, Saijou and Azuma, who get into a fight because Azuma wants to quit baseball. A Typhoon that's about to hit and there's this girl who says the only way to have the world ""reborn"" is by becoming a pillar. You can figure out the rest of the story. There's nothing deep or sentimental about this anime whatsoever.  
 
MAL said to write a longer review so instead I'm going to recommend an anime. If you want something about natural disasters and a way better story/plot/overall anime in general, watch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Plus it's only 11 and not only 27 minutes. Honestly, I feel like they could've done more with this concept. Maybe more backstory on Saijou and Azuma. Episodes about when they were kids, playing baseball, and about Noruda (the girl, if you didn't know by now) and her past. 

          
 
       Helpful I think the main issue about this movie is the length. The Story and the characters fell really flat. The only way this could've been solved is by explaining everything in more detail which would only be possible if the movie were longer. The characters weren't actually introduced, also there wasn't any backstory to it. 
 
Another thing to mention is that the voice actors were kinda bad. 
The voices were nice to listen to but there was no energy behind them. Exclamations and moaning and things like that simply sounded extremely ""weak"". 
 
The Sound was a little underwhelming, 
the BGmusic pretty nice expect that it also felt kind of ""weak"". 
 
Visually it was good, though nothing too special. 
 
The only reason for me to watch this was because I like the band that made the song for the ED. 
Not sure if I can recommend watching this but I don't regret watching it either.

OK lets keep this pretty quick and straightforward. 
1st of all i wanna touch on the story side of things, i neither like it or dislike it ,it's a rushed 30 minute movie i treated it more like an OVA ,which it basically is. 
There is a story but its so short there no point on me talking about it ,the synopsis itself tells u most of what's going on. 
 
-Its visual appeal was really good ,i enjoyed the animation thoroughly. 
-The sounds, ost's and what not ,are very appealing and fit that.. let's call it setting. 
-Characters well they are pretty lovable even within that short 30 minutes ,but i got nothing furthermore to add to that. 
 
To be honest just watch it, its 30 minutes it's a great animation overall ,just kick back grab a drink and watch it. 
 
If you managed to read this all.. well i appreciate that thanks, much love

To complicate the situation, Class 2-D challenges class 2-C once again and there's a rumor floating around that Harima and Yakumo are dating as the school prepares for the cultural festival. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","School Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.
Although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.
School Rumble Z, the ""parallel comedy"", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from Max or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.","School Rumble is what I believe we all wish our High School lives would be like. The eccentric characters and even weirder plot twists are very funny and leave much for the mind to crave. The weird love relationships in this story keep you clicking episode after episode, hoping they find a resolve to their romance, but I'm sorry to tell you this people, there's no happy ending. 
*SPOILER ALERT* 
After the first season, you think they have found a resolution, but no they didn't, although funny (and literally out of this world) its just a hallucination. Then once you get to the second season, even more confusion arises, especially towards the ending (again). 
Let's put it this way, if you are one of those people who watch anime because of it's length then watch this. If your one of those people who watch for its great plot and definite ending (and I stress this enough) don't watch this. Even the OVA kind of ticked me off because it jumps off nowhere and leaves me lost. 
 
Overall I give this anime an 7.5/10, only because of the ending...stupid ending!

          
 
       Helpful School Rumble Ni Gakki, along with its predecessor, is a school/comedy/romance anime adapted from Jin Kobayashi's manga of the same name. It continues the story of a group a students from Yagami High School who learn the ups and downs of life and love, in front of a humorous comedic backdrop. 
 
Story: Compared to the first season, the story starts off slowly with a bunch shorter stories that don't seem to develop the overall plot as much. It isn't until the mid to second half of the anime does it seem to really get back to the main storyline. The story is mainly about the characters chasing after the people they are in love with only to have their attempts fail leaving them to come up with another angle of attack (metaphorically). This anime is a nice follow-up to the first season and overall it continues the plot well. 
 
Animation: Like most anime comedies, there are a lot of visual jokes, so being well animated is quite important. Studio Comet does a good job fortunately and the visual humor comes across quite nicely. Some of the funniest moments I can recall come from the character Harima's reaction to certain things and situations. 
 
Sound: Nothing much to say on sound. The seiyuu do a good job and the music fits the anime overall. I like the opening and endings. 
 
Characters: In most romance/comedies and in this one as well, there are multiple love webs that exist and are the main motivations for the characters. In the first season of this anime, most of the focus is on the protagonists, Harima and Tenma. However, in the second season the scope seems to widen and greater focus is given to other characters which seemed to have a smaller role in the previous season. I like this expansion, as it makes the plot more complex and intricate. 
 
Enjoyment: School Rumble's (both the first season and the second) use of random, sometimes absurd comedy and good utilization of the parody help it to stand out in its genre and create many memorable moments. I dub this show a must see for comedy fans. This was one anime where I basically enjoyed every moment.

          
 
       Helpful Since i did a review for School Rumble Ichi Gakki (1st semester), I thought i might as well do a review for School Rumble Ni Gakki as well. 
 
Story - Like the prequel, this series barely has a storyline besides Harima after Tenma, Tenma after Karasuma. But the thing i liked about this season was the involvement between Eri and Harima. The involvement between them made this season more enjoyable for me then the prequel. 
 
Art - Just like Ichi Gakki, the art has no real difference. Still beautiful as usual. 
 
Sound - I really love School Rumble's choice of music. I thought after watching Season 1, they could never find something just as cheerful as SCRAMBLE (Guru Guru Mawaru.. Guru Guru Mawaru) but to my suprise, Sentimental Generation was just as lively and also made you want to get up and sing and dance, trust me i did that once.. 
 
Character - The character are the same, i don't recall any new characters in this one (watched this a year ago, can't really remember). But one thing i remember very clearly was the character developments. I mean there were still some characters that didn't change a bit... perfect example is Lala. The character that developed most in my opinion is none other then the Ojou, Eri. (Sorry have to give a spoiler, please do not read if you haven't watched yet!) From totally disliking Harima, to slightly having good feelings for him, i thought this was the best part of School Rumble overall. &lt;--Spoiler ends here. Also you get to learn much more about each and every characters. 
 
Enjoyment - Again, this series is perfect enjoyment. From pure comedy to pure romance, this series is something that will keep you going after a harsh day. 
The only reason i gave a 9 for enjoyment was because there are about 2 fillers in this season that totally were really lame. But this is mainly because there wasn't enough manga material and 2 episodes couldn't fill in the next arc for the manga. 
 
Overall - Some say this series wasn't as good as its prequel, i personally do not think so. I have no right to criticize one's opinion but i shall stick to my own that this series totally bombed. Overall, if your a really huge fan School Rumble and really want to know more about a certain character, you should really consider watching this season.

I think this is the fact that makes this show so awesome. They exaggerated everything so hard, that it turns into a funny quality of the characters. 9/10 
 
-Enjoyment: Definitelly one of the best comedy manga/animes ever created. At least from my point of view. I enjoyed every chapter, and this OVA is not an exception. 10/10 
 
-Overall: I love Prison School, and I hope it gets a second season soon. Hope you agree with my honest and personal review :3

Art: What most surprises me is it's art, I feel like art is the main reason which makes this anime so awesome. 420/10 
 
Sound: There isn't much to talk about sound except that it seems fine. I didn't notice anything special about it probably because the focus was more into art and comedy. 8/10 
 
Characters: OMG the characters, they are always pervy and funny. Definitely a big point in this anime and OVA. 10/10

This Review will have spoilers: 
 
Plot (2 of 3): The OVA adapts the arc of the manga ""Mad Wax"" which focuses on characterizing Joe, the only character in the group of the boys who hasn't developed and also shows the boys lives after being released from the prison. Joe wants to go back to prison because his life is boring and without any fun, all the boys have got (or almost) girls to talk to and they are happy with freedom, except for Joe. Even Gakuto was able to relate to a girl. Joe wants to go back to prison by any means necessary and does everything for it, he's the only one in the group that is no relate to anyone, not even to the boys, Joe does not seem to have a great friendship with any of the boys , his only visible friendship is with his ants, Joe tries in all ways to return to prison, because he believes that it is freedom, for him that world inside the prison is what really puts him on the same level as the boys, he feels alive and sees that his colleagues are in the same situation as him and sees them as equals, out of prison he is the only one who feels lonely and dislocated, for being a very strange guy. The plot approaches Joe very well and characterizes it in a simple way and still manages to make you a little more interested in the character, my impression that he was the most interesting of all the boys was not wrong, Joe is undoubtedly the most mysterious and flashy character of Prison School and this arc works him very well, the plot is simple but straightforward, it serves to develop Joe and does just that. Aside from Joe's development, OVA also shows Gakuto and his relationship to a new character, Mitsuko, a cute and clumsy girl, but this is not deepened by the simple fact that Gakuto is not the focus of the arc, it was still fun see the moments of the two. Overall the plot did what it was proposed: Develop Joe, nothing more, nothing less. The comedy remains bizarre and very funny, without doubt one of the strongest points of the series. 
 
Characters (2 of 2): They are still incredible and very charismatic, but I will only talk about Joe: His loneliness is understandable and his reasons for going back to prison makes sense, it shows his side and how he sees the whole situation from his point of view and everything makes sense. Not having friends, girlfriend or purpose in life is something painful and this is visible in he's characterization. Joe is not made to be cool, pervert and super excited character like the other boys. He is well written and difficult to deal with, a fascinating character who had not received his due focus on the series and when received did not disappoint me and managed to take my interest not only in him, but in the OVA as a whole. Mitsuko is a cool character, too, but not very relevant here, she's the arc fanservice and Gakuto's romantic interest, that's it. 
 
Art/Animation (1 of 2): Much worse than the original series, really bad... the character design is beautiful, but the rest is ugly and bland, the direction is still excellent, all scenes are very well directed and this is the positive point of the production. 
 
OST (1 of 2): Nothing new, most all tracks are from the original series and the new ones are very weak, OST was not much needed, but still important. 
 
Personal Taste (1 of 1) I really laughed watching the OVA. I was intrigued by Joe and I really enjoyed his characterization, it's a fun OVA and it fulfills his role well. 
 
Final Verdict: 7/10. It's worth watching if you want to know a little more about Joe, it's really fun too, for me, a good OVA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Enredo (2 de 3): O OVA adapta o arco do mangá ""Mad Wax"" que foca na caracteriza??o de Joe, o único personagem do grupo dos garotos que n?o tinha tido um desenvolvimento e tbm mostra a vida dos garotos após saírem da pris?o. Joe quer voltar para a pris?o pois a sua vida é chata e sem nenhum divertimento, todos os garotos conseguiram (ou quase) garotas com quem conversar e est?o felizes com a liberdade, menos Joe. Até Gakuto conseguiu se relacionar com uma garota. Joe com isso quer voltar para a pris?o de qualquer maneira e faz de tudo para isso, ele é o único isolado do grupo, n?o consegue se relacionar com ninguém, nem mesmo com os garotos, Joe n?o parece ter uma grande amizade com nenhum dos garotos, a única amizade visível dele é com as suas formigas, Joe tenta de todas as formas voltar para a pris?o, pois ele acredita que aquilo é liberdade, para ele aquele mundo dentro da pris?o é o que realmente coloca-o no mesmo patamar que os garotos, ele se sente vivo e vê que seus colegas tbm est?o na mesma situa??o que ele e os enxerga como iguais, fora da pris?o ele é o único que se sente solitário e deslocado, por ser um cara bem sombrio. O enredo aborda muito bem os aspectos do Joe e o caracteriza de maneira simples e ainda sim consegue deixar vc um pouco mais interessado pelo personagem, a minha impress?o de que ele era o mais interessante de todos os garotos n?o estava errada, sem dúvidas Joe é o personagem mais misterioso e chamativo de Prison School e esse arco trabalha muito bem isso, o enredo é simples, mas direto, serve para desenvolver o Joe e faz exatamente isso. Fora o desenvolvimento de Joe, O OVA tbm mostra Gakuto conhecendo e se relacionando com uma nova personagem, Mitsuko, uma garota fofinha e desastrada, mas isso n?o é aprofundado pelo simples fato de que Gakuto n?o é o foco do arco em si, ainda sim foi divertido ver os momentos dos dois. No geral o enredo fez o que era proposto: Desenvolver o Joe, nada mais, nada menos. A comédia continua bizarra e muito engra?ada, sem dúvidas um dos pontos mais fortes da obra. 
 
Personagens (2 de 2): Ainda s?o incríveis e muito carismáticos, mas apenas irei falar do Joe: Sua solid?o é compreensível e suas raz?es para voltar a pris?o tbm, ele mostra o seu lado e como vê toda a situa??o de seu ponto de vista e tudo faz sentido. N?o ter amigos, namorada ou um propósito na vida é algo doloroso e isso é visível na caracteriza??o do personagem. Joe n?o é foi feito para ser personagem legal, tarado e super extravagante como os outros garotos. Ele é bem escrito e difícil de se lidar, um personagem fascinante que n?o tinha recebido seu devido foco na obra e quando recebeu n?o me decepcionou e conseguiu ter o meu interesse n?o só nele, mas no OVA como um todo. A Mitsuko é uma personagem legal tbm, mas n?o é muito relevante, ela é o fanservice do arco e o par rom?ntico do Gakuto, só isso. 
 
Arte/Anima??o (1 de 2): Muito inferior à série original, bem ruim mesmo... o character design é bonito, mas o resto é feio e sem gra?a, a dire??o continua excelente, todas as cenas s?o muito bem dirigidas e esse é o ponto positivo da produ??o. 
 
OST (1 de 2): Nada de novo, a maioria das tracks s?o da série original e as novas s?o bem fracas, a OST n?o foi muito necessária, mas ainda sim é importante. 
 
Veredito Final: 7/10. Vale a pena assistir se vc quer saber um pouco mais sobre o Joe, é bem divertido tbm, um bom OVA.

It is ecchi and it has a little bit of nudity in the form of bare breasts and rear ends, but it does not contain any actual sex, no naughty bits, nothing that would be censored at all.  This is very mild erotica, not hentai. 
 
So what does it have?  Well it is a set of 5 vignettes where woman narrate short little stories.  We have a woman in red who caresses herself over her clothing and talks about sitting in ways that let people look up her skirt... a naked apron girl... a maid who shows lots of panty shots... a nurse who takes off her clothes for her female doctor... and finally a business woman who strokes her crotch with a pointer.  The closest it comes to an H title is the little bit of masturbation where nothing is shown and the patting of a naked bottom by a doctor. 
 
Not really any story to speak of, just some random scenes where the various women tell you things about themselves.  The artwork is pretty nice in general and the characters are well drawn, so I give the art a thumbs up.  But that is the only positive thing I can say.  I am sure there is someone that this risque anime is targeted at, but it was not me.  I was bored and disappointed... mostly because I really enjoyed the real hentai episodes of G-Taste that were previously released. 
 
So, nice artwork, no real story, not a hentai but rated as one.  If you just want to look at some girls, then you might find this interesting.  If you want a story or you want an actual hentai, look elsewhere.

       Helpful This review includes the G-Taste OVA as well. Diving into this hentai raw was quite the interesting experience. My head was constantly in conflict with my other head on how pleasurable this show was.  
On one hand the art was easy on the eyes and the girls were hot but seeing how every episode they end up in the most retarded situations really stroked me the wrong way. There was one memorable song in the whole series (G-Taste OVA red dress woman) but man, that shit fucking slaps. Most of my enjoyment of the show came from the fact this it still left quite a bit to imagination. Because of this, it felt like a more ""mature"" hentai and not some tasteless garbage. It felt, in a way, more refined than most shows.

3,1757,116,7.491234365,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Di Gi Charat Christmas Special,"The Christmas Special aired in December 2000 and featured Piyoko again attempting to capture Dejiko by inviting all the characters on a cruise. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)",['Comedy'],none,"Di Gi Charat Christmas Special was a 20-minute episode loosely based around the Christmas theme; present giving. I actually enjoyed this 1 episode more than the other specials and the 16-ep original series. 
 
Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least. 
 
This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter. If you watch this, you won't be disappointed pyo~

Features character introductions and voice swapping comedy.,"['Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo']","Once an all-boys high school, Seika High, infamous for its rowdy students, has recently become a co-ed school. However, with the female population remaining a minority even after the change over the recent years, Misaki Ayuzawa works hard to make the school a better place for girls. She puts a lot of effort into academics and athletics and earns the trust of the teachers. Eventually, she becomes the first female student council president. Misaki has gained a reputation, among the male students' body as a strict boy-hating demon dictator and as a shining hope for the teachers and fellow female students. However, despite her reputation, she secretly works part-time at a maid café to support her mother and younger sister by returning the huge debt their father had left them.
Unfortunately, Misaki's secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at Seika High. Instead of exposing it to the school, though, Usui keeps it for himself and even becomes a regular customer at the café, much to Misaki's chagrin. Known for being a genius in pretty much everything from academics to athletics and for having rejected numerous confessions of his female peers, Usui takes a liking to Misaki because he finds her 'interesting'. After going through various awkward situations, including being confronted by a forgotten childhood friend of hers, Misaki falls in love with Usui, who reciprocates, and the two soon become a couple.
However, their relationship is troubled by Usui's difficult familial past coming back to haunt him. Being an illegitimate child of a wealthy English noble family, Usui technically cannot form a relationship with anyone not in his social standing, Misaki included. Misaki has to see Usui being forced to transfer to a prestigious rival school Miabigaoka, and then away from Japan completely when his family takes him back to England. 
However, they graduate and Usui and Misaki eventually marry 10 years later.","Kaichou wa Maid-sama Lala Special is a special episode wherein the main & few characters are introduced and some bonus voice swapping as well.

3,6872,118,7.339400654,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Cyborg 009,Original Cyborg 009 1966 movie based on the manga. Features 009's origin and an epic battle against Black Ghost and their evil robot forces.,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by the tyrant Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and Black Ghost. The nine cyborgs �C from which the name of the series is derived �C band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats, such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.
","The action scene are done well for it’s time and it’s entertaining to see how the Cyborg are overcoming whatever the organization is throwing at them. All of the cyborgs have their own unique abilities and they show it off how they are working with each other. 
 
For the voice actors, they have done a decent job. The voices matches the character design and their personality. Even if some of them look like stereotypes, I’m surprised that they brought a nice voice for each of everyone where they could had easily done it the other way around. 
 
I have no problem with how the character looks like, for the most part. But the design on their villain is too silly for me. I mean this is the guy who supposed to bring war to the world right? With those things being his actual mouth? 
 
Besides that, the animation can suffers sometimes with repeated shots and sequences. This is troublesome since was on the big screen and not in the smaller screen, but I let these thing pass since it was made in the 60’s, where even Disney was doing it. 
 
It follows the source material well, even if they changed Joe from being juvenile to a race car driver since he would look better I guess.  But this movie is more of an adaptation than a retelling, which I think the movie suffers the most of. The story seems to be cover the first chapters of the first arc and the last chapters of the second arc. Which weird in the narrative when you consider 2/3 of the movie introducing the characters and escaping Black Ghost, just to have a time-skip and a final fight at the climax. 
 
Even if we spend most of the movie introducing these characters, we know more about the cyborgs power than their personality. If you go through the movie, it also seems that this movie is more aimed at the leader of the group rather than the group itself, which can be a disappointment for those who wanted to see a chemistry with all the characters. 
 
The movie is good for those who wants to skip the first two story arcs of the manga, but for those who already have, this movie will not give you anything new. Especially that first tv series started two years afterwards. 
 
But I can say that the opening was nice :> 
 
Go and see it if you are into some cheesy 60’s Cyborg action. 

          
 
       Helpful Usually there are two conflicting aspects when it comes to rating something as old as Cyborg 009: Compared to more recent series or movies it goes without saying that it is going to feel dated and unpolished; applying today's standards would be more than unfair, modern media is a beneficiary of an evolution that spanned several decades after all.  
 
At the same time it would be equally as unfair to justify all of its shortcomings by stating 'It's old! They didn't know better back then!' Not every piece of media ages as well as the other and some works, no matter how old they are, will always remain timeless. 
 
Cyborg 009 is the brainchild of Shotaro Ishinomori, pupil of Osamu Tezuka, the god of manga himself, which explains the evident similarities in both their art and attitude to work. Just like Tezuka, Ishinomori was incredibly productive during his lifetime, publishing an incredible amount of manga; on top of that he also created numerous tokusatsu-franchises which are popular till today (like Kamen Rider). Working as an assisstant on Astro Boy certainly left its mark on Cyborg 009, as well as the ever-looming shadow of the cold war and the increasing western influences brought by Japan's opening after WWII. 
 
The story goes as follows: Nine people from all over the world are abducted by a mysterious organisation named `Black Ghost' and are forcibly transformed into cyborgs with various superpowers. Black Ghosts goal is benefitting from warfare and conflicts by selling weapons and destabilizing countries - and the cyborgs are just one of the many tools they use to achieve it. Of course the cyborgs themselves are not pleased with the new part they are supposed to play, so they plan to escape and end Black Ghost once and for all.  
 
Joe Shimamura with the number 009 becomes the cyborgs unquestioned leader from the get go and is the flawless, perfect hero who knows and can do pretty much everything. Compared to him the others are mainly there to show off their powers or to provide comic relief. It soon becomes clear that the story is mostly about Joe and not about the team itself, since all the others remain characterless and their backrounds are never mentioned. 
 
The movies main focus is the fight against Black Ghost, told through numerous battles against various robots or monsters. Conflicts are resolved quickly without serious consequences or surprises and there aren't really any twists worth mentioning. One the one hand the tone tries to be serious but on the other hand it is full of cartoony slap-stick gags that make you think you're watching Tom & Jerry.  
 
The animation is okay for the most part. Many of the movements feel pretty wacky, especially the ones of the characters with more realistic designs. Of course Cyborg 009's age has to be considered and I also assume their budget wasn't that high, however if you compare it to some of the movies Disney has put out at the same time or even prior there are a lot of deficiencies. Japanese animation still had quite the way to go.  
 
Cyborg 009 has not aged well. Unless you are interested in the history of anime and its beginnings or seeing one of Japan's first superhero teams in action there is little reason to watch it. Checking out one of the newer adaptions or reading the manga, if you happen to be curious about these characters may prove more rewarding

It features a 6-minute prologue of Freedom as well as various staff interviews.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","Freedom is about a child, Takeru, discovering a secret that could change the very society he depends upon.
Civilization on the Earth was destroyed by a permanent abnormal climate shift. Cities with millions of people had been built on the far side of the Moon and became the only place where humanity still survived. The remaining population declared the foundation of Republic Eden, then set forth expanding those lunar colonies that loved peace and freedom.
More than 160 years have passed since then. In Eden, children complete their compulsory education program when they are 15 years old. They are then integrated into the society as citizens. During their brief moratorium they are granted freedom. Like other boys, Takeru decides to take part in a race with his friends using machines particular to the Moon, called “Vehicle”. But what distinguishes Takeru is that he has constructed his own vehicle. When his vehicle catches fire on a public road he is sentenced to 10 hours of ""volunteer"" work outside the dome, where he discovers the remains of a small crashed capsule bearing photographs and articles seemingly sent from Earth. Structures visible in the background identify the location they were taken as the Kennedy launch facility in Florida.
Infatuated with a young woman in the photograph, Takeru attempts to research conditions on Earth and finds that the library's information on the home planet is heavily censored. Furthermore, nobody is permitted to travel far enough from the dome over the lunar surface to get within visual range. He discovers a small enclave of people living in a facility outside of Eden's centralized control, and after befriending the enclave's leader is given access to a moon rover with sufficient range to get a view of Earth. He sees that the Earth is blue; it has recovered from the disaster that befell it and is now habitable again. The authorities of Eden pursue Takeru, attempting to suppress this discovery, but Takeru and his friend Bismarck manage to commandeer an old ""escape"" rocket and leave Eden to explore Earth first hand.
The escape rocket's capsule comes down slightly off course, landing in the ruins of Las Vegas, and Takeru and Bismarck use Takeru's vehicle to make the overland trek across the United States.","Rate a 5

Story 
Not only a tribute to the moon landing(sorry theorists, it happened.) but a reminder that we shouldn't relax. In other words, each step one stakes like on the moon jumps or kick-starts another. Slowly but surely we walk the path to our goal or flag. America while being gung ho(working together in Japanese terms) tends to forget about the present and live in the future. That necessary isn't a bad thing for it can bring new ideas to the table. Although, if we can slow our thinking and work with what we already have before kick starting the new thing more progress can be made. When further progress is made only than can we joy of freedom for we would be done with that task. A statement to greed and being hot headed.

An excellent choice by going with computer generated. Not only does this choice really emphasis to the anime's message but works with the setting as well.

","If you watch this, you should know what you're getting: Ecchi in its purest form. No plot, no story or character development; just pure unabashed fanservice. 
 
And that's where these specials do everything right. 
 
Who are we kidding? No one's going to watch this for the story or development of relationships between characters - it's just for the fanservice.  
 
The character designs are great if you don't mind the slightly chunky designs of some of the females or the missing noses. And since these specials are only about 4 minutes each, the quality is kept up. 
 
The music in the background is somehow very fitting... and the voice acting is just what you would expect from the characters of the show. Just fine. 
 
Enjoyment? 10/10. You know why. 
 
But rating these specials for the enjoyment and overall happiness of it would be ridiculous. So in fairness of its complete lack of story, but it's prowess in all other categories (for an ecchi series), I'd give the Ladies vs Butlers! Specials a passing 7/10.

3,2388,122,7.226252376,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Tachiguishi Retsuden,"Immediately following the end of the World War II, Tokyo was trying to emerge from the rubble. In a corner of the black market stood a flimsy soba (buckwheat noodle) eatery.  
It was a delicate time just before the closing. A man appeared at the threshold. ""One moongaze (raw egg). With soba."" This was none other than the legendary Fast Food Grifter known as Moongaze Ginji. His relentless scam quietly initiates.  
 
The time changes. In the midst of the first anti Japan-US Security Treaty movement (1960), the streets rumored about Foxy Croquette O-Gin, a beautiful lady Fast Food Grifter, who disappeared all of a sudden. Wandering the alleys in the years of the economic miracle was Crying Inumaru, the loser. Then came Cold Badger Masa, whose scandalous death made people aware of the presence of Fast Food Grifters within the Japanese society. Beefbowl Ushigoro put an end to a major gyudon (beef and rice bowl) restaurant chain. And it is not possible not to mention Hamburger Tetsu, who shocked the entire fast food industry.  
 
Fast Food Grifters are the phantoms that rise and fall with the shifting diet-styles. They are the dissenting heroes who carved their names on the dark side of dietary culture with their glare. Now their legend revives, strong as ever... 
 
(Source: Production I.G.)",['Comedy'],"
A fictional documentary about changing Japanese eating habits and the colorful thieves that swindle the restaurants which serve them.  The film begins with the origins of Japanese food stalls following the countries defeat in World War II.  The first grifter introduced is Moongaze Ginji.  He requests soba noodle soup with a raw egg (also known as ""Moongaze Soba"").  He declares the dish to be an imitation of a landscape.
The main body of the film follows a predictable pattern. A grifter is introduced, his food preference demonstrating the continued decline of traditional food in Japan, and his grift comically illustrated. Intercut at random are popular news event stories that always emphasise Japan losing its way and America and its allies' cultural and military despotism.  Vignettes include Japanese children exploding from hula hoop use, drunk businessmen imitating Neil Armstrong, as anomalies of natural disasters coinciding with the ongoing cultural transformation underline nature itself disproving changes in Japan. Yukio Mishima's suicide is also referred to as an effect.  Mishima committed suicide by seppuku to illustrate his support for Imperial Japan and the Emperor as a god.
One of the last grifters is Frankfuter Tatsu whose monologue is censored in each sentence because it refers to Disney Land. ""I could only think of ""beeeep-Land"" he declares over and over. He is obsessed with American culture while simultaneously being censored by American Legal system despots.  When asked why he is so interested in Disney Land he says he knows it is empty and fake, but full of everything, and nothing.
","What place does food have in your life? 
 
This is the question at the heart of Tachiguishi Retsuden, a question at once simple and yet surprisingly deep. Absurdly deep it turns out. Some of us eat just to survive: mealtime being the minimum effort required to replenish energy. Some of us eat for love of food: taking the time to savor new flavors, new dishes, new culinary adventures. Most of us probably find a balance between the two. But only an elite caste has refined Food into a true philosophy, an affirmation and definition of self, an art form: the Fast Food Grifters. 
 
They look like you and me. They enter restaurants, they order a meal, they eat, but the similarities end there. Each has a special technique for fleeing the scene without paying for a single crumb.  
 
Hamburger Tetsu orders literally hundreds of burgers from a burger joint, choking its supply and demand infrastructure until it collapses. Foxy Croquette O-Gin uses her feminine charms to distract the owner of a food stall, sometimes forcing him into a variant of Jan-Ken-Pon (Fox-Hunter-Farmer); if she loses, she has to flash the patrons as payment for the meal, if she wins… well… her grift is set up in such a way to be a win-win scenario. And Moongaze Ginji sees a mundane bowl of soba as an artistic landscape, complimenting the cheap noodles initially only to discover that they taste awful, thus shaming the owner to tears while he walks away in contempt. 
 
The Grifters are the ultimate moochers. 
 
Presented as a mockumentary, “The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters” studies these individual cases of grifting in order to understand the mindsets of those involved, whose exploits are as crazy as their names. The animation style is easily the most striking feature, consisting of photographed characters pasted atop two-dimensional paper cutouts in a relatively three-dimension world. This technique, dubbed “superlivemation”, will be familiar to fans of Oshii’s film Avalon. The majority of the scenes are thus quite static, interspersed with periodic moments of frenetic movement, and depending on one’s level of patience this may prove frustrating. However, when little is happening the scene always appears as though a slowly-moving photograph  -- proving both beautiful and oddly calming. 
 
As one would expect Kenji Kawai’s music is quite apt, at times reinforcing the dramatic bits, but usually playing against them to comedic effect. The subtle, atmospheric background music -- a forte of Kawai -- is easily the best. Even so, the soundtrack isn’t entirely memorable and you probably won’t feel an inclination to hunt it down. But in overall context, it is enjoyable; there’s a pervasive sense that the music is hardly taking the subject matter seriously. Heightening of absurdity? Check. And with the always engaging Kouichi Yamadera playing the part of the narrator, the sound is as much a feast as the visuals.  
 
The deeper meat here is a social critique of Japan’s changing palette over the decades, post World War II to present, as it becomes progressively less traditional and more influenced by foreign tastes. But the attack isn’t blistering. It’s more of a playful nudge, like an amused mother chiding her fussy, suspicious child into trying a new dish. It really is delicious. You really will like it. 
 
If a definition of absurdism is “people doing meaningless things in meaningful ways”, the Grifters are absurdists extraordinaire. What they say and what they do create the most hilarious moments and yet there is something so compelling about their food-stealing methods. Any idiot can run into a market, swipe a loaf of bread, and escape without punishment. A real artist does it with style, grace, and in plain sight. Oh, they’re amazing, these Grifters, they’re the anarchists of nourishment, the terrorists of sustenance! 
 
There might not be much dialogue from them, but that minimalism gives each of their lines a greater punch. Their stories act as punctuation marks to the narrator’s own tale, side dishes that become the meal itself. Each act of grifting is both a method for obtaining food and a view into each character’s approach to life. Moongaze Ginji, who bookends the story, is looking for a full stomach as much as he is searching for something artistic. In fact, it’s arguable whether food is the main motivation for any of them or if it is merely an excuse to satisfy a deeper hunger, be that social recognition or otherwise. 
  
It isn’t an exaggeration to say that this is a nearly two hour Wall of Text. Even Oshii lovers will find this his least accessible work: even shorter bursts of action, even longer stretches of introspection. But that isn’t a damning critique. This is a documentary after all and, silly though it is, it still adheres to the typical conventions you would expect. Those without a taste for such may wish to skip this. 
 
But there are always those of us hungry for new, even bizarre, experiences and to such adventurers I say: “You will be satisfied.” It’s crazy. It’s different. It’s not even close to the kind of anime you watch regularly, but it is one you won’t forget. Afterwards, you won’t look at your restaurant bill the same way -- and certainly not without a knowing smirk.  
 
So should you ever find yourself eating alongside a Tachiguishi one day, don’t worry, they’ll pick up the tab in their own way. 
 
Itadakimasu!

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
It's time for another ultra obscure review! Today I'm looking at ""Tachiguishi: The Amazing Lives of Fast Food Grifters!"" This was a 2006 movie written, produced, and directed by the legendary Mamoru Oshii. It's free to to view on Youtube with accurate subs...yet only 100 MAL users have seen it! This is considered Oshii's forgotten movie for a good reason...it's EASILY the worst thing he's ever made. We can forgive Oshii though because to err is human. Even the greatest film directors usually make at least one dud, unless they die young like Tarkovsky. 
 
Plot: 
 
Fast Food Grifters is an ostensibly comedic mockumentary about Japan's most legendary practitioners of mooching and the exquisite art of the ""dine and dash"". The film loosely covers Japanese history from 1945 to 2006 and shows the greatest restaurant moochers of each decade along with their outlandish techniques. The actual purpose of the film though is to bemoan the gradual erosion of traditional Japanese food along with Japanese culture. Oshii created the film as a Leftist critique of Americanization and American culture's perverse, strangling influence on traditional cultures around the world. Remember back in 2004 when Rammstein released their song ""Amerika""? This movie is like a shitty, overly self indulgent version of that...lasting 2 hours. Oshii has long held unfavorable views of the US, dating back to the late 60s protests and his brief time with the Japanese Communist Party. For some reason, he bottled up that anger until 2006 and then dumped this mess on us. There is a reason even Oshii's most diehard fanboys NOPE the fuck out of this film. 
 
 
Art: 
 
The art is another divisive element. It's this weird, grotesque hybrid of live action and stop motion animation using paper cutouts. Honestly this looks EXACTLY like something Courage the Cowardly Dog would do in the late 90s.  
 
 
Overall: 
 
I gave this a merciful 5 because I sincerely believe there's a decent film buried somewhere deep in this garbage pile. Sadly, the way its executed is an absolute chore to watch and essentially becomes ""Old Man Yells at Cloud"". I feel like Oshii fundamentally misunderstands American culture. US culture is not an all powerful juggernaut that influences all cultures in a one way exchange. US culture itself is extremely maliable and influenced by dozens of other cultures. Compared to Japan, America's culture and traditions are extremely shallow and weak. Japan has been eating the same food, prepared the same traditional ways for often 800-1,000 years. America became obsessed with cheeseburgers after WW2,  Chinese food in the 70s, Japanese food in the 80s, Mexican food in the 90s, Indian food in the 00s, and currently Thai and Middle Eastern food. We barely have a culinary tradition. Our most ancient and sacred culinary dishes are artery clogging, Southern Soul Food, because at least that dates back 200 years. 
 
 
Many people on MAL want to eventually complete the Oshii filmography, but that unfortunately means eventually watching this one. I decided to take the bullet for my fellow anime elitists and watch this one so you don't have to. Instead, you can save yourself 2 hours by just watching the aforementioned Rammstein song Amerika, and then watch this 40 second clip from the film Brother 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LBi0xQH5Og&list=LLJ4q0re1h9w0TRSRhq-wW4w&index=3&t=0s

And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag. 
 
Animation: 
Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...

3,966,125,7.072853403,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Crayon Shin-chan,"Just because an anime features a young protagonist does not necessarily mean that it is an appropriate series to show your children. Young Shinnosuke, or Shin-chan for short, is a very creative young boy that lives with his eccentric parents, Misae and Hiroshi, as well as his Prima Donna younger sister, Himawari, and has loads of unique friends to boot. 
 
Everyday life for little Shin-chan is full of funny (and shocking) moments, most of which stem from his unnatural and sometimes profane use of language, as well as his constant acts of inappropriate behavior. Shin-chan's famous ""elephant"" gag is one of the most defining moments in  Crayon Shin-chan , simply because it is the epitome of crude comedy, one of the core themes of the series. 
 
 Crayon Shin-chan  is a hilarious show about the day in the life of a young, curious boy, that captures the awkwardness of growing up as well as the beauty of being true to one's self, no matter what others say.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピ�`マン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","Hands down, my favorite anime, it's original, extremely funny, you might say the art style is bad, until you realize that it's how the characters are supposed to be drawn. I have seen the anime about 15 times over,i watch it a lot, very re-watchable. For being 5, shin(main character) always gets himself into trouble, mostly for pulling down his pants and doing his famous ass dance, has a very potty mouth, and makes some hilarity with his 4 friends. Georgie being my favorite of the 4. In all this anime deserves awards for awesomeness

          
 
       Helpful Well, that sure does it for me with this show. 
After watching literally 999 episodes and with the 1000th one just around the corner this next Friday, I think it's safe to assume I'm so deep into this show's endless nature that I will likely die before they stop making episodes for it (and movies, and Specials, and OVAs, and...). 
 
I'll take a big On-Hold hiatus from this until it somehow comes to an end (which I doubt), just to say that I'm not actually dropping it, because stupid me here never drops anime for pure OCD at this point. 
 
Such is the longevity of Japanese family fun anime ever since Sazae-san (that one I can't even watch whether I want it or not, since the eps are not preserved and no copies were made for several of the lost ones). Gotta say though, as much as I enjoy watching this to pass time, it's bound to get amazingly repetitive with the quirks, humor, eventual flanderizations and even some of its smartest comedic aspects. 
 
You still get here and there absolutely hilarious episodes, legit tearjerking moments (some of which even directly connects to a bigger picture made into a movie) and overall a lot of fun with the cast's great chemistry with each other. But at this point, you are also bound to find one huge mixed bag of overdone content and unfortunately very toned down comedy edges for a series that actually had a history of being quite the risquè enthusiast with many of its elements (being instead substituted at times with Disney Junior levels of ""for kids"" content, which was quite a shock considering how much this series used to really never stepped down too much from always trying to be very accessible for both parents and children to have their share of giggles). 
 
Other than that, this bit is quite obvious for anyone familiar with the series: 
 
Art and animation were always mediocre at best, although becoming a lot more fluid and well animated over the years in several specific occasions. 
Sound being your usual japanese slice of life comedy generic tunes with some memorable songs thrown in at times and of course, if you account on this category, your usual old-school cliche sound effects and punchline delivery shenenigans. 
 
And for an anime this long to only have had 17 openings and 15 endings is a bit weird and underwhelming as an element to look forward to in several cool plotlines that could have been made into them, if you allow me to do a nitpick, but that's just my opinion as a OP/ED lover myself. 
 
The characters literally make this show by themselves and are the true shine of this whole anime however. You really got to appreciate just how many situations they come up with in which the characters by simply being in there and acting like the audience would expect them to (and sometimes the situation being severally subverted for better or for worse, just to make a side note as to why this show can be unpredictable with part of its character interactions even taking in consideration the issue with flanderization mentioned above), and you have a funny time for solid 7-13 minutes depending on how long the segment sets itself up to be. 
 
Talking about that, something that makes this anime works in the Enjoyment portion is just how much it really tries not to overstay its welcome, always opting to going for 2-3 short different segments per episode (saved for some exceptions), many times being animated and written by different people of the anime staff, which gives a bit of lively variety in its own way. 
 
This anime has, as to be expected for such a long long-running anime, a lot of flaws and a mixed bag of episodes (to the point of several times being a mixed bag as a segmented episode per se). But you can't deny the overall appeal, influence and just how good it is in many regards in its own merits, for a comedy series. 
 
Besides all of its problems, I can't help but to give a solid and well deserved 7/10. 
 
If you are not a crazy person like me that goes completionist mode with every anime they touch, do yourself a favor and give a try at least in the first episodes, I can guarantee that, even if it isn't quite your kind of comedy, you will still have a good time with it. 
 


          
 
       Helpful ***THIS IS A REVIEW SOLELY FOR THE FUNIMATION ADULT SWIM CRAYON SHIN-CHAN*** 
 
When I first acknowledged that Shin-chan is finally going to be dubbed and licensed in NA, I was filled with thrill and excitement, having been a diehard Kureiyon Shin-chan fan since I was born, and could not wait to see it. However, after watching through all of it, and saw that there isn't any review on MyAnimeList on this specific release, I felt like I could give a word of advice or two for those who haven't seen it but will. 
 
Every bit of the English dubbed version of Crayon Shin-chan reminds me of the Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt dub. It is just a blatant and unjustifiable excuse for the voice actors, actresses and script writers to have fun and mess around with everything but without totally screwing up the original intentions and quality, but instead adding on top of it a different, but more suited type of humor for their intended audiences (North America and other English-native cultural based countries). 
 
With that summary said, it is clear now that those who have watched all the three-season 78~ episodes, will surely be shocked, interested, and surprised by what Adult Swim and FUNimation can do to totally turn an everyone-rated show into a purely adult-targeted grotesque and profane Newgrounds type of parody. I will try my best not to go off-topic in this review, but make it easy, cohesive, and be as critical and non-biased/objective as possible. 
 
In the American version of Shin-chan, many episodes that long-time original viewers are familiar with are turned upside down in such a way that each and every dialogue is different, thus resulting a different episodic story that tries to reach its audiences, but fails to leave an heavy impression like any of the originals do. There are of course the famous Apartment (Shin-chan blows up their house) arc, a Star Wars parody, and some related episodes that share the same settings (Happiness bunny's revenge, etc.) which FUNimation did an incredible job of dubbing them, however these still lacked the overall productive and practical sense of enjoyment the original had. 
 
This dilemma is verified through the four or five commentary episodes, where all the voice actors come together to bash the show and explain why they did what they have done as they saw fit. Not only that, but in certain episodes many lines direct to the audience in an attempt to break the fourth wall, however this trend only adds to the audience's confusion often times to the already confusing story in each hardcore edited episodic plot and setting. 
 
The original show's humor primarily focuses on Shin-chan's lingual disabilities, a fetish on butt-dance, lewd and childish acts, and all his friends‘ and families' yelling at him. The FUNimation version takes a huge opposite turn and deviates away from such elements, and create a world of their own. The dubbed show contains violence, insults, every-5-second swearing, characters' misery as laugh points, and just unbearable, incredibly shallow dirty and racial jokes. As expected when trying to convert such a cultural-heavy comedy show. 
 
While both shows tend to involve the exploitation of Shin-chan's private parts, nudity, and his father and his' abnormal perverted interest in hot, young-looking teenage girls and cougars, the US version tends to use this as one of the primary selling points of the show. But this is done incredibly well that it left the viewers not comfortable enough if one episode did not have a scene of Shin-chan's commenting on wanting to grope the breasts of his prey(this generalization is lacking in the original, as it can do with or without the lewd comments). 
 
The characters and their stereotypes have not quite changed. Hiro is still the average working class, Misae still the totalitarian dictator, Shin-chan the clueless, eccentric boy, etc. however certain characters behave differently here and there and have totally different roles to their original versions. Shiro (Whitey) has a British accent and a cunning personality, the teachers are all over sex and don't care about the things they say to the kids, the kindergarten principal is now a Mexican who is made fun of a-lot about for his genital sizes. 
 
Up to this point, I should be able to bring the fundamental difference between the show that made me give this a 7 and the original series and movies a 9. It is lacking many of the morals, emotional connections, and familial love and relationship lessons the latter offers the audience. This version completely disregard any of the said good qualities the original had, and will not satisfy the emotional side of your soul. Sounds cheesy, I know, but it's true. Original Shin-chan was not as shallow as FUNimation version, and had a lot more connotation that the viewers could not watch without. 
 
Shin-chan is old, and is birthed in the 90's. While the current episodes are getting along with the times, in 720p and all that jazz, the center concept and themes still haven't changed. As FUNimation picked episodes that are quite old and still revolves around more mature-but less appealing humor, they do quite a damn well excellent job in adapting for the American audience. By comparing the two versions side by side, one can easily distinguish the comedy values of the two cultures. 
 
The cultural and lingual barriers of the jokes are non-existent as they do in the original subbed version, perhaps due to the fact that FUNimation did not pick the episodes where Shin-chan says something in Japanese similar to another word or phrase, and their parents or friends correct them, and similar type of jokes the average Joe just wouldn't be able to comprehend or find funny, due to aforementioned differences. At times the viewers can even find the voice actors themselves making fun of the show inside the show. Inception! In regards with the voice acting, not enough compliments and respect can be given to FUNimation at how perfectly they can use the same animation, but produce such drastic and incredible results, by only using clever lines, meta, and reference jokes. 
 
To sum it up, I don't want to make this a TL;DR review, so what's most important is this: take this review with a grain of salt, and you will either love-or-hate this version. For those of you who have not watched a single episode of original Shin-chan and have no clue what it is about, watch it as if you were watching a newgrounds parody, because that's what American Crayon Shin-Chan is, but at its best. For those who have seen or are seeing the original, this will be a new start, a totally fresh start that won't bore, but appreciated by the seasoned Shin-chan lovers. Completely enjoyable, though occasionally offensive and confusing, FUNimation and Adult Swim does the job well done. 
 
Scored ratings and punchlines: 
 
Story 6/10 (Quite decent, some are superb innovation and unexpected, some are just repetitive and brainless, thus a fairly balanced mix) 
 
Art 5/10 (The style of Shin-chan is natively deformed and extremely cartoon like, with the occasional short scenes with superb artistic styles only to emphasize the mood and atmosphere. However, the consistency between episodes is what bothers me quite an amount. Thus the low rating) 
 
Sound 8/10 (Every voice acting piece was god-like, no flaws, no awkward moments, just a hell lot of fun and everyone especially Laura Bailey of Shin-chan puts their all into it) 
 
Character 8/10 (Ridiculous, unbelievable, yet understandable and relate-able, the characters seem to be more enjoyable but less respectable than in the original version) 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 (If you liked PSG, FLCL, and all the nonsensical comedy genre animes, you should definitely not skip the FUNimation version of Crayon Shin-chan. 50% trolling, 40% sex-related jokes, and 10% parody. What more could you need to laugh your butts off?) 
 
Overall 7/10 (Don't know any better way to say it: It is definitely, certainly, and undoubtedly a waste of time, but if you had time to waste, you wouldn't feel it was wasted with FUNimation's Shin-chan!)

It's mostly a rather dry recap of the first eight (iirc) episodes hosted by New Generations' seiyuu, who also present their favorite scene (the concert with Mika). They don't talk much about making the show or anything. The one bright spot is when Producer's seiyuu joins them, and they do talk a bit with him about making the show. (His favorite scene, incidentally, is Uzuki's first meeting with Producer.) Moreover, he was a high schooler at the time and is pretty adorable actually. So, if you feel a desire to have a little behind-the-scenes knowledge of IMCG (and I do mean a little), go ahead and watch, just skip ahead to when Producer's seiyuu appears.

Kōji Nanjō is one of the most successful rock stars in Japan, with his hauntingly beautiful voice and very attractive features. But beneath all the fame and glamour, he is a damaged and hurt young man who has absolutely no happiness or interest in life.
One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.
Due to the manga artist's illness, the manga ended at volume 19 without a proper ending. When she recovered, she drew the dojinshi Ai ni Obore, Ai ni Shisu (�郅四绀臁�郅摔筏�, lit. Drowning in Love, Too much Love, also known as Dekishi (溺死, lit. Death by Drowning)), to give readers a proper 'final meeting' scene.","Each music video has a simple short story involving the two main characters. The stories are basic and short enough to be explored within the length of a 3-5 minute song.  
The music videos themselves are quite dark, surreal, and artsy looking, with good enough animation, nothing too special.  
The majority of my enjoyment came from the songs themselves, which I actually thought were pretty (and surprisingly) good. This is what made my rating higher. I've only *watched* this anime about once, but I've listened to it about 3 times. The songs can best be described as interesting, weird, and catchy. They won't be everyone's style, but I enjoy them and see myself going back to them every so often.

          
 
       Helpful Is very strange talking about Cathexis, is not my type of serie but surprisingly I could find on this many interesting things. 
 
Being just five (5) music videos, each one of them tell us a different tale based on koji and takuto. If we know just a bit about what is zetsuai or the characters itself are, we can see a passionate way of each one of them, mostly over koji nanjo. 
 
The video clips are totally Surrealist, harsh, a very personal way of presenting the persecution of koji over takuto, we can see  strong selfish feelings of love.  
 
I guess the most particular of this is how we can differenciate both character as an entity, they are so unique with that powerful personality, is sadist watch how they fight against each other, with a kind of invasive personality, they can wrap us with the most sad and painful expression as  anger and passion. 
 
The five music videos are represented by different phantasies; The Rock 
Idol star tale. The religious-angel tale. The studio tale, centred on koji nanjo recording a theme and watching the artist life view. The vampire hunter tale. The last music video is i guess the most strange of them, the most personal and sad over the characters, as lovers, the crash point of view. 
 
This is very familiar to those 70's - 80's old music video clips, surrealism of lover and different meanings, abstracts stuffs. some scenes are a bit shocking and rude, contains romantics scenes as agressive scenes.

Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.
The volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the Avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.
The Legend of Crystania setting places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by an ""animal god"" of Crystania. One of the prominent characters is Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.
","Totally cute! Always looked forward to these segments at the end of each episode of the anime Record of Lodoss War. 
 
These short parodies have chibi forms of various different characters from the main anime either doing one time skits or going on a non-serious adventure that runs through some episodes. It's all comedy and pokes fun at the main story and its cast. It would be enjoyable for anybody who would like to see the silly, childlike version of Lodoss War!

Funded entirely out of its own deep pockets, it was hoped that the school would be a haven for young men and women on whose shoulders our future would rest. 
 
The School is open to any talented individual, irrespective of his or her lineage or financial standing and is known to count scores of singularly talented pupils. It is furthermore also famous for its harboring of a remarkable percentage of party animals. Not even the bright and talented minds of CLAMP School can keep the campus free of crimes and mysteries. Or can they? Join Nokoru, Suoh and Akira, our case-cracking kid detectives, as they save the day and even the odd damsel in distress! 
 
(Source: Bandai Entertainment)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Shoujo']","The Clamp School Detectives is a series of episodic cases.
","The kingdom of Clamp has been extremely well known in Japan. I originally came upon this show because i am a huge fan of clamp and i really enjoyed alot of their other works such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles one of my favorite clamp manga's. Other works include X/1999, Chobits, Card captor sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, XXXholic. Initially i was very excited to watch this show seeing as how i loved all of clamps creations how ever i was a bit let down. 
 
The setting for this series revolves around this large school comprised of bout 10,000 students with many different divisions and many activities, academics, athletics, and just bout anything you can think of.  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira are the 3 main protagonists of the series and are also the lead council members of the elementary division. These three kids must solve many cases around the school of certain mysterious happenings, usually involving a damsel in distress. 
 
Later on as you get a little further into the show, some of the main players of the series start to develop relationships with these elementary kindergarten females which is a nice touch, and the romance is not shown as true love which it shouldn't be given the fact that these characters are pretty underage. But i do appreciate how each relationship with these two female casts grow as you get further in the show and they start to be a part of the clamp school detectives. 
 
I think the strongest aspect of this show is the characters. The nice thing about the trio of protagonists is that they each bring something different to the show. Nokoru is the youngest son of the founders of the Clamp School and is essentially a prodigy in every sense of the word. Suoh is nearly as sharp as Nokoru, but where he lacks in the powers of observation he makes up for with his physical attributes. Akira is the youngest of the three. He's a little more na?ve, a better cook, and sees things more optimistically than his friends. They play off each other quite nicely and right from the very first episode they have a chemistry that easily carries the weight of 26 episodes. 
 
At first glance i thought this would be a series that focuses more on like mysterious happenings and murder cases, because the first episode kind of gives you that impression, but really most of the cases they solve are trying to help some lady that is in trouble, because of the episodic nature of the show, each case involves a different scenario.  
 
Although their is one particular plot in the show that takes place towards the end, the last 6 episodes with a more straightforward story and the introduction of a rather intriguing character. This story really caught my attention. It was much different then former episodic nature of the plot and a little more on a serous level, though the idea behind it was rather predictable, it still held my attention.  Which i thought was really the only thing that redeemed this anime series as far as the simplistic progression of the story. Which is why i rated it a 6 and not lower. 
 
If your a fan of clamp though, this series may be enjoyable, but if you have not seen other clamp works, i highly recommend you pass on this one and watch other great works from clamp. Other wise if you have nothing else to watch and are a clamp fanatic and want to watch every clamp in existence then give this one a shot as a last resort, then you may enjoy this series to an extent depending upon your tastes. 
 


          
 
       Helpful CLAMP School Detectives is a 90s anime based on a CLAMP manga. And it is, in my opinion, a very entertaining show. I just finished this series and decided to write a review about it - my first review, actually. Here we go. 
 
? Story - 9/10 
 
In the first 20 episodes there isn't a story. We follow the lives of three elementary school boys that happen to be in the Elementary School Council and are also (self-proclaimed) detectives. They - well, mostly their ""leader"", Nokoru, wants to help all the ladies he sees in trouble. He doesn't want to see any girl crying and is willing to do anything to help her. So the boys get in a lot of situations, some funny ones, some troublesome ones, and some actually dangerous ones. To achieve their goals they do things that real children aren't able to do - that most people aren't able to do, actually. In some episodes they actually have to solve cases, follow clues to find things, and they have the help of other characters, especially two girls from the school's kindergarten. Those two girls are also supposed to be the romantic interests of two of the main boys, but of course, they are all children, so the ""love"" in this show is represented as the most pure thing in the world, and nothing is sexualized, in case there was someone worried about it.  
Later in the series, the ""villain"" makes his appearance, so we have a more serious atmosphere and an actual plot. 
 
? Art/Animation - 9/10 
 
CLAMP 90s artstyle, it's simply gorgeous. I don't have much to talk about it, I just have a soft spot for oldschool art. 
 
? Sound - 8/10 
 
The soundtrack, all composed by Ali Project, isn't very memorable, but it wasn't bad at all; it did its job perfectly, fitting the show pretty well. The opening song is very catchy, and the endings were both good, especially the second one, but also not very memorable. 
The voice actors were great at their roles, I have nothing to complain about them. 
 
? Characters - 10/10 
 
All of them have different personalities and are very likeable. Our protagonists are all children. Three boys at age 11~12; Nokoru Imonoyama, who is the president of the ESC, is a bit irresponsible, but very kind, and really cares for the people he loves, and for the whole CLAMP Academy; Suoh Takamura is the serious type, he really respects Nokoru but also gets really mad at the his lack of responsibility; and Akira Ijyuin, who is also the main character of the manga 20 Mensou ni Onegai!!, is the youngest one, he enjoys cooking and is probably the most childish of the three boys. 
The two girls, Nagisa Azuya and Utako Ohkawa, are members of the Kindergarten School Council, they often help or are helped by the main boys.  
Some characters from other CLAMP manga series make some appearances, like Kentaro, Takeshi, Eri and Sukiyabashi, from School Defenders Duklyon and Miyuki from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland. 
Other characters usually show up in only one or two episodes. 
 
? Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
I loved it. I thought the manga was a good series to pass time, but nothing actually special, but I had a lot of fun watching the anime. It was really cute and amusing. Even though it's mostly episodic, the cases never get boring. 
 
? Overall - 9/10 
 
If you are into light-hearted stories, isn't worried about realism, and enjoy episodic series, I'd suggest you to give CLAMP School Detectives a shot! 

          
 
       Helpful Let me start of by saying this anime was created by the one and only CLAMP.  
 
Now that you know let me start my review. 
 
 
CLAMP Gakuen Tanteidan, or CLAMP School Detectives, is the story of three little investigators  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira, who are also members of the three-person elementary student council of their school.  
I guess this has a good story but I didn't see any goal in it. What do they want to happen? What are they trying to find? The only thing I see happening in this anime are there life and times inside the school. They beat bad guys up and discovers themselves after some time.  
It has, fortunately, some exciting action. Kids beating up bad guys looks cool. 
 
Storylines' a bit(just a bit) lame but I give the art some praise. The drawings are very detailed and pretty advanced for its time. The hair-blowing is also pretty good. 
Though I'm a guy I cannot resist saying... the characters are so cute and adorable. 
 
The music is nice. The pretty sound of the singers' voices are very likable. The opening and ending theme, however, is a letdown for me because it had nothing to do with the anime's plot. Little boys and girls pausing beautifully for the audience. 
Once fangirls see them screaming is unavoidable. 
 
The characters are fair enough. Nokoru for me is the blonde eminence of Shuichi Minamino. Suoh is an all around serious character with a pure heart which kind of reminds me of CLAMP's very own Li Shaoran who I like very much. Akira is adorable enough. I felt the girls never contributed anything except blow their pheromone all over Nokoru's staff. 
&quot;I'll give my life to this kindergartener.&quot; One of them said.  
 
Enjoyment... I can't explain much. I found the action very cool and the character design great. I did not like the storyline and romance though.  
 
My overall score is 7 out of 10. This might not appeal much to hardcore fans but it's perfect for kids or beginners.

As great fan of the manga I held up my expectations for this OVA. This anime adaptation of &quot;Fake&quot; focus on the Act 5 of the Manga, published on the second volum which, by itself, reduces very much the potential of the story. The flashback trick of the manga is explored here, but it was still disappointing not to see more. 
 
The manga story holds many detailed complexities, that were basically left out in the anime. However, it's still a great action and mystery tale.  
 
The characters were prefectly characterized: many hints and a lovely flashback are presented for us to know what is going on between them. However, for those that have not read the manga, a mistery remains: who the hell are Bikky and Chal and what are they doing there?  
 
Special kudos for the voice actors, a great cast that worked their job perfectly. Only Dee's voice seemed &quot;not quite right&quot;, but after some minutes I got used to it and now I can't imagine him differently.  
 
This is very enjoyable, much more for the adventure and mystery than for the BL (which, being near to none and not explicit at all, is well done and realistic). 

          
 
       Helpful I watched this simply because it was mentioned by a youtuber talking about the dynamics of gay relationships in anime. As someone fairly new to yaoi in general, I became interested and decided to watch since I was told that while this is an OVA, it's pretty much a stand-alone in and of itself. I have not read the manga, so that might influence my judgement, though I will try to make this as unbiased as possible.  
 
First off, the story: I'm going to be straight up-- other than about five-ten minutes in between, there's really no romance. And the romance that is shown is mostly just some kissing, and once it nearly escalates before being interrupted. So if you're here for the shipping aspect, this really isn't for you! On the other hand, for people who prefer a different type of story, there is a murder mystery going on in the background. Personally, while I'm a really big crime and horror fan myself, I found this unsatisfactory-- it was very, very painfully predictable, and in many spots it really did make sense. I won't go into detail here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it was disappointing as a mystery overall since I was able to figure out pretty much the entire way the story would play out in the first ten minutes-- it was ridiculously simple. 
 
I don't really watch old anime all that often, but I have seen a few (mainly Ai No Kusabi from 1992-1994 and Hunter x Hunter from 1998 and 1999-2001) and both have a cleaner art style that leads me to believe more effort could have been made. The art isn't necessarily BAD, but at times it seems sloppy. However, I was very happy with the more realistic body types-- most of the time in 'gay' anime, the seme tends to have a massive, hulking structure with gargantuan shoulders, while the uke is more of a tiny little feminine dwarf. I'm glad that both of our leads looked like... well, men. Normalish men. That being said, I didn't really like how the eyes were designed on most of the characters, but that can be easily overlooked.  
 
The background music and songs of this OVA weren't bad, but completely forgettable. All of it really lacked the fire to make a real impression, so I really didn't care for them. As for the voice actors, I watched a dub, where they did mostly a good job, other than some parts were they sounded rather flat. 
 
I think the main thing that saved this OVA from being completely terrible was the characters. While I didn't really like the way some of the characters were structured and the things they were saying (there were too many stereotypes, including the 'I'M NOT GAY! guy who just kissed a guy and admitted to having feelings for a guy' guy, the 'let's rape this person just because they totally gave me consent though they are currently struggling as I try to get close to them' guy, and the 'totally nice old person who really isn't as nice as they look' guy). On top of that, some of the dialogues were unnatural because... well, people don't really talk like that... Regardless of all that, however, I found the chemistry between the characters to be endearing, even if some of the slightly racist and homophobic comments haven't really aged all that well.  
 
Overall, this wasn't too bad, but not really what I expected.  
 
I would recommend this if you: like murder mysteries, like simpler murder mysteries, like (just hints) of romance in your anime 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: are here for the romance/yaoi, like more complex mysteries, don't like cliche/predictable plots, are really touchy about slightly assaulty behavior (think classic seme forcing themselves on someone clearly saying no but then the entire situation being treated like a joke...)  
 
Have a great day everyone!   
 


          
 
       Helpful I prefer the manga. The drawing in the anime isn't that good, and I wasn't impressed with the voice-work, either. The plot is the same familiar one as in the manga - though with lesser details, of course. A nice watch, sure, but nothing to be impressed about. (Then again, I think the manga is brilliant, so it is rather hard to beat that :D)

3,4472,131,6.918711513,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation,"The OVA features six separate stories revolving around the cast, some of which border on the bizarre; one of which is an MMORPG environment being played by Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa, and Nanako Kuroi, and another in which Kagami has a ""suggestive"" dream about Konata. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Lucky Star's story mainly portrays the lives of four girls attending a Japanese high school. The setting is mainly based on the city of  Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main character is Konata Izumi, a lazy girl who constantly shirks her schoolwork and instead uses most of her time to watch anime, play video games, and read manga. Although she is lazy, she has also proven to be very intelligent and athletic.
The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move on to their second and third years. However, the anime starts the story with them beginning their second year, and the other high school girls that are seen in the opening are only introduced halfway through the series. The storyline usually includes numerous references to popular past and present manga, anime, and tokusatsu series.
The spin-off manga, Miyakawa-ke no Kūfuku, focuses on the daily lives of two sisters, Hinata and Hikage Miyakawa, who live an impoverished life due to Hinata's wasteful habits.
","Well the thing about this review is it's directly compared to the other series, favorably or unfavorably. And after just writing a Lucky Star review, I thought it was only right that I write a Lucky Star OVA review. In fact, I only got up the energy to write a Lucky Star review to the community. 
 
So, now that I've filled out the preface, it's time to get to the individual qualities of the short movie. Or actually, just medium as an OVA. 
 
1. Story 
Well how does one comment on one story, that's slice of life episodic comedy? 
Well, you rate it on being an episodic, slice of life comedy. 
This one doesn't quite pace as the other one did. And has quite a bit of cool down and then short spurts of comedy. It's not so chatty and eventful as the main series. 
 
In this way it does make it feel a bit more like a movie. But at the same time, it doesn't do what it does quite well as it did with the main series. You expect more out of it than you get. It moves slow and uneventful, and ends before you know it. 
Well at least in it's favor, it ends long before you want it to end. 
 
2. Art 
It's the same great artwork as before. And there's no change at all. 
So there's really nothing to say about this. It's the iconic moe art style we know and love Lucky Star for. 
 
Ten out of ten. 
 
3. Sound 
Well you know...I didn't even notice the sound too much this time around. It doesn't have that memorable opening song that I remember. And it all seemed sort of quiet. Too quiet at times. It didn't really have to have all the music though. 
 
And the character voices were as cute as ever. 
 
4. Character 
I think I have to commend them for spending the time they did on characters like Patricia Martin. But overall, it felt like when it was supposed to be a party, that it was an empty party. I think this part...this...OVA..was lacking in some of the character charm and development that Lucky Star often had. In the case with everything with this OVA, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good. 
 
5. Enjoyment 
Even if an OVA isn't as good, it's a Lucky Star OVA. Meaning we'll love it. 
Seriously, how long were we starved for this? Too long. I went through every second of this thinking how I couldn't believe I was getting to watch more Lucky Star and fearful of every minute I drew closer to the end. It might have not been jam packed with the same about of fun as the main series, but it was still a lot of fun and well worth the watch. 
 
6. Overall 
Overall, it was what the number 8 says. It was very good. And well worth the watch and very much needed, beyond needed. It was almost cruel how long we had to wait. But it wasn't every thing Lucky Star was. I think a person is better off watching Lucky Star the series first, and then watching this because they're still absolutely starved like I was for more. It may not be one hundred percent as good as the original, but it's still got the magic. I don't want anyone to think and to get the impression that because it doesn't shine just as hard as Lucky Star the TV series that it's not every bit a good and enjoyable anime. It's a quality watch and I recommend it to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful This will probably be the shortest review I will ever write. 
 
As I said in my review for the Lucky Star series, KyoAni constantly references and criticizes the anime genre as a whole. Significantly, it also references and criticizes consumers of anime, including those watching the series. This OVA goes exactly one step further, exploring what would happen if the viewers’ volition filters back into the anime. What would happen if the fandom �C and its associated theories, frustrations, and obsessions �C become part of the show itself? Well, you get this OVA, which in Lucky Star fashion follows the same plotless, trope-filled, single-sided characterization that the main series is known for. 
 
For better or worse, you absolutely do need to have seen the main series before seeing this, as this OVA interacts differently with those who are familiar with its characters and style. Watched the series? Yes, you need to watch this too. 


          
 
       Helpful Ahh the Lucky Star OVA. While it didn't fully capture the spirit of the anime series, it's still great that we are fortunate to even see the clan again after the anime was finish, so I can't really complain too much. The only saving grace *for me at lease*  was that Konata was funnier and otaku as ever and I liked Tsukasa more in the movie then in the anime series because she was ""cuter"" I didn't like that the Lucky Channal was live action it was not funny almost unwatchable and it was much shorter then I expected to be only around 43 minutes long

Supporting characters are featured in short chapters.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Josei']","Princess Jellyfish centers on Amamizukan, an apartment building in Tokyo, where the only tenants are otaku women, and where no men are allowed. While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

3,3946,133,6.871320615,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Jarinko Chie,"Jarinko Chie is a movie directed by Takahata in 1981. Based on the very popular manga by Etsumi HARUKI, it is about ten year old Chie, ""the most unfortunate girl in Japan"", who manages her family diner while her unemployed yakuza father and her mother are separated. This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy.  
 
The story is set in Osaka, which has a totally different culture from Tokyo. After the success of the movie, a TV series was made, and Takahata worked as the chief director. 
 
(Source: nausicaa.net)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Seinen']",none,"There are very few words needed to describe this movie. Let's say, it is a classic Takahata.  
 
Do not go in there expecting an emotionally heavy movie like 'Grave of the Fireflies' or even something fantastical like 'Tales of Princess Kaguya'. These movies were magnificent but you cannot compare them to Jarinko Chie because they aren't of the same genre and they aren't trying to achieve the same thing.  
 
'Chie' belongs to the same category as 'My Neighbours The Yamadas', meaning, for this genre, it is one of the best you can get out there. This movie is mature, it is deep but it is very well directed so that it is light and funny with just a pinch of drama. The story is simple and it is just as poignant as any other because that's a story which you believe, which you know can happen, which you know has happened. It is your average dysfunctional family, trying to get back together. This movie has characters who are real and believable and likable. They all have flaws and they all have their distinguished idiosyncrasies and they all come out as fully developed human beings which you can never get enough of.  
 
Sure, technical wise, it is nothing like 'Fireflies' but the style of the animation suits the mood of the story and the quality is actually pretty high. For the dub, the Japanese did a wonderful job but, and I'm gonna say this knowing that many might disagree or even be completely unaware of it, I believe the French dub is really good as well. Trust me, I'm a very demanding person when it comes to dubs and I must give credit where credit is due. The French dub was amazing. 
 
At the end of the day, 'Jarinko Chie' is just a pleasant story that you can watch over and over again because the characters are so true to themselves and you can easily relate to them. This was a movie of my childhood and shall forever remain my favourite from the master Takahata.

(Source: Production I.G)","['Action', 'Samurai', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"I'm surprised that nobody bothered to review this 60 second anime. I get that it is essentially an add for Murphy's Stout (which essentially explains the absolute lack of story and character), but I do believe that something should be emphasized on why this anime has a certain appeal to it. 
 
For a start, I actually liked the art style - for a 60 second anime made in 1997, it actually is really well thought out and certainly stands strong even after the 19 years since its first release. The same goes for sound - the way each samurai enters the bar and the overall ambience they make just to get a stout (combined with the retro cyborg feel that these samurai were aiming for) makes this a unique ad as well as anime, to say the least. 
 
In hindsight, its an ad, but one which makes me want to have stout. Its nostalgic, well drawn, and the sound makes it hold strong even now.

          
 
       Helpful This is basically an advertisement for Murphy's Irish Stout, and its incidents are just as the synopsis says. 
However, it is an excellent ad which relays a strong atmosphere of a post futuristic megalopolis setting. The cyberpunk apocalyptic scenario along with its excellent design, superb choreography and smooth animation makes a very enticing experience for the eyes while an exciting music playing in the background. Production I.G. nailed it. And it ends it with an interesting unpredictable ending that serves like a cherry over a tasty cupcake. 
It delivers an interesting view of a futuristic world. There's not much to say about this 19 years old ad of 60 seconds. It perfectly does its job and is interesting to watch.

3,8500,135,6.808135018,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Haguregumo,"Haguregumo is set in the Bakumatsu, the turbulent period at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, after the ""opening"" of Japan in 1854. The country was being torn apart by competing factions - modernizers trying to apply Western technology and ideas to Japanese society; Imperial loyalists, trying to reassert to the ascendancy of the Emperor; and the forces of the Shogunate, trying to defend the military bureaucracy (bakufu) against all comers. The bakufu organized special police squads, notably the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi, to ""defend public order"" and assassinate opponents. (In popular culture, they are all lumped together as the Shinsengumi.) Covert violence and even open warfare were commonplace. 
 
The movie covers 1866 and 1867. It tells the story of a retired samurai, Kumosuke (or Kumo, for short), who is living quietly, not to say idly, in Edo (old Tokyo) with his wife and two children, a young boy named Shinnosuke and an infant girl, Ohana. While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine. Kumo is forced to use his still-sharp sword skills to defend himself, but he'd basically prefer to stay out of the treacherous political currents. Nonetheless, he ends up saving Ryouma Sakamoto (a famous Westernizer) from the Shinsengumi and teaching Ichimonji the futility of the warrior way.

Based on a long running manga series, which started in the seventies and oh yeah, you can tell. 
The story is of a lackadaisical courier/swordsman who is a master of a twins blade, but prefers to spend his time cheating on his wife, being a terrible father, drinking sake and not doing his job. 
The film is a comedy and manages to be funny at times, while having some truly disturbing scenes. 
The film is set at the closing of the edo period, where anti foreigner warriors are at large and shows the main character coming into contact with a group of them and beating, but not killing them. 
It then shows his carefree life as he enjoys life with his wife, (whose single goal in life seems to be to get some from her husband, when he's not grabbing ass around town) and hanging with his son, (who is looking for a much better father figure, and finds one) and his daughter (a chip of the old block who does as she pleases too.) 
Not much really happens, but it gives insight into what must be a very dated, average, but oddly fun manga series. I recommend watching, you will somewhat enjoy it, though you may get a bitter aftertaste of old school sexism.

There, he is chased by samurai working for the Joker. During his escape, Batman meets up with Catwoman, who reveals everyone else arrived two years earlier (due to Batman being in the outermost area affected by the Quake Engine). He learns from her that all of Gotham City's top criminals have become feudal lords after deceiving the Sengoku daimyō, battling each other until only one state remains. In order to stop the villains from altering history, Batman and Catwoman must get to the Quake Engine in Arkham Castle (formerly the asylum).
Batman discovers that Alfred Pennyworth is also in the past and has built a Batcave outside Edo. When the Joker's troops ambush the hideout, Batman storms his way in his Batmobile towards Arkham Castle, which transforms into a giant robot fortress. Just as Batman confronts the Joker, he is forced to leave and save a mother and child below from being crushed by the robot's hand. He transforms his Batcycle into an armored suit to defeat a sumo Bane and stop the robot hand, only to learn the mother is Harley Quinn in disguise. As Batman is surrounded by the Joker's minions, he is suddenly whisked away by ninja led by Eian of the Bat Clan of Hida.
Batman learns the Bat Clan helped Nightwing, the Red Hood, Robin and the Red Robin upon their arrival and the clan has followed a prophecy of a foreign bat ninja restoring order to the land. Robin gives Batman an invitation from Grodd to a nearby hot spring. There, Grodd explains he intended to send the villains far away so he could take Gotham for himself, but Batman's interference sent them all to feudal Japan instead. Batman and Grodd agree to work together to return to Gotham. Batman, Grodd, Catwoman, the Bat-Family and the Bat Clan battle the Joker and his forces by the river.
They defeat the Joker and Harley, but Grodd turns on Batman, revealing his alliance with Two-Face before the Joker and Harley escape and blow up their own ship, taking Batman down with it. Having captured a power converter from Harley, Catwoman attempts to bargain with Grodd in bringing her back to Gotham; however, they need to obtain other power converters from the Penguin, Poison Ivy and Deathstroke to complete the Quake Engine. Two days later, Batman recovers from his wounds and encourages the Bat-Family to learn the ways of the ninja in order to defeat Grodd.

The Bat-Family saves Catwoman and Grodd before the Joker merges all of the castles into the super robot Lord Joker.
An injured Grodd gives the control of his army of monkeys to Batman; Robin enables them to merge into one giant samurai monkey to battle the Joker's robot. The samurai monkey then combines with a swarm of bats to form the Batgod to defeat Lord Joker before the Bat-Family storm into the castle to battle the villains. The Joker reveals to Batman that as farmers, he and Harley planted special flowers that triggered their memories back once they bloomed. As the castle falls, Batman and the Joker engage in a sword fight. Using his ninjutsu skills, Batman defeats the Joker.

","I overall liked this movie. Characters and story are fun and interesting, art is beautiful and it refrences feudal Japan and Batman comics quite well and music is good fit for this series as well (for similar reasons as artstyle). But where this series looses points in my eyes are pretty much all action scenes.  
 
During action scenes there was too much noise on the screen and thus it was hard to follow what was happening during action scenes. After pretty much every action scene I was like: ""Yep.. some things happened during that scene. Although I don't know what excactly"". Also what made those action scenes bad where nonsensicle reveals during them. Okay.. Now we have robots. Okay they had managed to build a submarine. Okay. Instead of reveals like that I would have liked to see more strategy during fights (f.e using different fighting styles or techniques during fights, more ambushes and backstabbing during fights etc.). Currently it felt like most reveals came out of the arse. Now everyone is immune to influence of Grogg, and suddenly everyone who is evil is not. Such reveals seriously dampered suspense. Because this ova was quite action heavy, low quality of action scenes seriously lowered my overall score of this series. 
 
That is why I give this series 6/10. Eventhough this series (especially outside  
the action scenes) was quite well made. 

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
Good Ol' Kazuki Nakashima. This is the madman that wrote Gurren Lagann and Kill La Kill. Now he has returned to tackle the DC comics universe and have his own run on Batman. Have you ever wondered what it would be like if Batman were as gloriously stupid and over the top as TTGL? Your wish has been granted! 
 
Plot:  
 
Gorilla Grodd has invented a time machine and ends up sending the Batman Family and several of the Dark Knight's rogues' gallery back to feudal Japan. Why Nakashima went with Grodd when he is supposed to be a Flash villain, I honestly have no idea. Batman and Grodd are the last to tumble through the time portal, so when they arrive the others have already been there for 2 years. The Batman villains have each created their own fiefdoms and are fighting each other for domination of Japan. Each of the Batman villains is using a giant, transforming robot castle to aid in their conquest. It is later explained that Grodd built these robots for them , but this makes no sense because Grodd arrived at the same time as Batman and they already had the robots when Batman arrived. Nakashima gives no fucks. Batman is aided by Alfred and 4 of the Robins: Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and Damian Wayne. Oh and Catwoman is also there. Together they must ally with a Ninja clan called the Bat Clan and defeat The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, The Penguin, and Deathstroke. So far this sounds like the kind of plot that would happen all the time in the goofy Silver Age of comics, but Nakashima soon adds his own unique touch. We soon get scenes like Damian Wayne summoning all the monkeys in Japan and having them randomly fuse into a giant Bio-mech monkey. The Bio-mech monkey then fuses with all the bats in Japan to form a giant Adam West Batman. Sadly they don't end up throwing galaxies at each other, but I'm glad Nakashima still has his old genius. Batman defeats the bad guys, everyone goes back to the present, and this will NEVER be referenced again. The End. 
 
Characters: 
 
Nakashima's take on Batman and the Joker isn't too bad honestly. The only characters that felt really off to me  were Damian Wayne and Deathstroke. Then again, US Comics change writers so often that no characters are honestly that consistent. Scott Snyder Batman is not the same character as Frank Miller's Batman, who is entirely different from Tim Burton's Batman. All of them are named Bruce Wayne and have the same basic background, but their personalities, relationships, the way they talk, etc is all completely different. Nakashima clearly had fun writing these characters and his fun is actually infectious. It seems he does have a decent familarity with the DC Universe. This actually makes sense. Have you noticed that TTLG is basically just a comedy version of the 80s comic Crisis on Infinite Earth's? In that comic, a super powerful being called The Monitor is willing to use any means necessary to save the Universe from a powerful being called the Anti-Monitor. The Anti-Monitor comes from a universe of all anti-matter and wishes to destroy the positive matter universes. In TTLG, the Spiral King wishes to use any means to stop the Anti-Spiral from destroying the universe. The Anti-Spiral comes from an alternate universe that produces anti-spiral energy whereas life in our universe produces spiral energy. Yeah...I think Nakashima might be a DC fan. 
 
Art: 
 
The art is honestly the weak point of the movie. This is that same shit CG as Berserk 2016 and this was produced by the Studio that brought us Pop Team Epic. Yeah...it's pretty bad. 
 
 
Overall: 
 
This is a classic Nakashima anime. It's fucking stupid as all hell, but it's fun. Also this time he doesn't have a massive budget or his pal Hiroyuki Imaishi to help him out. While I still consider Kill la Kill and TTLG to be obscenely overrated, I've gained a new respect and affection for Nakashima. It takes a certain kind of genius to make stories THAT stupid and ludicrous. His writing is honestly quite unique and I look forward to his next work.

Bane was hilarious in the brief scene he was in and 2 face was a total badass! And the Joker was a great villain as usual along with Grodd who was surprisingly played in big role in this movie. Never thought Catwoman would make such a great Waifu. The fights at the end could have gone on longer, but they had to fit it all into 85 minutes. 
 
And I even think that each character played a roll as each of the Feudal Lords at the time of Oda Nobunaga.  
 
ENJOYMENT 
I came into this movie not expecting much and ended up getting a fantastic action packed joy ride with a great story.

","My enjoyment for these could've been much better. Perhaps because the last Sekai Ichi thing I watched was the movie, which was basically my favorite yaoi anime/movie/ova I've watched, this felt underwhelming. The stories didn't feel entirely complete to me. They left me wanting more, but in a ""this is missing/lacking more than I care for"" kind of way.  
 
The first one was really, really adorable and sweet. And the parts that weren't present time were fantastic. If it focused only on their high school days, I probably would've given it a much higher score. I feel like this OVA would've been better if it either did that, or was more than one OVA so it could successfully pull off going back and forth.  
 
The second one was... mild? Not boring, but not interesting. I guess mediocre is the best way to put it. Again it felt really like it was lacking/missing/incomplete.  
 
Don't think I'm just expecting too much out of OVAs... because I've liked other OVAs. I liked the OVA I watched for Junjo Romantica, for example. Was it a waste of time? No, I wouldn't say that. But I also wouldn't go out of my way to rewatch it, either. It probably doesn't deserve an overall 7, but I do like the art, sound, characters, and /parts/ of it.

The teaser preview at the end of Dimensional Sniper included references to van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" series.

As I enjoyed previous Conan movies featuring Kaito Kid, I was really looking forward to this one. Conan movies are not without flaws, but I can usually look past those flaws based on enjoyment alone - but for this movie, not so much. 
 
Let's jam: 
 
Story (3/10) 
The story is quite straightforward: the Suzuki family wants to organize an exhibition featuring all of van Gogh's ""Sunflower"" paintings with the help of a group of hand-picked individuals called the ""Seven Samurai"", but for some reason Kaito Kid decides to get involved. This in turn causes the police to become involved, as everyone tries to protect the paintings from Kid while making sure the exhibition goes off without a hitch. 
There were two things that I found annoying about the story: 1) it was not well-executed. It felt like the writers wanted to make the story more interesting by adding random plotlines and events unrelated to the main story, but this only served to make the movie unnecessarily complicated. Since the characterization was weak to begin with, the movie was unable to justify these creative decisions. 2) It was quite predictable. Anyone who is familiar with the Conan franchise can pretty much tell how this story will play out after the first 15 minutes. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how the writers further develop the story, but in this case it definitely did not enhance the viewing experience. 
 
Art (7/10) 
The movie was well-animated, employing bright colors and beautiful shots of New York City and Tokyo. The animators also did a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for various scenes. One sequence taking place on an airplane really stood out for its great visuals and intense action. 
 
Sound (5/10) 
For the most part, the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and complemented the movie. Not the most memorable soundtrack of all time, but effective nonetheless. I do have to say that the ending song was terrible, and did not belong there at all. 
 
Characters (3/10) 
Characters can make or break a movie, and in this case the characters did the latter. We all know that the new characters introduced in a Conan movie are one-shot characters, but the Seven Samurai were boring and generic even for one-shot characters. When the writers tried to utilize them to further the plot, it was rendered ineffective because none of them possess any personality whatsoever. It felt like they were introduced for the sake of the storyline, and then completely abandoned. There was also an old lady character who had some sort of personal connection to one of the Sunflower paintings, but the writers spent extremely little time sketching out her storyline, therefore stripping it of all its emotional value. 
On the other hand, it was nice to revisit the rivalry between Conan and Kaito Kid. For some reason though, most of the main characters in the Conan universe play extremely small roles in the storyline and mostly let stuff happen to them, and even Conan doesn't do as much detective work as usual. Kaito Kid may be as charming as always, but the plot doesn't do him any favors as well. 
 
Enjoyment (6/10) 
I enjoyed most parts of the movie, especially the action scenes, while other scenes were utterly unenjoyable. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't look past the flimsy plot and ineffective characterization. 
 
Verdict 
Out of all Conan movies, this is one of my least favorite, along with the Jolly Roger one. For long-time viewers of Conan, I would recommend re-watching a previous movie featuring Kaito Kid instead of seeing this one. For anyone new to the Conan franchise, I would recommend movie #7 or #10 instead, since both feature well-executed and exciting storylines that also further develop the relationships among the main characters.  
 
I know the team behind Conan can do better than this, so I'll be looking forward to the 20th movie!

          
 
       Helpful Story 6/10: 
-The story is your usual Jirokichi Suzuki vs KID, but for the FIRST time he didn't collect the art to lure KID but for the pride of Japan?!. For Jiro-ojisan to have a reason other than luring KID to add it to his biography doesn't go well with him. 
- The culprit's motive was weak and there was barely any smart deductions. 
- Hibara's screen time was wasted randomly, while there could have been a well developed side story using it instead(the 4 scenes did nothing to the movie or development). 
+It was nice seeing Sonoko going around with her uncle to formal events and being more active. 
 
Art 7/10: 
The new characters are drawn plainly, but KID, Conan, and Ran looked great through out the movie and especially in the climax scene when Conan shows a touched expression and says ""KIDo"". 
 
Sound 9/10: 
BG OST wasn't anything unusual, but the credits song OH!Rival! was great? 
 
Character 6/10: 
Weak culprit, weak character development of the introduced team and at the end you forget that some of them even exists. I honestly felt like 6 new characters was too much and they barely have any bg, development, or presence. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10: 
-It was definitely disappointing for a KID movie. A lot of things weren't explained probably, especially with Charlie's hatred toward KID! we get no explanation to why he was in rage the whole movie and no worthy confrontation, we don't even know how they know each other.  
+ The final part of the movie was the most if not the only enjoyable part! btw, what's with the latest movies where Ran saves the day.  
 
Overall 6/10: 
--------------- 
The lowest score I've ever given to a DC movie till this day! I definitely was disappointed since I'm a Hibara and Kid fan, and wasting these two characters in the movie was a shame. 

          
 
       Helpful The most recent Detective Conan film has come and gone, and this one is a bit different. Similar to the 10th movie (Requiem of the Detectives), we have our littlest detective out to protect the fine arts, though in this case, Conan must save one of Van Goh's most important paintings, the Sunflowers. Is this movie an amazing art heist wannabe, or a copied flop? Oh, and did I mention Kaito Kid? Cause yeah, Kaito Kid. 
 
Story (6/10): After the Suzuki Zaibatsu purchases the originally thought destroyed 2nd Sunflowers painting, Kaito Kid essentially declares that he'll steal it. But since this is completely outside of the thiefs usual M.O., all characters involved become suspicious, especially after the messages and methods become violent. Conan and friends are now on a deadline to get the Sunflowers Exhibition up and running, but it still doesn't answer the main problem: why is Kaito Kid after the paintings?  
 
The story here is a bit of a mixed bag, to say the least. There's a lot right but enough wrong that it's hard not to address. The good things are that it really takes a smart approach to trying to defeat Kid, showing all the work that goes into everything behind the scenes. It's really quite fun to see just what Suzuki Jiro does to show off his extreme wealth. All the stuff that connects with the Sunflower paintings themselves is also interesting, and a little heartwarming.  
 
There are some problems with the movie. The resolution to who is after the paintings is WEAK. And I don't just mean weak, I mean WEAK AS FUCK. (Yes, f-bomb worthy weak.) True, the clues do tell you who it is, but God almighty is it a letdown. In connection to that, there's a random confession to a crime dead center in the climax that basically comes out of nowhere and does nothing to change the plot AT ALL. Also almost everything to do with Kaito Kid is basically worthless, and yes as a fan of his, that sucks to say. I'll elaborate more in the below section, but suffice to say, this is probably the weakest movie that Kid has been a part of.  
 
Overall it isn't a bad story, but man, the parts that are bad are standout bad. 
 
Art (8/10):  As is per the norm, the art is excellent, giving all the scenes wonderful color and action. Though I must point out that there are a few 'quality' background scenes here and there that are a bit more standout than I would usually critique.  
 
Sound (7/10): Back to basic Conan movie music, but as usual that isn't a bad thing. Though I must point out the track that plays during the climax of the movie, as it was really damn good.  
 
Character (6/10): I do have some positives and negatives in relation to the regular cast. First the disappointing: it feels like they dumbed down Conan and Ai. While nothing extreme or distracting, it just feels like the two smartest characters in the show almost don't have that much of an impact in solving the crime. Conan doesn't have to work hard to figure anything out and really only gets like 2 clues total to work with in the entire movie. It just feels like he got pushed out of his own movie. 
 
Not all is bad though. The Suzuki's (Jiro and Sonoko) are actually more entertaining here than they've been in a while.  Ran, her Dad, and Inspector Nakamori are also treated with respect and given quite a lot to do here. Basically the main side characters here are treated well and are really fun to watch.   
 
Kaito Kid is also barely in the movie. Technically he is in most of it, but he doesn't even have a freaking line until 20 minutes near the end. Despite being the main 'antagonist', he's just a non-factor in the story too much of the time. It honestly feels like the movie is trying to play Kid like he was back when his introduction was a bit more mysterious, but by today, where his manga is a thing and he had his own anime last year, it just doesn't work anymore.   
 
With the movie exclusive characters, they are just boring and forgettable. True, Inspector Charlie is the best of the bunch, but he's ultimately not that important in the long run. The other characters have literally 3-8 lines of dialogue and no personality at all. Hell, I don't even remember their freaking names after just watching it. They're close to the top of a Worst DC Movie Cast list for being just there and irrelevant by the end.   
 
(As is traditional at this point, I need to make my complaint: why are the freaking Detective Boys in this damn movie? Their scenes are worthless and they literally serve no purpose. I don't want to hate on them, since as Quarter of Silence has shown us, when given real purpose, they are great characters. But here? They should've been excluded from the entire second half when the exhibition takes center stage. Hell, even the Professor is kind of awkwardly shoved into the movie, with all his scenes being really bad comedy.) 
 
Enjoyment (7/10): I did have more fun with this movie than I did the last one, if you can believe it. Probably because I do like a good art heist film. Granted, as noted above, the second half is where I started getting lost. While the actual climax is really fun, I was just disappointed that we didn't really get a Conan vs. Kid film. I really should know by now that we'll never get one of those until a miracle happens, but I still held hope that this would be the one. Again, while it seems like I'm complaining, I really did have some fun with this movie. (Also there's a tiny call back to something from the 18th movie here, which is kinda cute.) 
 
Detective Conan: The Hellfire Sunflowers is probably one of the more average movies in the series, though it isn't awful by any means. While the side characters are really given a time to shine, the story has some major flaws in its second half and doesn't really feel like the Conan/Kid focused movie that it's trying to be. If you're a DC fan, I as always recommend that you watch it at least once for completions sake, but non fans aren't going to find anything interesting here. 
 
6/10 = average by DC standards; second half is weak, with the mystery reveal failing to impress; there are better Conan/Kid movies, like the 14th (being the best); the main older side characters do kind of get a chance to shine;

(Source: Wikipedia) ","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","In the future, a race of insectoid aliens, known as the Uchuu Kaijuu or Space Monsters , seem dedicated to the eradication of humans as the latter takes its first steps away from the Solar System, and they are getting closer and closer to Earth. Humanity has responded by developing space-going battleships and giant fighting robots. These complex robots―RX-7 Machine Weapons―are actually an advanced type of fighting suit, piloted by a single occupant. As advanced as they are, however, they are being used as trainers for a new weapon, the Gunbuster. Pilot candidates are selected from the best and brightest youth on Earth and the Lunar colony. These are trained at schools around the world.
In the year 2023, six years after the first battles with the aliens (the actual battle started in the year 2015 however due to time dilation, two years went by on Earth by the end of the battle), and centers on young Noriko Takaya (タカヤ?ノリコ Takaya Noriko) (voice: Noriko Hidaka). Although Noriko's father was a famous admiral in the space fleet who went missing following one of the first battles of the war, her own talents as a pilot are questionable―especially when compared to the other students. Nonetheless, she has entered a training school on Okinawa, where she is largely influenced by her instructor, Kōichirō ?ta (""Coach ?ta"") (voice: Norio Wakamoto), who was one of Admiral Takaya's crew. He has faith that she will overcome her early clumsiness, while other students are critical of her inability, referring to Noriko as the ""daughter of defeat"".
Noriko idolizes the beautiful, competent and talented Kazumi Amano (アマノ?カズミ Amano Kazumi) (voice: Rei Sakuma). Amano is the top RX-7 pilot at the school, and likely the entire world. Coach ?ta shows the extra training which Amano creates for herself, inspiring Noriko to look within herself for strengths which she did not know that she had.
Only two Gunbuster pilots from each school will be selected for the real mission. Amano, of course, will be going, and all of the others want the second slot on the team. Takaya is determined to win, not only to be with Amano but also to find (or avenge) her father. She is thrilled to discover that she has in fact been chosen as the second Japanese pilot.
Following that selection, conflict between Takaya and other students comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, ?ta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground―but does nothing. He is there to observe, and perhaps to save Takaya's life, if the combat gets too intensive.
Takaya is on the defensive from the start, and the older student humiliates her by action and over the radio. As Takaya's RX-7 is pummeled, Noriko realizes that her difficulties are a case of sensory overload―she is getting too much information from the electronic monitoring systems. She turns off her monitors, but as the systems go dark, her opponent is infuriated by the perceived insult and prepares the final, killing blow. Just as it appears that Noriko is doomed, she destroys her opponent's RX-7 with a ""Thunder Kick"". Her opponent muses that the school rookie has beat her with an advanced maneuver which she hadn't been taught. This is the proof that ?ta was seeking, that Noriko had an innate ability which would be invaluable in the battles to come.
Together, with Coach ?ta and Amano, Takaya is sent into space to train with other representatives from all over the solar system in preparation for the attack upon the space monsters. There they are introduced to a Soviet pilot from the moon base by the name of Jung Freud (voice: Maria Kawamura). On their first training mission, Takaya and Amano are stopped by Jung, and challenged to a duel. Amano and Jung become completely involved in the fight, as Noriko trails along, and all three get lost within the machinery of the space station. The fight stops midway, when all three come in contact with the first space monster that was defeated and captured.
Once they return they are scolded by their coach, but because of their importance to the missions success as well as building feelings between the coach and them, they are let go with a simple warning. Jung later apologizes for her challenge, and thus begins a friendship with the two.
As they move farther into space, the young pilots are placed in their quarters for subspace traveling. On a dare, Takaya is sent into the hangars and meets a male space pilot named Toren Smith (voice: Kazuki Yao). Amano comes into doubt of Takaya's abilities and asks the Coach to end their partnership. Takaya overhears the conversation and ends up partnering with Smith instead.
The first true battle between the aliens begin, and the humans realize how vastly outmaneuvered and outnumbered they are. They are able to retreat with limited casualties, but Takaya has lost Smith, and gained an uncontrollable fear towards deep space combat. As their second battle approaches, Takaya is determined to improve and asks the Coach for private lessons. Jung finds out and thinking that she doing so to control Gunbuster, challenges her in space. But even before they are able to fight, Takaya breaks down within her suit and is taken to the infirmary.
The captain decides to retreat to Earth, but the fleet is attacked in sub-space, leading to the destruction of the majority of their forces. Once they reach Earth's orbit, only the Exelion and a few minor cruisers are still active. Though their struggle appears bleak, Takaya manages to summon up her strength for the sake of her friends and crew members. She takes control of the incomplete Gunbuster and uses its high-powered weaponry to force the enemy to retreat. The battle is over, but those who remain are faced with the harsh reality of war and its aftermath.
Afterwards, the three pilots return to Earth, where things have changed significantly. Due to the effects of time dilation, 10 years of relative time has passed on Earth while the pilots were in space. Takaya's former nemesis who had previously challenged her at school is now the coach for new pilots. Her best friend, Kimiko, is now a mother with a 3-year-old daughter, and Earth has been working on a 70 km long space ship as a form of defense in the event of a space monster attack.
While in a peaceful lull, Takaya and friends try to re-adjust to living in a world that has already passed them by. Takaya tries to reconnect with her friend, while Amano tries to share her feelings with the Coach. The peace is broken, however, when Earth is notified that a space monster fleet of unprecedented size is headed towards Earth. After many arguments, the idea of sending the old Exelion as an unmanned black hole bomb, is proposed. The Gunbuster is nominated to escort the bomb there, and then to come home.
Takaya and Amano, in separate ships which combine into Gunbuster, are sent out, a trip that will last an hour or more to them, but half a year to everyone back on Earth. As they almost reach their goal, Amano breaks down, admitting that she does not want go forward, since each second forward means the longer she is away from their Coach, who is now dying from space radiation. Takaya is able to convince her to continue, and their mission is a success. Upon returning, they are relieved to learn that the Coach is still alive; he and Amano then get married.
The final episode takes place 15 years later. Amano has lived on Earth during this time, but after the Coach passes away, she decides to take on a final mission. The space monsters have resurfaced, and in retaliation Earth has been building a much larger black hole bomb, which has been created using the mass of Jupiter pressured into the size of the moon.  Known as Buster Machine III, this weapon is the size of a small planet. When detonated, the bomb and 3,000 'slave mines' placed around the center of the galaxy, will cause a black hole to be formed thereby sucking in and destroying the space monsters.
Amano is sent back into space to board the new ship Eltreum, where mobile suits called Sizzlers (buster sized machines, piloted individually) are now used in combat. With the crew present to welcome Amano, she and Takaya share an emotional reunion, though the absence has felt much longer for the former. Takaya has difficulty coming to terms with the fact that so much time has passed on Earth, after only 6 months relative to her.
When the final battle begins, Amano is ordered to man the Gunbuster with Takaya, and both fight alongside others to defend the bomb. The alien army is fended off, allowing the black hole bomb to be set. However, when the time comes to activate, they find out the enemies' attacks have damaged 2% of the 'slave generators' required for implosion. Amano and Takaya decide to dive down into the core of Buster Machine III and activate it by using one of Gunbuster's two Degeneracy reactors, even though doing so means they will likely be unable to leave without suffering severe relativistic time dilation during their escape.
After the bomb is set off, Noriko and Kazumi spend 12,000 Earth years objective traveling home, although for them only hours or days have passed. Upon arriving in Earth orbit in the damaged Gunbuster, the pilots cannot make contact with anyone nor see any sign of habitation on the planet, suggesting that human civilization is long gone. However, their despair is instantly dispelled when a massive light pattern suddenly appears on the planet saying ""WELCOME HOM?!"" spelled out in simplified Japanese (""オカエリナサイ"". The final letter ""イ"", however, is reversed, which indicates the current civilization was mimicking the bygone language). Delighted that their planet is alive and well, the pilots bid the Gunbuster farewell and return to Earth.","These short episodes came with the original videos and star Amano and Noriko as they educate the viewer on the science and history of their universe.

For example, the Italia Veneziano character is into pasta and women. The Deutsche (German) bishi loves potatoes and sausages, and Nippon is an otaku boy.

(Source: ANI)","['Comedy', 'Historical', 'Parody']",none,"Overview: 
 
Cue the squealing fangirls! Today I review the 2nd part of Hetalia. 
 
 
Story and characters: 3/10 
 
As a huge fan of history, I really liked the concept of Hetalia with people representing countries and felt it was a MASSIVE waste of potential. It has a lot of comedy potential because countries typically act only in rational self interest and often commit horrible deeds that they try to rationalize. If countries were people, almost all of them would be complete fucking assholes! A few notable exceptions would be China and India, who abuse themselves but haven't really been too bad towards anyone else...at least relative to other countries. 
 
What problems did I have with Hetalia? Firstly, Hetalia doesn't even attempt to teach history along with the cheap laughs. It is 100% slapstick, fanservice for the girls, and cheap ethnic stereotypes. Although I enjoyed getting to see what stereotypes Japan has about other nations, since they are often quite different from those we have here in the US. The only problem is that the mangaka who created the original web comic never seemed to have a very good grasp of history. Some of the characterizations are simply, objectively wrong. For example, Germany is a loveable jerk who is portrayed as always being an asshole, but he is always just a mild asshole. Russia is portrayed as a schizophrenic psychopath who switches between sickeningly sweet to a psychotic killing machine and back without warning or reason.

On the other hand, German civilization like The Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, and the 1st German Empire had the cleanest human rights record in Europe for 400 years and were the nicest, warmest, and greatest neighbors anyone could have... then suddenly went on a killing rampage that would make the fucking Mongols blush, killed 17 million civilians in cold blood, and actually formulated a plan to kill 80% of Eastern Europe or just over 100 million people following a German victory and enslave the other 20%. Germany even meticulously planned how they would slaughter some of their own allies like the Latvians, who killed their entire Jewish population without even being told to do so, just to impress the Germans and lick the Germans' boots. Someone bows down to you, worships you like a God, and you callously slaughter them anyways? Who the FUCK does that shit!? The same country that interbreeds with a neighbor for hundreds of years, then out of the fucking blue declares them sub-human and burns down their capital block by block until NOTHING of historical value is left standing and over 500,000 civilians are dead and bloody in the streets. Germany is NOT consistent! Germany is absolutely insane, completely unpredictable, and overwhelmingly horrifying. Just like Russia's character from Hetalia. How could the mangaka have fucked up this bad?! Also America needs to be WAY more of an asshole, as does England and Japan.

Also the English dub is amazing and features some of the best voice actors working in the US. Patrick Seitz and his wild screaming in a cheesy German accent took this series to the end zone. He put the whole fucking team on his back and he delivered! God bless that man!

       Helpful Overview: 
 
Cue the squealing fangirls! Today I review the 2nd part of Hetalia. 
 
 
Story and characters: 3/10 
 
As a huge fan of history, I really liked the concept of Hetalia with people representing countries and felt it was a MASSIVE waste of potential. It has a lot of comedy potential because countries typically act only in rational self interest and often commit horrible deeds that they try to rationalize. If countries were people, almost all of them would be complete fucking assholes! A few notable exceptions would be China and India, who abuse themselves but haven't really been too bad towards anyone else...at least relative to other countries. 
 
What problems did I have with Hetalia? Firstly, Hetalia doesn't even attempt to teach history along with the cheap laughs. It is 100% slapstick, fanservice for the girls, and cheap ethnic stereotypes. Although I enjoyed getting to see what stereotypes Japan has about other nations, since they are often quite different from those we have here in the US. The only problem is that the mangaka who created the original web comic never seemed to have a very good grasp of history. Some of the characterizations are simply, objectively wrong. For example, Germany is a loveable jerk who is portrayed as always being an asshole, but he is always just a mild asshole. Russia is portrayed as a schizophrenic psychopath who switches between sickeningly sweet to a psychotic killing machine and back without warning or reason. The writer basically swapped the 2 characters. Russia isn't sweet or nice to its neighbors...EVER! Russia is the consistent, lovable asshole. On the other hand, German civilization like The Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, and the 1st German Empire had the cleanest human rights record in Europe for 400 years and were the nicest, warmest, and greatest neighbors anyone could have... then suddenly went on a killing rampage that would make the fucking Mongols blush, killed 17 million civilians in cold blood, and actually formulated a plan to kill 80% of Eastern Europe or just over 100 million people following a German victory and enslave the other 20%.

       Helpful I was blown with laughter when I first watch Hetalia! It made me like many of our worlds countries! 
 
To start off I been only watching the english dub version. That's because so I can hear each person's unique accents, which are great by the way cause the english voice actors did a very good job trying to capture each countries own accent! 
 
I give story an 8 because they do kinda teach you a few events that happen in world history, although each episode is only about 5 minutes long.  
 
The characters are awesome! I like how the anime captures each country's stereotype. For example America is always seen eating burgers and he talks like those idiot people who are always saying ""dude!"" and France often acts like a pervert and is sometimes made fun of his weakling nature. Russia doesn't have no fear which fits well with his country since they are trained to show no weakness, and of course Italy is seen as a useless person in battle, thus given his name.  
Hetalia is a funny comedy you need to see! 9 out of 10!

       Helpful Halo one of the biggest franchises in gaming history, and know with the help of 343 Industries and some of Japan's greatest directors and story makers we get Halo Legends. 
 
Halo Legends has 9 episode's, with different story's and characters, and almost all of them are well writing and with great story to keep you entertained. If your a Halo fan those nine story's will give you new insite and a new look on the Halo franchise and I'm sure for those who like Anime also will have some enjoyment in this small packaged. 
 
Halo has always been know'n for their beautiful soundtracks, and they return in Halo Legends, many of them redone and it makes you come more in to the story. While I have some complaiment with the artwork and sound, some of the episode could have gotten better animation then it did, although this didn't ruin all that much, they could have spent some more money and time on the animation so it feels more real then i did. 
 
 I'm sure all Halo fans like myself will enjoy this, and if never have played Halo or been so interested in Halo this is your chance to watch what some of the story in Halo is all about.  


          
 
       Helpful Okay it might be a bit early for a review but with 2 episodes down I can only see it getting better, at worst remaining at the same level of excellence they have achieved so far. The interesting use of varying styles is brilliant as it changes what to expect for each episode. Overall the storys are great, not only beacuse of the brilliant writers but also because it has been said they follow Halo cannon and therfore ARE part of the Halo universe we all know and love. Hopefully the remaining episodes do continue this great series and keep it at it's current level, just have a few more weeks to wait till they all have aired (YAY Waypoint) though I must say the last episode is the one I'm looking forward to the most....what can I say I love parodies >_< all in all great start can't wait to see the rest!

The year is 1996.  
 
As the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to escalate, with the conflict having now extended its reach to even the Moon and Mars, another sinister threat begins to emerge in the background. The alien race from Grados begin to take pre-emptive military action to conquer the Earth in an attempt to prevent the ever-spreading threat that it poses from stretching its hand of power to even the farthest confines of the Uldoria system where the Gradosians reside. The impending conflict first makes itself known on the planet Mars where members of the Cosmic Culture Club, an exchange program created by the UN, are currently arriving on the planet. Several large piloted machines appear, caught in the midst of a desperate struggle. These machines called SPTs or Super Powered Tracers are a form of advanced weapons technology that Grados possesses.

But are they even willing to listen? And even if they are, can they stop fighting among one another to face the conflict they are now beset by before it's too late? 
 
Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner or Blue Comet SPT Layzner can be cleanly divided into two parts and since they are significantly different from one another I'll refer to them as Part 1 (Episodes 1-24) and Part 2 (Episode 26 onward) within this review (Note: Episode 25 is a recap). The first part feels almost like a love letter to the real robot genre which, by the time Layzner had aired in 1985, had managed to establish that it was here to stay. Layzner, in many instances, very clearly derives inspiration from its predecessors. A number of shout-outs are seemingly given to many of the series that helped in bringing this new era about, at least from what I can see. Don't believe me? Well, I'll point out a few of the most noticeable ones that can be found in the series. The name ""Blue Comet"" is almost definitely a reference of sorts to Char Aznable, whose moniker in Mobile Suit Gundam is the ""Red Comet,"" and the V-MAX system on the Layzner can boost its speed to three times its normal operating output which is highly probable to be another reference to the speed at which Char is said to move in his Mobile Suit. Interestingly, the V-MAX system also seems to have had a significant influence down the road itself as it appears to be very similar to the Trans Am system seen in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. There are certain mecha designs in Layzner that are reminiscent of the Variable Fighters from Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Several character designs and the personality traits of certain characters also seem to be derived from those in a number of prior real robot series as well. Gosterro's counterpart would likely be Quamzin Kravshera of Macross, possessing similar character designs, in addition to both being members of the military, as well as being killers of their own allies. Gresco is similar to Drake Luft from Aura Battler Dunbine, both in design, and in certain personality aspects, too. Eiji's character starts to physically resemble Chirico Cuvie from one of Ryousuke Takahashi's prior works, Armored Trooper Votoms, as the series progresses. Eiji's spacesuit also has a red left shoulder, probably a reference to the Red Shoulders of Votoms (the red is painted on the right side of the mechs in this series). Eiji shares the same voice actor (Kazuhiko Inoue) as the main character from another of Takahashi's prior series, Crinn Cashim from Fang of the Sun Dagram. Ahmos Gale resembles Jean Paul Rochina of Armored Trooper Votoms and serves a somewhat similar purpose to the main character in both series. That's just to name a few. Still, I found it pretty interesting and perhaps you may as well. Part 2 of Layzner, on the other hand, seems to have taken significant inspiration from several films. Perhaps most notable/likely to have influenced Layzner would be The Terminator and Star Wars. There are also very clear instances where it seems to have been influenced by Indiana Jones or horror movies as well. I could be wrong about this one, but the Death Demon Squad also seem to have certain scenes that are lightly reminiscent of elements from A Clockwork Orange. It seems Takahashi is quite the fan of many films as there are often numerous shout-outs to them in the series that he has worked on. Also, and since I haven't seen it I can't say with complete certainty, but based on my very limited knowledge of the series, Part 2 of Layzner may have been partially inspired by Fist of the North Star. 
 
Based on the alternate reality premise of the series one would probably be able to easily assume that there would a commentary on the Cold War within the show. Indeed, this is what is being criticized on the surface. However, Layzner is not only offering a critique of America and the Soviet Union's tension during this time (note as well that the Cold War was still ongoing in 1985 when the series was airing), but perhaps also Imperial Japan in some ways. However, back to the main theme of this show. At its core this series resolutely proclaims its support for mutual understanding and cooperation between all peoples and individuals. There should be no distinction of race (whether human or alien) or country and everyone should be able to help one another as fellow intelligent beings. Right off the bat, the Cold War tension between the two superpowers is immediately called into question when we learn that Eiji is of two different races yet still loves both Grados and the Earth. What it's attempting to say is that despite being of two different places he is still a person, just as even though two countries are two different places they are still all comprised of people, and all people deserve to be treated with respect. Early on, we learn that Eiji has been forced to make the difficult decision of making the trip to Earth, alone, away from his family, while being branded a traitor, to warn the blue planet of the impending crisis that they face.  
 
One of the big ideas in this series is that you should not base your opinion of person on your first impression alone. There is a lot more to them than meets the eye and it repeatedly turns your first impressions of a person around, sometimes multiple times with a single character. This idea applies for the both the characters within the series and for the viewer of the series as well. David's first impression of Eiji is not a positive one at all. It's kind of clever how they make him have a poor first impression of Eiji while simultaneously doing everything they can to try to make the viewer dislike him without leaving the realm of being realistic, only to completely change both impressions as the series progresses. Early in the series David will probably irritate the viewer, but at the same time you should keep in mind that he's young, and that he has just watched his best friend die right in front of him (I don't see people complaining about a character from a certain series that features giants who behaves in a very similar way). After he manages to get past this initial confrontational attitude with Eiji he will become one his most loyal friends, as he comes to understand that Eiji does in fact have the Earth's best interest at heart. After the two manage to come to an understanding their mutual trust in one another is unshakable which applies for the members of the Cosmic Culture Club as well. There is a really heartwarming moment at the end of Episode 26 where the viewer will come to understand just how far David has come as a character. Compare it with his initial behavior towards Eiji and you'd hardly think they were the same person. This scene effectively hammers in the thematic message of the show quite significantly too. With the massive development David undergoes he may actually be the best character of Layzner, only perhaps outmatched by Eiji himself. Another time where your initial perception of a character is likely to flipped over is the whole situation with Rowan. Other examples would include Lieutenant Commander Dannie, Julia, and Gale, to name a few others. Layzner works to show that these characters have more depth to them than being one-note or laden with tropes, and more often than not it succeeds.  
 
Eiji is a pacifist and he abhors killing. So, if you've got a problem with a protagonist like that you may not like him all that much, although I would suggest that you seriously re-evaluate your outlook on life if you think not wanting to take the life of another is a ""bad"" trait to possess. He is rather stoic (Seriously, Chirico, is that you?), and bottles up his feelings quite a bit, but despite this his love for people is undoubtedly one of his shining qualities. He has a pure and noble heart that values all life, and he manages to exemplify true heroism and self-sacrifice. Despite being quite stoic, his emotions do power through in certain scenes. Look at his face when he sees Earth from space for the time; he is visibly moved by the scene, quite possibly even more so than those of the Cosmic Culture Club who are finally within reach of their home. The Layzner machine has an AI installed on it, Rei, with another hidden AI as well, Phoron. Phoron is never referenced again after a certain point (this is different for the extended and somewhat alternate ending in Episode 3 of the OVA version). The AI installed on the Layzner is amoral which at times serves as a source of struggle for Eiji because he does not want to kill. There is a scene where Eiji debates with Phoron that also really helps the advancement of the themes at one point.  
 
As a result of what happens between Part 1 and Part 2 I can't give much of a review of Part 2 without spoiling something big from Part 1, so just be aware of that before proceeding. Part 2 begins after a three year time-skip from Part 1. Before discussing the second part I want to say something about the first part. Humanity, realizing how outmatched and outgunned they are by Grados finally unite as one to wage a battle against them and this can be very hard to take seriously. Even if they face a common enemy would they really be able to unite this easily to face them? Well, considering the thematic heart of the series it wants to believe so and it is probably necessary for this to happen as easily as it does to give those themes that much more power. However, I would have preferred a bit more effort with the writing during this point. It really declines in quality for about two or three episodes. The second part of this series gets really, really dark. Eiji, the members of the Cosmic Culture Club, and the people of Earth have failed to prevent the conquest of Earth by Grados resulting in the Earth being forced into a dystopian nightmare. Grados has culled the population of the Earth, reducing it to a mere fraction of what it once was. A Gradosian weapon capable of destroying the ozone layer leaves cities completely razed. Oppression by the Grados results in routine public executions (even children), torture, the destruction of anything that has to with Earth culture (books, art, film, etc.), brainwashing, forced labor, etc. The Gradosians, thinking themselves a superior entity, reign over the humans of Earth without mercy. A resistance group takes up arms in the hope of revolting against them. Among them are a now more mature David and Anna located in New York. Simone and Arthur are fighting battles in other locations in their own way before they reunite with the group in New York. Dr. Elizabeth is working with the Resistance underground, developing weapons to combat the Gradosians. Eiji finally reappears after three long years and joins the fight with the Resistance. But Rowan has decided to align himself with Grados. The second part of the series is mainly about toppling the Gradosian regime and continuing to advance the themes of the series forward. It also brings back a character who was very clearly dead (and probably should have remained that way) as a cyborg. The second part encounters a number of pacing issues and the production values also take a very noticeable hit at many points as well. Within this part there is some rather impressive depictions of outright insanity and madness though, notably for that cyborg character who I had initially considered to be pretty one-note, but as a result of the way the insanity was depicted it ended up improving my opinion of the quality of the character's writing somewhat. Despite this part being very dark it still has its fair share of heartwarming moments, and really pushes the themes of the series to new levels. 
 
As for the romance in the series, at the beginning I didn't care much for the way it was handled, but like this series has continually proven, I should not base my perception of something on my initial impression alone. There are two romances that are significantly built-up over the course of the series. (They aren't the only two romances though. They're just the ones the viewer would probably be the most ""familiar(?)"" with. (Although I'm not sure if familiar is the best word choice here.)) One of the ways it manages to pull this off is by having the last episode look back at some of the events that led to the conclusion of the series. It is here that the things that I initially thought weren't all that great in regards to the romance suddenly end up being quite a bit more meaningful. Both of the romances in the show have some heartwarming moments to them and by the end I was rather impressed with what one of them had managed to pull off. At one point, one of these characters narrates to another a story related to a flower about a maiden who waits for her lover to return to her for months, and then years. The series manages to pull this off with the time-skip from Part 1 to Part 2, and I was rather pleasantly surprised that it also had significance at another point aside from this one occasion.  
 
Here is some nitpicks that had no impact on my overall score of the series. A minor one I have would be that the language barrier is non-existent. Everyone is able to understand one another easily even though they should be speaking different languages in certain situations. I would assume that English is the language that is primarily spoken in most cases though. In Part 2 one of the characters is reading a book that is formatted right-to-left rather than left-to-right despite taking place in New York. Of course, they are trying to save all the books they can at this point, so I can easily toss this aside as completely insignificant. (I just felt like pointing it out.) Oddly enough, there is another scene where a book is formatted left-to-right, but more often than not they are formatted right-to-left in most scenes.  
 
The battles in the series, while not always being animated the best, are a bit different from what I've typically encountered in other mecha series. This is mainly for one reason only though: the SPTs frequently do these really flashy spins/flips. Additionally, the animation can be rather rigid on occasion or feature a noticeable drop in frame rate. The art utilizes these really vivid color choices. This can be seen pretty clearly on Mars with the red and orange hues of the planet being in the background of the bold, deep blue of the Layzner unit. The Layzner machine typically stands out quite a bit when it's in a scene due to its color, especially when the V-MAX system is activated at which point it effectively gives off the impression of a ""blue comet."" There are a number of cases where there are very obvious off-model drawings for the characters or the backgrounds. Oh, and the opening theme is probably one of the greatest opening themes ever. I can't forget to say that :D  
 
Layzner is quite the underappreciated hidden gem. While it was cancelled, resulting in a mad dash at the end to wrap things up, it is still rather impressive with what it managed to accomplish during the time that it did have. I do have some problems with how certain parts of the series played out, but overall it was handled exceptionally well and I am satisfied with the time I spent watching it. For fans of old real robot mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Votoms, Macross, and Dunbine I recommend giving Layzner a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised. Layzner, both as the series and as the machine itself, embarks on a journey for the day when all of humanity can reach a mutually beneficial and cooperative relationship with each other. Without a doubt, it's a series with an optimistic outlook, but it also comes across as a solemn prayer for humanity. And as it searches for that day when everyone can understand one another, 
 
The Blue Comet slowly bathes the sky with a glistening light―a light gently illuminated― 
 
―With hope.

 Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru  opens on the life of Yamatonokami Yasusada, Souji Okita's beloved uchigatana, as he begins his first day at the Saniwa's citadel. Soon reuniting with his old friend, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, the two are caught up in the daily antics of their fellow sword warriors. They never miss an opportunity to have fun, whether it be through wild snowball fights or introducing their newest comrades to the citadel. Of course, when the government calls, the swords are always ready to fulfill their mission of protecting history. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",none,"Protip: don't start watching this if you don't know anything about touken ranbu. 
Protip2: watch it immediately if you're a saniwa 
 
Reason? In short, you're most probably not going to enjoy it. In long, this anime obviously assumes that the watcher is familiar with either the characters or the concept of tkrb. It is too short to properly explain anything and half of each episode is dedicated to a different character. Needless to say, character development in ten minutes? I don't think so. 
 
But the thing is, I've played the game ever since it came out so all the swords are very dear to me. Seeing them being animated like this made them more tangible for my smol saniwa heart. I recommend it to all fellow saniwas out there because this anime is seriously so heartwarming. (I hope you like Yasu-kun though bc he gets lots of spotlight lolol.) It gives more insight into the personalities and bonds of the swords, it even reveals some facts about them that you may not have known on beforehand! Anyway, it gets a 10/10 from me. I love my swords.

          
 
       Helpful I'm just going to start off by saying that I have never played the game this is based off of and probably never will. If you are in the same boat, then I would recommend that you don't even try to watch this. I honestly would have dropped it pretty early on if I didn't need to complete it for a MAL challenge. It's obvious that this show was made solely for fans of the game and they don't really even try to make it appealing to other viewers. As a newcomer to the franchise, these are my thoughts of the show based solely on it being an anime rather than an adaptation of a video game. 
 
First of all, don't be fooled by the underlying plot of these swords being animated to fight an organization bent on changing history because the anime doesn't really focus on that most of the time. Instead, the series is pretty much centered around the characters and their interactions with each other in the citadel. Throughout the series, you will constantly see the same exact plot points being recycled such as introducing new characters, forging bonds between characters, and dealing with internal struggles of characters. It's kind of obvious once you know the background of the series that the whole point of doing this is to give fans the chance to see their favorite characters stirring up emotions inside of them. However, without that excitement of seeing someone you know that you can only get from previously playing the game, the cycle becomes repetitive and boring after awhile. On top of that, they introduce like 50 different characters in the span of the series, so it is hard to keep track of them all without having prior exposure to them. By having so many characters, I felt a lot of the shows attempts to deal with internal struggles fell flat because it's really hard to be impacted by a scene involving a character you are still trying to figure out the identity of. I will admit that there were maybe 2 times where a scene involving a character actually made me feel something, but most of the time attempts to make me sympathize with them were unsuccessful and even the times I did feel something I get the impression it didn't impact me as much as it was supposed to. This series is definitely built around character interactions, so not developing characters before emotional moments and cycling through so many of them in such a short amount of time because you assume the viewer already has an understanding of them through the game is definitely the fatal flaw in this anime for viewers who haven't played it.  
 
Honestly, I was just bored most of the time watching this series and you probably will be too if you haven't played the game. I understand that the anime would have been a lot better if i did play it and this may even be considered a masterpiece if you view it as an addition to the franchise rather than as an adaptation of the game. However, I don't think you should have to delve into a game in order for an anime to be good because if a show is good it should be able to stand on its own. Yeah, the series probably was more successful pandering solely to fans of the game considering it's getting a second season, but as far as being a stand alone anime, it is pretty bad in my opinion. The whole aspect drawing viewers into the series is their connections to characters from the game, so without that, there really isn't too much about the anime that keeps you interested. If you really want to watch this then do yourself a favor and play the game first. Based on the numerous top rated 10 reviews I've seen on this show's MAL page, it may be worth the time and effort. However, if you don't want to do that, then don't even bother watching this because you will probably just continuously lower the score to an anime that wasn't even meant for you to begin with.  


          
 
       Helpful I haven't play the game yet, but I really LOVE this anime!!! 
It's so relaxing, refreshing, cute, and fun to watch! I love all the characters (especially Yasusada & Kiyomitsu <3 )~~ 
*it took some time to remember their names though* 
Every episode made me laugh so hard! XD 
Well, some episodes have some sad feelings on it, but they still have jokes with them! I can watch this anime over and over again! 
And, the opening and ending songs.. Absolutely love them! Especially the ones that was sung by Kiyomitsu - Yasusada and Iwatooshi - Imanotsurugi. I'd like to buy the CDs!! XD 
Very recommended for someone who is looking for something peaceful (and cute!), and not recommended for someone who is looking for a serious themed anime.

As Chiyo-Chan's pigtails bounce out of the window, who knows if young Chiyo will ever be happy again. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"This is some kind of teaser for the actual TV series, and all the events in this ""movie"" is also found in the series. Thus, this one is more or less pointless in the sense that it doesn't add anything to the ""story"" of AD. It fulfills the role of teaser quite well, though; most of the characters get introduced rather properly, and you get a good taste of what the series is all about. 
 
The animation is better than the real series, even though I think they focused a bit too much on making the girls beautiful or even sexy. That is not what Azumanga Daioh is about, if you ask me.  
 
The ""happi hen"" song in the end is gorgeous, but a better take exists on the soundtrack CD.  
 
Since it is only five minutes long, you could as well watch this, you might actually like seeing the wierd girls look good for a change. Just don't expect anything new.

          
 
       Helpful ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is essentially a flashy, spiced-up episode of Azumanga Daioh.  
 
With a run-time of about six minutes, the show summarizes the original plot of the 26-episode Azumanga series, and it does so pretty well by combining many of the show's jokes, character interactions, plots, and themes in a way that doesn't feel forced or ham-handed. This show is pretty good in that regard.  
 
The story is a typical scene from any random Azu episode. It takes place in Miss Yukari's class-room, and features the main girls doing their usual thing. The plot has many twists, even for such a short show. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've watched/read Azumanga, it will be very familiar. 
 
The art is especially notable and good. It is much better than the original 26-ep. Azumanga, but this is not to say Azumanga doesn't have good art to begin with. But in the movie, the art is even better. Perhaps to stick to the idea of a ""movie,"" the art seems to have had more time, effort, and money put into it. The character's animations are smoother, the colors brighter and more vibrant, the lines sharper. it is a good look for Azumanga, and I like it. 
 
The sound is good, but in my opinion it is no better (or worse) than Azumanga 1-26. It is clear and understandable. As for the Japanese AND English voice-actors, they are the same as those who voiced Azu 1-26.  
 
The characters are quirky, unique, and each one funny in their own special way. Their actions and antics are similar to Azumanga 1-26. Those who've seen the original series will not feel alienated. The old characters are still themselves.  
 
The Azumanga movie is just as enjoyable as a regular episode of Azu, but it is unfortnately quite short. Just when you are getting into it, it ends. Yet, the show is quite enjoyble, and fun, for veteran Azu fans or newcomers to the Azumanga or even anime world. 
 
Overall, ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is a good watch that I certainly recommened, either as a compliment to Azumanga Daioh 1-26 or a stand-alone watch. But if you watch this short movie before Azumanga 1-26, some of the jokes may confuse you, as the show assumes you've already watched Azu 1-26. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the second short pilot film that JC Staff released, this one a lot closer(but still not quite matching) the animation style and budget of the TV release.  It’s a bit longer than Web Daioh, and while it’s not quite as funny, it does put forth a more accurate representation of what the series would eventually be.  Rather than a traditional intro, like Web Daioh had, this film opens with a shot of Chiyo riding on her dog, Mr. Tadakichi, introducing herself and nearly getting thrown off of him.  The opening features some of the show’s iconic background music, which is always nice. 
 
Splitting it into two halves, the first half is probably the weaker one.  It features a couple of minutes of Yukari’s class, squeezing several of the running gags and staples of the series into two minutes.  This includes Yukari being a dick, Chiyo getting good grades, the Bonklers(which I’ll always call them because it sounds better than knuckleheads) acting out, Chiyo trying not to be cute, Tomo standing outside, Kaorin being in love, Sakaki musing over a cat bite, and keep in mind, thisall takes place in the span of two minutes...  Including the opening.   
 
The second half, in contrast, plays out one joke on it’s own...  Osaka and her pigtail dreams.  If you’ve seen the anime or read the manga, you know what I’m talking about, and this goes on for almost 3 minutes.  Unlike the first half, this one doesn’t stick to the established material, instead taking full advantage of the surreal situation to try some new jokes, like Chiyo slowly turning her head like an owl(creepy) and the entire class thinking she’s a lost child that doesn’t belong there.  I’m not going to give away how this part ends, you kind of just have to experience it for yourselves.  It’s weird. 
 
The short ends with a thirty second credits, marking the second appearance of Chiyodaddy, and if i’m being honest, I don’t feel as though this one’s as strong as Web Daioh.  It suffers in terms of pacing, with so many jokes and in-show references thrown at you in such a short time that it’s hard to process what you’re watching.  The Osaka dream is at least new and interesting, especially the way it breaks away from the script.   
 
There’s actual music in it, which I definitely like, especially since upon reflection, this is the pilot for the show’s iconic score, too.  The dub is phenomenal, and the actors are on point...  Save for Mandy Clark and Nancy Novotny, big surprise there...  But I’d especially like to give a shout out to Jessica Boone and Kira Vincent Davis, as they play the most prominent characters in the short and absolutely slaughter their roles.   
 
All in all, not quite as good as Web Daioh, in terms of story, but a small improvement in the area of production values.  I give it a 7/10.

","Critic’s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #79: The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya. 
 
Let’s Go! 
 
This is about A comical spin-off of the popular ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" anime series that originally aired back in 2006 involving all the major characters in more child-like forms of their animated selves going through various spoofs of previous plot line; like Nagato and the dreaded laptop with a twist. face offs with the rack of costumes that were stuffed in the corner of the club room. and dodge ball tournaments on a sugar rush. 
 
Yeah, it’s a random spin-off. and this spin-off is awesome. Well, for the most part. During the first 4 episodes, there was some CGI animation, but afterwards… Kyoto Animation went back to the 2D Animation while staying true to the chibi designs that distinguishes the Main series of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi-chan is a Kyoto Animation production. It is indeed a spinoff of the series and this is not a TV anime, it is a web series. As far as web series go, the animation is quite good and for it being made in the same year as another web anime known as Hetalia. Haruhi-chan does look impressive for being an Original Net Anime, assuming ONA’s have lower budgets than TV Anime and OVA’s. Despite the first 4 episodes being CGI-animated, it looks great. 
 
The music compliments the spin-off and I don’t have much to say about it since it’s not heavily important in this spin-off 
 
Like the series, The Japanese cast and English Dub cast do not disappoint and both casts do step it up by making the comedy work. I already said enough about both casts when I reviewed the series. 
 
When it comes to characters, everyone is in chibi form and this helps to differentiate from the main series. Since this is a spin-off, I can tell you that you may want to give character development a pass since this is a spinoff that puts heavy emphasis on humor and laughs. Everyone is over the top and even Yuki Nagato is funny in this one. If you liked the characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. Chances are, you’ll like this spin-off just as much. 
 
If you got an hour and a half, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya does not disappoint as a spinoff. It’s just as fun as the main series but it is more funnier than the main series. Like the series, this is a great one to watch with classmates if you are in high school or college. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was released alongside Nyoron Churuya-san, but unfortunately it is out of print. 
 
With all that said, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya is a fun spinoff to the popular Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. The animation is good for an ONA, character development and plot get a pass, but it is a fun series because of how funny it is. It is an awesome spinoff. 
 
I give The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya an 8.9 out of 10. it is VERY GOOD! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment and join the club.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, seeing as how TMoHS is my absolute favorite anime of all time, this review will be extremely biased and may not be helpful at all. That being said here is my review: 
TMoHCS is basically a completely non-cannon and chibi version of TMoHS that is basically a little short-series consisting of about 3-5 minute episodes of hilarity. 
TMoHCS was heavily enjoyable for big fans of the series but would probably be mediocre with a couple of big laughs here and there for people who didn't like TMoHS or aren't fans of the series. This is pretty much just for when you're bored and would like to watch something slightly different. 
I enjoyed this heavily because I love the characters from TMoHS and this is really just a filler while I waited for the third season of TMoHS to come out. 
Hope I helped and I hope you enjoy the show!

          
 
       Helpful Okay, the only reason that I'm still a Haruhi fan is for two reasons: 1) the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2006 and 2) this ONA. ^^ 
 
The original idea of The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya came from a parody comic series that pretty much subtly made fun of the original anime. And, I'm not usually one for these kinds of parodies, but I just couldn't resist~! ^^ Also, I love how evil Yuki is shown to be in the series... *devious grin* Not to mention that random lion that was thrown into the mix as well... ^^;;;; 
 
The art... Well, let's just say that it's very rare to see chibis still keep their proper anatomy and such in tact. This, is a good thing. Haruhi-chan Suzumiya has managed to pull this off quite well. But, then again, we are talking about Kyoto Animation. Also, the first couple of episodes were done with 3D generated cell-shaded characters. After the first four or five episodes (give or take), though, they resumed to 2D traditional cell-shaded characters. 
 
The sound was, unbelievably, astounding. Usually, I'd get annoyed with Mikuru's voice, but the situations that the story showed made it so that it was actually quite enjoyable~! 
 
Characters seemed to be put on a more comedic spin. But, you do have to realize that this is a parody series that focuses on some points on the original series and pretty much spends about 2-5 minutes making fun of it. But, because they focused so much on the comedic side of things, there wasn't any real development in character. But, that's a given when you're watching a series of parodizing shorts on one of the Anime Industry's largest franchises. 
 
The enjoyment was DEFINATELY 10/10~! Not only did it have the element of satiric comedy, but it also had some... risque-ness into it as well. (is that even a word??) Such as the ""wall between hearts."" (Or, something like that.) Also, there was some awesome ass-kicking in a few episodes. ^^ 
 
Overall, it's not a story and plot-driven anime. It's not exactly focused on character development, either. No, it's merely a satire that makes fun of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, and personally, I think that they've done a swell job~! 
 
I give ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya"" a grand total score of 9/10!

3,2508,146,6.569675303,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Genshiken 2,"The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture, otherwise known as Genshiken, is now under the charge of a more confident Sasahara. Things have changed in between semesters, and the otaku club now has a new otaku-hating member named Ogiue. Sasahara's initial goal of starting a doujin circle and selling those fan-made magazines at the next Comic Festival becomes a reality, but reality is a cruel master... who apparently crossplays. Afterward, the club is abuzz with talk about Tanaka and Ohno's relationship, which takes a hesitant step forward. 
 
(Source: Media Blasters)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Slice of Life']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","The first time I saw Genshiken, I was just completely taken in. Now the second season has taken it to the next level. Continuing from the OVA series that takes place after the first season, Genshiken 2 makes another Otaku come back for the fans. This time with some new characters and some interesting background stories, the story of Genshiken has become more in depth with the real world while still having it's Anime based zanies.  
 
The story begins when Sasahara takes his new presidency of the Genshiken club to the next level, by entering the club into a Comi-fest Dojinshi retail. Now he teams up with a new member, Ogire, to make some awesome manga. Meanwhile, Madarame is having a difficult time leaving the sanctaty of college, Ohno and Tanaka are getting closer then ever, Kasakabe is starting to understand Kousaka's Otaku lifestlye, plus Kugayama is starting to learn to standup for himself and speak out. Alot goes around until Sasahara decides to leave Ohno as president in order to become a Manga editor, and admit his true feelings to Ogire. 
 
Yes, alot has changed with the Genshiken crew. For those who read this should agree that this Anime shares alot of what most of us go through everyday while living in this Anime loving world of ours. I believe if you watch this Anime from the first season to this new one, you'll say to yourself &quot;yea. I love being an otaku&quot;. 
 
All in all the story was solid and kept in touch with the first season. The character development is great. And the comedic attude is right where it should be. Now, you just have to watch it.

          
 
       Helpful Things seem to pick up in Genshiken 2 versus the events in part 1. The art goes through some changes and improves over the quality in part 1 in my opinion. The plot seems to expand outside of the club room more as part 2 brings with it a lot more changes to the members and their personal lives.  
 
It's a bit sad to see characters we grew to like moving on with their lives, but it's also a bit odd compared to what we generally see in Slice of Life anime. Most titles in the genre are more than eager to broach and even go full on rainbows and sunshine on the topic of moving on and missing your friends and loved ones: after all, the point, according to the majority, is not to think about the days when you'll miss your friends, but to remember and enjoy the times you have in the present.  
 
The problem with these feel good emotions is that very few of those shows actually follow through with it. In fact, most of them leave the viewer feeling as if the characters will be in school forever. That everyone is just like Peter Pan and the days of adulthood will never come. Genshiken 2 does not fall into this category, which, as stated, can be a little sad, but it's also refreshing to see an anime actually showing life move on. 
 
*** This is part 2 of a Genshiken, it is highly recommended to watch part 1. It is also highly recommended to watch the OVA's before beginning part 2. Many animes have OVA's bundled with various seasons that are really little more than extra stories; however, the Genshiken OVA's are actually vital transition episodes from part 1 to part 2. While you can generally get the gist of what happens between the end of 1 and the beginning of 2, you will see characters show up in part 2 that might leave you scratching your head going, ""Where did they come from? And what happened between those guys?"" Later in the season there are also direct references to events from the OVA. I hadn't actually seen the OVA's, believing they were simply extra side-story episodes. That was until about half-way through 2 when some of the references were going over my head and I had to go back and watch the OVA's.

          
 
       Helpful After the hugely disappointing ""Genshiken OVA"", I was honestly quite worried about ""Genshiken 2"". The original ""Genshiken"" was brilliant, but everything went off track in the OVA's, possibly due to the franchise being passed to a different studio. 
 
After watching the first few minutes of ""Genshiken 2"", I breathed a sigh of relief - it's is well and truly back on track! The charm and likability of the first season that's sorely missing from the OVA's thankfully makes a return in the second season. 
 
In some ways, ""Genshiken 2"" is less realistic than the original series, but in other ways it's more so. As the members of Genshiken enter their final years, issues such as graduation and job hunting starts to weigh heavily on their minds whereas previously, they never seemed to have worried about exams and the other things that you would expect most university students would be worried about. The bonus is that these aspects happen to be the strongest parts of ""Genshiken 2"".  
 
My personal highlight of ""Genshiken 2"" is probably the graduation episode. I consider the years I spent as an undergraduate at university to be some of the best years of my life, and that graduation episode, in which the chemistry between the members of Genshiken are there for all to see, really struck a chord with me. The elation of completing your course; the sense of sadness and nostalgia as you part ways with your friends and bid farewell to university life; the excitement mingled with fear of the unknown future... all these conflicting, bitter sweet emotions are captured to perfection in that episode. 
 
In contrast, a friend of mine who was sitting at home, unemployed after graduating at the time he watched ""Genshiken 2"" found his personal highlight to be the job hunting part, where he really empathised with the characters' troubles in that area. And this speak volumes about the fantastic ability of this show to connect with viewers who've experienced similar situations. For a slice of life, there can be few higher praise. 
 
In the otaku aspect of the story though, ""Genshiken 2"" is quite a distance off the standard set by the first series. The first series is a superb demonstration of uncomfortable humour done right, as we watched a very honest portrayal of the members in ""Genshiken"" flounder awkwardly in social situations. Part of the discomfort comes from sympathy for the characters, and part of it comes from perhaps seeing a part of our geeky selves within the characters. Unfortunately ""Genhiken 2"" is a demonstration of uncomfortable humour missing the mark. In-jokes about the otaku culture is all well and good, but the cringeworthy jokes involving topics such as yaoi are simply taken a bit too far. The American otaku's behaviour and their Engrish are also too cringeworthy. 
 
And this is the main problem with ""Genshiken 2"" - it comes off as overly self indulgent to the extent that it's slightly guilty of pandering, with parts of it feeling like it's moved from the first season's viewing of the otaku culture from an often external stand point straight into the heart of otaku fantasy land itself in the second season. This shows especially when you see the anime trying to to shoe-horn most of the socially inept members of Genshiken into romantic relationships, only one of which comes across as an expected and natural development. 
 
In addition to the excessive pandering that goes on, part of the reason for the significant shift of perspective is probably due to the fact that Kasukabe is no longer a major focal point of the series. Kasukabe played a pivotal role in the first season. Her biting comments directed at the otaku culture tempered the geekiness of the series with a cold dose of reality, and ensured that it didn't get bogged down by its explorations of otakudom. But her gradual, grudging acceptance of the subculture meant that her main role was done by the end of season 1, so it made sense for her to step into the background a bit and. As a result, the reality check that she provides are no longer there in ""Genshiken 2"", and this makes a significant impact on the feel of the series. 
 
""Genshiken 2"" attempts to fill up the void left by Kasukabe with two characters. Firstly, Sasahara, (who everyone thought was the main character after the opening episode of the original series but who turned out to have a more minor role in that season) actually steps up to become the main character for ""Genshiken 2"", making up for the reduction in Kasukabe's screen time. Then there's the character newly introduced in the OVA's - Chika Ogiue, who takes over Kasukabe's role as the otaku hater. But to be honest, Ogiue's reason for disliking otakus doesn't sit well with me, and neither does she seem to express her dislike as convincingly as Kasukabe did.  
 
Sasahara is probably the best character in ""Genshiken 2"". There's a deliberate sense about the way his character is developed as he goes through the stern trials of being president of Genshiken, and even sterner trials of job hunting after graduation. Despite his bland personality, or perhaps because of it, he's probably the character that the majority of us can identify with the most. Despite the conceptual weaknesses with Oguie's character, she's interesting in her own right, and makes for a strong addition to the cast, adding a different kind of personality into the mix. 
 
Although Sasahara and Ogiue both make very positive contributions to the show, they're not nearly as interesting to watch as Kasukabe's interactions with the group in the first season. In addition to this, Madarame's crazy antics are also not what they used to be. With Sasahara and Ogiue not able to make up for the reduced impact of Kasukabe (the representative of ""normal"" people) and Madarame (the representative of extreme otaku), ""Genshiken 2"" doesn't have that special spark that the original series had. Also, I still have issues with Kasukabe's character apparently passing on a hefty portion of her aggressive personality onto Ohno, though this character inconsistency isn't nearly as glaring as it was in the OVAs.  
 
On the art style side, the second season is closer to the OAV's than the original. Even though it looks more crisp, I preferred the more down to earth plain-ness of the style of the first season.  
 
Overall, ""Genshiken 2"" has redeemed the franchise in my eyes. As good as the first season it is not, but it's recovered most of the charming qualities that made me enjoy the first season so much, and after the shambles that was the OVA's, I gladly welcome this new addition to the franchise with open arms.

Solely because she is the only student to see him, she is the only student from the Normal Branch to be in the competition.

","This anime was very good towards the music area. They showed a very good display of instruments and classical pieces such as the canon or Salut' d amour. The animation was decent overall, at some points it was really well done, some werent so flattering. But the story line is very good and the characters you'll fall in love with! ^^ 

          
 
       Helpful La Corda D'Oro is pretty much the first anime I ever watched, so I have somewhat of a nostalgic attachment to this show. It’s a sweet and relaxing anime about a music competition and explores the effect music can have on one’s life and the people around them. If you have an interest in classical music and don’t mind somewhat simplistic characters, I would encourage you to give it a try. 
 
STORY: 
This show is about a music competition, and centers around Hino Kahoko, who was named as a competitor despite having no knowledge or experience in playing the violin. It’s a character-driven story, and focuses on the interactions between Kahoko and the other participants, and explores what music means to each of them. It spans the course of the entire music competition, and I like how the four main events serve as major turning points in the story and the characters’ development. It’s a simple and somewhat predictable plot, but the use of music and the structure of a competition makes it an enjoyable and relaxing ride. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
The characters all seem to fit into a stereotype, which makes their behavior somewhat predictable and lacking in complexity. But all of the characters are likable (though some more than others) and they all have a decent amount of character development (though again, usually predictable). All of this character development centers around Kahoko and her genuine love for music. It’s fun to watch how much of an effect Kahoko has on her fellow competitors and her classmates, and especially the effect this music competition has had on herself. 
 
One thing to note is that this is a reverse harem, so most of the guys develop some kind of crush on Kahoko. But these feelings don’t lead to an actual romance, and merely serve to influence each character’s behavior. I have no complaints about the lack of concrete romance, and prefer to have it open-ended given that it’s a reverse harem (and I’d rather not see the show choose one pairing and leave everyone else disappointed). All the guys care about Kahoko in their own way which I found sweet, and I was satisfied with the way the show handled it. 
 
SOUND: 
Since this show is centered around classical music, you’ll get to listen to a variety of short pieces throughout the series. Each song fits the scene, and it’s one of the show’s strength (since there aren’t a whole lot of anime about classical music). 
 
ART: 
It looks decent, and I have no major complaints. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I found this show sweet and relaxing, and I enjoyed the competitive spirit and the focus on classical music. It’s a simple story and doesn’t have anything unique or complex to offer, but it does a good job for what it is. Its biggest flaw is its simplistic characters and predictable plot, but the abundance of music is what made this show enjoyable for me.

          
 
       Helpful STORY (10) 
Hino Kahoko, a high school girl who has never played an instrument in her life, is given a magic violin. In turn, she must compete in a competition (the Concours) with several elite music students from her school. It's a story about Kaho learning to love the violin and music, while deepening her relationships with her fellow competitors. 
 
The story is not for everyone. This is a character driven series through and through. The plot loosely falls around the Concours, but the purpose of the Concours is to contribute to character development. That being said, the character development is outstanding. I barely noticed the lack of plot- simply seeing these amazing characters interact and grow had me yearning to see the next episode. 
 
The story really falls flat when it comes to romance. This is a reverse-harem at its core (based on a dating sim), so I was not surprised by how things ended up. Still, the lack of any concrete romantic development or even a hint on Kaho's part as to which guy she likes best is very frustrating. Yet, there are just enough romantic moments to make you want to see something more. This cannot be written off as a simple ""friendship"" series. 
 
CHARACTERS (9) 
Hino Kahoko is a decent, but bland lead. I liked her determined approach to the violin, and her character development was well done. During the anime, we see Kaho persevere, doubt herself, face a major setback, and ultimately triumph. While I enjoyed this, her inability to choose one guy was irritating. This flaw really shows through in the La Corda Special, where she can't even begin to make a decision as to which guy she likes best. It was very annoying to watch this. 
 
Each male has a distinct personality, because this is a harem-type show. You have all of the usual suspects- the cheerful and clumsy guy, the guy all of the girls are in love with, the cold but good-looking guy, the cute and innocent guy, etc. I found all of the boys to be interesting, enjoyable characters. To some extent, every character develops, which is refreshing. Tsukimori was definitely my favorite character. I liked how his approach to his music gradually became gentler throughout the series. All of the characters are cute, both inside and out! 
 
SOUND (10) 
Music is where this anime shines...which is what I expected from an anime centered around a music competition (hehe). In 25 episodes, a wide variety of classical music is introduced, which I really enjoyed. 
 
The OP and the ED songs are outstanding. In particular, the OP ""Brand New Breeze"" had great music, great art, and overall, it was very cute! It tells us exactly what the anime is all about. The song gives a feeling that Kaho is singing to each of the boys. The ED music is also very good- it seems like the boys are singing back to Kaho. I like the call and response format of the OP and the ED. 
 
ANIMATION (10) 
I loved, loved, loved the character designs. This is what attracted me to the show in the first place. Each character has a distinct, unique look, right down to face shape. All of the Bishounen are good-looking, but my favorite character designs are Tsukimori, Shimizu, and Tsuchiura. 
Apart from character design, animation was average. 
 
 
VALUE / ENJOYMENT (9) 
In case you didn't notice, I adore this anime. The story it told was heartwarming. I would only recommend watching it again if you really love the story. Or if you really love Bishies. 
 
The Bottom line: 
The music, character designs, and the characters themselves are easily the strongest components of the show. Recommended for fans of Shoujo anime. Skip this one if you dislike indecisiveness in romance. 
If you liked this, you may also like Aishiteruze Baby (a series that gives off the same warm and fuzzy feeling as La Corda), or even Peach Girl (a reverse harem with a more concrete romance story).

3,6946,149,6.467325215,Anime featuring traditional Japanese culture,Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku: The Legend of Koizumi,"Global political figures such as The Pope, Kim Jong Il, George W. Bush and recent Japanese Prime Ministers play riichi mahjong against each other.","['Comedy', 'Game', 'Parody', 'Seinen']","In a world where all politics and diplomacy are settled via no-holds-barred mahjong battles by world politicians, Junichiro Koizumi settled scores with the United States, North Korea, and Russia before retiring as Prime Minister of Japan. However, he is recruited by the Vatican to be one of the five world leaders to counter a new international threat: the Nazis, still alive, who settled on the Moon and established the Fourth Reich. The Nazis challenge the world leaders to a best-of-five mahjong match to the death on the Guiana Highlands, but the battle is interrupted by the news of a rebellion on the Moon. After Adolf Hitler returned from the match on Earth and put down Erwin Rommel's rebellion, he beckons Koizumi to the Moon to finish the match. After a tremendous battle, Hitler is defeated while Koizumi becomes stranded on the Moon, his fate unknown. After Koizumi is presumed dead on the moon, the Japanese government under the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) established the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps (MJ-13) in an effort to make up for the loss of Japanese mahjong power. However, the LPD lost the 2009 elections to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), who promptly tried to eliminate the newly established corps in the name of fiscal restructuring. The MJ-13, headed by Koizumi's hidden son Matajiro Sanada, duels three mahjong greats selected by the DPJ in a battle to decide the fate of the corps. Sanada defeats the incumbent prime minister Yukio Hatoyama in the last round, which causes the latter to lose power. It is then revealed that the LPD is planning to retrieve Koizumi from the Moon through Japan's space agency JAXA, and that MJ-13 was established to prepare for an upcoming war.
A challenge is issued to Japan to send five mahjong greats to the disputed Senkaku Islands, where a mysterious ""red box"" is threatening the safety of nearby fishermen. The ruling DPJ does not want to get involved in the controversy for fear of angering their Chinese masters, to the point of sending ninja assassins to try to kill Sanada, who desires to sail to the islands to investigate. Eventually, in the face of falling public support, the DPJ strikes a deal with the LDP to call an election early, which the LDP wins and promptly sends the MJ-13 to the Senkaku Islands. There they discover an abandoned Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier being overtaken by Red Guards, and a preserved Mao Zedong inside the dreaded ""red box"". Mao challenges Japan to five mahjong matches, with each of the 5 main islands of the Senkaku Islands being the wager. Mao cites his ambition to claim the islands for his Neo Chinese Soviet Republic and eventually reclaim China from its current leaders, who he thinks have betrayed the communist cause. After Japan defeats Mao, winning all matches along the way, Lenin himself summons the mysterious figure ""Mask of Mahjong"" as his aide to challenge Japan to a final match. The ""Mask of Mahjong"" defeats Lenin in the first round, and is revealed to be Junichiro Koizumi being controlled by the head of Leon Trotsky. The war ends with the ambitions of the Neo Chinese Soviet Republic broken, and Koizumi and Sanada reuniting as father and son, both acknowledging each other's mahjong powers.
After a two-year hiatus since the end of the ""Senkaku Islands Bloody Battle"" arc, the manga resumed in 2017 with a sequel centering on the imperial princess Hako Mikado (御�T葩子) playing against foreign adversaries such as American president Donald Trump.","This anime is an utter atrocity. There's no storyline, it looks down right stupid, and is just a insult Shonen rip off. The characters just seem too wacky and over the top more than what I believe should be. It's not enjoying to me in any way. It also I feel it's kinda racist in someways. After watching all of the episodes, I was confused at what I saw.  To anyone who reads this, I'd stay far away from this travesty. Definitely a waste of time. I'd rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution than this disgusting piece of crap they call a ""Japanese Anime""

          
 
       Helpful I'm not sure if this is a political satire or political propaganda, but it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. If was laughing until tears entered my eyes during the whole thing. 
The whole thing is just one ridiculously over-the-top. It parodies other sports/game anime by how dramatized the moves are and the political figures all have funny caricatures to them. Also, Mao Zedong rises from the dead to play a game of mahjong. What more could you ask for? 
The entire anime is 26 minutes. So, if you want a quick watch and laugh, this is the show. If you feel your time has been wasted, you only invested less than half an hour. I say it's worth the chance. 
Just go into this show not expecting anything serious because it sure doesn't take itself seriously.

          
 
       Helpful Politics is often thought of as a dull and dreary affair; several old men in suits debating issues like agricultural legislation and increasing taxes a little. But perhaps the most uninteresting of all is international affairs; a battle to get as much as you can from someone else while giving them back as little as possible in return. It’s a world of faked smiles and awkward handshakes.  
 
If only the countries of the world could compete against other like men; pitting themselves against one another in fierce competition, as they battle for ultimate supremacy. 
 
And what better way to do that, than a game of 2v2 Mahjong? 
 
‘The Legend of Koizumi’ sees the former Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro doing diplomacy with six of Japan’s deadliest enemies, including North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Chinese Premier Wen. Also taking part in the (trash) talks are a range of Japanese and international political figures.   
 
While all but the most informed of Westerners are unlikely to recognise all but the most infamous members of the cast, this barely detracts from The Legend of Koizumi’s humour. Even if the names are new, the characters are not; Dictators that don’t play by the rules, and exaggeratedly manly “heroes of freedom”.  
 
And it is this that makes Legend of Koizumi very accessible, even to a foreign audience; something that isn’t easy for a political satire that uses localised, real world figures. In fact, the main reason Legend of Koizumi is funny is simply because it is so over the top; from letting out a primal scream while declaring Riichi to intercepting a nuclear missile with a Fighter Jet, Koizumi is so ridiculously manly that he can burn a hole through a mahjong tile simply by pressing his finger up against it. 
 
Since Legend of Koizumi is mostly about poking fun at political figures, it doesn’t really have much of a story. Essentially, he settles Japanese diplomacy by battling various communist dictators. Given that there are three episodes and each one is only ten minutes long, we can forgive Koizumi for lacking any real character development or providing much in the way of introductions before the games begin. But remember that although these figures may not be well known in the west, in Japan they are household names; they don’t need any lengthy introductions. 
 
Koizumi is the single product of a small animation studio, and hence did not receive a very large budget. Thankfully however, the art doesn’t really feel cheaply made; animation is largely avoided, however the animation that is there is as smooth as any television production. Reaction shots are kept to a sensible length. And while they are somewhat frequent, multiple angles are used to prevent it from feeling static. What’s more, these flaws only become apparent with a well trained eye, or upon closer inspection. 
 
The art style is reminiscent of fighting or martial arts anime; butch, muscular bodies and faces, with blood vessels ready to pop at any second but are still recognisable, bearing obvious resemblances to the figures they parody (if you know what the figures they parody look like, anyway). 
 
The background music is mock suspense; loud and heavy percussion throughout, spaced with tense silences and touches of dramatic, orchestral strings. Most of the cast have exaggerated deep, masculine voices; dialogue is delivered in a style similar to a bad action movie. For example, in one scene, Koizumi (having been shot only moments ago) calmly steps out of a helicopter and simply says: “Let’s delegate”. 
 
 Aside from catchphrases delivered like they were lifted from  a Schwarzenegger movie, Koizumi’s dialogue is limited guttural screams when declaring a hand, and trash talking his opponents, who are given silly accents and have their mannerisms and characteristics blown out of proportion. 
 
But being so over the top is what makes the Legend of Koizumi so good; even without the satire it is still hilarious to watch and easy to enjoy.  And, since it only lasts 30 minutes in total, it doesn’t have enough time to become stale or repetitive. 
 
If I was going to be diplomatic about it, I’d probably cite that the easily accessible humour, the very short running time and the large enjoyment factor that Legend of Koizumi has, make for good incentives to watch it. But then, diplomacy never gets anyone anywhere does it? 
 
So watch Legend of Koizumi, or I’ll declare ‘Rising Sun’ on your ass, pinko!
