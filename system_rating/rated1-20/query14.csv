Computer Obaachan is a silly, charming little music video targeted at children about a space-traveling grandma and her supercomputer, and that's pretty much the entire story. Throughout the short Obaa-chan fiddles with her computer and takes a spacewalk. The short is whimsical in its art, song, and execution. The song will easily get stuck in your head.  
 
The artwork has a storybook vibe to it and while it repeats animation several times, it avoids getting too stale this way. 
 
This is a fun little retro video that may be worth sharing with small children too!

Pro(s) 
-music: it is slightly catchy. No idea what is being said but i suppose i might be humming the tune if i knew the words. 
-plot: carries some nice messages? Again, with no idea on the words i can't be certain but if you show a random meetup with the audience of kids and the first act is touching....well that goes against stranger danger doesn't it. Perhaps, the message was peace be with you everywhere you go? It is a stretch maybe more so then her oxygen hose. 
 
Cons(s) 
-art: could use some improvement. I am not saying the drawings were not well done. It was after all for children. It's just the animation was wildly tossed in. You have your random repeats, you have obvious side by side merges and it is bright. Not wicked bright but i would but in a potential seizure warning. Also, the art towards the end acts as if the power is going to cut off.

14,2813,1,13.69756638,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Chiisana Ahiru no Ooki na Ai no Monogatari: Ahiru no Kwak,"Alfred J Kwak (Dutch, it takes place in Holland) lost his parents, brothers and sisters when he was young. He was raised by a mole. The series covers the life of Alfred from the day he is born. In his life Alfred tries to help all sorts of animals all over the world. The series are meant to entertain children and teach children about life, covering historical aspects like WW II.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Kids']","Alfred J. Kwak was born as the son of Johan Sebastian and Anna Kwak. Some time after his birth, Alfred loses his parents and his brothers and sisters after a car hits them. Henk the mole, a good friend of the Kwak family, raises the little orphan duck. Alfred experiences a lot of adventures.
Unlike many other cartoons targeted for children, Alfred J. Kwak features exceptionally mature and often dark themes. Amongst others it deals with different social and political issues, such as abuse of power, but also raises important values such as friendship and solidarity.
The cartoon is also notable for the political themes on which it touches. In the cartoon, Alfred fights against a fascist dictator, takes in refugees fleeing from a country under Apartheid (with white geese and black ducks), saves whales against hunters, and oversees the changeover of his country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with a democratically elected president. Such themes are far from typical in a children's cartoon, and form a big part of Alfred J. Kwak's appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides.
The cartoon is also unusual for the subtlety of its long-term narrative. In most children's cartoons, the characters do not age. In Alfred J. Kwak, we see the progress of the main characters from very young children to adulthood as the series advances. This is particularly striking in the character of Dolf, who is initially a mere schoolboy, but who, as time passes, becomes a criminal and a dictator.
The time setting of the cartoon is somewhat surreal. On the whole the technology and dress of most characters seems appropriate to the late 20th century, and yet Alfred and Paljas/Boffin often travel in a spaceship with a technology far more advanced than that, while many characters such as the king's staff, Scratchpaws the cat, and Dolf in his Napoleonic incarnation wear clothes more appropriate to previous ages. Other surreal elements to the cartoon include such strange characters as the evil genie of the bottle, living chess pieces from Alfred's chess game, Pied Piper style Clown on the Moon, and aliens who appear like ducks except for their human-style feet, and a ""dream"" style wild West episode during which Dolf seems to become aware that he is a character in a cartoon.

","This is the FIRST anime serie i,ve seen on t.v as a kid with my sister ( back at the time i din't knew anything about anime, too young, ) but i notice'd that it looked diffrent and more well done background sketckes than any other cartoon i've watched then so far ( i was around 3,5 years old) back in '89. On air on t.v it became a very populair cartoon for the kids and the further the story developed, it went to a darkertwist  somewhat offensive with some sign's  of WW2 and the rasicm apartheid in back then South-Afrika something u NEVER EVER  seen in american cartoons. Alfred Jodocus Kwak , full name in dutch, and other chara. had a very long and on/off relationship with eachother ever since class, but for alfred later on  ( and his father Henk the mole) it involves as well some otherworldy adventure's , alien entitie's, space adventure and as well very educational theme's about the place were they live resemble to the netherlands.

          
 
       Helpful I saw this for this first time when I was a kid growing up in the Netherlands, and it was THE cartoon. Like many people already said before, it's a kids show, but it has a lot of mature topics like diseases, starving, crime, death etc.  
I really think that this show shaped me in a way because they didn't go out of the way to show children how the world really is.  
To me, and this might be the nostalgia talking, was the best cartoon of all the cartoons of my childhood.  
Thank you for having this on My Anime List, it really makes it a legit anime :)

          
 
       Helpful Ahiru no Quack, or better known as Alfred J. Kwak is a dutch anime aimed at kids. 
But unlike most cartoons aimed at kids, Alfred J. Kwak features lots of mature and mostly sad the,es. Amongst others it deals with various social and political issues, like abuse, or power. Even with all these negative themes, the shows about important values too, like friendship, family and solidarity. 
 
The anime is notable for the political themes on which it points a highlight. In the anime ...our main protagonist fights a evil fascist dictator, takes in refugees, saves whales against hunter and even oversees the changeover of his country from an sbolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.  
 
Such themes are far from typical in a children'sanime, and form a big part of Alfred J. Kwak's appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides. 
 
The story settles around a duck, some time after birth Alfred loses his parents and sisters, and is raised by a mole, which was a good friend of his parent. Together they wind up in lots of different adventures, fun adventures, but even so, very dangerous one's. 
 
What's nice is that Alfred actually grows up, from a small kid, at the end of the show, he's an adult duck. In most kid's shows the characters don't age/or at least mature. 
 
The art is simple, but astonishing beautiful, it has this old style which really appeals to kids, and yet, me too. I've seen the series as I was a kid, here on television, but I can still enjoy it when I put (the tapes) on. I've seen the anime in different versions, the original (dutch), japanese, german, english etc. etc. And most of the times the audio sfx's stay the same, which is good. 
 
The characters are magnificent, we got Alfred, the duck. Who lives in a giant glog-shaped house.Then we got a mole who takes care of the duck. 
Dolf, the leader of the bad organization &quot;National Crows' Party&quot;, who resembles Adolf Hitler. Then we get a &quot;black&quot; duck, who's a refugee and Alfred's girlfriend, a polar bear who's a scientist, we even got a stork and a magpie as cool characters. 
 
We've got lots of animals, who resemble or potrait cool, funny, evil and most of all, fun people (or just) fictional beings. For kids it's highly enjoyable, if you like serious anime's with a small touch of kids view, this is what you need to see.

","This is a quick review to let people know that this anime is terribly underrated. Not a lot of people have watched it so I guess it’s only recently been subbed. But I seriously recommend it. For a 1983 mecha, it features the best animation and characterization of the genre for years to come. In that decade, the flowing animation and clear character designs were rivaled only by OVA's and movies. I kept googling it and double-checking just to see if I wasn’t watching a 90’s/00’s remake by accident. You’ll watch this and wonder how Macross (slightly earlier) and Zeta Gundam (two years later) managed to look so unappealing. More so considering this is apparently also Tomino’s brainchild, though he didn’t seem to be involved in production. 
 
The premise doesn’t sound that original at first. A group of kids are stuck on a spaceship, somehow managing to survive constant alien attacks. The spaceship getting hounded by aliens thing has been around since Space Battleship Yamato, but the new thing is that the main group of characters are really just teenagers and mostly very small children. Suddenly your parental instinct kicks in and the stakes are alot higher. They wouldn't kill off a 6 year old main character right? Right...??? 
The other new thing is that it works. It’s light hearted, fun but exciting and suspenseful, very consistenly so, for 46 episodes. If you like the first couple of episodes, you’ll like all of them. Even my favorite genre series so far had boring filler episodes or flaws that stuck out like a flamingo at a funeral. 
 
At the very least it wins the prize for least flawed mecha series of the early 80’s. 


          
 
       Helpful Vifam can be best described as a show that settles upon simple concepts and focuses on executing them as well as possible. The show has a simple premise: humanity has expanded out into the galaxy and has come into contact with an alien race, over time war broke out between humanity and them, a group of children( from ages 4 to 15) got separated from their parents in the fighting, and we follow them as they go on an adventure through space to find them again. They learn to defend themselves, make hard decisions, and grow up a lot along the way.  
 
These children and their development is the focal point of the show, with the ongoing war and enemy attacks providing the background needed to facilitate their growth. The children really do feel like children, and there is a prevalent slice of life element present that connects you with them all as characters. Their trials are almost as much about learning proper social interaction and dealing with their own personal challenges as it is fighting off enemy mecha and managing their spaceship. The two intertwine constantly.  All the characters are well developed, and in a stroke of brilliance the show delivers a story about how children – through their need to be protected and loved by their parents, a definitive trait of children – end up maturing into heroic, independent and reliable individuals who tend to do just fine without them. 
  
Visually this show delivers, the art is rarely if ever off model and the mecha are well designed and tend to just look plain good. At times it looks as good as you would expect an OVA to. Even the grunt units tend to be well shaded and rarely are brought about via stock footage. What is especially interesting is that the mecha are incredibly plain – just about every unit has the same set of weapons and have similar capabilities, and yet every battle is dynamic and engaging. The choreography is extremely well done, especially considering how plain the mecha and their capabilities are. The creators pulled this off by making battles multifaceted, adding in more elements than just the mecha combat, and by having a good sense of how to keep a battle visually engaging in general. Just like with the general themes and character development in this show the mecha element is simple and effective, focusing on high quality execution and not worrying about novelty or flashiness. The music is well done and achieves what it needs to. The main antagonist’s theme is really satisfying to me personally and is one of my new favorites in anime. 
 
Vifam is an underrated gem from the golden age of mecha anime. It isn’t a flashy show at all. If anything it is the epitome of “substance over style”. If you like 80s mecha anime then this is a must see. 


          
 
       Helpful Being an obscure title from the 80s, I didn't have high hopes for this series, however, I found myself pleasantly surprised. 
 
Story 
 
In the future, Humanity has reached out into space and colonised two other planets. The story begins on the most recently colonised planet, as it falls under attack by alien forces. The civilian population proceeds to evactuate and amidst the chaos of battle, the training ship Janus takes flight across the galaxy. It's crew number just over a dozen, most of whom are children. 
 
Essentially, this is a story about 13 children, their travels across the galaxy, and the effect they have on the war. It's a fairly light-hearted tale, watching the characters learning to cope in space, and learning to defend themselves, while they grow together as a group. 
 
There is a fair helping of humour in the way the characters go about there task, but the series is generally a serious one. The scenario is also well crafted, with lots of little details as to how and why. I didn't really notice any loose threads. 
 
The series weighs in at a hefty 46 episodes, but there's plenty of story to tell, and it keeps going at a fairly nice pace. 
 
Character 
 
From the worried leader, to the excitable-military-nut, to the laid-back-jokester, the characters are solid, if perhaps a little simple, with a good variety of personalities. 
 
Art 
 
For an 80s anime, the art is well done. The characters have lots of personality, and the battles are decent, with little noticable re-use of clips. 
 
Sound 
 
No complaints. The characters seem well-voiced. Hearing the little ones ask when they'll meet their parents will likely tug at a few people's heartstrings. 
 
Overall 
 
In short, it's a good series that doesn't really deserve to be overlooked as much as it seems to be. Sure, being from the 80s, the art is a bit dated, and scenes are paced a bit slower, but it's still a well-made series. I'll recommend this to people who like sci-fi, and think the characters should be more important than the mecha. 
 
PS. It probably deserves an 8, but my bias against 80s anime says only 7 :P

","I previously wrote a review for this anime but I wasn't quite happy with it so I'm remaking it... You can skip to the end for a quick summary. 
 
Keep in mind that this anime is REALLY ecchi, there's nudity and sexual acts so if you don't like that kind of thing then don't watch this. If you didn't like it simply because it was short I'm kind of disappointing in you.  
 
Story: 8 
It's about a boy being engaged to a popular girl at school and them proceeding to live together. This kind of premise is not entirely unique so there's not much to say about it. But what originally appealed to me in the story was how they handled its ecchi. Instead of showing meaningless boobs on screen, they actually twist the more ecchi moments into actually being very romantic and intimate moments between the leads. Which serves as both not only fan service for the viewer but also very romantic and touching moments. 
 
Art: 7 
The backgrounds are okay, I didn't find them particularly hard to look at nor particularly stunning. The character models are nice and they often switch from more realistic human models to more chibi like models to convey comedy and make character to appear to be more cute with varying degrees of success. Animations are not stellar but they don't feel lazy. 
 
Sound: 7 
SFX is often off for example something makes a sound yet the sound appears 1 to 2 sec after that action. This is NOT TOO bad and can often be overlooked. The SFX themselves seems realistic and believable as does the voice acting. The OST is meh. None of the tracks stood out to me but they all help to convey the right moods at the right scenes.  
 
Characters: 8  
I found all the characters to be very likable. The mc, Izumi, is pretty mature and is NOT afraid to engage in sexual acts with our other mc, Ui. Ui herself can be pretty adorable and gives Izumi that extra push to actually do stuff with her, once engaged, Izumi is pretty ballsy compared to pretty much every other protagonist of an anime like this which is honestly an incredible breath of fresh air. The supporting cast is more or less forgettable, nothing really stands out but they are likable especially Ui's mother. Ui's mother, actually feel like a step-mom, yet she still feels like her own person as she has very childlike qualities that corresponds with her appearance. This anime also does a pretty good job at shoving details about the character's lives and their thinking without going right out and saying it making do on its incredibly short run time 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Because of its admittedly fan service-y and ecchi nature of this show it easy to enjoy. However, because they spin in it ecchi in such a romantic way the show also becomes quite heartwarming. It's short run time also helps in this because the anime's short comings can easily be overshadowed by the more superior romantic moments. 
 
Overall: 8 
Watch if you want to see... 
-An intimate romantic relationship 
-A LOT of kissing 
-A somewhat realistic approach to its engagement premise 
-A popular girl/living together romance 
 
NOTE: Keep in mind that these compliments ONLY extend to the s1, s2 is bad don't watch that the best I can give it is a 6 for s2 :\ 


          
 
       Helpful First of all,this is very same type of ecchi anime as others,very basic but enjoyable plot,nice looking art without awkward animations,symphatic protagonist who doesnt seems like virgin when he sees some boobs, everything was great about this anime except the length,you cant enjoy good plot and atmosphere with this anime with just 8 min. lenght which is extremly short,i would recommend to authors at least 15-20minutes. 
But,compared to other same genre ecchi,love,romance anime this one is slightly short also on plot,if you are heavy-minded on plot you can find this anime somehow unsatisfying for you,but for average ecchi audience i think this one will do his work. 
 
If you enjoyed anime like for example : To Love Ru,Rosario to Vampire etc, you will also love this one,just without supernatural things and aliens. 
 
8/10 I highly recommend this short-length but great anime :)

          
 
       Helpful Alright guys, how do you spell degenerate? D E G E N E R A T E. That's right! It's also you, and me! Okusama ga Seitokaichou is probably something that will make me feel like a degenerate for the next month, but do I regret watching this? Not really. 
 
Story: For the 10 minutes that the anime has for screentime, the story is actually progressed at a constant and steady rate. The content of that does vary depending on the episode, but overall they do manage to fit in a good amount of story into 10 episodes. Every episode seems to have a focus on a character, and many involve our main character turned degenerate, Hayato, and how his antics seem to affect his soon-to-be wife. With the story of the episodes, they also sometimes throw in a gimmick, like how he and Ui have to make up, a chance meeting with someone, etc.  
 
Art: Alright. I'll say it. I watched the uncensored version. I'm a degenerate. However, all that really did was add in the part from the love hotel, and add in some HYPER REALISTIC ANATOMY. Besides the fact that I watched that version, the art is actually not that bad. They make good use of changing to chibi forms, expressions are nice, and they like using the thinking emote a lot. Also, each and every character stand out in their own way. However, past that, the art is just kinda there. 
 
Sound: Lots of lewd noises. Oh, and the opening is nice. Yeah, that's all I got. 
 
Character: For 10 minutes per episode, the characters are used very well. Each character got their own episode with something centered on them, and you can definitely tell which character is which based on personality. Everyone is their own selves, and they actually showed character personality to the last detail. However, since the episodes are only 10 minutes, that does not leave much time for deeper development outside of the 2 main characters. 
 
Enjoyment: Overall, yeah. I felt like a total degenerate watching this anime. I would say that hindered my enjoyment just a slight bit. However, getting that out of the way, I still enjoyed this, in a slightly weird way. 
 
Overall: My overall opinion of this show is that it's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend watching it in public, or really anywhere outside your house. Overall, not that bad of an experience, although the short episodes may hinder some enjoyability.

14,966,4,12.77754688,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Crayon Shin-chan,"Just because an anime features a young protagonist does not necessarily mean that it is an appropriate series to show your children. Young Shinnosuke, or Shin-chan for short, is a very creative young boy that lives with his eccentric parents, Misae and Hiroshi, as well as his Prima Donna younger sister, Himawari, and has loads of unique friends to boot. 
 
Everyday life for little Shin-chan is full of funny (and shocking) moments, most of which stem from his unnatural and sometimes profane use of language, as well as his constant acts of inappropriate behavior. Shin-chan's famous ""elephant"" gag is one of the most defining moments in  Crayon Shin-chan , simply because it is the epitome of crude comedy, one of the core themes of the series. 
 
 Crayon Shin-chan  is a hilarious show about the day in the life of a young, curious boy, that captures the awkwardness of growing up as well as the beauty of being true to one's self, no matter what others say.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","Hands down, my favorite anime, it's original, extremely funny, you might say the art style is bad, until you realize that it's how the characters are supposed to be drawn. I have seen the anime about 15 times over,i watch it a lot, very re-watchable. For being 5, shin(main character) always gets himself into trouble, mostly for pulling down his pants and doing his famous ass dance, has a very potty mouth, and makes some hilarity with his 4 friends. Georgie being my favorite of the 4. In all this anime deserves awards for awesomeness

          
 
       Helpful Well, that sure does it for me with this show. 
After watching literally 999 episodes and with the 1000th one just around the corner this next Friday, I think it's safe to assume I'm so deep into this show's endless nature that I will likely die before they stop making episodes for it (and movies, and Specials, and OVAs, and...). 
 
I'll take a big On-Hold hiatus from this until it somehow comes to an end (which I doubt), just to say that I'm not actually dropping it, because stupid me here never drops anime for pure OCD at this point. 
 
Such is the longevity of Japanese family fun anime ever since Sazae-san (that one I can't even watch whether I want it or not, since the eps are not preserved and no copies were made for several of the lost ones). Gotta say though, as much as I enjoy watching this to pass time, it's bound to get amazingly repetitive with the quirks, humor, eventual flanderizations and even some of its smartest comedic aspects. 
 
You still get here and there absolutely hilarious episodes, legit tearjerking moments (some of which even directly connects to a bigger picture made into a movie) and overall a lot of fun with the cast's great chemistry with each other. But at this point, you are also bound to find one huge mixed bag of overdone content and unfortunately very toned down comedy edges for a series that actually had a history of being quite the risquè enthusiast with many of its elements (being instead substituted at times with Disney Junior levels of ""for kids"" content, which was quite a shock considering how much this series used to really never stepped down too much from always trying to be very accessible for both parents and children to have their share of giggles). 
 
Other than that, this bit is quite obvious for anyone familiar with the series: 
 
Art and animation were always mediocre at best, although becoming a lot more fluid and well animated over the years in several specific occasions. 
Sound being your usual japanese slice of life comedy generic tunes with some memorable songs thrown in at times and of course, if you account on this category, your usual old-school cliche sound effects and punchline delivery shenenigans. 
 
And for an anime this long to only have had 17 openings and 15 endings is a bit weird and underwhelming as an element to look forward to in several cool plotlines that could have been made into them, if you allow me to do a nitpick, but that's just my opinion as a OP/ED lover myself. 
 
The characters literally make this show by themselves and are the true shine of this whole anime however. You really got to appreciate just how many situations they come up with in which the characters by simply being in there and acting like the audience would expect them to (and sometimes the situation being severally subverted for better or for worse, just to make a side note as to why this show can be unpredictable with part of its character interactions even taking in consideration the issue with flanderization mentioned above), and you have a funny time for solid 7-13 minutes depending on how long the segment sets itself up to be. 
 
Talking about that, something that makes this anime works in the Enjoyment portion is just how much it really tries not to overstay its welcome, always opting to going for 2-3 short different segments per episode (saved for some exceptions), many times being animated and written by different people of the anime staff, which gives a bit of lively variety in its own way. 
 
This anime has, as to be expected for such a long long-running anime, a lot of flaws and a mixed bag of episodes (to the point of several times being a mixed bag as a segmented episode per se). But you can't deny the overall appeal, influence and just how good it is in many regards in its own merits, for a comedy series. 
 
Besides all of its problems, I can't help but to give a solid and well deserved 7/10. 
 
If you are not a crazy person like me that goes completionist mode with every anime they touch, do yourself a favor and give a try at least in the first episodes, I can guarantee that, even if it isn't quite your kind of comedy, you will still have a good time with it. 
 


          
 
       Helpful ***THIS IS A REVIEW SOLELY FOR THE FUNIMATION ADULT SWIM CRAYON SHIN-CHAN*** 
 
When I first acknowledged that Shin-chan is finally going to be dubbed and licensed in NA, I was filled with thrill and excitement, having been a diehard Kureiyon Shin-chan fan since I was born, and could not wait to see it. However, after watching through all of it, and saw that there isn't any review on MyAnimeList on this specific release, I felt like I could give a word of advice or two for those who haven't seen it but will. 
 
Every bit of the English dubbed version of Crayon Shin-chan reminds me of the Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt dub. It is just a blatant and unjustifiable excuse for the voice actors, actresses and script writers to have fun and mess around with everything but without totally screwing up the original intentions and quality, but instead adding on top of it a different, but more suited type of humor for their intended audiences (North America and other English-native cultural based countries). 
 
With that summary said, it is clear now that those who have watched all the three-season 78~ episodes, will surely be shocked, interested, and surprised by what Adult Swim and FUNimation can do to totally turn an everyone-rated show into a purely adult-targeted grotesque and profane Newgrounds type of parody. I will try my best not to go off-topic in this review, but make it easy, cohesive, and be as critical and non-biased/objective as possible. 
 
In the American version of Shin-chan, many episodes that long-time original viewers are familiar with are turned upside down in such a way that each and every dialogue is different, thus resulting a different episodic story that tries to reach its audiences, but fails to leave an heavy impression like any of the originals do. There are of course the famous Apartment (Shin-chan blows up their house) arc, a Star Wars parody, and some related episodes that share the same settings (Happiness bunny's revenge, etc.) which FUNimation did an incredible job of dubbing them, however these still lacked the overall productive and practical sense of enjoyment the original had. 
 
This dilemma is verified through the four or five commentary episodes, where all the voice actors come together to bash the show and explain why they did what they have done as they saw fit. Not only that, but in certain episodes many lines direct to the audience in an attempt to break the fourth wall, however this trend only adds to the audience's confusion often times to the already confusing story in each hardcore edited episodic plot and setting. 
 
The original show's humor primarily focuses on Shin-chan's lingual disabilities, a fetish on butt-dance, lewd and childish acts, and all his friends‘ and families' yelling at him. The FUNimation version takes a huge opposite turn and deviates away from such elements, and create a world of their own. The dubbed show contains violence, insults, every-5-second swearing, characters' misery as laugh points, and just unbearable, incredibly shallow dirty and racial jokes. As expected when trying to convert such a cultural-heavy comedy show. 
 
While both shows tend to involve the exploitation of Shin-chan's private parts, nudity, and his father and his' abnormal perverted interest in hot, young-looking teenage girls and cougars, the US version tends to use this as one of the primary selling points of the show. But this is done incredibly well that it left the viewers not comfortable enough if one episode did not have a scene of Shin-chan's commenting on wanting to grope the breasts of his prey(this generalization is lacking in the original, as it can do with or without the lewd comments). 
 
The characters and their stereotypes have not quite changed. Hiro is still the average working class, Misae still the totalitarian dictator, Shin-chan the clueless, eccentric boy, etc. however certain characters behave differently here and there and have totally different roles to their original versions. Shiro (Whitey) has a British accent and a cunning personality, the teachers are all over sex and don't care about the things they say to the kids, the kindergarten principal is now a Mexican who is made fun of a-lot about for his genital sizes. 
 
Up to this point, I should be able to bring the fundamental difference between the show that made me give this a 7 and the original series and movies a 9. It is lacking many of the morals, emotional connections, and familial love and relationship lessons the latter offers the audience. This version completely disregard any of the said good qualities the original had, and will not satisfy the emotional side of your soul. Sounds cheesy, I know, but it's true. Original Shin-chan was not as shallow as FUNimation version, and had a lot more connotation that the viewers could not watch without. 
 
Shin-chan is old, and is birthed in the 90's. While the current episodes are getting along with the times, in 720p and all that jazz, the center concept and themes still haven't changed. As FUNimation picked episodes that are quite old and still revolves around more mature-but less appealing humor, they do quite a damn well excellent job in adapting for the American audience. By comparing the two versions side by side, one can easily distinguish the comedy values of the two cultures. 
 
The cultural and lingual barriers of the jokes are non-existent as they do in the original subbed version, perhaps due to the fact that FUNimation did not pick the episodes where Shin-chan says something in Japanese similar to another word or phrase, and their parents or friends correct them, and similar type of jokes the average Joe just wouldn't be able to comprehend or find funny, due to aforementioned differences. At times the viewers can even find the voice actors themselves making fun of the show inside the show. Inception! In regards with the voice acting, not enough compliments and respect can be given to FUNimation at how perfectly they can use the same animation, but produce such drastic and incredible results, by only using clever lines, meta, and reference jokes. 
 
To sum it up, I don't want to make this a TL;DR review, so what's most important is this: take this review with a grain of salt, and you will either love-or-hate this version. For those of you who have not watched a single episode of original Shin-chan and have no clue what it is about, watch it as if you were watching a newgrounds parody, because that's what American Crayon Shin-Chan is, but at its best. For those who have seen or are seeing the original, this will be a new start, a totally fresh start that won't bore, but appreciated by the seasoned Shin-chan lovers. Completely enjoyable, though occasionally offensive and confusing, FUNimation and Adult Swim does the job well done. 
 
Scored ratings and punchlines: 
 
Story 6/10 (Quite decent, some are superb innovation and unexpected, some are just repetitive and brainless, thus a fairly balanced mix) 
 
Art 5/10 (The style of Shin-chan is natively deformed and extremely cartoon like, with the occasional short scenes with superb artistic styles only to emphasize the mood and atmosphere. However, the consistency between episodes is what bothers me quite an amount. Thus the low rating) 
 
Sound 8/10 (Every voice acting piece was god-like, no flaws, no awkward moments, just a hell lot of fun and everyone especially Laura Bailey of Shin-chan puts their all into it) 
 
Character 8/10 (Ridiculous, unbelievable, yet understandable and relate-able, the characters seem to be more enjoyable but less respectable than in the original version) 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 (If you liked PSG, FLCL, and all the nonsensical comedy genre animes, you should definitely not skip the FUNimation version of Crayon Shin-chan. 50% trolling, 40% sex-related jokes, and 10% parody. What more could you need to laugh your butts off?) 
 
Overall 7/10 (Don't know any better way to say it: It is definitely, certainly, and undoubtedly a waste of time, but if you had time to waste, you wouldn't feel it was wasted with FUNimation's Shin-chan!)

       Helpful As an OVA, Major: Message's point is just to bring the entire series to a close. Gorou, who has faced many many struggles so far, but have always received support from his friends and family, becomes the one to support his family, with his only gift he can give to his kids, baseball. 
Throughout all seasons of Major, we've seen Gorou grow from a talented reckless kid, to a championship-winning professional in Major League Baseball in USA, while retaining his recklessness. But the biggest influence he's had is arguably from his dad. So now that Gorou has become the father, he sought to be the role model to his kids, the way his father became his. And the only way he could do that after his injury, being the reckless that he is, is to show his kids, Izumi and Daigo, the result of his hard works; to show them that an obstacle is just another challenge to help them grow. 
I know there won't be another season of Major, but if there ever is, this time it'll be the story of Izumi, the way that Major was the story about Gorou.

She moved back to with her parents and continued to date Takayuki Narumi. She wanted to see her old friend Mitsuki Hayase who Takayuki Narumi dated while she was in coma. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance']","Kimi ga Nozomu Eien's story revolves around the main protagonist Takayuki Narumi, a male high school student. The first chapter, which takes place between July 6 and August 20, 1998, serves as a prologue to the second chapter. Takayuki is set up with Haruka Suzumiya by their friends Mitsuki Hayase and Shinji Taira. Takayuki ends up in bed with a nude sprawled out Haruka, but their relationship is not consummated due to performance anxiety. Mitsuki stops Takayuki on her birthday and has him buy her a ring, which results in him being late for his date with Haruka. At the end of the chapter, caused by Takayuki not being able to arrive in time, Haruka ends up in a coma because of an accident. In chapter two, during the three years since the accident, Mitsuki has been taking care of Takayuki and they have formed a relationship. Takayuki has also taken a part-time job at the Daikuuji (Sky Temple) family restaurant. Haruka's sister contacts Takayuki to tell him that Haruka has come out of her coma and is asking to see him.
","Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~ is an alternate re-telling of the original KimiNozo, or Rumbling Hearts in English. Rather than choosing Mitsuki, like in the original, this 4 episode OVA follows the story where Takeyuki chooses to follow Haruka instead. 
 
STORY 
I can't say I loved the original storyline very much, but at least there were tear jerking moments, and very good drama scenes. In this re-telling, we see hardly exciting &quot;drama&quot;, nor a real story to begin with. Almost like it's dragging out the storyline to last 4 episodes. I wouldn't say more as the storyline is so thin, any mention of anything would probably remove the need to watch it. 
 
I might be semi-biased though, since I supported Mitsuki throughout the original, or at the very least, Akane. 
 
ART 
As in the original, the art is quite good. 
 
SOUND 
The opening ain't bad. Not the best, but not bad. 
 
CHARACTER 
I see complete makeovers in Takeyuki, who suddenly became an understanding person instead of the moronic loser from the original, Haruka suddenly turned to be strong-willed, and Shinji suddenly became a relationship guru that everyone goes to him for help. Come on, at least keep the personas the way they were! 
 
ENJOYMENT 
I think I enjoyed it more than I'm supposed to, possibly because of the art. But there was too little Daikuji Ayu, meaning far less entertainment than the original. 
 
OVERALL 
If you are a great fan of the original, or is a Takeyuki X Haruka fan, you might like this one, though it's far from the standard of the original. Too many persona changes, a mediocre storyline, and too litlle Daikuji Ayu.

          
 
       Helpful The storyline here was weak, it felt like they were dragging it out needlessly. I gave it a ten because I was on team Haruka.  I accept this as canon-how it was supposed to go-not a retelling,. 
 
How could you pick your lover out of SHEER guilt? Haruka was the one he wanted to be with.  I know that loyalty and romance matter a lot, but desire is the most important force in the range of human emotions.e. If you settle-you'll stray. At least that's how i see it. I doubt tatuyuki could ever be faithful to Mitsuki. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I would say ""spoiler alert"" but because there is no actual direction, climax or conclusion you could read all of this and the viewing experience would be no different. 
 
This is an alternate ending to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien or Rumbling Hearts, and it may as well be another reality.  
 
The characters are inconsistent to their personalities in the original series. Seeing Takayuki in a blissful state of complete happiness with Haruka was perplexing to watch, because: 
a.) When has Takayuki ever been happy? Who is this character? What? 
b.) Stop being so happy 
c.) It is as if Mitsuki never happened (...I'm sure HarukaxTakayuki fans will dig it) 
 
Compared to the first series, 'Next Season' is so much less intense and angsty. Which unfortunately makes it a little dull... a lot dull. Every time something could go wrong, it doesn't. Every time a character has complexities (I'm speaking on behalf of you, Mitsuki and Akane), their issues are carefully brushed into a corner to avoid the emotional confrontation that they perceive a frail Haruka to be incapable of understanding. The whole arrangement is kind of disconcerting, sort of like having hidden ingredients in your meal and wanting to know what they are but you never find out. 
 
Overall I would describe this as ""sweet"". If you found yourself frustrated by the heavy emotionality and display of raw human emotion found in the original take, this is perfect for you.

Fortunately, many of the city's citizens were able to evacuate to safety, and in the years afterward have formed a new home called Edge. 
 
 Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children  revolves around Cloud and Tifa as they try to make new lives for themselves, as well as for those around them, in this new city.

He has no idea, however, that these men share a link to his old enemy, Sephiroth, and Cloud’s quest to vanquish them will bring him back into conflict with the demons of his past. If there is any hope in conquering these threats, it lays within the bonds of friendship between Cloud and his allies who saved the world once, and now must do so again.","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Fantasy']","
Advent Children takes place two years following the events of the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, during which the antagonist Sephiroth attempted to absorb the Lifestream (the lifeblood and soul of the Planet) and be reborn as a god. He was defeated by Cloud Strife and his companions. Still, Sephiroth's final spell, Meteor, destroyed the city of Midgar. 
Since the end of the game, the survivors of Midgar founded the new city of Edge, where Cloud and his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart now run a courier service and are the caretakers of an orphan Denzel and the adopted daughter of Barret Wallace, Marlene. Due to feeling guilty for failing to save Aerith Gainsborough, Cloud has recently moved out and isolated himself from his friends. The story also portrays that many people, including Cloud and Denzel, are infected with a mysterious disease known as ""Geostigma,"" which has no known cure.
Cloud is contacted through Tifa and summoned to a meeting with the Shinra Company's former president Rufus Shinra, who was presumed killed in Final Fantasy VII. Rufus asks for Cloud's help to stop Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo. The trio is the physical manifestation of Sephiroth's surviving spirit. They are seeking to resurrect him using the remains of the extraterrestrial villain Jenova. Cloud refuses to help and leaves.
Meanwhile, Kadaj and his colleagues are recruiting children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight, and Loz kidnaps Marlene. All the abducted children are taken to the ruins of the Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren. He announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, Kadaj's gang overpower him but is saved by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Cloud then returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.
Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he possesses Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj saves it and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are caught in a blast along the way by an explosive planted by Reno and Rude. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud he will use the souls of Geostigma's deceased victims to dominate the Planet. He and Cloud then fight. Throughout the encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. Cloud replies that he cherishes everything and then uses his Limit Break, Omnislash Ver. 5, to defeat Sephiroth. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.

","Final Fantasy VII, the game, will have a special place in my heart for the reason that it was the first RPG I ever completed. It holds powerful sway, so much so I've beaten it 100% many times, worked hard to raise gold chocobo's and even defeated the &quot;unbeatable&quot; Weapons. 
 
Sitting down to Advent Children I came into it with mixed thoughts. On one hand I knew it would never capture the charm of the game, but since it had all the same characters it must have some good parts. Was I right? No, I was horribly wrong. 
 
I watched this movie both subtitled with Japanese audio and in English. But never have I felt more empty and broken then when I finished this movie. The story itself is like a poorly written fanfiction compressed into a short movie. Character development is null because those characters developed DURING THE GAME. I thought perhaps I was being too critical on the game as a hardcore otaku, and so I watched it trying to pull away and look at it as &quot;fanboy-ish&quot; as possible. 
 
Did it work? No, no it failed horribly. Even as a fan of the game I hated this movie, hated what they did to my favorite characters and what they did to an ending that I thought was very well done. The ONLY thing about this movie that I thought was decent was the art. But that's to be expected, animation quality nowadays is top-notch and since FF7 is a serious fanbase it's not hard to expect that the quality of the animation would be top-notch. So would I recommend this movie to anyone? No, definitely not

That's the only fitting description I can think of. Advent Children is basically a 100 minute FMV. You get treated with breathtaking graphics, and that's about all you get. 
Story and characters are about as shallow as it gets.  
Story is better forgotten, and characters are actually impossible to remember. 
Don't listen to the pants-creaming Final Fantasy fanboys out there, past the visuals there's nothing even remotely interesting to be found in there.

Junpei and Kanta, who live with their grandfather, a fisherman, and their father, the head of the firefighting force of the village, are forced to move to the stables while the Russian commander's family, among them the commander's daughter Tanya, move into the main house. At school, Russian children occupy half the building, and Tanya and the other Russian kids begin to mingle with the Japanese children at recess. After a playground jostle makes Junpei bump into Tanya, they become friends and the two brothers are subsequently invited to Tanya's house for dinner.

Meanwhile, their father, Tatsuo, with the help of their school teacher, Sawako, secretly supplies the rest of the village with foodstuff from the Dawn Corps' emergency stores. When Hideo finds out about this, he tries to smuggle the food to sell outside the island, but gets caught instead. Tatsuo rushes to the cave where the Dawn Corps' supplies are kept and gets arrested.
On September 25, 1947, the Japanese on the island are made to assemble at the harbour to be sent back to the mainland. Junpei and Kanta set out with Sawako, while their grandfather chooses to stay behind, determined to spend his last moments on the sea. The three are reunited with Hideo while boarding the ship, and arrive at an internment camp at Maoka, in western Karafuto, a few days later, where they wait for the ship that will take them back to Japan.

The four of them drive to a pillbox where they spend the night, but in the morning they spot Soviet soldiers who've managed to track them down, and Hideo runs ahead as a decoy while Sawako and the children make their escape.
The trio are able to make their way to the internment camp holding Tatsuo, where they have a tearful farewell, with Tatsuo promising he'll find a way to reunite with them no matter what.

Junpei's school holds a graduation ceremony for those who never managed to have it, and a blonde girl, Tanya's granddaughter, approaches Junpei at dinner. She hands him a notebook, containing one of Junpei's sketches of Tanya, and Junpei gives her his old copy of ""Night on the Galactic Railroad"" in return. Junpei is saddened to learn that Tanya had died a year earlier. The Russian hosts then begin to play music and the partygoers, both Russian and Japanese, begin to dance. Tanya's granddaughter invites Junpei to dance with her, and the scene morphs to the spirits of Shikotan's original residents dancing with each other among the stars.
Theme
Giovanni’s island follows these two boys in a roller coaster of emotions focusing on after World War Two. Mainly on the after effects for Japan from losing the war, this small island in the outskirts of Japan was greatly impacted and forced to share schools and houses with foreign conquerors. The theme that the movie is trying to focus on is delivering a message to the audience that even with being in a position of conquest and oppression you can get along when put in the right environment especially for children. The children were forced to combine their schools as the families of the soviet union came and colonized the island with the Soviet soldiers. When they first arrived the two mixtures of Japanese and Soviet Union children did not intertwine well but with time they ended up building relationships with another and even became friends at school and embraced one another's culture. National anthems even became normal to sing each other's national anthem at school when they used to be separate and then they sung together. The children started to enjoy each other's company and even the commander of the Soviet Union’s family spent time with Japanese children for dinner.  Giovanni’s island shows the importance of endurance and compassion both were valuable for Junepi and Kanta in friendship with not judging an entire country  based on its action but instead just the person themselves. A prime example of this is the reunion at the end of the film because they all come together for the reunion in peace and harmony even after everything that the Japanese and Russians went through together on that island. Giovanni shows the destiny of people forced in this world where violence lingers, war is inevitable  and language is different but even with all of these issues the movie delivers a clear message that companionship and endurance through hard times can  persevere.
","1945, Japan was defeated in WWII. We find ourselves in the beautiful greenery island of Shikotan, and the Russian army has taken the land as their own. Junpei and Kanta are two little brothers who find themselves in the spoils of war and have to face this cruel reality. When two countries collide, we happen to discover different cultures, distinct features, language barriers and ruffling history. “Giovanni no Shima” takes us onto the railroads of a train, and stopping at every station, it shows us how to break those obstacles and teaches us about longing and loss, but also bravery and determination to achieve one’s goal, in a destroyed and homeless Japan.  
Miyazawa Kenji’s words and reveries play a major role in the story, thus Junpei and Kanta are named Giovanni and Campanella, two main characters of Miyazawa’s “Night on the Galactic Railroad” book. Some quotes are often taking part in the narrative with Junpei’s soliloquies. A tangible imagination guides us in yet, another lovely Production I.G; the art is well conceived, although one might refer to it as a bit kiddy and dull, but remember, this is a movie for the whole family, therefore, you will find its funny moments with chibi expressions and scribbled backgrounds. Nonetheless, i believe it to be of a very delicate caliber. One fascinating aspect is the voice actors, and i have to say that is extremely well exerted. Not only we hear new exquisite Japanese talent, but, as well, Russians voicing the Russian characters, like Tanya. You may also enjoy the coalescence of Russian songs with the Japanese ones, it gives a profound and unique ambience, i think.								   
Overall, “Giovanni no Shima” is a beautiful and powerful movie that should’ve earn the appreciation of everybody, and such will makes realize that the errors we committed in the past, cannot be repeated now, as well as in the future. 

          
 
       Helpful What. A. Big. Mood.  
 
in 1945 some stuff with some armies went on, you might've heard about it before. this movie does not mention the rape of nanking but it does tell the story of some people on some island somewhere. then it tells the story of the same people in places not on some island somewhere. 
 
the art is really really really good and enhances the most emotional scene in the movie which was very touching if you weren't listening to someone complain about the subs for the entire fucking scene, luceo. aside from the highly stylised moments on the galactic railroad the art is generally good, two of the characters are consistently vibrant and fun to watch. 
 
during the first half of the movie there's a great bit that really hits home how cool hearing stuff is, they're like singing a song and shit. the dub is really good and if you don't watch dubs i'm putting you on the f.b.i watchlist you fucking weebo pedo. 
 
i really enjoyed this movie. perhaps you could consider the portrayal of the soviets as pretty nice guys who're just following orders bad, but i don't feel like thinking super critically right now. also for a movie about world war II im pretty sure there was nothing about the nuclear bombs. mostly it's just a story about people, and the circumstances they're in, rather than a movie that makes any historical judgements. 
 
ok 10/10 i think, don't @ me on discord saying that i enjoy images of little girls i do not enjoy little images of little girls stop it do not say i enjoy them,

          
 
       Helpful Giovanni no shima is a beautiful film about dreams, hope and love. Taking place at an island called Shikotan in Northern Japan during the end of the 2nd World War, Giovanni no shima displays a unique milieu even for the most studious anime-watcher. 
 
Siblings Junpei and Kanta are very young when the Red Army comes and takes control of their dear home island. But even on the hard times, when food is scarce and scary armed men watch every move they take, the two have something they can always rely on: their imagination. ‘The Galactic Railroad’ is their way to escape difficult situations, taking them far away where ever they dream to, even if it's only for a moment. 
 
Soon they come to think that everything’s not that helpless after all. The culture the Russians brought with them is interesting, so different. As time passes the language sounds less and less strange in their ears. The fair-skinned kids they go to school with have become their friends. Maybe it’s possible to live along like that, in peace. Or is that only naivety of the youth? There are far bigger things happening and waiting to happen, things invisible, yet incomprehensible for Junpei and Kanta. 
 
Giovanni no shima relies on simple character design but interesting enough for everyone to look clearly different and recognizable. The colours and views of the island are beautiful, but a little plain. However, the ‘Galactic Railroad’ colours up not only Junpei and Kanta’s life, but the film’s looks too. Like the film overall, those dreams of Junpei and Kanta are beautifully animated. 
 
The voice acting is great. The children are really played by children, and the Russian characters by native speakers. We also hear some Korean in the film. All nationalities are shown to have both good sides and bad sides. The soundtrack is also beautiful, especially those few songs we hear sung by the children. 
 
The story told in Giovanni no shima is heartwarming, but also tragic. It’s an epic story of survival and loss, but also love, family and friends. Even though the story is fictional, it teaches you a lot about history you might not have heard about before, and makes you think. This interesting piece is definitely worth watching.

The only clue he has to who his family might be is an old photograph showing two young children, a boy and a girl, playing in a small pool outside of a blue house. In an attempt to find his family, he moves to this blue house and begins working as a programmer. He's living a comfortable life until the day two very different girls show up at his door, both in possession of the same photograph, and both claiming to be his twin. With no way to prove who is a relative and who is a stranger, Maiku allows both girls to move in with him until they know for sure.  
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Harem', 'School', 'Sci-Fi']","Please Twins! is a story about three high-school students: Maiku Kamishiro, Karen Onodera, and Miina Miyafuji. The three were drawn together by a photograph of their childhood home which later makes all of them seek out the house in the picture. However, the picture shows only two children, a boy and a girl. The three conclude from this that only one of the girls, either Karen or Miina, can be related to Maiku. The other must be a nonrelative. The only other identifying feature of the pair in the picture is that the boy and the girl have eyes of the same unusual color, a feature that furthers the ambiguity as all three of them share the same eye color.
The main concern of the male lead, Maiku, is that, although he eventually comes to care for both of the girls, he does not know which of them is his sister. In addition, the two girls develop feelings for Maiku, forming a love triangle that cannot be resolved until the truth of their relationship is known. All three main characters are in the predicament of wanting to discover their past versus the risk of losing a romantic relationship.
The events of the story are set the year after Please Teacher! and characters from that series appear in supporting roles throughout Please Twins!.
","This anime started good at first, but then the story started to revolve around childish things such as not letting a man have his space, testing him to see whether he was gay when he is trying to do his work, creating fake applications and saying you're 18 to get a job(illegal), and misunderstandings after misunderstandings after EVEN MORE misunderstandings. This anime is seriously revolved around misunderstandings. Mind you, all anime have misunderstandings in them, and they are annoying from time to time and I for one don't like them. But to say this anime has misunderstandings in it is an understatement. ""Girl's falling down on a chair and you grab her to keep her from falling"" : Calls you a pervert. ""You spill a hot drink on your pants and for some reason go outside of your tent to unzip your pants"" : Was getting it on with the girl  whose shirt happens to be undone. Seriously, is it SO much to ask for ONE scenario where the man actually, oh, I don't know, explains the situation instead of going ""oh... well this is..."" Miina always runs away for no fucking reason whatsoever and Karen always passes out and nobody bothers to send her to the hospital for this serious illness she has. The logic combined with the humor still leaves the most sour of all sour tastes in my mouth. To say I wanted to punch my screen while watching this series is an understatement. The whole plot is beyond childish. Looking at, for another example, two support characters going out, mind you, GOING OUT, and at the end of the date, the man kisses the woman, and she literally SHUNS him for life and heads over to liking another boy. What does shun in this example mean you ask? Slaps him (let me remind you: DATING), runs away, goes to pretending to like another boy for months on end, and then makes the man apologize to her for her own mental problems. All in all i'm glad I finally finished this anime. Side note, that music that's always playing for 2 minutes on while showing a slideshow of whats happening is very annoying. I do not recommend this anime to anyone who hates misunderstandings or 10 year old main characters. Though this was in made in the 2000 era, so i'll give it a small pass for that.

A spin-off sequel to Onegai Teacher, Onegai Twins is, by far, compared to its prequel, much more light-hearted than the complex (not much though) Onegai Teacher. It's a funny anime series which you, if you happen to be a fan of romantic comedies, will probably enjoy. Do not place high expectations on this anime though, for you may end up a little dissapointed. 
 
Story: Basically, the story is about a boy, Maiku Kamishiro, living by himself in the same setting as Onegai Teacher. A youngster with a mysterious past, the only clue to who is family might be is an old photo showing two children, him and an unknown girl playing outside in a small pool, on a blue house's yard. He moves to that same house, and finds a job as a computer programmer, while trying hard to keep up with his studies. However, his life has a turnaround when two different girls, Minna Miyafuji and Karen Onodera, each one of them carrying the same photo that he has and claiming to be his twin sisters, thus moving in with Maiku, until the mystery is uncovered. In addiction, the three of them have the same eye colour. Who is after all, Maiku's sister? However, in the end, both girls end up falling in love with him, but, because the truth to their relationship is not known, are in a predicament of wanting to discover their past against the risk of losing their romantic interest. 
I find this story, although appealing to our curiosity which is a good point about it, to be somewhat lame. In the end, it turns out to be pretty predictable too. And the background isn't well developed. Unless you watched Onegai Teacher first, you will not understand some things that take course on the plot. So I suggest you watch Onegai Teacher before passing on to this series. Not only that, but also the protagonists' background! The story loses some points because of that. Many animes with better stories than this one. There are a few stories with worse stories than this one too... 
 
Art: Nothing special really. Nor good, nor bad, just plain mediocre. Perhaps a little less worked out than in its prequel. It's a pity though. The art isn't the main asset of this anime show. 
 
Sound: Passing on to the sound. And my personally favorite part of this series! In my opinion, both the Opening and Ending Theme are great! Specially the Ending. A really nice song, meaningful lyrics and entracing melody and good rhythm. Take some time to listen to these songs. It's a shame though, we're talking about only two of them. The background musics are also pretty good. The favorable part about this series, without a doubt. 
 
Character: I wish I could say the same about the characters though. Like I mentioned before, their background is not very developed. And they aren't the most original characters in the world. Maiku, the tough and stoic guy, Karen, a shy and polite girl and her opposite polo, Minna, an outgoing and energetic girl. Typical &quot;love-triangle characters&quot;. Also, if you watched Onegai Teacher, remember the characters? Well, they're back! And... not better than ever. Ichigo Morino was a delight though. A charming dark sense of humour which gives life to this plot. Yet they made the characters from the prequel differently in this plot, and what's the idea of turning the quiet Matagu, into a pervert trying to get involved with his sister?! Pretty twisted... What's his interest after all? He should get a life. The supporting characters are not very appealing either. Far from the ideal anime crew. 
 
Enjoyment: Last but not least, the enjoyment. Though this series is full of flaws, it's light-hearted and funny to see their small disadventures through their life together. Also, the drama, though it might seem shallow and lame, give this anime a serious touch, which however ends up blurred by its comic relief. You will have some laughs, and, if you're the &quot;hopeless romantic&quot; type of person, you may cry in the end, which I doubt. The important about this series isn't the story, nor the excellency of characters, nor the art. It's about humour. A series best fitted to be watched during Summer, when school is over (a lot of chocolate helps too, you'll see!). 
 
Overall: 6/10 (Fair)

          
 
       Helpful It's your typical harem anime, it's kind of good and bad. I could not continues watching after episode 6 because it got weird. It's similar to ""One of Them is My Younger Sister!, Who is"" I'm not into those kind of romance which is why I stop. Just keep an open mind about it. 
 
Art: It's a little bit dated but during the time of it release it's considering to be decent at the time.  
 
Story: It's has an interesting story and setting. 
 
Character: I like the main character because he is reliable and independent. He's not your typical good-for-nothing/pervert.  
 
Enjoyment: I'm impress because it's not easy to impress me. The comedy element is strong, I love every second of it but the drama kill it. 
 
Overall: If you're looking for okay comedy/harem you might like this.

","Critic's Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2012. Review #20: Kimba, The White Lion 
 
Back when I was about 5 or 6 years old, there was a Disney movie that I watched all the time. That Disney movie was The Lion King. I loved the animation in the movie and I never got tired after repeated viewing. Today, I haven't watched it as much because there are other movies I like and I have shows that I want to watch. I decided to do a little research on the movie and I found that it bears a striking resemblance to Kimba from the anime Jungle Emperor (Kimba, The White Lion in The U.S.) There was a controversy over The Lion King because of its similarity to Kimba, The White Lion. It's been 18 years since The Lion King was released so I have no comment about the whole comparison of both things. My theory is that Kimba, The White Lion was the primary influence for The Lion King. It didn't completely plagarized Kimba, The White Lion. I also want to mention that I am treating this review as a retrospective. With that said, here's Kimba, The White Lion! 
 
 
 
The basic premise of this anime is that Leo (Kimba in the American release), a young lion cub who becomes king of the jungle when his father was killed by a human hunter. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Mushi Pro production and this is an anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga of the same name. Don't know who Tezuka-san is? I'll tell you. Tezuka-san is a cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer, activist, and was best known for series such as Astro Boy (which was the first anime to come to the U.S.), Black Jack, and Kimba, The White Lion. Tezuka-san was often nicknamed ""The Godfather of Anime"" and often considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney, which made total sense. Tezuka-san was influenced by some of Walt Disney's work. Tezuka-san has a prolific output, and had pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres that earned him nicknames such as ""The Father of Manga"" or ""The God of Manga"". 
 
 
 
Before I go any further, I want to apologize beforehand that I dropped this series and I don't plan on finishing it. I will simply give out my retrospective of Kimba, The White Lion to the best of my abilities. 
 
First of all, I am going to excuse the quality of animation on this anime for a couple of reasons. First off, this is the first anime in color. Secondly, this was a 60's anime. The animation has definitely aged as time went by. 
 
 
 
 
The music by Isao Tomita may not be recognizable today but he often composes soundtracks of the anime adaptations of Osamu Tezuka's series. 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as voices go. This is going to be a bit difficult to talk about. I am assuming the Japanese cast is good on this show. The Dub is from way before 90's dub quality and the dub is corny but actually watchable and that's saying a lot. Too bad the American release never included the subtitled version. it's a Dub-only affair in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
The characters are simply introduced well but it was hard for me to latch on to the characters in this show. I don't have much to say on this matter 
 
 
 
 
 
Then there's the story, It is kid-friendly but it does challenge the audience with some mature themes. It has a simple premise that expands as the show progresses I should also point out that Rintaro (who went by the name Shigeyuki Hayashi during the making of Kimba) was the chief director. You might want to do a little research on this guy because there might be a few animes that he was involved in that you probably didn't know that he was part of. Also, Eiichi Yamamoto was also the director of this anime and he also did the series composition for Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US). 
 
 
 
After sharing those little tidbits, allow me to mention The Lion King once more. About the whole controversy about whether The Lion King homaged this anime or plagarized it. There seems to be some comparisons between the two and I can see some similarities.  
 
 
 
This anime was influential in Japan and might as well be a major influence to The Lion King. The Lion King might as well be an American tribute to Kimba, The White Lion. 
 
Kimba, The White Lion is available from Right Stuf. 
 
 
 
With that said... Kimba, The White Lion is an anime worth checking out if you are looking for an anime that is definitely worth seeing if you want to go as far as the 60's. This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However in order to fully appreciate this anime, you will have to overlook the flaws and technicalities that this show had to offer. This was a 60's anime, this anime was completely hand-drawn and not many sound effects were possible at the time. What you see is what you get when it comes to this anime. Many children in Japan grew up watching this anime and now are the key players in the anime industry today. I may not have a big interest in this anime, but at least I was able to give out my first-impression retrospective into the series. 
 
 
 
I give Kimba, The White Lion a 5 out of 10, it is SO-SO! 
 
 
 
feel free to comment, and give out a might roar!

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.

","When it comes to One Piece, I always fall into the bias trap, for me personally, it is really hard to criticize what makes up my all times favorite franchise, but then again, sickness has to be called off. For a One Piece episode, movie, filler, OVA, ONA, special, anything, this was on the lowly low. I'm of course excusing the art department in this one as the time period of its release was never famous for that, it's the setting that was lacking, the oddness, the randomness, the goofiness, it wasn't there. 
 
When starting to watch any One Piece related content, you always come prepared to see some giant cheek clapping (Meaning it in an SFW way), colossal occupies dancing, eerie monsters walking down the street, reading a paper may be, it is always something out of the norm, but this was was a complete disappointment when it came to that, the only goofy thing was the villain's hairstyle, and it was not enough.

          
 
       Helpful Though this special is quite enjoyable it feels the most like filler out of all of them. The story is OK. But just a little bit to dragged out, it should have been 10 minutes shorter, if it was the special would be more enjoyable. However it isn't in any way a bad special. The premise is good, the new characters you meet in this special fit in well within the one piece world and the strawhats are their great personal selves. All in all a real one piece fan should not skip this special.

well it was an simple romance,ecchi anime.it was enjoyable and if u guys are free and got no animes to see you can watch it :D

          
 
       Helpful Tonagura! is basically an ecchi anime. There are a lot of fanservice and the requisite male character who always finds himself being slapped, kicked, and hit because of his perverted ways. 
 
I like the premise of the story because it deals with a childhood friend and crush who the female character meets again. Trouble is - the person Kazuki remembers from her childhood is not the same as the one she is seeing now. But as the series progresses, you might become annoyed with Kazuki for her continuous (and sometimes unfair) abuse for Yuuji - who is just probably just a little bit more perverted than boys his age. 
 
One of the more interesting characters who shine in this anime is Kazuki's older sister who is perfect - her evil, sadistic ways notwithstanding. She cosplays a lot - depending on the menu. But my favorite character would have to be the teddy bear gun-toting Marie, the younger sister of Yuuji, who deals out 'divine punishment' whenever her brother gets too perverted (which is most of the time). 
 
It's not really the best out there, but it could get you a few laughs and give you your fill of ecchi-ness if you're looking for one.

Story: 5/10 
 
Barely any story, it was just basically a ""Hey, that happened so let's add on to that!"" type anime. It wasn't done that badly, though. The comedy side on this anime is light-hearted, but it happens mostly when Yuuji is being perverted either towards Kazuki or someone else. If this was just a romance anime, I would've voted the story a 2, as it was mostly a one-sided romance anime. 
 
Art: 7/10 
 
When I was going to review this anime, I would've thought it was an anime that was made around 2010-2011, but when I looked at the date that it was aired, I was very surprised. The art was above average, with somewhat smooth animation. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
 
Soundtracks that play at scenes were average, it wasn't overused. The OP reminds you of a very normal school, romance comedy anime so does the ED. 
 
Character: 6/10 
 
I'll just state my sentences on the 4 characters: Yuuji, Kazuki, Marie and Hatsune. 
 
Kagura Yuuji, Kazuki's childhood friend, the perverted-type protagonist, which the kind I dislike but an exception for him. He can be serious sometimes, which made me like him as a character. 
 
Kazuki Arisaka, Yuuji's childhood friend, the character I hated the most in this anime. Why do I hate her? It's because she can't make her mind up. It's either she hates Yuuji or she loves Yuuji, choose one for fucks sake. On top of that, she makes Yuuji feel bad, by making him think that she likes this person or she likes that person, even though she knows and accepts the feelings she has for Yuuji. Mainly at the last 5 episodes, I felt really pitiful for Yuuji.  
 
Kagura Marie, the quiet, yet the type who always punishes her brother for doing indecent actions. She's unsocial, but good friends with Niina. 
 
Kazuki Hatsune, the type you would think that would fit best as a princess/queen, because of her elegant speeches, how she does everything perfectly and her nice, kind attitude. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
 
Though I disliked a lot of points about this anime, I still managed to enjoy this anime. Would I re-watch this anime? 95% no. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
 
Looking for a rom-com title that will kill some time until you find a better one? This anime may be for you.

","This show is not change your view on realty or shift your perception of the world if anything it will make you question what are you doing with your life. 
 
The main draw and turn away of this anime is definitely the ecchiness which is the base of the show. Now if you want to watch little shy boy (Kouta) get pushed around by huge breasted fox girl (Chizuru) then this is it man.  
 
But there's something else to it ,when I first watched this show in 8th grade I was probably trying to get a hard on or something. Now I watch it and find comedy in the simple portrayal of the plot and the gags. This anime was supposed to be dumb and doesn't take it self seriously at all. My fault in 8th grade was thinking this show was a hot and steamy romance anime ,when really it a very straightforward gag anime with ecchi to add to the general unserious and light tone. 
 
What I don't like about the show is the why. Why did that happen, why is the dialogue about as flat as Kansas, and why am I still here. Firstly the plot it's definitely one of those where something happens just cause if nothing happened you'd be watching borderline child pornography every episode. Things happen for no reason and there are constant changing trops and tropes which can be confounding. Second is the dialogue ,while watching I think silent films had more to offer than this 5th grader screenplay shit. Like it so simple and bare bones ,which can be funny sometimes ,but mostly I just find myself sitting there and wondering if there is a reason for existing. There is absolutely no substance to it if someone ever quotes something from this show and tries to find meaning to it their is non they say thing for the purpose of I need to factually state this has happened, I need to state what I am doing, I need to tell Kouta that I'm trying to bang, or ""omg not trying to bang""(Kouta). 
 
If you can deal with all that I truly admire your drive ,and maybe you'll find something we've all been looking for entertainment. 
 


          
 
       Helpful There's only 1 word that can truly describe this anime, ecchi..... Ecchi says everything about it. There is no true story line to it other then a fox girl falls in love with a human and wants nothing more then to be with him, but is constantly being interrupted by other spirits or some unseen force that just feels like it must interfere. 
 
A bit of a warning if you're wanting to watch this, don't watch the English dubbed. I watched the first episode of it (I do have a problem with watching a show with one set of a voices then having to switch over cause it messes with me but this was not the case) and I must say the voice actors are extremely bad... I merely watched the first episode of it so I didn't hear EVERYONE'S voice but Kouta sounded way too girly (Yea he's supposed to be some weak kid but that doesn't mean he's gotta sound like this), Chizuru was WAYYY too soft (From my understanding Chizuru does anything she could to be with Kouta and had no problems being intimate with him, why does she sound like she's a defenseless character...), I think the only one who sounded decent for their character was Tayura.

          
 
       Helpful 1st time to write a review. Im sorry for what will i say, Im just saying what i think of the anime. 
 
The story is good, it does have great scenes. I also find the anime very funny. 
 
but.... the characters for me seems to be quite lame or weird. I mean why does the boy is shorter than the girl, it would look as if a 16yr old girl would be a couple with a 12yr old boy. 
 
First part for me is good, very funny. Middle part would get boring. Last part would get good again. 
 
Final conclusion: ecchi it is great and many scenes of it is funny. But other than that, nothing is great about it anymore.

  Subaru Mikazuki es un joven que crecio sumido en la lectura facinado en las infinitas posiblidades q le brinda la imaginacion y como estas logran plasmarse en textos. Al no poder compartir su pasion con los demas jovenes se aislo bastante de la sociedad lo q lo lleva a ser un joven callado y un poco antipatico incluso para con su familia. Todo esto da un giro para mal al fallecer sus padres dejandolo sin familia cercana, solamente con un amigo y su pasion por su trabajo de novelista. 
  Es aqui donde comienza nuestra historia Subaru se encuentra estancado, sin inspiracion y su editor de siempre fue cambiado por alguien conmpletamente opuesto a nuestro protagonista. Durante una visita a la tumba de sus padres un pequeño gato callejero toma la ofrenda como su alimento. Subaru encuentra en su mirada ruda y amenazante una inspiracion q no habia sentido antes y sin pensarlo adopta a nuestro segundo protagonista; Una pequeña gata callejera la mayor de toda su camada en todo sentido, muy desconfiada y con un instinto protector q le hace honor a su sobrenombre gatuno onee-san. 
  Ambos protagonistas se relacionaran para mejor cambiando ambas vidas y aprendiendo como vivir en familia. Subaru aprendera a vivir en sociedad y como devolver el cuidado y afecto q esta le fue otorgando asi como tambien a afrontar la muerte de sus padres bajo estas nuevas luces. Mientras q nuestra protagonista gatuna aprendera a confiar en los demas y a disfrutar de una vida sin peligros junto a lo q ella considera su protegido (Subaru). Los personajes secundarios son queribles y bien planteados basados en estereotipos realistas lo q nos permite reflejar un poco de nuestra ambiente en ellos y familiarizarnos mas en esta serie. 
  La serie posee una narrativa destacable al emplear ambos puntos de vista para presentar la situacion del episodio. Comenzando con la perspectiva de subaru quien nos da un contexto del entorno  y la situacion a la vez q nos muestra sus miedos y preocuaciones. En la segunda mitad del capitulo la luz brilla sobre nuestra onee-san y es aqui donde la serie destaca al no otorgarnos animales inteligentes como humano sino q nos explica actitudes ferales como una forma de pensar simple. Ya no vemos el entorno o una situacion compleja sino un tema o foco a la vez y una emocion para cada situacion contrastando y eventualmente convergiendo con lo q nuestro protagonista humano ve q es un gran elemento de esta serie. 
  En cuanto al arte la serie esta hecha de manera explendida no se ven malas posturas o elementos muy exagerados q saquen a uno de la narrativa con una animacion simplista q omite los elementos mas complicados y nos deleita con lo q nos entrega 
  Su ost es bastante sencillo y un buen acompañamiento a las situaciones con un op y ed q respaldan la trama y plasman como se va a desarollar la misma.  
  Ciertamente una serie tranquila para ver de una sentada o dia a dia. Un slice of life / drama muy tranquilo q sirve para matar el rato o tener de trasfondo e incluso compartir con aquellos ajenos al anime.

          
 
       Helpful While I could make an effort to bolster this review up with excessive cat puns, I think I'll just attempt to stay out the litter box by sticking to the facts.  This feline focused slice of life ends up getting an 8.4 with the 5 point rating system, making the final score [8/10]   Having enjoyed it 10/10, Id love to push it up to a 9, but that is not how maths work.   Stupid maths.    
 
        So before we go into how we got that score, a bonus anecdote: 
            My Roommate is Sometimes on my Knees, and Sometimes on my Head...  is just way to long, so I can see where the, My Roommate is a Cat ((still long)) comes from, but I  feel like we are losing a bit of whimsy.  Like if you over heard me talking about my housemate stealing my muffin before crapping on the counter top,  not knowing it was a bird adds a bit of hilariousness to the situation.    
 
 
          So lets talk about the story of Haru's House.  Was the story ""An artistic introvert adopts a cat, consequently broadening his horizons""... or was it... ""A scrappy alley cat is snatched up into domesticated life, and over time shoulders the responsibility of protecting her human""??    The answer is both, and they coexisted in a very perfect sort of entanglement. While either premise sounds kind of boring alone, the execution of this split perspective pairing the two, was extremely well done.    So even without this Anime having an overly complicated story, its fundamental design earns it an [8/10]  for me. 
 
       The art for Subaru and The Great Indoors,  was kind of bland.  The story did incorporate a bit of character growth involving a color scheme, and the animation did handle that with care, so even being bland you will still appreciate the efforts.   Their biggest artistic accomplishment was of course Haru.  Haru was a cat, and while having an anime face and emoji type facial expressions,  the animated mannerisms screamed cat, not a cartoon kitty,  but a bonafide cat.  All the artistic ups and downs lead to me giving ""The Cat and Confined Creative"" a [7/10].   
 
        For sound,   that opening theme is just amazingly catchy.  While the La La La ending theme was fitting, it was a bit anti climactic. When I take the rest of the soundtrack and measure it along the voice actor's performances,  My Cat Doesn't Pay Rent earns an honest [8/10] 
 
 
      The two main characters,  and their split perspective views of their situation, only works cause of how brilliant their personalities were designed for each other.  They are not the most complicated of individuals, but they were lock and key perfect for their interactions.   The rest of the cast contributed amazingly to that chemistry as well.  While I loved it all,  some episodes did mismanage the perspectives just a tiny bit.  I don't even have to give examples as I can all but guarantee you will notice the bits I am talking about.  With those shortcomings being so minor,  I give Neko to Hikikomori a super solid [9/10] 
 
 
          I loved this show,  and I'm a dog person. [10/10] enjoyment. I do recommend giving My Roommate is a Cat a watch, and the best time for doing so would be when you just need a warm and fuzzy pick me up.   It's full of dawwws and awwws and I promise it will at the very least make you smile.

       Helpful As a cat owner, I have a huge bias towards Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue. Every moment I and friends saw Haru (the cat), we in synced said aaawwwwww. Seeing the daily life of an adorable kitty and his introverted owner was interesting to watch but I found the sounding cast of the main characters more interest. Especially Atsushi Kawase, who I found he was my favorite character in the show for merely being disliked by Harua, but still making an effort to show his compassion to Haru and cats in general. In the end simply if you want to watch anime that is both wholesome and has cats, then this is the anime you've been looking for.

","When I was a kid I used to fantasies about being all alone in a still and quiet world. To just walk around in it and explore without disruption, gave kid me the chills and the feelings of excitement and calm at the same time. I don´t know where that fantasy originated from, maybe a book I read, but it stayed with me for a long time. So, naturally, I was very intrigued when reading the synopsis Kokkoku (Moment by Moment). An anime that bases in this frozen world concept, count me in! But did it evoke the same feeling my childhood fantasies? I will get down to that now.  
  
Kokkoku take the concept still and quiet world and go all the way with it. The normal but a bit dysfunctional family Yukawa, are suddenly forced to use their magical heirloom to save two of the family members by stop time and enter what is called Stasis. Unlike me, they don´t feel excitement and calm when entering this quiet and still world. Which is completely understandable, because they are not alone. Other people also seemingly have the power walk around in frozen time, and monster-like creatures called Heralds are lurking around. And in this still and frozen world, a cat and mouse game for life and death take its place. 
 
This was absolutely an interesting premise (at least to me for obvious reasons). But its just that, what I wrote in the section above is a pretty good summarize of all that happens in these 12-episodes long story. It does have its little twists, like some of the characters has powers, and of the mysteries of this world is explored. That was the highlights. Otherwise its pretty straight forward, family tries to save their family members and get out of Stasis alive, and a secret society that have their own agenda. It was absolutely refreshing several ways; 1) the main characters are not a group of high school students, but a normal family. 2) the concept of a frozen reality is not a concept used 3 times every season. 3) The only real fanservice is in the ending song. All plus in my book. But even do refreshing in many ways, it still kind of missed “it”, to really pull me in and looking forward to it. I can´t really put my finger on what, I just found myself mildly interested in the story.  
 
The characters are just as the story kind of fresh and lovely under used. Useless overweight unemployed dad? Check. Sake loving grandfather? Check. NEET older brother in his late 20´s? Check. The voice of reason little sister? Check. Together they were realistically portrayed as dysfunctional family. I think that made up a fresh group of main characters in an anime, as far the family theme goes. But were they super interesting? Njaaaa… Not really, just fresh in anime, at least to me. They weren´t thought provoking, nor very memorable.  
 
Kokkoku is the work of the newly founded Geno Studio, and the art animation is absolutely decent. The characters can look a bit sloppy at distance, and nothing astonishing otherwise. Backgrounds often looks good, depict the Japanese suburb nicely.  
 
The VA´s (Japanese) all did their job without any complaints from me. Slow and uninterested voice of NEET brother? Its on spot. Annoying and loud voice of loser dad? Oh yes, they nailed it. Gruffy and hoarse voice of old sake loving grandpa? Yes, indeed. The soundtrack was fine, just as the characters though, not that memorable. The opening is however quite memorable, with a pop-rocky beat. 
  
Did it entertain my as much as my childhood fantasies? Well, sad to say no. Do I regret my time? Absolutely no. Even if it became more of a chore then a pleasure towards the end, the interesting concept and the mildly explored Stasis world was enough to pull me through to the end. The cat and mouse game became e little dragged on as it was the main focus. I would´ve liked a bit more world exploring, such as the complexity of the Stasis world and its inhabitants, the origin of the magical stones and the power it could bestow normal people and so on. That would´ve made this more enjoyable to me. I can recommend Kokkoku to you that can coup with narrow storytelling and slow pace, its not a bad show, its just not a the brightest star in the sky. 


          
 
       Helpful I liked this anime a lot, 
It was my favorite anime of the winter 2018 ongoing anime. 
 
The art style was pretty nice and fit very good with this kind of story. 
The characters where portrayed in a good matter. 
 
At the start of the anime, you are kinda curious about what is going to happen. 
Then, it is starting to get interesting, and you want to see more. 
Eventually you'll be hooked to this anime, since it has this certain vibe. 
Then you realize this anime is almost to its end, and you are starting to feel a little sad. 
 
The story never got boring in my opinion, and was always very interesting. 
This was one of the few anime's that I think had a really good ending!!! 
Normally when an anime ends, I feel a little sad and empty because it's over, but in this case I don't mind, because of the good ending. 
 
Some more story about the world itself could have been told in a spin-off, but that is very unlikely to happen. 
 
I would definitely recommend this anime.

          
 
       Helpful I had never heard of Kokkoku when I watched the first episode, but I was hooked afterwards. Now, here at the end, I definitely enjoyed myself, but I can see it probably isn't for everybody. 
 
Art 3/5 
Well drawn, the action scenes do a good job of communicating the speed and impact of every action, and the cast are all distinctly designed without having to resort to goofy hats or anything. In fact, kudos to the animators for keeping the details of the time stop in mind when lots of small objects are flying or falling. However, it makes extensive use of CGI for several elements - personally, I think it blends well enough with the more traditional animation, but if you strongly dislike it in your anime, its going to annoy you frequently.  
 
Sound 4/5 
Much like the animation, the sound effects do a great job of putting oomph behind the action scenes. Most of the music, when there is any, doesn't stand out too strongly, but I think ""Flashback"" is the best OP of the season - its a great song and the visuals accompanying it are really slick. Like a friend of mine said: ""You gotta respect someone who can turn 'punching a man's heart' into a beat drop."" 
 
Character 3/5 
I think Juri makes for a good main character. She's got some playfulness to her, but she's mostly a serious woman who gets stuff done. Like the show's description says, her response to the yakuza kidnapping her nephew is to grab a knife and get ready to cut some fools. As things progress, she shows little hesitation in getting things done when push comes to shove, but its obvious the situation is wearing away at her and you wonder if she can hold on. 
Her grandpa is cool, and is similarly willing to step up to the occasion in a crisis. The rest of the cast is kind of hit or miss; the brother and father wear on my nerves, and quite a few are just kind of there. 
 
Story 4/5 
The show starts off with a really interesting premise, that being the time stop spell. From episode 2 onwards, it expands on this premise is some interesting directions. Without spoiling anything, let's just say the spell has some rules and exceptions that play heavily into the advancement of the story, but don't feel broken or unnatural. 
That said, I feel like I need to dock points for the ending. Not that its bad -just that they REALLY needed another episode or two to smooth it out. It feels very abrupt. 
 
Enjoyment 4/5 
Kokkoku moves slowly (not because of the time stop, hur hur hur) but I enjoyed the ride all the same. The first episode made me want to see where it was going, each episode ended at the perfect cliffhanger to keep me interested, and in the last third, s*** gets crazy and I wanted to see how it would one-up itself. 
 
Overall 4/5 
Kokkoku feels unique and is a fun experience - the action scenes have some good brutality to them and some of the imagery is hilarious in how bonkers it is. Unfortunately, its pacing is definitely not for everyone and its story has some major rough edges.

All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society.

She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and becomes friends with some of the locals.
One winter day, Ame almost drowns in a river after trying to hunt a kingfisher, but Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to let her go to school like other children. Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school. Meanwhile, Ame is more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.
In fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, Sōhei, who realizes something is strange about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets angry, transforms into a wolf, and inadvertently injures him, leaving a scar on his right ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, Sōhei tells them a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame. The two become friends.
Yuki and Ame fight over whether they are human or wolf, especially after Yuki forces Ame to start going back to school, to which he refuses. Two years later, a fierce storm gathers and Yuki's school is let out early. As Hana is about to leave to pick her up, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, so she follows him. The other children are picked up by their parents, leaving Yuki and Sōhei alone. Yuki shows Sōhei that she can transform into a wolf and it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.
As Hana searches for Ame, she slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father, who tells her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see Ame fully transform into an adult wolf and run into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.

","While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, bizarre as it may sound, of Christopher Nolan and his style of movie-making. You know, complex stories with multiple twists that try to intrigue you up until the end credits (and sometimes beyond). For the most part, they succeed, yet my problem  with his movies is a consistent lack of believable, living characters, all I see are puppets who are there for the sole purpose of letting the puppeteer tell his story. 
 
Well, Wolf Children is a complete opposite of Nolan's style. The story is very basic with but one unusual twist to it which is revealed even in the title. This anime, however, features a whole cast of characters who are practically leaping out of the screen. Some may consider it a flaw; personally, I don't require a sophisticated story to make the experience enjoyable for me. And, you know, since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies are considered classics despite having the most basic plots imaginable, I believe it's true for a lot of people.  
 
This anime is a perfect proof that sometimes you don't need to make up a story, you don't really need to force conflicts. There are even no antagonists here. What I consider this title to be is a genuine representation of life. And it is really all you need: life has conflicts, life is difficult as it is. You don't really need to invent anything else, you just have to make it feel real. 
 
This movie manages to do just that, in no small part thanks to its pacing. It has a very unique feeling to it, despite covering a big period of time, it still manages to take its time. There are a lot of still and slow scenes, sometimes silent or practically silent to allow the atmosphere really sink in. I tend to admire movies that successfully utilize this storytelling tool since it really shows the advantages of visual media. Yes, i am a confident proponent of the ""show, don't tell"" idea. 
 
Speaking of ""show"", the art was kind of a mixed bag for me. The movie looks a bit like a sketch, yet it stays consistent with its style. In the end, it doesn't come out as lazy artwork but instead as a choice to make the atmosphere soft. It took a bit for me to get used to it but it was never able to take me out of the experience. I guess that's just my personal attraction to detailed and perfect art instead of the hand-made feeling the creators are going for here. 
 
The music is often absent, it only comes in at truly dramatic moments to make sure they leave a desired impression. It's not used to reflect the characters' feelings, this title uses it only to supplement its narrative, not to replace it. For what it's worth, it's adequate. The voice acting was, again, adequate. Just your standard set of good actors doing a good job. 
 
Talking about characters themselves would mean spoiling the show, since its narrative mostly has to do with exploring their personality, so I'm not going to do this. I'm just going to say that they all feel like real alive people, and are very relatable; especially the mother, she is just all around a wonder of a human being.  
 
Overall, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, mostly because of its tone being not for everyone and the artistic choice but it's definitely great and one of my favorite anime movies from now on.

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review, I hope I don't mess things up. I kinda want to do reviews because it can help me in the future if I decide to rewatch it. 
So... 
 
THE GOODS: 
I think the story was pretty good and fairly original. But it's not the story who had a big impact on me, it's the characters. 
I can't even describe how much I loved the characters, especially Hana. I honestly can't recall, except Nagisa from Clannad, a more pure character. Like she is such a nice and kind-hearted person that it melted my hearth. It was so so overwhelming that from time to time I started crying.  
And there are her children who have a spectacular evolution through the whole movie. 
The sound and the art were also pretty good. 
  
THE BADS: 
I honestly can't recall anything bad. You will enjoy it from start to finish. It may be a little slow from some, but I think it has a good pacing. 
 
I don't give it a 10/10 because it doesn't have that *spark* that made me gave other anime or movies a 10/10. 
It doesn't mean it isn't perfect how it is.

          
 
       Helpful Pardon my grammar I think I fixed everything but my mind tends to go faster then my hands. 
 
Story:9 
The story is most definitely unique in several ways; probably because produces don't want to get backlash on the consept of beastiality, and I think it perfectly incorporates the wild and domestic in the children together with the motherly love. 
 
Art:8 
The art is nothing unique but it has good quality. However I have never been a fan of the 3D multi-level effect they got going. 
 
Sound:9 
I feel there couldn't have done better but i feel the 10 is reserved the thing that stand out above the others 
 
Character:8 
The characters fit the story perfectly. 
 
Enjoyment:9 
The Story made me feel joy and sorrow, because this family has several problems but they fit together in a way most can only hope for. 
 
Overall:9 
 
This movie was not the best but it should most definitely be on your radar. 
however the biggest problem it the lack of info on the father's death.

","***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW*** 
 
After taking a decent break from anime, I am slowly but steadily inching my way back into the scene. I thought that it was time to watch another anime film (mostly been sticking to currently airing anime) and I am so glad that this was recommended to me from a fellow anime lover. After watching Little Witch Academia and wanting so much more content, I find myself in the hands of Majokko Shimi no Yoyo to Nene.   
 
Story: 7/10 
It is your somewhat typical person placed in a strange new world story overview; Yoyo a mage from a world full of magic is accidentally transported to a modern day Earth. While here she notices many anomalies and has to correct what is wrong. While there are some key moments of extreme tension, the mood for the movie is pretty much carefree. 
 
Animation: 9/10 
Every frame of animation in this film is simply beautiful. Beautiful colors everywhere, fluid movements in action scenes, and in certain key moments extremely crisp and detailed shots. Character models look great and the lighting is very spot on. Might deserve a better score but it's hard to give it more when you have other super heavy hitters (Redline, ext). 
 
Sound: 9.5/10 
Great, superb, excellent, vivid, everything good. The musical score was very spot on (great horns cutting through the orchestral strings) and all the voice actors did a very good job showing their character's emotions. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters are not all unique but they do a great job providing fun and interesting scenes. Yoyo's personality is really easy to latch onto while Takahiro's kind of distant/not wanting to show emotional attachment attitude got kind of annoying after awhile but they meshed pretty well with each other which was the main goal.  
 
Overall: 8.4/10 
This film was such fun from start to finish. The musical score and animation were the overall stars of the film with the character interactions in a close second. The plot did a good enough job providing some substance but I wish there were some more conflict situations.  
 
Enjoyment: 9.3/10

       Helpful Not quite what I expected. While the artwork is fine by itself, the characters and story were sub-par. 
 
Story: 
 
If you read the summary, it follows two magical sisters' as they interact with children from our world. Danger ensues. I appreciated the slice of life moments and the use of magical technology (very small, but sweet). What was disappointing was the distractions that fell their way and the deus ex machina's revealed at the end. There were far too many, so it felt very unsatisfactory. 
 
In addition, they touch on death in an interesting way. However, one of the main character's most dramatic moments rang very hollow with me and came off as cheap at best. Why? There was very little investment in the character involved. It was difficult to empathize. 
 
Finally, the relationships between the characters were very shallow, established in brief moments that felt forced. 
 
Art: 
 
The artwork had an interesting sketch-like quality that was a little distracting at first, but nice. The colors tended to blend in to each other from what I could remember, more towards the beginning. 
 
Sound: 
 
I'm not an expert, but I thought there were noticeable moments of silence that felt strange. The music that existed was fun at times, and overall it did its job. 
 
Character: 
 
The characters were shallow. This could be attributed to the fact that it's a children's movie.  
 
Since there are two magical sisters, I expected the movie to explore their relationship more. Instead, it focuses on the antics of one sister in our world and only touches on their relationship when support is required. Honestly, I felt like one sister could be summed up as: the one who supports the other sister and is otherwise quiet. Now, this would be fine if there was something else and if the main character had more to her (besides being in-your-face energetic and reckless). Unfortunately, it's not the case. 
 
The side characters are all right, but their reactions at times seem inappropriately exaggerated to force tension or compromise. It comes off as hard to believe, but for a children's movie, it does its job. 
 
OVERALL RATING: Meh 
 
If you absolutely love magical girls, it's fine. If you just want something fun and cute to watch, there's better options, but this could work. It's not terrible, but it's not fantastic either.

          
 
       Helpful This anime was indeed a beautiful magical story! I would probably never watch it if not my random desire to watch a movie featuring Kakuma Ai - a voice actress of my new-found favourite character. And so, here I am.  
 
Story: 6/10  
 
Honestly, the story bit is quite weak. After reading the synopsis, I expected to see a story about, as it states, ""a pair of sisters"". According to it, both ""cursed sisters"" are going to investigate an anomaly that suddenly appeared next to their house and being ported to our modern world. Yet, in reality, only one of the siblings is appearing in our world, while the second one stays behind and can only help the first one using a magical crystal ball.  
Regardless, it is a good story, if you let yourself forget about the not-so-small discrepancies between the synopsis and the actual plot. It is a kind adventure story about a magic user trying to fix the problems that happened to our world. It explores the human's greed and selflessness and teaches to abandon the selfish wishes caring about others instead.  
Being an overall kind and bright story, it has major plot holes that are hard to ignore. Such as, it is never explained why some building exist in both magic world and real world, while other ones just disappear from their original place. Moreover, the story is never expanded on what is happening to the people that were originally in those ""disappeared"" buildings and if they are even alive at the end of the story.  
 
Art: 9/10 
 
The art is without a doubt the strongest bit. Bright colours of the magical world stand out on the background of the real world creating a nice contrast. The animation is mostly flawless, and although there is nothing outstandingly great about it, it is quite unique and remarkable.  
 
Sound: 8/10  
 
The ending theme is great. Apart from that, there is nothing much to talk about sound wise. There are several moments when background music could help create a brighter picture but it just wasn't there. For the rest of the times, OSTs were picked well and matched the atmosphere of the movie.  
 
Characters: 5/10 
This is honestly the weakest bit of the movie. The only character who got a proper development is the main heorine, Yoyo. The second one would be probably the little girl named Aki. Yoyo's sister, Nene, although she is tagged as the ""main"" character, got less screening time than several of the supporting ones. I am probably biased, as Nene's seiyuu was one of the main reasons I originally decided to watch this movie, but I still think she could get more development being one of the two main characters.  
Takahiro, who you could probably call a second main character according to the amount of screen time he got, still lacks a proper development. He acts harsh and rude sometimes, lacking any empathy for his parent (who turned into slime monsters, dammit!), being kind and supportive in other times, then suddenly he's switching on tsundere elements and goes blushing.  
Most of the background characters, on the other note, are well implemented, and the guy from the ambulance team honestly made me smile.  
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
Yes, regardless of those small flaws (and the fact that my video was buffering most of the times), this was still a good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. It was supposed to be a kind family-friendly magic story, and it definitely reached this goal.  
 
Overall: 7/10  
Majokko Shimai no Yoyo to Nene is not an outstandingly good movie, but it is definitely worth watching. It is a simple, yet an enlightening story that most people could probably enjoy. Ecpecially if you like magical girl stories, ""Little Witch Academia"" atmosphere and warm adventures, this movie won't leave you disappointed.

","I watched this film at Annecy Animation Festival, right after I'd seen two other anime films (In This Corner of the World and A Silent Voice) neither of which I will be reviewing or spoiling here but both of which were, while wonderful films, not particularly cheerful. Therefore, as the last anime film I was seeing in the programme I kind of expected that kind of tone to be present in Lu also. 
 
I had also seen the trailer for it and it very much made the film seem to me like a bootleg Ponyo... yet I somehow really wanted to give it a chance. 
 
And I am so, SO glad that I did. All my expectations were subverted and the trailer does the film no justice. The only way I can really describe Lu Over The Wall is by saying it simply feels like the feeling of sheer joy, in film form. I'll admit, when it started off, with the slightly sulky male protagonist and his musician friends right at the start I thought ""oh no, what did I get myself into"", but the moment Lu enters the scene that was all gone and the film was an absolute joyride. At points when I thought I couldn't be having more fun, it got more fun. I was grinning for a solid 60% of the film and the audience was laughing at multiple points and if that's not proof that this film is pure joy, I don't know what is. 
 
Catch me buying this film on DVD and playing it if I'm ever down, and in the unlikely event I ever have children I promise you they will be raised on this stuff.

<LONG REVIEW> 
I started this because I have heard a lot of praise for the director of this movie, Masaaki Yuasa. I didn't know what I was getting into with this movie,the only thing I know is that it's about music and friendship. At first I find it quite hard to like the art and animation choice. It's quite different from other anime I watched before and it's isn't very consistent. To describe the animation, it's like Trigger but on more drugs. But slowly I got used to it and saw the charm in it.  
 
Story wise, it's nothing we haven't seen before. It can be quite predictable. But I like the way they decided to handle it. Mixing it with great soundtracks and the unique art adds in a lot to the overall enjoyment. To be honest, the story isn't bad, it's quite a fun story actually. If you don't mind stories aimed at kids then feel free to watch this. Also, the story gets weirder as the movie progressed, but at least it's fun to watch. I can see the script writer enjoying himself while writing for this movie.  
 
A lot of characters are under-developed, but this doesn't matter. It's not a movie focused on the characters, it's more story-centered, so I can put this issue aside. Each character is likable, especially the mermaids. Our main character did go through his own drama, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. I especially like Lu, the best character in the movie. I like her personality and also design wise she is freakin' cute. Lu's father is quite a well-written father character. As I have said above, the friendship development between humans and mermaids is quite spectacular and heartwarming.   
 
Speaking of a music themed movie, of course the music is going to be good. I love every tracks in the movie. Each of them really did adds in a lot to each scene. Props to the composer. I highly recommend you to watch this if you want a movie with great soundtracks. The voices for each character is also well done. I can see that the VA's are trying their best to make the characters feel more realistic. The ED theme for this movie is quite a good song too. Overall, no complaints here.  
 
In conclusion, Yoake Tsugeru Lu no Uta is quite a fun movie to watch. Sure not everyone would like it because of the art and animation choice, but if you are a Masaaki Yuasa fan or one who likes this kind of fantasy story with heartwarming themes about mermaids and humans, feel free to watch this, you will not be disappointed. I also recommend this to those who want a good friendship and music themed movie. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful In 2017, cult anime creator Masaaki Yuasa directed two feature films out of his new Science Saru studio. ""Lu"" is the weaker of the two. Watching it is like watching three anime movies at the same time. Whatever conceptual or emotional core it could’ve had is deafened in a cacophony of tangential ideas and subplots. 
 
A teen weighed down by his parents' divorce joins a band whose practice sessions summon a mermaid in a declining fishing town. Meanwhile, the town opens a mermaid-themed amusement park. Meanwhile, there’s a cataclysmic curse that threatens to swallow the town. Meanwhile… 
 
""Lu"" can’t care less about its own subject matter, which is disappointing considering the storytelling strength of Yuasa’s other recent works. Rather than develop any facet of it to satisfaction, the hokey film dashes from one animated spectacle to the next, which is entertaining in its own way, considering that Team Yuasa are no mere Studio Ghibli pretenders on the visual front. 
 
Science Saru has controversially trained its core animators in the forbidden art of Adobe Flash (now Adobe Animate). Through computer-assisted inbetweening, they’ve created a world of constant, mesmerizing motion while avoiding the robotic feel of something like ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"". Some sakuga-heads may disagree, but it’s an impressive technical showpiece that makes uniquely different tradeoffs in the limited-animation world. It’s a shame this wizardry was applied to something so otherwise conventional.

Esteban, age 12 is a foundling from Barcelona, with a mysterious power of ordering the Sun to appear, for which he is called ""Child of the Sun."" Upon the death of his adoptive father, Esteban learns he was rescued as a baby from a sinking ship in the ocean. The mysterious medallion that Esteban wears since ever has a trace somewhere in the New World, probably coming from the Mysterious Cities of Gold. Esteban leaves Spain to find his parents and find out who he is. On the way he meets Zia, an Inca girl who was kidnapped from her people years back and has exactly the same medallion as him. Later on, they are joined by Tao, a young Galapagos robinson, the last descendant of the Empire of Heva, an Empire said to have built the Cities of Gold. Following Coyolite, the shining star represented on their medallions, the three children travel through the unexplored New World, searching for the Cities of Gold, believing that this way is leading them to their lost parents. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Historical', 'Sci-Fi']","In 1532, a Spanish orphan named Esteban joins Mendoza, a navigator, and his associates Sancho and Pedro, in their search for one of the Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father. They are joined on their quest by Zia, an Incan girl (who was kidnapped by Gomez, Gaspard, Perez and Mendoza), and Tao, the last descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English dub).
The series is a mix of ancient South American history, archaeology, and science fiction. During their journey, the travelers encounter the Mayas, Incas, and Olmecs. They discover many lost technological wonders of the Mu Empire, including a solar-powered ship (the Solaris) and The Golden Condor, a huge solar-powered ornithopter (mechanical bird), capable of traveling considerable distances under the sun's power alone. They are constantly pursued by antagonists Gomez and Gaspard, who are also in search of the Cities of Gold.
The Seven Cities of Gold were built by the Emperor of Hiva out of fear that a global war would destroy all civilizations. Such a war actually broke out, destroying the Empires of Mu and Atlantis when they used the ""Weapons of the Sun"". The Seven Cities of Gold hold copies of books in their ""Universal Libraries"" as well as powerful artefacts, including the ""Great Legacy"", a portable fusion reactor. Other elements of this technology turn up in unexpected places, like the Solaris on Tao's home island, Esteban's and Zia's medallions as keys to the Cities, and Tao's jar as an important piece of the Great Legacy.
Reminiscences of this ancient story are present in Inca legends written on golden quipu, which only Zia can read. This triggers an obsessive quest for the Cities of Gold on the part of the Spaniards Mendoza, Gomez, Gaspard and Francisco Pizarro.
Esteban seeks his long-lost father and he is also tied to Mendoza, who rescued Esteban from a sinking ship when he was a baby. Esteban seems to have a magical ability to make the sun appear, which proves to be an invaluable asset throughout the series. Zia also seeks her father, from whom she was taken and was brought to Spain as a gift for the princess Margarita when she was seven years old. She has a medallion just like the one which Esteban carries.
Tao seeks signs of his ancestors. He possesses an encyclopedia which contains information about their lost technology as well as a mysterious jar which according to the legend, only the High Priest of the City of Gold can open, and it proves to be the Great Legacy's cooling or control rod system. Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro are motivated by their search for gold, but Mendoza genuinely appears to be fond of the three children.
The Olmecs are the descendants of survivors of the global war who hid under their mountain. Only their elite were able to survive, suspended in cryogenic hibernation. The Olmecs do not appear to be human—or if they were once human, it is implied that they were horribly mutated by the fallout of the nuclear war that destroyed their ancestors. They are short and thin and they also have pointed ears and enlarged frontal bones. They are highly intelligent but they are devious and selfish.
Led by their king, Menator, the Olmecs seek an artefact called the ""Great Legacy"" in order to power their cryogenic systems, as well as samples of healthy cells from the children in order to combat their mutations and their sterility. Their technology is generally inferior to modern technology, and they use weapons such as spears and swords. They maintain some elements of their advanced technological heritage, such as the stasis and medical technology which is used to keep the elite of the Olmecs in suspended animation until an opportunity to revive them arises, technology which is powered by what appears to be a geothermal power system.
This power system is destroyed during an escape by the children and Mendoza, causing the Olmecs to conduct a frantic search for the fusion reactor core (the Great Treasure) which is hidden inside the City of Gold. They also possess a flying machine which appears to have been constructed with the same type of advanced technology which the Golden Condor was constructed with. It is armed with a particle beam or a focused heat weapon which is very powerful.
Eventually, the Olmecs succeed, at great cost, in taking control of the Great Legacy. It begins to melt down without the moderation which is supposed to be provided by Tao's jar. The resulting earthquakes and volcanism destroy the City of Gold. A world-threatening meltdown is avoided by the personal sacrifice of Esteban's father who, acting as the High Priest of the Cities, is presumed to be dead after he replaces the jar. At the end of the series, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro, who have salvaged some gold before the city's destruction, return to Spain, while Esteban and his friends set out across the Pacific Ocean on the golden condor in search of the remaining Cities of Gold.
","Yet another animated series I watched as a kid and had no idea it was to the most part made by Japanese people. Then again, it was so good to be made by any other country so that pretty much explains it. Technically, The Mysterious Cities of Gold (TMCOG) was the One Piece of anime back in the early 80’s. It is a children’s adventure regarding seeking treasure, discovering ancient civilizations, uncovering secrets, and occasionally using relics to fight their way through various challenges and opponents. It is partially based on actual history, the age of exploration during the charting of America, and even has live-action documentary segments in the end of each episode that teach the children to the basic events that took place at that era. Thus it entertaining and educational at the same time, two elements that usually conflict with each other when it comes to animated shows. I sort of see it as a great combination of a historical documentary such as the journeys of Christopher Columbus with a classic fictional adventure full of action and suspense, such as Treasure Island. Although there actually are anime made about both those titles around the same time, none were as captivating as TMCOG because they both felt too basic. 
 
Despite its age, the production values are not bad at all. Although the character figures look rather simply drawn and have minimal shading on them, their motions are usually very dynamic in terms of performance (not frames per second) so your eyes are kept busy looking at something all the time. I am even willing to say most modern anime shows have far less things going on in each scene compared to this oldie, thus tend to be far easier to be bored if all you look at is frozen caricatures with a flapping mouth. Also, since none of the characters has superpowers you are guaranteed an interesting event no matter how simple it may appear to be. Steering a ship or climbing a mountain tends to be a dangerous task and the series takes its time to show how they need to organize in order to do it right. Whole episodes are spent in just having the characters sailing or walking, while at the same time flavouring them as personalities and making the simplest thing they do to appear hard, dangerous, and meaningful. 
 
Sadly, the above doesn’t stand true all the way and in the second half there is way too much super technology going around to water-down the feeling of adventure. The characters will simply use their medallions to unlock gates nobody else can or fly with an airplane (made in ancient times!) to complete any task in a few seconds. They make it seem so simple and rushed, it loses its initial importance. 
 
Regarding the sound part, I never watched the series in the original Japanese or French dub; just in Greek as a kid and in English as an adult. In both cases I can’t say they were very impressive. In fact, I could say they felt very colourless, childish and simple but then again it is a show aimed at children so no worries here. The music themes are very nifty and they tend to be very memorable. They have tunes that make them sound like they are from native Central America and the lyrics are full of adventure-inspiring words; so I say they are successful at what they set out to do. 
 
The story is simply amazing if you see it as a whole. It combines both historical facts, has lots of adventure and mystery, has lots of character interaction, has lots of excitement and above all HAS ALMOST NO FILLERS! The main three heroes are kids who seek to find something important in the Incan ruins (each one has different goals though) and are supported by a crew of explorers who simply want to find gold and get rich. So there is variety in the motivations of its characters, something which usually leads to internal conflicts. The themes are also changing from time to time so you are again not getting the same atmosphere in all the episodes. Some of them can be about adventure, others about pacifism, others about greed, and so on. Some of them event have science fiction in them which may feel out of context a bit (makes the Incas to appear like they had 20th century technology) but I guess it is excused in a children’s adventure and since we already have all those weird Nazka theories. 
 
What may feel tiresome is how the action is almost always very basic and any conflict is resolved in a rather cop-out manner. It tends to get boring if you are sure the heroes will find a way to get out of any danger without ever getting hurt. Also, some parts will feel unnecessary long and the payback will be just something you knew all along that would happen. But as I said, waiting for those live action segments just to see how all that fit in the story was keeping me interested no matter what was happening. 
 
The characters will feel rather basic and stereotypical but they definitely get some sort of development along the way and everybody is given enough focus for you to know and like. Although they are all very simple as personalities and act rather cartoony (extreme personal quirks or traits), they are all a colourful bunch and I liked them for what they are. We get the usual high-spirited kids, the greedy adventurers, the stupid megalomaniac villains, the vengeful natives, but thanks to the variable themes of the story, they definitely manage to grow on you. 
 
It is without doubt one of the best animated retro adventures of all times and I recommend it to everyone who wants some good old fashion excitement regarding treasure hunting and exploration. 
 
And now for some excused scorings.

       Helpful In terms of adventure and mystery this is probably the best series ever created and there will pass many years until its surpassed, the new series of current days are so full of visuals and yet have so poor stories that people will drop 90% of them. 
Tmcog is trully a masterpiece that makes many of the new serie creators jealous :p

          
 
       Helpful Given that a lot of reviewers admit right off the base that it has nostalgic value for them, the first thing I'm going to say is that this show does not for me. I wasn't born until 1988 and I didn't even get cable until late 2001, I had no way to watch this show until hulu and DVD. So, this is a review from someone who did not have nostalgic factor involved as a disclaimer before I even start this. Now, onto the review! 
 
I'll start with the weaker elements first, the animation did not age particularly well and the voice acting often comes across as stiff. Now, it's pretty cool that they actually used kids to voice the kids, but they're not terribly good most of the time and not having a strict script resulted in saying way too much at certain times and having it come off rather stiff and forced a lot. I am thinking this is simply the era it was dubbed, I've heard other 80s cartoon dubs in my life before and a lot of them sound similar, like America did not learn how to dub well until the 90s. Robotech was a rare exception for me where I quite liked most of the voices and voice acting, so good acting has come out of the 80s, but I'm not going to say this was a particularly good dub. I did eventually get used to the voices, but certain animations on screen would cause a syndrome in which the characters would be forced to say incredibly obvious things like ""watch out for the rocks!"" while the rocks are already falling or make several characters obsess over the same event for way too many lines (""wow, I can't believe we dodged all those falling rocks! There were so many!"" ""Yeah, that was close!"" ""Is everyone ok?"" ""Yes, we're all ok! I'm glad none of us got hurt!"" ""So am I!""). I'm fairly sure a lot of these instances had to come from the animation itself, which was another thing that didn't necessarily age too well. The backgrounds look nice most of the time and for its time, it's actually pretty good, but fight scenes are pretty poorly animated and you can just see that a lot of animation was reused as the same guy climbs up a ladder right behind his identical twin. The animation really felt like it limited the series too me, I often felt that they had to write around it and came up with scenarios that required less animation. 
The music is pretty nice, but certainly comes off as 80s sounding with some synthesizer stuff mixed in everywhere. You either like it or you don't, but it did fit the series pretty well. 
 
But onto the actual reason for watching, the story and characters. Now, I'm not sure if this was a requirement of all 80s and 90s adventure type series, but there are several worthless characters who just tag along for what I can only imagine is to annoy the audience, and here we have two and a half, the two idiot Spaniards who's entire mission it is to almost kill everyone by being stupid and getting them in trouble and the most useful thing they do the entire series is find a cave behind a waterfall while spending the rest of it demanding gold and being useless and whiney and a little bird who is actually useful in warning of danger, but it's voice is just annoying as all hell. While I can forgive the bird (it is kinda the team pet), those two idiots are pretty much worthless to the point where their employer says so and these two are there the entire series while contributing nary a drop to the story or action and they're so annoying they can't pull off funny either. 
For me, the best character was probably Mendolza, you could never quite tell who he was siding with, the side that gets the gold or the side that follows the kids on adventures, and it was interesting to second guess what he was going to do. Even after all this time, he still felt interesting, he did age well. 
As for the kids themselves, they obviously are the main focus of the series here, well they tended to vary in how interesting they were. It would often depend on what the episode was focusing on, but for the most part, Tao stole the spotlight for me while Zia stood in the corner shouting ""Oh, Esteban!"" while being kidnapped or held at...sword point (I suppose you would call it) way too often (I'm assuming because of animation limits) in need of rescue. Esteban could be pretty interesting too, he showed he had some brains and did some clever and unexpected things, but he can't bargain with bad guys very well nor outsmart them. As soon as any given bad guy threatened Zia or Tao, he'd instantly give in to whatever there demands are. On the rare occasion he did manage to outsmart one, it was quite fun to watch. Oddly enough, the bad guys themselves weren't terribly smart, they often do the same stupid tactics and are easily fooled by falling rocks, they all just happened to be extremely good at capturing Zia and holder her at sword point. It only helped the bad guys that the animation forced a syndrome in which no one could look behind them to notice someone obviously about to kidnap Zia until she went ""Oh, Esteban, help!"" even when there were obviously bad guys in the room, all armed with swords, standing closest to Zia. I was unable to suspend my belief here when it happened almost once an episode. 
 
But it all boils down to one thing for me: is this a good adventure series? And I would have to say that yes, it is. The locales were fun and imaginative while still being based in reality and some ridiculously unlikely dangerous thing was on the verge of happening every other second to spur the plot along (to quote family guy: ""and then he was attacked by a pots and pans robot!!"") and the episodes just flew by. Despite spending a bit too long talking about stupid stuff, a lot of stuff happened each episode, so pacing was fast. I liked it all until the sudden appearance of a certain group towards the end that just seemed out of place within the show, annoyingly, this group was there from that episode pretty much until the end of the series. It didn't ruin it, but it did annoy me at least. 
If you can ignore things like animation, long winded scentences about what you already see happening, and some really stupid characters, it's still an enjoyable ride and most of it is pretty good. It was, however, overly predictable with the exception of Mendolza who could always be counted on to add a bit of spice to the show in any given situation. I'd still call it good, but would probably most recommend it to people who find nostalgia in it, like adventure shows a lot, like 80s shows, or are going to show it to a younger child, sibling, niece/nephew, etc. The educational segments at the end sometimes contain some mild nudity, but they really helped add to the world and were usually very interesting (a few sucked, maybe 4 out of 39).

Heartbroken, Remi ends up with Vitalis, a traveling musician, and his troupe of animal entertainers. Together, they travel the country in search for Remi's real parents, along the way learning the harsh lessons of life. A deeply moving story about friendship, loss and the pursuit of happiness.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Kids', 'Slice of Life']","With the story being set in 19th century France, Remi lives in a French village with his mother called Chavanon. His father Jerome Barberin works in Paris. When he is injured, he decides to return to his village, though he is a changed man and is much hard-hearted. Remi discovers that he is actually a foundling. Barberin sells Remi to a traveling artist named Vitalis and his animal group.

Then, 10 years later, Remi became a lawyer and marries Lise, and Mattia became a violinist.
","The thoughts of being sold off to a stranger can instill in those fear and uncertainty, especially when considering that the one that is being sold is a mere happy (and unknowingly orphan) child, oblivious of the harsh conditions of the 19th century of France. Ie Naki Ko, or No Man's Boy Remi, narrates a sad, yet heartwarming tale of Remi and the hardships throughout his life as a travelling entertainer, learning valuable lessons about life itself. Although it is a beautiful anime, it suffers from some issues, the most notable one being the pacing of the story. 
 
The story of Ie Naki Ko is pretty straightforward, audiences being presented with an accurate historical representation of France and a simple lifestyle of some villagers, whose sudden average life is torn apart. Remi is sold off by his supposed father to a travelling entertainer by the name of Vitallis for monetary reasons, much to his wife's horror and the child's pain. However, it soon becomes apparent that the old, broad-shouldered man only has good intentions with the boy, saving him from his wicked foster father and poor life. This is visible through subtle characterization, which is shown, rather than narrated. 
 
Throughout Remi's long and arduous journey, viewers are presented with a very realistic portrayal of France. Examples such as the wonderful rustic views of the french countryside, or the harsh conditions of that time, and with that, society itself. Other aspect to consider is the fact of being thrown in a job as an entertainer: it comes with both good and bad sides to it. The social standing of such people are lowly viewed and looked down upon by society, as well as the difficulties of the troupe, such as their income: searching for a place to stay, closely following their monetary balance are such examples. 
 
As mentioned earlier, the anime generally suffers from some pacing issues in all the different arcs: most events could have been solved/displayed without dwelling on it that long, whereas there were instances where it was actually desired. Some examples, such as Remi learning to read or living on his own, could have been extended upon and used its time to portray how french society was faring in that period. Other thing that could have been displayed are the difficulties of the different classes. Nevertheless, those were just minor things. Surely enough, most of said events are very mundane, which added to the immersion of the story, in addition to creating a well-balanced drama within. Naturally, the whole journey of Remi may seem ultimately a very convenient one (especially in the last part), but it seemed to be the goal the anime was working towards to, that of happiness, and in that regard it executed it well. 
 
Characterwise it could be lacking it the eyes of some, as the show focusses mainly on the main protagonists, Remi and Vitalis. Both are well-developed and fleshed out through the series, in addition to their motives. There is Remi, a good-natured boy who develops significantly alongside the story in a satisfying manner. Then there is Vitalis, who seemed to be at first a simple device to push the story forward, yet is the exact opposite: both mentor and like a father to the boy, whose ultimate motive is a very noble one. What is curious is how this character is developed: instead of being narrated and directly told to the viewer, it is carefully displayed and shown through his actions and images. This was very refreshing and worked significantly in favour of the anime. 
 
However, the little background story regarding Vitalis could be seen as a bit lacking and disappointing, yet the sheer amount of fleshing out of his character was surely more than enough to compensate for it (besides of being interesting on its own). There are quite a lot of side characters shown throughout the anime, which hinders the expansion upon those a bit (which would have been nice to see it included), but this is ultimately due to the vastness of Remi's journey. For the most part, they are well presented to the viewer, serving their purpose. 
 
Regarding the animation of this work, it is dated as expected with some rather rough motions, or still frames. Nevertheless, the art style compensates this issue significantly, with great hand drawn pictures of the wonderful french countryside or just the characters themselves. Occasionally, still frames are used to portray different atmospheres the anime is trying to portray with different colors, be it very vivid or raw. It must be said that for new comers to the `old school` visuals may be taken aback by it, yet I cannot stress that this is actually a very pleasant change to nowadays art style and direction. 
 
Concerning the soundtrack used, it is at times wonderful and befitting of the situations, yet at times it felt a bit off, breaking the immersion within, yet as a whole was above average. This does not include some wonderful male vocals, which was a joy to listen to. As for the voice actors, these had their up and downs as well, sometimes either being too forceful in their interpretation or unconvincing; this was however a small drawback. The opening and ending were very suited with the use of simple instruments of that time, such as a harp violin, you name it 
 
Ie Naki Ko was overall a beautiful anime, portraying the beauty and difficulties of life, yet sadly suffered from pacing issues as well as a bit of progression issues in the story. The art style was a very pleasant change to the current ones, as well as the great characterization of the main cast. It shows audiences the struggle of life, the hardships, and how one should always push forward no matter the situation. I can recommend this anime to viewers interested in drama, or interest in the a character driven story; the dated animations and sounds can be off-putting, yet it is certainly worth the try despite this. 
 
Thank you for reading.

          
 
       Helpful Sublime! 
It must be watch. 
Remi, 8 years old, adopted, is rented by the father Barberin who can not work anymore. Vitalis, a street performer with three dogs and a monkey, embarks across France, and teaches him to read books and music. The recipes of the shows are poor, and they often live under the stars. One evening in Gentilly, Vitalis dies of cold and hunger ... 
it has humanity, optimism. 
When watching this anime during your youth, the score of 10/10 is logical. 
This anime allows a reflection on life: A child without family who follows an old man across France. What adventures! All emotions wake up. We are happy with Rémi when he does his shows, and we are unhappy when he is in the mines. 
The life of the poor is beautifully painted. 
All the themes of life are united: life, death, misery, love, friendship, solidarity. Rich in pedagogy, this anime teaches us very quickly the authenticity of life. 
for all teenagers who want to live a unique adventure. 
Another thing I liked: in the space of a few years, Remi, with Vitalis then with Mattia, made more than one tour of France on foot, like the companions of the duty, and the discovery of the regions, the Auvergne, the Velay, the Vivarais, the Quercy, the Rouergue, the Cevennes, the Languedoc, etc ... all these regions more or less disappeared under the administrative constraints, but which have, or had a cultural richness, interest me. 
Rivers, rivers and canals that allow, at the time, Mrs. Milligan and his son Arthur to travel in France on a tourism barge, ... it's a dream!

          
 
       Helpful This anime was made in 1977. It's quite hard to believe that when anime was still in it's adolescence, the world of anime still had masterpieces for it's time. When you think of 70s anime, you probably think about Anne of Green Gables, 3000 Leagues In Search of Mother, Candy Candy, etc. But I believe that Ie Naki Ko belongs in that category too. 
 
This story is based on the French novel by Hector Malot. I haven't read the novel (though I do have an interest in doing so, but I have no idea where to find it in English)l, but when I saw that it was being streamed on Anime News Network, it really got me interested...and I'm glad I watched it! The story for this is just nothing short of amazing. Remi and his comrades endure hardships, receive few joys, and sometimes get totally crapped on by life. But even so, I couldn't help but both cheer for Remi and encourage him to go on as I was watching the saddest parts. This anime has made me cry more times than any other anime, and that has to mean something, right? There's no point in which the anime feels too fast-paced, too slow-paced (admittedly though it is, in fact, slow paced), and even though there's fillers, they serve their purpose and never deviate beyond that. 
 
I feel the best thing about the anime were the characters. They're all endearing and unique, and they're portrayed as actual people instead of all the gunked out stereotypes you see in most modern anime nowadays. Remi is by far my favorite out of them all. His courage, strength, and determination really struck a chord with me, but even he understands his own limits (such as trying to get food for the animals by himself though failing miserably). The animals in the show were great too, though I admit I don't have much experience in seeing real life animals perform tricks like that, but I guess that's just me. I also liked Mattia. He was a cool guy and a great friend despite his slight complacency. There were a few characters who annoyed me a bit, but they were brief and didn't last long in the show. 
 
And I haven't even started talking about the production values yet! Osamu Dezaki really knows how to direct and pick the right company because the way he made the setting (France) come to life is just unbelievably great! Even though the show was produced in 1977, it doesn't look like that at all! The budget for this series was pretty gosh-darn high for it's time. It almost looks modern, though constant multi-plane animation was used for this anime instead of computer generated animation, and the former animation was commonly pioneered by Disney when they produced Snow White in 1937, but no anime used it until Remi came along, which was probably a big achievement in the anime world. 
 
Of course, there are some things in Remi that did seem to irk me a bit. I remember in one episode Remi and Mattia dressed up as girls with really heavy make-up in order to escape from people who were chasing them. I absolutely hated how they looked, and I didn't think they actually did that to anime characters in the 70s (except in maybe budding shoujo manga like Rose of Versailles or anything of the like). A lot of people are gonna hate me for saying this, but I also felt the music was a little passe too. I mostly hate the ED sequence for the show. It sounds way too bouncy and cheerful for such a dark and vivid series! Even the World Masterpiece Theater version of Ie Naki Ko had better music that caught the atmosphere while not trying too hard to get all preachy about courage and survival! There's another thing that irked me, but I don't feel like saying it in fear of getting yelled at. 
 
But despite it's minor flaws, Ie Naki Ko is an absolutely wonderful 70's anime series. It really shows you first hand that life is tough, harsh, and even cruel at times (which Disney always tries to hide from it's audience practically 99.8% of the time), but it also encourages you to believe that once you overcome those obstacles, they'll all be worth it and you do, in fact, achieve happiness in the end. It tells us that life is meant to be lived, not wasted, especially if you have something to live for. I thank this anime for teaching me that!

One day the adults disappeared into the theme parks, leaving their children abandoned. That was a plot by 'Yesterday Once More', an organization who despises the 21st century and tries to bring Japan back to the 20th century with the dreams and hopes. Shinnosuke and his parents, Hiroshi and Misae, fight against the plot of 'Yesterday Once More' in order to live together with family in the 21st century. 
 
(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","Set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke ""Shin"" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.

 You get such an enjoyment cause everything is so good, the charcters are better in the series but they still are incredible in this masterpiece.

       Helpful Shinnosuke is still the same ol' perverted kid in this movie. 
 
The story begins of nice, Shinnosuke and his family star in this action movie where his Dad plays a parody superhero. (Parody of Ultraman.). After this it just continues normally, everyone we basically know from the normal series is at the World Fair's 20th Century Museum, where all the parents try to relieve they're childhood. As they are about to enter the 21st century, a certain evildoer hypnotizes adults via tv, thr...ough a 20th Century Museum commercial, this turns the adults in childs, not psysically, but mentally. 
 
This shows that Shinnosuke can be very mature, and yet.. not.  
So the story's pretty plain, but the way it is shown in this movie it's just great. 
 
They still use the same weird art style, which is just needed in Crayon Shin-Chan series/movies, specials and such. So I'll give it a good score. The sounds okay too. 
 
The characters, of course, Shinnosuke is still the same ol' perverted kid, which I said before. Furthermore he still has those crazy moods and actions. Shinnosuke's friend group is just as crazy as normally, especially when they get drunk on Oolong Tea. You can see they're mature side which you don't see very often, yet they can act as baby's the next moment. 
 
If you're ready for a bit extraordinary artstyle, alot of humor and a funny adventure. This movie is where you need to be. I recommend that you'd watch (a bit) of the series, &quot;Crayon Shin-Chan&quot;, just so you get to know the characters and minor characters a bit. But it's highly enjoyable, even to watch it several times.

Teak finds him and rescues him from being pulled into the whirlpool where Argon is kept. As Sirius is made ruler of the Sea Kingdom, a jealous and bullying Japanese giant salamander named Mabuse (named Mugwug in the English adaptation), attempts to take the eye of Argon away from Sirius and get the creatures of the deep to make him the king of the sea, but Sirius deals with him easily and sends him flying.
Malta returns to the Holy Flame, accompanied by her friend Piale, but becomes agitated as she worries that the strange boy - or one of the monsters from the sea that her mother has warned her about - will appear. The next night Sirius returns to see her. They introduce themselves and after realizing they mean each other no harm, they begin to fall in love. Sirius tells her all about life under the sea, which Malta finds fascinating. As the sun begins to rise, however, Sirius must return to the sea, because the children of the water will die if they are touched by sunlight. They bid each other farewell until the next night and Malta gives him a kiss.
Sirius and Malta are extremely happy throughout the following day, which doesn't go unnoticed by Teak, Piale and Themis. As Sirius and Malta play in Malta's secret garden that night, Teak journeys through the forbidden waters and sees the two dancing with each other. Unfortunately, a group of gigantic, deadly jellyfish take the opportunity to attack the sea kingdom while Sirius is away. Sirius sees the calm waters turn rough and goes to fight, but it is too late. Teak, who was hurt by the jellyfish, lashes out at his brother and reveals he knew where he was. After asking Moelle (named Aristurtle in the English adaptation), the oldest and wisest sea turtle in the ocean, for some advice, Sirius is advised to forget about Malta. Malta is upset when Sirius doesn't return the following evening. Mabuse tries to convince Sirius that the burden of the Eye is too heavy and he will gladly take it from him, but Sirius refuses and instead decides to see Malta again. Mabuse, deducing that he is hiding something, follows him.
In the Fire Kingdom, Themis sees how sad her daughter is and reminds her that during an eclipse coming in five days, she will be the next Queen of the Fire Clan. Malta is heartbroken and begs her mother to let her keep taking care of the sacred flame, to which her mother refuses. Sirius returns that night much to Malta's happiness, but Piale catches them kissing and attacks Sirius. She flies off, heartbroken. Malta, beginning to realize they can never be together, performs a farewell dance for Sirius and throws herself into the Holy Flame. Refusing to believe what she says, Sirius jumps into the flame after her, but they fall out. Before they can both hit the surface of the water, they land on top of Moelle, who brings them safely back to shore. He now understands the love Sirius has for Malta. Moelle tells them the story of how water and fire no longer lived together as one, but when he's done, he sees Malta and Sirius embracing, surviving the amount of heat from the nearby flame. Moelle tells them there may be a way for them to stay together—it is rumored that somewhere in the heavens there is a star where fire and water live together. During the same eclipse where Malta is to be made queen, strange pink flowers of fire and water known as Klaesco blossoms (called Kalea flowers in the English adaptation), on Mobius Hill (called the Hill of Elysium in the English adaptation), burst into bloom and release white spores that fly up into the sky, making their way to that star.
Unfortunately, Mabuse overhears everything and after making himself known to the ""traitors"", swims off to tell King Glaucus. Moelle chases after him before he can tell Malta and Sirius where Mobius Hill is. To make matters worse, the Holy Flame, left unattended too long, goes out. Malta knows without the sacred flame, her mother will lose her youth and most likely kill Sirius for what he has done. As she sobs on his shoulder, Piale, who had been watching the whole time, promises to distract everyone while Malta and Sirius escape to Mobius Hill. Piale declares her love for Malta and becomes the Holy Flame herself. Themis and the Fire Children notice the change in the flame, however. When they fly down from the palace to see it, the Queen discovers Piale's sacrifice and sends the Fire Children to bring back Malta. They almost succeed in recapturing her but Sirius fights back until they are cornered by both Glaucus and Themis. They confront each other and force Malta and Sirius apart. Both of them imprison the two children as punishment for betraying their own kind and so they can not elope together.
Three small sprites free Malta and distract the guards so she may escape to Mobius Hill. Teak visits Sirius in prison and unsuccessfully tries to get him out. Malta wanders through a desert for days, encountering the strange creatures of Sand Riddle Hill who transport her to Mobius Hill for answering their riddle. Sirius keeps calling Malta's name, earning the sympathy of most of the creatures of the sea. Mabuse comes with a dangerous idea for Teak to get Sirius out—steal the eye of Argon and bring it to his prison. Once free he will attack and destroy most of the kingdom, allowing Sirius to escape. Teak doesn't like this plan but thinking he has no choice goes to tell Sirius, unaware of Mabuse's true intentions to finally take the eye for himself. Sirius refuses to hand over the eye, but when Teak says being king matters more to him than his fire child, Sirius tells him that he doesn't deserve to be king. He tells him to return the eye to Glaucus instead and tell him he was never worthy of being his heir, hoping perhaps Glaucus will let him go. On the way there, Teak is ambushed by Mabuse and his gang and he takes the eye for himself. Now declaring himself king, they drunkenly celebrate until Teak is able to escape and take back the eye.
Teak makes it to Glaucus' temple but the guards refuse to let him in, believing the eye is a fake. In anger, Teak heads to the forbidden waters to give the eye to Argon instead. After approaching the deadly chasm, Teak changes his mind and tries to return to Sirius, but the eye is overcome by Argon’s power and pulls Teak into the whirlpool. Argon is unleashed and he begins to destroy the ocean. The world above is affected as well; Malta is almost sucked into a maelstrom that forms below Mobius Hill. Glaucus battles with Argon and defeats him for good. Sirius escapes the dungeon before it collapses on him, and finds Teak, who is mortally wounded. Teak tells him to go to Malta before he dies. Meanwhile, on Mobius Hill, the eclipse begins and the Klaesco blossoms start to bloom. Malta tries to stop all of the spores from floating away but it is too late. Malta falls to the ground sobbing, believing Sirius had lied to her about returning. During the eclipse, Malta is transformed into the new Fire Queen.
Sirius desperately searches for Malta on land but falls off a cliff and loses his sight when he hits the ground. When he finally reaches Malta, the Fire Children present are astounded that the Water Child kept his promise. A heartbroken and haughty Malta tells him the flowers are gone and refuses to speak to him ever again. Sirius still calls out for her and runs to her as the eclipse ends. Malta begs him to go back but it is too late. The sunlight kills Sirius and Malta begins to weep over his body. The Fire Children and Themis watch as she mourns the loss of her love. She says that they will never be apart again, and carries him into the water, where she returns to her original form and at the same time, also dies. Themis is heartbroken when Glaucus appears out of the sea with their bodies. He reminds the world that fire and water were indeed once one, and sends Malta and Sirius up to the faraway heavens to let their love create that world once more. In an epilogue, Moelle appears saying that fire and water now live again in peace on this planet, but he passes on the story of Malta and Sirius, and how they now watch over the world from their own star in the night sky.
","I’m reluctant to categorize Sea Prince and the Fire Child as a children’s cartoon―seeing as the overarching theme of Windaria, an ADULT-ORIENTED animated film felt a little bit less bleak. This film was produced by Sanrio Films, which also created the infamously dark “children’s” cartoon―Ringing Bell; which had me scratching my head as an adult―I can’t even imagine what a child would decipher a film that teaches, “if someone slaughters your entire family―hunt them down to… ask them to be your mentor, and then kill more of your own kind!” I don’t know, it’s a kooky film! 
 
•	This story, in layman’s terms, is a mythical rendition of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, which, probably sounds really cool―until you see how the plot is handled. There are several stupid mishaps by characters that could have easily been avoided; but, apparently, every single character in this fantastical Grecian tale is mentally impaired―causing problem after problem to intensify the tragedy. 
 
•	The romance is weak, but I don’t fault the story for that. Romeo and Juliet only happens because two people happen to meet and because crazily infatuated with each other, nothing new there. Piale’s (a lesbian fire fairy) dedication to Malta (essentially Juliet) seems stronger than the breadth of their love and her role in the film, while important, is very fleeting. 
 
•	Many characters die over stupid things, like, “I’m going to do this really risky thing to try to help this person, even though it might end our entire civilization.” The main hero and heroine don’t help with the stupidity, seeing as they are both bequeathed with the greatest responsibilities in their kingdoms and they both aren’t able to even live up to these titles for ONE day; they literally sacrifice the lives of hundreds or thousands mythical sea or fire creatures to smooch! It’s infuriating. 
 
•	People think that they thirsty character motivations in School Days is irritating―this is stupendously worse. In fact, School Days has much better catharsis and morality than this idiocy. This movie teaches youngsters that if you toss your duties onto other people, sacrifice the innocent lives of your kingdom to have a forbidden love, make decisions that further ensue calamity, and die holding onto that “pure” love―it will reunite the elders of the kingdom, in lieu of your death, despite their reasons for quarreling being incredibly pithy as well. Seriously, if the kingdoms of fire and water were torn apart at the seams because of the Wind God throwing shade and gossiping―how is the death of the lovers supposed to having any lasting impact on the illusory amalgamation of the two kingdoms? 
 
•	Overall, despite the production values being gorgeous―the animation and character designs reminded me of Disney’s Fantasia―the story, characters, and ethos of the story are severely lacking; Ringing Bell was much better, although the morality was also skewed. I give it a 3/10. 


          
 
       Helpful The story is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet style with elemental gods instead of humans. This makes me have mixed feelings. While the story is so old and pretty much exactly what you would expect of the tale, I do like the gods a bit. Sadly, it was not enough to save the story as it felt bland in both voice acting and artwork. It just doesn’t pop at all and I felt myself becoming bored while watching it as there was no surprise, no special meaning behind any of it. 
 
The artwork is pretty beautiful but it is far from perfect. While the watercolors and special backgrounds pop, the characters seem to feel a little lack luster. The design of the characters feel like they are bland. Malta has only a small hint of wearing something although she is pretty much nude to a point and her limbs are just think sticks compared to her body with rather strange eyes that seem to be overly slanted. On the other hand, Sirius has thin limbs too but with rather clumpy looking ‘feet’ and hands. It makes me wish they were beautiful images like in the credits but sadly, they don’t fit the background at all. 
 
The voices… oh boy the voices… They have no feeling what so ever in their words and Malta’s voice is just overly high pitched. It’s a sad dub that makes me wish that I watched the Japanese version but the show was so bland to me that I don’t want to watch it again.

          
 
       Helpful Hey this is my second review for a show that hasn't gotten any recognition. 
 
Story-Well its the Romeo Juliet esque plot line with two sets of parents and or families in which despise each other. The introductory part of the story tells how the Water god and Fire god came into conflict.The sea prince is the son of the Water god at first he shows a trait for running away on his escapades. Conversingly the fire princess and or fire child is dutiful to her mother at first( guarding the flame etc..). After the two main characters encounter each other is less friendly with an exchange of verbose name calling, but this is due to their parents respectively portraying the other side in a pejorative manner. Then of course after several meetings the veneer that taught them to hate each other was reproved. Afterwards segments of conflict insue in whether they can coexist and love one another. 
 
Art-This show finished airing in the early 1980's. Don't expect pristine depictions of any scenery or setting. However the animation looked disney liked at times or similar to the style used by Ghibli films. For its epoch its quite well done and rarely are there any inconsistencies with the characters. 
 
Sound-The music is clandestine and classical, almost scintillating that it illustrates the relationship between the characters.It's quite profound with the calming effects and peacefulness gained with the two main characters together without interruption. 
 
Character-Sirius the sea prince is more akin the adventurous and disobient type.  He adjusted rather quickly with the fire society disproving of his relationship with Malta. Malta however is calculating, calm and obedient for the most part but she also has her curious nature. Sirius had a direct influence on her changing of character in developing to become less dependent or questioning. 
 
Enjoyment- The movie had its cheesy moments but that's what you should expect from Romeo and Juliet type romance. Childish and facile at times making it a proponent of disney themes but that doesn't trump the serious and poignant relationship that the main characters  have for each other. 
 
Overall-If you would like to diversify your list with an antiquated theme thats been done before but with different characterisations. The dosage of disney themes that this show ascribes to maybe be perilous to some. Overall a pretty good movie for its intended audience.

Story: 6 
 
The story (synopsis available above) is pretty simply. It's simple without the need to get convoluted and is very enjoyable with it's innocent fun but... here comes my biggest issue with the show; it's not handled very well.  
 
To avoid spoilers I won't go into details: there are concepts introduced which don't show up for long periods of time, seeming like they were forgotten or copped out because of time restrains. Transitions between time 'skips' (for lack of a better term) is awkwardly handled, leaving the audience to piece together how much time has passed with very little indication for no reason and, my biggest issue, the extremely sporadic pacing. The pacing is all over the place in this show; some parts are calm and collected while others go from one thing to another so fast that there's little time to take anything in.  
 
Art: 8 
 
The character designs are very 'normal' (for the most part) without the need for flashy in-your-face characters or deformed bodies. The art is overall quite nice and the close-up shots on the instruments are pleasing to the eye. Very fitting with the rest of the show leaving no complaints.  
 
Sound: 10  
 
This is probably bias speaking, especially since jazz is one of my favourite genres--and the 'main' song ""Moanin'"" by Art Blakey being one of my favourites--but the sound of this show was damn near perfect. The voice acting was good and there were no overblown reactions for comedic purpose (that I remember), sound effects were fitting, and the music selection left little to be desired.  
 
Characters: 9 
 
I could go off on numerous tangents about each of the [important] characters but to save time and space:  
 
they were all well written with their own motivations, reasoning, likable and irritable traits, they had fitting reactions and were, in my honest opinion, more relatable/human/'natural' than in most other anime. Although some development is lacking, the execution more than makes up for it if I say so myself.  
 
Overall: 8. 
 
As much as I loved this anime there were numerous issues with the story which I found to be greatly detrimental to the overall show but not enough to make me dislike it. It's a show I'd definitely recommend and think stands on a solid 8/10. 

          
 
       Helpful I think that there are certain anime that come along in our lives that make us rethink our current ratings. They make us rerate the decent shows and the above average shows. They make 7's turn into 6's, and 8's turn into 9's. Why? Because you really don't know where to put them. Here on MAL we can only choose a single number to represent how we feel about the anime. But sometimes I'm left feeling like, ""Oh, this anime was better than so-and-so, so I have to rate it a 8. But it was worse than so-and-so so I have to rate it a 7."" Sakamichi No Apollon is one of those anime that confused me. Reading this review means that you're opting to know why.  
 
Story: 7 
Basic story. I think that often times in anime, if it doesn't have a show-stopping mindfuck of a premise, people rate the story lowly. I think that the only thing that matters is if the story is one that I can read about and then want to watch it. That doesn't make the story anything amazing, but it means that it has potential. I've never watched an anime based in the 60s before. That was cool. I've never watched an anime about jazz music before. That was cool. What the show lacked in is what it became in the latter half of the series. 
 
Art: 10 
I've got nothing but praise for the art in this anime. I kid you not, reading the dialogue wasn't my top priority a lot of the time. To me, the art was impressive. Usually in anime (or at least the ones that I have watched) they use very many lines. In this anime, they use blends. There's no line differentiating the skin that is shaded between the skin that is facing the sun; there's a blended transition. The fluidity of this anime was shocking. If anyone knows anything about anime, they'll know how there's usually a lot of corners cut when it comes to the art and animation. There's usually a lot of loops, and certain angles aren't fucked with. In Sakamichi, especially during their music scenes, there was nothing but captivation and awe within me. Like I said before, I've got nothing but praise for the art. 
 
Sound: 9 
An anime dealing with jazz... that's incredibly cool to me in itself. All this anime got me wanting to do is listen to Moanin' on a endless loop. The beginning theme is one of those themes that I will doubtlessly be listening to over and over. Something about Yuki's voice paired with the lyrics of the song gets me in this audacious mood. Seriously. It makes me want to get off my ass, go outside and live. The ending theme though, I can't say the same for. It wasn't bad by any or all means, but it wasn't captivating. I'd stop listening after the first 5 seconds. Mostly though, the music was enjoyable.  
 
Characters: 7 
This is where the anime began to fall on its face. One minute, I love the characters. The next minute they're doing some horribly dramatic, unnecessary thing. The main character, Nishimi, is probably the worst of them all. He makes the same mistake over and over and over again and makes things a lot worse than they have to be. And it's all is over absolutely nothing and it often escalates too quickly. He needed a heavy dosage of plz calm the fuck down. Sen is a character that I liked for the most part. I think that he was too quick to throw a fist, but I liked him nonetheless. He was funny, carefree and a good friend for most of the series. But he wasn't immune to enticing very worthless drama. Besides his few minor offences of that though, he was a good character. Ri'ko... I'm on the fence about. I have this huge thing against lacklustre, personalitiless, docile females in anime. There are SO many and they're all SO boring. She was a nice character and she did have flaws, she was just a... I don't know, boring character. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
12 episode anime that took me some like 3 days to finish. With that, I wouldn't say that it captured my attention that greatly. But it certainly held it. There are some anime that are just impossible to put down and there are some that are impossible to not finish, even if it's eventually. 3 days isn't bad, but considering that I'm out of college and all I've been doing is eating and working out, it's not good either. I think that in the middle of the series my interest dipped, just to peak again in the last episode. I kept watching though, which means that I enjoyed it enough. 
 
Overall: 8 
What happened when I watched this anime, is that I didn't know whether to rate it a 7 or a 8. It was better than Kaichou wa maid-sama, which I rated a 7, but it was worse than Nana, which I rated an 8. What did I do? Change my rating of Maid-sama to a 6 and Nana to a 9 (plus it's one of my favourite anime, I don't know why it wasn't a 9 anyway). I was so set on rating this anime a 7, but I was really impressed by the ending. If it weren't for that, this anime would have gotten a 7, no question. Judging by the posts on the last episode discussion board people are very up and down about the ending, but in my opinion it was the perfect way to finish of the series on a bittersweet note. It also had me feeling for the characters more than I thought that I would, since I was never 100% invested in them. I was very impressed.  
 
So is 8 an inflation? Sure is. If I could be more specific with my ratings, this anime would probably get a 7.5. Worth the watch, impressive bits, and slightly over average.

          
 
       Helpful This is true masterpiece! 
 
Story revolves around a somewhat lost and depressed shoolkid who, thanks to meeting an amazing person, manages to overcome his own downsides and discover joy in life. 
 
Story and characters. 
There are many amazing characters and 2 main are shown in development. They both have very lovable personality and you just can't stop from falling in love. 
Story is realistic and thought through. If you prefer stereotypical characters of shojo and action mangas this plot isn't for you.  
 
Art and sound. 
Sound is perfect, both voice acting and music. There is a lot of really well done music pieces and no cheezy ""disney-like"" moments. Enjoy pretty awesoem jazz and a bit of rock'n'roll.  
Art is done quite well. This anime is in semi-relaistic style, people aren't deformed and you can easily tell one character from another. I really loved design of characters and environment. 
 
Enjoyment. 
Though there are many very sad moments in ""Kids on slope"", overally this anime leaves you warm and fuzzy inside. I felt like crybaby in the end.  
 
Despite main action happening in school, I'd suggest target audience for this story is older than 20, probably 25+. One needs to have a bit of life experience to fully enjoy the plot. This anime is a must watch for all who like realism and need a little boost to their souls.

However, new challengers are rising up left and right, claiming to have an answer for the move responsible for crushing his opponents. Will Ippo be able to step up to the challenge, or will the weight of his pride destroy him before he finds out just what it means to be strong? Meanwhile, fellow Kamogawa Gym mate Aoki Masaru is just a hop, skip, and a Frog Punch away from claiming his own belt, ready to take on the Japanese Lightweight Champion! 
 
 Hajime no Ippo: Rising  continues Ippo's quest to become stronger, featuring the same cast of loveable dimwits from Kamogawa Gym, as they put their bodies and hearts on the line to make their way in the harsh world of professional boxing. With a will of iron, Ippo steps into the ring once again. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Sports', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","Ippo Makunouchi was an extremely shy high school student, unable to make friends due to always being busy helping his mother run their family fishing charter business. Because he kept to himself, a group of bullies led by Umezawa got into the habit of picking on him. One day, when these bullies gave him a rather serious beating, a middleweight professional boxer who was passing by stopped them and took the injured Ippo to the Kamogawa Gym (鴨川ボクシングジム, Kamogawa Bokushingu Jimu), owned by retired boxer Genji Kamogawa, to treat his wounds. After Ippo awoke to the sounds of boxers training, the boxer who saved him, Mamoru Takamura, tried to cheer Ippo up by letting him vent his frustrations on a sandbag. It was then that they had their first glimpse into Ippo's talent for boxing. After that incident, Ippo gave the situation a lot of thought and decided that he would like to begin a career as a professional boxer. When he conveys this message to Mamoru Takamura, he gets verbally reprimanded: Takamura thought Ippo was taking professional boxing too lightly. However, Takamura felt that he couldn't outright refuse Ippo, especially since his feat of punching the sandbag much harder than anybody else in the gym (except for Takamura). Therefore, he challenges Ippo to catch 10 falling leaves from a tree simultaneously after a week of training, fully convinced that Ippo would fail, Takamura jogs away as he continues his roadwork.
However, after a week of tough training, involving nightly hours, Ippo manages the technique in the nick of time. He waits for the jogging Takamura to come by his usual path and surprises him by catching all 10 of the falling leaves and only doing so with his left hand. This impresses Takamura greatly, and he informs Ippo that the action required to catch all 10 leaves is called a boxing jab. Takamura invites Ippo back to the boxing gym for introductions.
When they got back to the gym, the coach, Genji Kamogawa, was not at all impressed by Makunouchi's lack of fighting spirit, and therefore, was challenged by Takamura to have a practice spar against a member of the gym. However, Kamogawa decides to give Ippo a severe challenge and tells him to spar with Miyata, who is 16, the same age as Ippo. Miyata is known as a boxing prodigy and is one of Kamogawa gym's future hopes. Takamura gets extremely worried with this prospect, as Miyata skill is way above the four-rounder pro boxer. As expected, Ippo loses by KO, but not until Miyata struggles dodging his punches and finally ends the match with his trump card: ""The Counter"". Coach Kamogawa decides that he has great fighting sense and spirit and decides to train him to eventually become the Japanese champion with a world ranking while Miyata became the OPBF (Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation) Champion. Both are expected to hit high in the rankings and, eventually, fight each other for the world champion's belt.
The story focuses heavily on character development—even during the matches something is learned about both fighters. Ippo has a habit of running into his opponents before matches, giving him a chance to learn more about their backgrounds and even sympathize with them. Ippo is an extremely timid and modest person who never assumes that he is strong enough. He instead draws courage from seeing the strength of his opponent and realizing that he is able to stand up to it. Ippo and his friendly rivalry with Miyata is the main draw in the early part of the series. That later changes to Ippo's path toward the Japanese Featherweight Championship and eventually the world championship. Along the way the audience is given glimpses into the other characters' pasts, motivations, relationships to others, and current boxing trials. A colorful cast of supporting characters and opponents as well as side stories concerning their paths in the boxing world rounds out the series.
","This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here. 
 
Hajime No Ippo is a long running anime with about ~125-127 total. I first learned about it from a friend and this is probably the 3rd or 4th anime I've watched (the others were fairly short). At first I was apprehensive about watching this due to its length and it being only about boxing.. but now that I've finished it, I'm left wanting more. This series is what really makes me appreciate anime and its last episodes are always on my mind, along with all the good moments I've had throughout watching its run. This anime has amazing storytelling, hilarious comedy, THE best character development I've ever seen, great action sequences, and the most importantly; this show has a lot of heart. While there are many animes out there with some of these good elements, none of them pull them off as perfectly as this one does. The funny thing is, most people find their favorite animes through their favorite characters (whom they relate to), and while there are certain characteristics of the characters that are relatable; there are none that I can truly relate to entirely. With that said, there is no bias here. 
 
This speaks for the entirety of the series. Since this is on the Hajime No Ippo: Rising section, I may as well review this season specifically a little bit. I'm not going to lie, the first 2 episodes were ok, they're nothing special. The real enjoyment begins at episode 3 and up. Its hard to say that this season is the best one given how long the first season is, but this one is definitely the most memorable due to the way it executed the story, allowing you to remember the whole season instead of chunks of it (like the first season, which may be because of its length). Something that may be considered negative is the fact that Ippo is only the center of the season through the first half of it (maybe up to ep17?). But it makes up for it by paying more attention to some of the characters who have had less development in the last 2 seasons. After Shimabukuro, all of the main fights are good... of Bryan Hawk quality. Finally, this season just had so much heart, especially at the end. This piece is a minor spoiler, but the last 2 episodes focus on the past with Coach Kamogawa/Nekota and it is a MUST watch. Out of all the episodes of the series, the last 2 are a strong mix of sadness/happiness that will leave a mark in the hearts of anyone whos followed the series from the beginning.

       Helpful This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here. 
 
Hajime No Ippo is a long running anime with about ~125-127 total. I first learned about it from a friend and this is probably the 3rd or 4th anime I've watched (the others were fairly short). At first I was apprehensive about watching this due to its length and it being only about boxing.. but now that I've finished it, I'm left wanting more. This series is what really makes me appreciate anime and its last episodes are always on my mind, along with all the good moments I've had throughout watching its run. This anime has amazing storytelling, hilarious comedy, THE best character development I've ever seen, great action sequences, and the most importantly; this show has a lot of heart. While there are many animes out there with some of these good elements, none of them pull them off as perfectly as this one does. The funny thing is, most people find their favorite animes through their favorite characters (whom they relate to), and while there are certain characteristics of the characters that are relatable; there are none that I can truly relate to entirely. With that said, there is no bias here. 
 
This speaks for the entirety of the series. Since this is on the Hajime No Ippo: Rising section, I may as well review this season specifically a little bit. I'm not going to lie, the first 2 episodes were ok, they're nothing special. The real enjoyment begins at episode 3 and up. Its hard to say that this season is the best one given how long the first season is, but this one is definitely the most memorable due to the way it executed the story, allowing you to remember the whole season instead of chunks of it (like the first season, which may be because of its length). Something that may be considered negative is the fact that Ippo is only the center of the season through the first half of it (maybe up to ep17?). But it makes up for it by paying more attention to some of the characters who have had less development in the last 2 seasons. After Shimabukuro, all of the main fights are good... of Bryan Hawk quality. Finally, this season just had so much heart, especially at the end. This piece is a minor spoiler, but the last 2 episodes focus on the past with Coach Kamogawa/Nekota and it is a MUST watch.

       Helpful First of all a big thanks to George Morikawa because he did something nearly impossible with Hajime no Ippo. He managed to keep his story interesting and his comedy fresh even after all these years. Sure it has it’s weaknesses(for example some short chapters in the manga plus some repeated stuff in the story etc) but it is still a great accomplishment that only a few are capable of. 
 
The story is about Ippo a kid without any purpose in his life and fate decides to make a boxer out of him. This season focuses on his challenges to keep his special move sharp and fresh, the Dempsey roll. in the manga the reason for the focus on the Dempsey Roll is explained better but since madhouse tried to handpick parts of the story there had to be some changes so they could fill it all in their schedule which is still no biggie since Ippo is not the best part of the story for me anyway(cause most of the times we know he is gonna win so it takes the tension away for me at least). His coach Kamogawa and his hero Takamura are the best parts and both get to shine in this season. Takamura aimed to rule 6 classes and his fights are always exciting and we get to see his second conquest in this season with a classier opponent this time, Eagle. A man that is exactly the opposite of Hawk, not just in style but also in personality. This is specially for American  so mangaka could show better to them that he is not against Americans! 
 
Madhouse decided to put the best part at the end of the season of course and along with some changes they put the Kamogawa background story at the end of this season which is probably the best part of the whole story and it explains why Kamogawa and Nekota are in their current state(plus Dankichi). As for the other characters Aoki and Kimura are mostly for comical relief like most of the times (even Aoki’s serious fight was funny and unreal probably on purpose) and Manabu is yet to reach his best condition in the manga but he is not liked by many it seems so I guess it’s for the best. (I actually like his character specially his expressions during matches and his second fight with Imai but he seems to me just like an extra character just to extend the story and doesn't add anything meaningful. I get it that he is there to show the growth of next generation but if it is going to be the similar rivalry thing that happened in the previous generations then who cares?!...). as for female characters…sigh, Sport genre and good female characters usually don’t go hand to hand(there are some strong or useful ones in some stories still as characters they are not that interesting). also this season shows one of the key messages the manga has: the importance of rivals. 
 
The animation doesn’t seem too much improved to be honest specially when you watch Kuroko no baske’s second season and see the improvement there in the short time it had from it’s previous season(although they didn't keep it up till the end) but it still feels a little cleaner and sharper than before. voice acting is strong just like previous seasons although Kamogawa’s voice actor passed away (rest in peace) so they had to replace him. Sadly they replaced him with Miguel’s voice actor but many probably don’t even remember Miguel so who cares and they might not even adopt Wally’s story so he might not be needed since if there is going to be a fourth season they might go for another epic fight or something (Volg’s fight would be good if they could somehow include it too since they had to show Volg this time too so it would be cooler narrative-wise but guess for that reason they should go for Randy J too.). also Coach’s voice in his earlier days didn't fit him(it is done by Mamoru Miyano mostly famous for Light Yagami) it was obvious they were just trying to use a famous Voice actor cause he is an important character but to be honest the fact that it doesn't fit is not a bad thing cause not all characters should have voices that matches their faces or style and as long as voice actors do their job fine they are fine. As for OP and ED I didn’t enjoy them although they made a smart use of a front page of one of the chapters in the ED which I liked. 
 
2013 was filled with great sport anime like Yowamushi pedal, Kuroko no Baske Season 2 and Diamond No Ace and sport fans are hopefully pleased. Hajime no Ippo Rising doesn't lose to those anime of course and it is a worthy adaptation. also Hopefully George Morikawa will start another Takamura fight soon or something as epic so Madhouse gets more tempted for another season.

OPERATION COZY FAMILY.  
 
Thousands of years ago, Enka the God of Destruction, was killed. However, with a dying breath it claimed that its child would appear and destroy humanity. Now in futuristic Japan, all of the potential children of Enka have been found and placed into a haphazard family.  
 
Teika the lion, Gekka the jellyfish, Yuuka the oni, Ginka the cross-dressing mafia son, and Hyouka the bioweapon--along with their parents Ouka and Kyouka (the ruler of a demon underworld)--all live under one roof in a family frenzy. ","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"What do you get when you take a Jellyfish, an oni, a lion, a cyborg, a cross dressing mafia member and a cat with a serious God complex? You get one of the strangest comedy anime of all time. For such a long time whilst watching this show I couldn't pinpoint what exactly it was trying to achieve nor what it wanted to be. It constantly jumped between comedy and random shenanigans to tragic backstories and drama at the drop of a hat, all of which made the show incredibly jarring and confusing to watch, resulting in some of the worst tonal shifts I have seen for any anime. Now, before I actually get into that, let me talk more about the plot for this show. 
 
Enka, the God of destruction died one thousand years ago but upon dying, proclaimed that one of his children will carry on his will to destroy the world. Now, in modern Japan, all of the possible children of Enka have been gathered together and are joined as a family in an attempt to prevent the destruction of the Earth by showing them how wonderful and beautiful human life is. The possible children of the God Enka, include Teika the lion, Gekka the Jellyfish and even a biological weapon, Hyouka. Each of the main characters are both unique in terms of design and personalities, and have decent chemistry with each other, as well as lengthy backstories and tragic past. And that's it for narrative really. Nothing really happens of much significance and all the events that do happen in the show feel random and intrusive rather than a natural progression from arc to arc. While the show does attempt to create comedy, and for the most part, the comedy could make me smile and even laugh a couple of times, it's ultimately ruined by the abrupt and strange tonal shifts that change so frequently, which ruins the dramatic tensions of the show. One moment they're throwing out some random gag and the immediate next one we are watching the backstories of a young girl who is being whipped by her evil family. It feels jarring; clunky. 
 
Some of the most entertaining episodes of the show are just when they are sticking to comedy and random hijinks and if the show was more like this in its entirety I would've had a lot more fun as a result. It's just that they chuck so much in with so many random characters that it begins to feel tiresome and the show begins to drag mid-way through. While, as I said, the characters can have decent chemistry with each other, their backstories are forced in and are so boring that I lose interest right away. Even when the show does introduce a more central and focused narrative for the final four or so episodes, it still feels rather awkward and confusing as well since the characters keep jumping from one place to the next without reason and characters are introduced which go nowhere. The show as a whole is just rather inconsistent with no rhyme or reason to any of the events that are happening. 
 
And it's not like the show is completely devoid of any interesting ideas or themes, it's just that the ideas are executed so poorly or never expanded enough on to feel worthwhile in the end. Most notably, when one of the arcs focuses on the mistreatment of animals and how they should be the ones to control society and not humans, but not enough time is spent on fleshing it out enough. 
 
The characters themselves could provide a joke here and there that made me smile but that was the most I ever got out of them. Kyouka, the cat with a serious God complex is both selfish and annoying and easily my least favorite thing about the show. While they do try and present her as being full of insecurities, justifying her behaviour, not nearly enough time was spent on fleshing it out nor developing it. Ouka, the father of this jumbled family, was rather plain and flat and hardly memorable in the slightest. The other characters of the family are a little more interesting in terms of personality but their backstories felt trite and forced, used as a cheap way to make us sympathise and connect with the character rather than building them up as people.  There are a plethora of other characters but they're so forgettable, that's it hardly worth the time speaking about them. 
 
The animation was fairly consistent but there are not really all too many moments of great art or movement. The art style works in the shows favour and conveys the goofy and silly nature of the show rather well, in the same vein as Konasuba does with its animation and art. I liked most of the soundtrack for the show, albeit it, if it is pretty forgettable but the opening is catchy as hell. 
 
In conclusion, I really did want to enjoy myself with this show, I really did. It had a good set-up, a nice main cast, all of which with different gimmicks and personalities that could have bounced off each other very well but the constant shifts in tone and the forced tragic backstories as well as melodrama are what kept me back from having a good time. It's a shame too, since this show did have some things going for it at the very least...

          
 
       Helpful The basic construction of this series is a little odd. One get's used to seeing mainstream entertainment stick to fairly similar genre patterns, sometimes subverting these tropes and sometimes sprinkling some flavour from a complimentary genre (e.g. action comedy). However KKN is odd in that it attempts to blend an impressive range of genre's that one doesn’t often see together. Now sometime's when you mix lots of colours together you get brown, but in this case it's done and works surprisingly well. It makes for an engaging viewing experience as the show moves from slapstick comedy to heavy drama seamlessly. The pace of the plot and these rapid changes of emotion make for an extremely entertaining show. 
 
All of the characters, while generally fairly outré, are well characterised and appealing. None more so than Kyouka, the main protagonist or at least the common focal point of the show. As I said above it contains a number of elements all of which are well executed and integrated. The comedy in particular is extremely funny, while some of it does rely on being passably familiar with other anime or Japanese culture the majority of it should be accessible and amusing for any audience.  
 
While the humour alone would be enough for me to recommend it the action and in particular the drama are also great. The drama in particular is rife with pathos. It deals with some pretty heavy elements in a pretty competent way. Though now that I write that I begin to wonder; are these things actually well done? Is it really good at invoking pathos or have I become emotionally unstable? Sometimes the latter seems more probable as I find myself reacting strongly to material which I objectively feel shouldn’t really be eliciting the responses it does.

          
 
       Helpful There seems to be a lack of reviews of Kyouran Kazoku Nikki where all the episodes have been watched at the time of writing so I shall attempt to fill that void. 
 
The Diary of a Crazed Family, that should tell you something about this anime.  In fact, if you were any bit serious about it, it would take your face to the curb and beat it out of you.  At least for the most part.  But let's get this party started shall we? 
 
There is no real story in Kyouran Kazoku Nikki, each episode could easily function as a standalone short, but that doesn't mean the show lacks continuity or has no real meat within the episodes themselves.  Usually there is an Aesop or moral or something or other to be taught by Kyouka-sama and that's about the only thing that would annoy me.  It's more or less a slice of life.  Your mileage may vary. 
 
The art, fitting to the theme, is vibrant and colourful.  In fact, this is one of the few anime that does not have over-the-top &quot;anime&quot; hairstyled characters.  For that I applaud it.  Heck, even a Stinger is faithfully recreated in anime form and ofcourse, the sparkles are appropriately added so there really isn't anything to say about it.  Not outstanding, but not terrible. 
 
The same can be said of the sound.  The OP, is one of the few that I willingly sit through to listen to.  A very good indicator of what the show is about as well.  There are multiple EDs, one for each of the Midarezakis, save perhaps Gekka, but she's a Jellyfish sooo.  Moving on, each ED is in a way, representative of each Miderazaki, quite fitting and credit is given where credit is due.  Next we have the BGM, which I can't say doesn't go terribly well nor wrong.  In fact, not commenting about it probably the best thing I could do.  Because it means they did something right.  I have nothing to complain about. 
 
Almost all of the main cast has some depth to them, a shame really, I wanted to know more about Ouka and Ginka.  In fact, there are still some unexplained flashbacks (and I haven't checked Wikipedia yet) for Ouka and I would like that resolved, thank you very much.  Ginka, on the other hand, got the short-stick when they drew the characterisation priority chart I bet.  Other than that I'm fine with the hyperactive yet insecure Kyouka, the shy and timid Yuuka, the mysterious Gekka, the innocent Hyouka, the mindful Teika and of course the rather normal Chika (rather being the stressed word). 
 
Then of course, comes the enjoyment derived.  But it is hard not to enjoy such a well implemented comedy.  My favourite moment is probably when Santa took a Stinger and later going to town with Kyouka.  There are plenty of  things that are over the top.  But that just adds to the comedy, and somehow it never feels forced.  Which usually then segues into a heartwarming moment.  Quite well pulled off at points but sometimes, I can already see it coming which can dampen the impact somewhat.  Overall, this is something of a must watch for fans of comedy (personally I don't know anyone who would dislike a good comedy).  That's it really, so embrace Goddere and may Kyouka-sama smile upon you.

(Source: Nippon Animation)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']",none,"Mahoujin Guru Guru is probably the craziest, wackiest anime I've ever seen. Slapstick is constant - nothing is ever serious for more than a minute, if that long. 
 
In Plain Old Village (that's actually the name), Nike has been undergoing &quot;training&quot; since he was very small, as his parents are adamant that he become a dashing hero someday. Conveniently, just as the boy has grown old enough to take care of himself (age 13), that's when all the trouble starts. When his dad finds out that the king is looking to recruit a hero to deal with this resurrected evil, one thing leads to another and Nike meets magic user Kukuri. Though cute, soft-spoken, and pretty much idolizing her new friend, she has a bit of an attitude and struggles to learn the Guru Guru circles. This leads to a lot of bizarre &quot;oopsies.&quot; You'll just have to watch to understand.  
 
Along the way of their journey, they'll meet many interesting characters. And by interesting, I mean insane. There's an old man dressed in a hula skirt who pops up at the most inconvenient times to do a disturbing dance. A sprite who wears a loin cloth. An incompetent hero wanna-be who couldn't fight a butterfly with a flame thrower. And that's just to start! Nike and Kukuri themselves frequently act the complete opposite of what their position implies. 
 
The artwork is adorable and fun, drawn completely &quot;chibi&quot; style except for a few instances. This can, however, make it hard to guess how old a character is at times. While most anime shrink the characters down for exaggerated emotions, this show actually grows them up to &quot;normal&quot; size. 
 
Overall, this is a very, very silly show in a universe that you could wake up in and think you'd eaten some bad cheese. If you're a fan of a good fantasy story and/or have ever played an RPG, you will definitely appreciate the jokes. If you like romance, there's a bit of that. If you like random and nonsensical, there's enough to choke a horse. Basically there's something for everyone. Highly recommended! 
 
WARNING: There is a little innuendo that might startle some people (especially parents). Nike is a bit of a pervert ;)

          
 
       Helpful One of my favourite animes of all time. It's a charming and light-hearted fantasy comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. I've watched Spirited Away, Berserk, One Piece and many animes more highly rated than this one but to me this beats most of them. Every episode is such a joy to watch and it never failed to bring a smile to my face. No anime with a higher rating can accomplish this except for maybe Gintama if you exclude the nonsensical and plot heavy episodes. And as for its gag potential this one has episodes that made me gag as hard as some of Gintama's funnier episodes.

          
 
       Helpful This is my first anime that I liked~ When i was young, there's only slam dunk and mahoujin guru guru which impressed me. It gives me a lot of inspiration. This anime also influence me into drawing. To be frank, I am not a fan of chibi but the way this anime present it (other than main characters *1/3, they're all normal*with 1/4,1/5 porportion)~ It is an anime that won't give you time to rest(you will laugh about every min~no time for you to breathe) Furthermore, it is something you won't get bore with ~ I watched the chinese version of it more than 20 times (i'm serious, I stopped watching it at my 20th because the disc start to lag). On the other hand, I suggest you to watch it alone in your room because there are many embarassing and childish scenes in it. I got laughed at because my big sis and bro saw me watching it~ well that won't change the fact that I like it. I still like it very much. In my case~ it worths buying it~ but becareful! the Mahoujin Guru Guru 2 is not the same at all!

","A while ago I made a review on Digimon Adventure, explaining why I found it to be one of the best kids shows out there, one that had smartly developed plot and characters, great soundtrack, good animation, and overall superb enjoyment not just for kids, but for young adults as well. I also said that a 7.78 score was way too low for a series that achieved something as great as developing each character propperly, have the characters arc influence in the main story arcs and present mature themes to little children without being too dark for them. And so the expectations for Adventure 02 were far too high; I wish I could say as well that the score (currently 7.34) is also low, that the series is the great sequel Adventure so much deserved. Sadly, it is not, 7.34 is the score this sequel deserves, if not lower (even into the 6s zone). Why is that? Let's see: 
 
Storywise: The storytelling is not bad, but much has changed, including the pace; Digimon Adventure had 5 story arcs, each 10 to 14 episodes long, which allowed it to move at a pace that never felt too quickly or too slow, each arc started and ended properly. Here... not su much; we have 3 story arcs, one of 21 episodes, then one of 17 and the last one of 12 episodes. We find some filler episodes in the first one, some ongoing character problems on the second (I'll fill that in the next section) and a rushed and convulted final arc that tries to make up for what is kind of a lagging season by bombing us with too much material that never gets developed (Demon, for instance). 
Now, don't be fooled; despite all its flaws the storytelling is still enjoyable, there are still mature themes around and the air of greatness of Digimon Adventure, however the flaws are too notorious and the characters also dragg it down, but I have to admit that they are all thought through, none of them comes out of thin air (give or take the final arc) and they all get somewhat their propper ending. 
The plot is not as good as the first Digimon series, but the potential is there. Now, why wasn't it fully used? Mainly, characters problems. 
 
Character: Here is where Adventure 02 just outright failed. Remember how amazingly outlined the characters from the first Digimon series were? Remember how they were just broadstrokes that got developed into fully fleshed out character and how amazing was that the crest of each character represented the very scent of how they were? Well, Digimon 02 mainly hopes you forgot about all that. 
We still have our main 8 characters from the first series, but 6 are downgraded to supporting roles, while 2 remain and 3 new character join (one more joins lare on). Now these 3 characters are the main trouble of Digimon 02. 
Daisuke (aka Davis): he is arrogant, he is reckless, and he is a good guy deep down, we have our most stereotypical hero! Of course, that wouldn't be a trouble with the propper character work, but here there is... none. There is no background to explain Daisuke's personality, whereas in Adventure we had backgrounds for each character. We know he has issues with her sister, but that never gets developed (not to mention we never get to know his parents). As the series goes forward Daisuke changes and matures, for no apparent reason; granted, being in the digital world fighting monsters does change people, but Daisuke's change really came without propper building up. He passed from annoying to tollerable, but mainly he was just plot fodder. But he is not nearly the worst character. 
Miyako (aka Joley): now here is a character that mostly everyone will hate! Why is that? Miyako is all talk and no action. She is energetic and sometimes you picture her as the optimistic one, but as soon as she get into the real danger she freaks out and it takes her about 5 minutes of screen time to realize she has to fight. As the series progress her character is mostly ignored and she is left with her characteristic energetic self and food lover life personality, with no development whatsoever or any background at all. 
Iori (aka Kodi): Want someone as annoying as Miyako? Iori might be the one. He is rigid and barely makes an expression, if any. Unlike the previous two, this character does have a background which is not only in sync with his personality, but actually linked with the final arc and despite being kind of interesting, the character himself remains the same for about the whole show, with no actual changes and nothing more than his usual poker face. 
Takeru (TK) and Hikari (Kari): They came from the previous series, so everything should be ok, right? Sadly no; both Takeru and Hikari are mainly ignored in this series. Takeru has about 3 good character moments in the show in the first arc, and then acts as plot fodder later on. Hikari is... well, I wouldn't know, she really doesn't fullfil any function here, give or take going to the dark sea world or supporting the rest on battle. 
Ken: Here is a character that actually got good treatment; he is given a nice background which is consistent with his personality, he is conflicted, and while shy he is mainly likeable for showing the brave to move forward and attone for his wrongs. He is the only one that actually gets good character moments and a character arc that is mainly involved in the plot. Sadly 1 out of 6 doesn't make the cut for good character treatment. 
 
Music: Gladly, the OST from the previous series remains here with the addition of some more tracks made just for this one, which are good. The opening theme, while not as amazing as the one seen in Digimon Adventure, is actually pretty good, both endings are also good, and the tracks that plays in the new evolutions moments are quite nice (specially the one when jogress evolution is made). So, yeah, still a 10 if you ask me. 
 
Enjoyment: For all its faults and failures in the character department, I still think I like this Digimon series. It has some very bad moments that made me ask myself ""why am I watching this crap?"" Followed by some very glorious moments that kept me on the edge of my seat and reply ""Oh, yeah. That's why"". Sure, if I had to grade each episodes, most of them would be on the range of C to B-, but there would surely be straigh As in the ways, but sadly some Ds or Fs too. As a whole, the enjoyment is fair: you get some very clunky, cheesy and boring moments, but you also get profounds and exciting ones (thank you BlackWarGreymon! And Taichi and the rest too for that matter), and as such the enjoyement is in thin line between fair and good. 
 
Stray observations (funny facts and bits of information I got while watching the series): 
-Did you know that originally Adventure 02 had 64 episodes, but the order got cut to 50 somewhere around the way because of low rating? Now we may understand why the finale felt so rushed. 
-There was supposed to be a rivalry between Daisuke and Takeru, but that gets forgotten at some point and then Daisuke just ignores Takeru; and they want to make us believe they are friends... 
-Daisuke and Ken, Miyako and Hikari, all got some good character moments and emotional pep talks previous to achieving jogress evolution. Takeru and Iori got it by having Takeru tell Iori ""have faith: well, that escalated pretty quickly 
-Demon (being sent to the dark world in episode 45): ""you'll regret this"". Apperantly this was set up for Digimon Adventure 03, which you know ended up being tamer so... no, they never regreted it. Besides, what was his purpose in the first place? We'll never know. 
-Ken (in episode 42): ""por favor déjeme entrar"" Ken, tu español no es malo, de hecho mejor que el de mucho japoneses, pero no deja de ser raro escucharlo. 
-Best character: BlackWarGreymon, surely, as he is a sympatetic villian at first and then a tragic hero. His arc is also the high point of the series, as he wonders for the meaning of life; he surely got the best character treatment, closely followed by Ken. 
-Worst character: Miyako, surely, clossely followed by Iori. 
-Daisuke (in the finale) ""I want to have a ramen shop!"" Ken: ""I never knew about this"". Nobody did Ken, and nobody even cared. 
-Award for most forgotten character from Adventure: Mimi, somehow the writers though sending one of their most developed characters into USA would make the cut. They were wrong. Also, I think Sora was pretty much forgotten too.

       Helpful I watched digimon adventure 02 when I was still a kid, I did enjoy it very much. After I grow up, and rewatching it, I can't believe that it had a bunch of flaws in it. Let's go into it... 
 
Story: 5/10 
Being connected with 1st adventure series, the story involves about digimon kaiser, who make rampage on digital world, torturing digimon becoming his servants. New chosen children had to stop him for what he did. The story of kaiser become connected with the next villain and more. My problem is, the story had a LOT of annoying plotholes, especially on the dark ocean episodes. It's cliche, didn't make sense at all. It tended to be darker but it failed, more like a useless filler. It was nice to see the connection between the old villain with the next one until the last villain, making it become clear about the controversies. 
However, the ending of the episode is just not what it should be. I was disappointed for the ending. But overall, the story is okay-ish, degraded from the straightforward adventure 1.  
 
Characters: 8/10 
Despite of huge plotholes, the characters are more or less good, except the main character. It had fair enjoyable moments between characters, sometimes are annoying. And it had a few good teen drama. 
Daisuke was just an annoying generic typical shounen main character. He's the most annoying of all, he tends to be more anime-ish character. Even though so, he did a few best job especially in before last episode. Maybe that's what I can only appreciate him for. 
Takeru was a crybaby on adventure 1, but he get developed well in adv 2, becoming much level-headed and not being crybaby anymore. Despite being nice, there's a time when we can see his anger because of something traumatic of him. It had a burden of not being able to overcome the trauma. But eventually he could do it well. 
Ken, the former kaiser, was unexpectedly first a villain which later become the protagonist, but apparently, he's not that evil and tyrant. His back story were very sad and making it sympathetic. Deeper psychological problem goes to him. After being freed from being kaiser, he only thought that he's not forgivable, and just being depressed. Fortunately, he eventually can overcome that feeling and become developed really well. 
Iori is a kid with more level-headed person. He had a trauma of being left by his late father because of accident in his job as an officer. Somehow, he's still being childish and couldn't control his emotion well. He did developed well eventually, despite not much changes of him. Things got more complex with Iori when he found the truth of his father's relation. 
The rest of characters are good just the way they are. However character like Miyako seemed annoying, despite she had done some best job in a few moments. I have no comment for Hikari, but she's just so so. Most of old chosen children had developed well too. 
 
The villains are much better than cliche adventure's. They have their own reason of why they become the bad one. I really appreciate that the series can made the watcher being sympathetic for the villains. However, the last villain was a degradation, and not enjoyable. 
 
Music: 9/10 
As usual, digimon series are very well-known of their epic music. Opening was catchy enough, ending was nice as well. Soundtracks are good enough, but the thing that I really like was the insert songs. Break Up and Beat hit are epicness, fitted the evolution scenes really well. Bokura no Digital World was so good and memorable. 
 
Art: 8/10 
I have no comment for the general art, but they did really well with the 3D CG evolution scenes especially for imperialdramon.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
I still enjoy it as if I was still a kid, but it went down quite a bit when I found the big flaw on the plot. But I enjoy the characters very well also the epic insert song. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
Despite the degradation of the plot of the story, it still did well. However, I can still think that a connected story or second season of same story of digimon isn't that needed. Thanks for reading my review.

Story: 
 
Heavily influenced by Japanese culture, and in some cases newcomers might not understand, but it does not affect the plot too much. Otherwise, I'd say the plot is something new, and very intriguing.  
 
The symbolism is nice, but I don't want to spoil so that's all I'll say. 
 
 
Art: 
 
The animation is truly great and not very choppy at all.  
 
I very much like how they mostly stuck to natural hair colors in here. The characters were attractive, I don't know how you could think Izumiko looks bland, it's quite obvious this anime is heavily influenced by modern day Japan, where at school you cannot dye your hair *cough, cough* 
 
 
Sound: 
 
The voice actors have nice voices... The songs are great as well.. 
 
I don't really have a problem with, except for the scene where the father is talking in English with an American, but the American's accent was very thick and it was a little hard to understand him. 
 
 
Characters: 
 
When it started off, I HATED Izumiko as well as Miyuki. However, as I went through the series, I began to warm up to her and notice her changes. I thought Izumiko found herself and what she wanted. So basically the character development was beautiful. Miyuki was a little bratty at first, but after time, you see different sides of him as his bond with Izumiko strengthens. alsohischaracterdesignissuperhot 
 
The villains weren't evil for no reason, which was interesting. 
 
One thing I disliked was the similarity in names like Honoka and Hodaka or Masumi and Manatsu, who happen to be twins/ triplets (along with Mayura). 
 
 
 
 
I'm very excited about the manga and hope this gets another season, I like the direction this is going.

          
 
       Helpful Stories aren't always about narratives. Sometimes, we can discover more ideas by ourselves if we put our efforts through. And of course, discovery comes from experiences. For a certain shy and dull looking (I think she's cute though) girl according to her peers, she's about to experience some whole new changes in her life. 
 
Her name is Izumiko Suzuhara, the Red Data Girl. 
 
RDG: Red Data Girl is an anime series adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Noriko Ogiwara (The Good Witch of the West). Her talent of writing involves in the field of fantasy and supernatural so expect some of those themes from RDG. Otherwise, P.A. Works handles the production of the series. They are known for their usages of serene visuals and clearly does not disappoint; at least in the art department. However, the experiences I got out of this series is not exactly enthralling or exciting. In fact, it was something quite different. 
 
In essence, this series is like a fantasy but takes place in modern times. The time period it takes place seems to be normal and likely perspective to our very own 21st century without high tech gadgets or space cars. Rather, it is a normal and typical school life setting in a modern civilization of development. Suzuhara Izumiko is the main female protagonist in this and she's always been shy. Even from the first episode, it's easy to pick out from the fact that she has a hard time socializing with others or being part of a group. It's not too surprising though by her nature considering the fact that she has been raised in the mountains. Or rather, Suzuhara has been associated with the Tamakura Shrine and along with her miko outfit, we can consider her to be a shrine maiden.  
 
The series spells out some confusion and mystery. For example, Suzuhara seems to have a strange power that lies dominant in her and these powers are let out when she is near technology. This is proven when electronic gadgets she comes in contact with results in destruction. Additionally, her glasses when removed seems to gave her visions of the supernatural, or otherworldly beings. From an initial standpoint, it's hard to tell anything by how these powers came to be. For one thing, we know that it's some sort of ability and very likely has a connection with Suzuhara's origins. It spells out mystery and the viewers' curiousity may peak from some of these aspects; at least I know I did. Regardless of her strange abilties though, Suzuhara enrolls to Hōjō High School in Tokyo where her life becomes more normal. At least, that's what she originally hoped. 
 
Then on the opposite of the globe is Miyuki Sagara. This guy is essentially introduced as a prick. His attitude is literally a bully by the way he talks to Suzuhara and behaves around her. For whatever reason, Miyuki seems Suzuhara as a nuisance and more so because he is assigned to be her protector. Luckily though, their relationship seems to get better and possibly even go on the road of romance. It's at least not in the friend zone section but the two definitely has some engaging moments. These moments are captured by their dialogues and some development, especially after a certain event that reveals an even deeper secret of Suzuhara. 
 
The secrets in this series also reveals some other aspects with the character cast. Take example, Mayura Sōda who is known as a cherry girl with friendly demeanor. However, she has more secrets and particularly gets caught in a rivalry among the school grounds. Among other factors, perhaps the biggest secret revolves again with Suzuhara. We learn that there's a supernatural vessel within her. It could be something related to a divinity or a goddess. We don't know too much about it but it has connections with her origins and the mysterious powers that she possesses. Unfortunately for her, she knows little about her origins herself or those powers. She does have a knight in shining armor though. But even so, Suzuhara still can't live the normal life a young teenage girl. With the ability to destroy electronic devices through an unintentional or intentional touch, she won't ever be able to use iphones, listen to ipods, or watching anime on a computer like most people. Damn, shame. 
 
Among other factors, there's the serene like atmosphere that is constantly present in the show. The mountain atmosphere gives off a fresh scent of the settings and brings out a sense of realism in Tokyo that makes you feel right at home. The way some of the structures are designed as well to fit within the traditional Japanese ways. Needless to say, it presents its Shinto themes in the right direction. After all, Shinto is considered a spirituality and in Tokyo, there are many practices that establishes connections between them. In RDG, we can see some of the way the characters are dressed, the monuments, the festivals, the clear mountains, and shrines that are all over the place. The school itself is traditional and consists more of the modern atmosphere rather than anything too out of place. 
 
Unfortunately, the show is hard to grasp and connect together. There's a lot of confusion among the characters and what's there. The plot itself is also a bit loose and I find it dull at various occasions. The Shinto atmosphere might also not fit well for target audiences. In fact, RDG is more the type of the show where we have to expect the pace to start off slow, flow smoothly, and hopefully wrap up in a tolerable way. However, I find the pacing to be a bit intolerable. At many occasions, I find that the plot itself to be just too dull. It tries to present its story with a mythical narrative that plays along influences of the Japanese culture. At the same time, the way it executes it is not so exciting. Unless of course you're really interested in the Asian culture along with Japanese traditions, Red Data Girl may not be for you. However, there are instances though that I find the series to be interesting. The title character Suzuhara keeps her innocent outlook and seems to be on the side of a 'coming of age' drama. She is the 'miko' and host of a powerful divinity.  
 
But for some things to care, there are the visuals. P.A Works handles the production of this series and the artwork gives a definition of beauty. As mentioned before, the artwork aesthetics gives the details to the surrounding atmosphere as well as the nature of the series. There's the mountain, the shrines, the outfits, and even spirits to match traditional Japanese ethnics. Of course, Suzuhara herself is drawn as a plain girl with the nerdy glasses and braids to match her statue. For one, I am pleased that P.A. Works is involved in this as it gave me a nostologia of Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari; at least in terms of visuals. 
 
As for the soundtrack, the series maintains a balanced rhythm. It's nothing too special to take notice of as most of the time, the OST remains smooth and light. There's no intense beats or rock. Rather, there's this linear pace of natural sound. The OP song ""Small worldrop"" by Annabel is sung with a smooth voice and at the same time shows some possible foreshadowing. Then, there are the ED songs that plays off the traditional themes again. In the song itself, we can see that Suzuhara is walking as in a possible reference to her development in a modern coming of age/fantasy story. 
 
Ultimately, I'd say this series is a gamble to watch. Some people may like the serene backgrounds along with the spiritual vibe that gives off while watching the show. Then of course, there are others who may be bored out of their lives of trying to figure out what is going on. Then, there are the folks who watches the show to pass time. It's a tough gamble but I hope it'll play well for you. Now, phew that was a lot of data to absorb, or rather info.

          
 
       Helpful When I watched some other works from PA Works, I really liked their way to draw so I started to get interested to RDG: Red Data Girl. 
 
I didn't really look at the plot(I didn't like to do that back then) so I was rather surprised about the story. A shy girl being the last vessel of the Himegami based on the Shinto Legends. and i didn't know anything about Shinto. 
But no I did not get disappointed, like some other users i've seen writing about this. It was really interesting but yeah, a little bit confusing. 
 
The art is nothing I can complain about. It's really beautifully drawn and the sceneries are great. I fell in love with the art. There's absolutely nothing to complain about. it gave off a really relaxing feeling. 
 
The sound was really awesome. I liked all the OSTs and the opening and ending was awesome. Izumiko's voice in ep.3, ep.5 and ep.7 was so pretty. The song was relaxing. I have never complained about the sound when watching the anime from PA Works. 
 
The characters are well-designed, really pretty. But not so unique i would give it a 9 or 10.  
 
I really enjoyed this anime. This is one of the best spring 2013 anime in my opinion.  
But I understand why people disliked this. Too rushed and too confusing.  
I read the manga and novel after watching this, and i noticed they skipped out ALOT of details. It would have been so much better with more episodes than 12. It wasn't enough and they skipped out explanations and all kind of things. A little bit disappointing, i would say ^^. 
 
Overall, this anime was really good but I feel like the romance was a little... weird?(not the right word) 
I mean it felt like Miyuki just suddenly was like ""oh so apparently i like her"" or it's just me missing something. The novel had more romance on. xD 
 
This anime is worth watching unless you hate getting confused. 
I'll give this anime a 9/10. I was thinking of giving it an 8 but it really is worth a 9. 
 
By the way, my bad for making no sense ._.

Now let’s get to the actual review 
 
This anime is, first and foremost, about the atomic bomb. It’s also about a bunch of other stuff, mostly actual psychology. By that, I mean the anime is deeply concerned with humans, their emotions and how they view the world. It doesn’t stick philosophical jargon in the dialogue or has trippy imagery in order to insist how important it is. The situations demonstrate ideas, and psychology rears its head in character actions and thoughts. 
 
We need to talk about the bomb first. The general stort you hear in the West is that America is Big Bad mostly because it’s powerful and has a lot of money (As much as I love Star Wars, people watch it too much). Therefore, if they dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese then the Japanese are automatically innocent. They haven’t done a single bad thing in the war but were hapless victims of humanity’s worst weapon. 
 
Of course, that’s not the actual story. Read about the Rape of Nanking, about Unit 731 and the Kamikaze. Japan was one of the main reasons why that era is humanity’s darkest hour. Thanks to the atom bomb, though, Japan could feel like a victim for a while. Victims don’t bear responsbility. They’re passive. Things are being done to them. The atom bomb saved Japan from the position of villain they might’ve been placed in once Unit 731 and Rape of Nanking were exposed to the world. Sure, you can buy books about these subjects but what do you hear about more – the Holocaust or these incidents? Germany was the loser, but Japan was the victim. 
 
Shonen Bat and his victims mirror this. Notice how American-looking Shonen Bat is. The baseball bat is a distinctively American symbol, belonging to the country’s most beloved sport. The manner of his dress – the hat, the hoodie is also more common in American than Japan. Furthermore, he has a peace sign on his hat (which was originally the anti-nuclear symbol). How he acts is by targeting people who are cornered, some innocent and some are not. By beating them up, they become victims. He releases them from that stressful position, whether it is being a bully, juggling identities or a big debt. Oh, and his name is very similar to ‘Little Boy’. 
 
Maromi symbolizes Japan’s obsession with cuteness. Many took it as a criticism of that. Supposedely after the war the Japanese escaped to these cute cartoons and figures. They rely on them for solace and escapsim. Its type of cuteness is called ‘yurui’, which tends to mean bumbling and mild. Japan was turned into ‘yurui’ after being devastated by the war. All the people who got beat up become like this. They become passive, smiling, mild and without much content. They vanish after Shonen Bat releases them from their victimhood. 
 
Maromi isn’t a total rejection of that aesthetic. In the last episode Maromi fights Shonen Bat. Maromi represents hope. It may be false one, but it’s some kind of hope. He came from a pet dog. Shonen Bat, on the other hand, is a weapon whose purpose is total erasure. These are two different things. 
 
Cuteness isn’t just an escape. It’s a total rejection of war and its stomping aggression. The problem isn’t in cuteness itself but how it becomes a slave to the technological aggression. By that, I don’t mean that Paranoia Agent is luddite and that it takes an anti-technological, nature-only stance. 
 
It does take a look at how a deeply technological society, how humans’ attempts to build their own worlds cause isolation. The show opens with dozens of people rejecting others using their phone. The origins of Maromi are in the death of a dog by a car – a device integral for big city life. The work and school complexes put big pressure on their subjects. A failure at work doesn’t get help in improving himself, but his superiors constantly bully him instead of letting him go. A kid who’s used to being number one can’t imagine being anything else. The atom bomb wouldn’t be possible without a huge military complex. 
 
It’s not impossible to use technology and cuteness for connection. The only people Shonen Bat rejects are a group of suicidals who meet thanks to the internet. It’s their connection that keeps them from being cornered. The possibility of suicide sets them free, and it gives them a better escape than anything Shonen Bat does. They work for their death and find human connections through it. Everyone else is trapped in systems they can’t exit. 
 
Maromi isn’t free of the work system. It has appropriated him, turned him into another device. Now the people behind Maromi puts tons of pressure on Tsukiko to design another character and for the producers to get the show on time. The people behind the symbol don’t follow its idea. Neither the consumers – they storm the stores, instead of relaxing with the little plushie they have. 
 
Such ideas about the nature of work and how it leads to pressure may promote laziness. The anime doesn’t. Work is necessary, and we do see the police officer who works two jobs so he’ll wife will be okay. Here’s why Shonen Bat doesn’t go after him. Like the suicidal three, the police officer has a way out. He forms connections with both his co-worker and has a wife to come home to. 
 
They say Japan has a high suicide rate and puts a lot of pressure on their students and workers. That doesn’t sound like a culture that follows the ideas in cuteness. If the above statement is true, Japan isn’t one big child. Rather, it’s a man whose had so much pressure put on him that only a state of victimhood can give him escape. It’s not just a mirror to the atom bomb, but how the Japanese culture is too harsh on its subjects and encourages them to be victims. 
 
The world in Paranoia Agent isn’t full of privileges, with problems existing only in the characters’ heads. It paints the modern world as claustrophobic. Social circles trap you in their gossip. Workplaces beat you when you fail but don’t let you go. Even the glory of being the best is trapping. In a society that has few options, victimhood is a way out. That’s very similar to war. If you can’t win, at least be a victim. It’s better than to lose. 
 
You’ll hear often how weird the anime is, but that’s beside the point. Yes, the anime isn’t exactly linear. It blurs the lines between fantasy and reality in the last episodes. It’s never from a conscious desire to be weird. The anime locks on its themes. By the time episodes with unrelated characters arrive, it doesn’t feel out of place. Since the episodes are connected themetically and progress the ideas, they feel like necessary part. Paranoia Agent doesn’t rip the traditional structure for the sake of it. It has a structure of its own because that’s how it expands on its themes. 
 
is the sort of brilliant narrative that doesn’t just define why anime is a worthy medium. It’s a brilliant piece of hard that’s worth your time regardless of what you like. It may be deeply concerned with the Japanese experience, but the atom bomb is a subject that should touch all of us. We’re talking about the worst weapon in the history of humanity. It also connects this to the universal human experience. Don’t let the tags of ‘experimental’ scare you. It’s accessible as it is brilliant. 
 
5 plushies out of 5

          
 
       Helpful Paranoia Agent - 8/10 
 
I loved this show, it was a nice sip of fresh air after watching a few not-so-interesting titles. Good things about this show include an interesting visual narrative and art direction. Often it uses visual elements to narrate the story rather than using dialogue, although it also uses dialogue to narrate the story, but the important details are hidden in lots of non-important info which makes it feel like a detective movie, you pick up interesting details or not and then understand what it meant later. 
I don't think i even have to say anything about Soundtrack in this anime. It met my expectations (expectations from the composer Susumu Hirasawa, whose music i had the pleasure to listen to while watching the original Berserk TV) completely. Now i was very dissapointed by the actual plot of this show. It's very simple, albeit it has a message to it (SPOILER: Face Your Problems : END SPOILER) 
Aside from that the plot remains a mystery until it's simply dumped through info, you can guess what is going to happen from visual clues and foreshadowing if you have experience with anime, but it is still very intriguing until the end. There is also a ""weird"" factor to the plot, since it starts off in a very realistic setting, and ends in something that is rather surreal and the ending while being open to interpretation is written pretty badly in my opinion. (SPOILER: Happy end was forced, then the very last bit of the last episode hints that nothing is over, since it's the same exact scene from the first episode, but it's still in my opinion is way to forced into, it should've ended when the police officer exited the metro and found ruins of the world :END SPOILER) 
In short, the ending could've been good and reminiscent of End of Evangelion but it went that extra bit to further conclude things, yet leave them open-ended still, which makes concluding things absolutely useless. The writing and dialogue however, suffer no problems what so ever, it is entertaining and interesting, however if we are going to cherry-pick here, all the characters are way too clueless, if a killer was on the loose everybody would be a bit more serious about the situation, but this may be the very definition of ""Syouganai"", so take that as you will. 
The Suicide Trio episode is an awesome example of how narrative can make something rather simple (SPOILER: they were dead, but they ran away in their minds, thinking they are alive (wtf) : END SPOILER) because it showed things without explaining them, and only hinting at an explanation in the end. 
But enough about plot. 
Character Design is while may not be everyone's cup of tea, and the average SAO watcher will find them ugly while the average Studio Ghibli movie watcher will find them very reminiscent of movies like ""Spirited Away"", personally i found them pleasing and refreshing, it was nice to have each character was very different from each other, and that character design linked to the narrative in a way, hence all the characters looked like the typical person of their personality would, and whether you find this good or bad is entirely up to the viewer, i've found it to be both good and bad in certain situations. The quality of animation is great, but if you're getting the Blu-Ray be aware the remaster is not of very good quality, all the edges are very blurry which creates an illusion of low resolution picture, however those very same effects are generally used well to visually narrate the story and to create somewhat an atmosphere. Atmosphere, is what this show really lacks, since all the episodes are about different characters they have very different takes on the story, and consistency is not big enough of a thing here to create an atmosphere, save for maybe the 13th episode, but even that kept shifting around two different places. 
I think i covered everything there is that needs attention. 
The plot is simple and needs no analysis, if you have watched the show and missed anything just rewatch the last episode.

To begin, all human beings have a viewpoint of all shapes and sizes. But there are times when someone can be cornered into agreeing on something so he or she can please others. Regardless of the situation, a person will eventually form his or her own opinion and draw a conclusion about something but not everyone will agree. And then... 
 
 
Review #73: 
Paranoia Agent 
 
 
In the country of Japan, there seems to be an elementary school kid that is known as Lil’ Slugger (Shonen Bat in the Subtitled Version) and this mysterious enigma has been going around attacking people with his bent, golden bat. After Lil’ Slugger’s first attack, two detectives are investigating this case so they can stop this kid from making any more attacks, but they will find out soon enough... that this case is much more than they expected. To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse production and they really are known for high production values. I’ve said this before in previous reviews when the name Madhouse is brought up. This is to be expected most of the time. With Paranoia Agent, this series looks incredible but there are some hiccups somewhere along the way. This is also Satoshi Kon’s only TV series and even though the budget in this show isn’t enough to make a movie. There were some unused ideas that were never implemented in his movies and he decided to recycle these ideas and put them into Paranoia Agent, and this is quite interesting. Like his previous works, the blending of fantasy into reality really hits in this show (well for the most part). What is also used very well is the show’s foreshadowing and it sure knew when to keep things mysterious. But regardless, the animation is done pretty well and it is even a little mind-screwy with good reasons. The music by Susumu Hirasawa is pretty damn incredible. The electronic and techno beats serve the show well and the soundtrack can be a bit eerie at times as well. And this eeriness to the soundtrack is a perfect way to compliment everything else in the show. Since this show exploits the characters’ weakness and proneness to anxiety and fear, the way the soundtrack compliments all this is pretty impressive. Hirasawa-san struck all the chords when needed and he does not disappoint. If there is one thing about the soundtrack that is awesome, it is the opening theme “Dream Obsessional Park”. This opening theme sounds incredible and the opening looks incredible to some extent. The closing theme does sound calming compared to the opening and it does serve as a nice contrast to the opening theme. Either way, Hirasawa-san made a fantastic soundtrack to Satoshi Kon’s only TV series. When it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is really good. Daisuke Sakaguchi is great as Shonen Bat, Mamiko Noto is also great as Tsukiko Sagi. Also, Shozo Iizuka is terrific as Keiichi Ikari and Toshihiko Seki was also terrific as Maniwa. There are a few well-known seiyus and I guess that can be nice. As for the English Dub, it is really REALLY GOOD! Sam Regal is a very deceiving voice to hear as Lil’ Slugger but it works. Michelle Ruff is terrific as Tsukiko Sagi and one of her best roles even though she doesn’t play a “normal” character. Carrie Savage is also phenomenal as Maromi by having a cute voice for the stuffed doll as well as giving the viewer some eeriness. Michael McConnohie was also phenomenal as Keiichi Ikari and even Liam O’Brien lands a home run in this one. Even some voice actors and voice actresses that aren’t big names performed very well in the dub of Paranoia Agent. Not a single voice was off. Paranoia Agent has one of the best English Dubs. Period. Jonathan Klein’s ADR Direction in Hellsing was outstanding, Paranoia Agent is probably the best dub he has directed. You can’t go wrong with either version but I strongly suggest the dub as well before or after you watch the subtitled version. As far as characters go, this may be the hardest thing for me to talk about when it comes to Paranoia Agent. The way the show is being told is that each episode is being told in a specific character’s point of view. For example, The first episode is told from Tsukiko Sagi’s point of view, she does appear in later episodes but these specific episodes aren’t mainly focused on Tsukiko. As the show progresses, we learn more of the people who are involved with the Lil’ Slugger incidents and we even get to see their dark sides which actually make the show thought-provoking. This is a very psychological show and this does feel like a character study, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It surprisingly has a plott that connects even though the episodes are mostly about the character and that character’s point of view and that it feels non-linear in some sort of way. Is it perfect? No. There is one episode that I did find pretty pointless at times but it still wasn’t too terrible I just wish it was told differently than what is being presented in the complete version that is before us. There is a little hiccup with the storytelling and that’s one flaw with Paranoia Agent. When the show brings questions, it’s thought-provoking. When it’s eerie, it may make you feel a little uneasy. When the show reveals things, you will probably be surprised. The show does live up to its name and what I really like about this anime is that it is thought-provoking to the point that it may even make a viewer like me want to question where my weaknesses are before I reach my breaking point. I think everyone’s had some ups and downs, but that’s kind of why I like this anime so much. The psychological aspect is realistic, the whole Lil’ Slugger thing is not… But I suggest you watch the show to get the answers because you sure are not going to get them from me. But if you must insist, I must ask you. Are you sure you want the answers you are looking for and are you willing to hear the truth when you have the answer? Sometimes, it is best that things go their own course without questions. Period. 
 
 
Paranoia Agent was available by Geneon. It is sadly out of print and this home run slugger really needs to get re-licensed one of these days. 
 
 
With all that said, Paranoia Agent is an eerie series. The show lives up to its name and it’s psychological elements are thought-provoking. The animation is fantastic, and the music is superb. The characters are very interesting despite a few storytelling hiccups. Despite all this, this is a must-see but it may not be for everyone so be on your guard. 
 
 
I give Paranoia Agent a 9.5 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!

It was decent overall, but just not anything as I expected it to be. They left a lot of things out and didn't explain much at all, so it kind of lost its spark for me. It was still enjoyable to watch, just... not as much as I'd hoped.

","The ova in air gear was amazing. I think it was made just to see how people would react to the ova and see if they wanted to animate the second season of air gear or not. It will definitely answer some questions for those who haven't read the manga but it will add a lot of more things to air gear where unless you read the manga you won't have any idea what the hell happened.

I am speaking strictly from the continuation of air gear it answered some things but still have lots of questions for those who didn't read the manga

Do I need to say anything all of the characters are amazing  
 
I would recommend you watch it 

          
 
       Helpful I really enjoyed these OVAs, the thing is they are way out of context. If you just finished watching the anime, read the manga until you get to this part otherwise you WILL be confused by this. If you read and follow the manga all the way through you'll understand this. Air Gear is a great manga and anime, but if you want to get the full enjoyment out of this you have to understand it, so i recommend before watching these catch up to the point in the manga before watching the first OVA, the next 2 OVAs jump like 80 chapters after that.

          
 
       Helpful ahhhh Air Gear: Break on the Sky.....on one hand, I like the fanservice, strangely, and found the battles to be quite enjoyable....on the other, I despise how poor the story is, how strange the are characters, and how this seemly came out of nowhere.  
 
Air Gear: Kuro no Hane to Nemuri no Mori or more awkwardly known as, Break on the Sky, is a collection of 3 OVA's that take place after the storyline of the animated series...I think; it looks like it is supposed to be more in tune with the manga which would explain why it didn't make a lot of sense. 
 
Essentially, it is about Ikki and his team, Kogarasumaru, trying to enter a tournament that will help them to reach the top of the trophaeum. Ringo, as a member of Sleeping Forest, is now an enemy of sorts, and the team, for some bizarre reason, has to fight the original Sleep Forest team.....in cyberspace...I am not joking. The story seems like an after thought because they clearly didn't bother to introduce the audience to a slew of new characters that I assume are from the manga. It feels like a vessel for a ton of pandering. 
 
Now to talk about something good, the art. The art is actually quite stunning and done infinitely better than the original, which is no surprise seeing we're comparing OVA's, made in 2010, to a series, made in 2006. The detailing of the characters looks great and where it really shines is in the aerial battles, which are undoubtedly the best part of the OVA's. Character's move fluidly, are well detailed, and fly around beautiful backdrops and settings. 
 
Music is typical, nothing that stood out really. It does fit into the whole ""Air Gear feel"" though which is nice. One thing I do have to mention is the laughably bad moments where the voice actors say a line like ""All for one and one for all."" in English; they clearly haven't had a lot of experience with English.  
 
It was strange for the producers to release an OVA that requires a fair knowledge of the manga. I've never read the manga, but I've seen all of the anime series; you would think that would be enough, right? The characters don't act like you would expect from the anime series because of this. Ringo is a lot more outgoing and Ikki is one giant douche....well more so than in the series. 
 
On a visual level, it is awesome and I'd definitely recommend it for that. I would say it's for the type of person that say, watches Highschool of the Dead for the reason it was made. If your looking for something deep and meaningful, avert your eyes.

So what to do with these potential psychic monsters in the making? Enter B.A.B.E.L., the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory, where hopefully ""The Children"" and others like them can become part of the answer to an increasing wave of psychic evolution. It's a win-win solution... Unless you're Koichi Minamoto, the overworked young man stuck with the unenviable task of field commanding a team of three pre-teen girls!  
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","In the future, as people with ESP increase in numbers, so does the possible good and evil they can cause to society. The Japanese government establishes of the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory (B.A.B.E.L.) a special esper organization tasked with dealing with situations that can't be resolved by ordinary means, including dealing with espers engaged in criminal activity. Kōichi Minamoto, a 20-year-old prodigy is assigned by B.A.B.E.L. to the task of supervising the most powerful espers in the country, a trio of gifted but mischievous 10-year-old girls known as ""The Children"": Kaoru Akashi, Shiho Sannomiya, and Aoi Nogami.
As the series progresses, The Children and Minamoto must deal with several enemy organizations, each with conflicted views regarding the role of espers in the world, including ""P.A.N.D.R.A."", a cadre of rogue espers determined to wage war against the rest of mankind, the ""Black Phantom"", a mercenary organization who brainwashes espers into living tools of destruction and the ""Normal People"", composed solely of non-esper individuals who view espers only as a threat to be vanquished.
","Let's start with my favorite parts of the show: The main Antagonist 
 
Kyosuke for me is interesting, he's cool, he's likable, he's funny, and I have never wanted to join the villains organization more than I want to join PANDRA, Even the members are awesome. 
 
Then there are the main characters in BABEL, now if I wasn't going to join PANDRA, and I was an Esper(#Esper_master_race), I would join BABEL maybe. That's because while I like most of the characters in BABEL, most of them should be fired or sent  to prison. The chief is the the absolute worst character in the show, he wastes resources and harasses 10 year olds. Then there's Sakaki, who while actually being a very likable, would be arrested for some of the things he does in the office. Then Supervisor Tanizaki, who was extremely creepy in episode 4, Tanizaki is the other worst character in the show.  
 
Then there's Director Fujiko, whose introduction could be edited out and it would change nothing, including her ability to drain other characters energy with physical touch, which was used in a pointless minute long seen that could be removed and change nothing. I actually do like Fujiko in some cases, but the first few episodes she's in are mediocre and in the grand scheme of things, pointless. 
 
Next let's talk about my one of my favorite characters in the, Naomi! 2 out of her three episodes in the show were amazing, and they all have the same premise, Tanizaki(the creepy guy) is worried about her, and our main characters spy on her to figure out what's really going on. Other than episode 4, these episodes are really good. 
 
Next let's talk about the main characters, Kaoru Akashi, Aoi Nogami, Shiho sannomiya, and Koichi Minamoto. These characters are really good, most of the time. The girls constant jealousy or attacks against Minamoto get annoying after a while.  Minamoto himself, if you look had him individually, he is very bland. The girls themselves are likable in their individual characters are very likable, especially Kaoru, who has to be since she is probably the most important character in The Children. Aoi is cute, but annoying at times, and Shiho doesn't really have a lot to her in terms of character in the beginning, but gets better as time goes on. 
 
There are also some some other characters who I really like, but we don't have time, we should move on to other parts. Let's talk about the music. I really love the music, even though I didn't like either of the opening themes at first but I grew to love opening 1, and like opening 2. I love all the endings, especially ending 3, I usually like female singers more than males, but I love the singing voice of Kouji Yusa(Hyoubu Kyousuke). 
 
Next let's talk about the animation. The animation while outdated, looks really good to me. There is one episode in collection 3 when they have a really fast paced fight scene and they sacrifice a lot of detail fr the movement is what it feels like. There are also episodes that have good artistic direction, and bad artistic direction, where for some reason they make the screen sideways, like it's meant for some kind of Fanservice, but really just makes you dizzy. 
 
Let's talk about the story, which the anime doesn't actually get to the main plot of the entire series till the end of collection 2. Now I'm not going to go too deep on spoilers, but there was a prediction of the future, and a select few characters are trying to prevent it in different ways, and realistically you know that it's going to happen because that would be anticlimactic. I like a lot of the events in the show that I personally like and though I really wish there was more of this show, because I really like a lot of the characters. 
 
The ending we're given is serviceable, even though the manga is actually still continuing today. I really think that in  few years we should get a remake that goes all the way to the more resent manga chapters, which in 2018 or 2019 the manga might be over. Now they could probably just remake the the whole series because not a lot of people have seen it, considering you can't really stream it anywhere legally, but I will say this show is worth buying, I rewatched several episodes in the show, but I would say that they should cut out some stuff in order to broaden its audience.  
 
Like they could sensor a lot of the loli stuff, and though I'm kind of against the idea, they could do an FMAB and have a filler that tries to introduce us to the characters and stuff in order to skip some of the other stuff, I'm against the idea though, because you'd probably miss out on many amazing moments and a few hilarious moments too, but I would understand trying to get to when they're in middle school as fast as possible though. 
 
I give this show my fullest recommendations to watch by any means necissary. I'd also like to have to possible remake to be licensed by funimation, becaused while they could never be as good as this Japanese cast, I would like it to be dubbed. The show is licensed by sentai filmworks and does not have a dub. It's also cheap to buy, which is another reason to buy it. I only spent 100 dollars on these four collection, and 25 on the spin off, The unlimted Hyobu Kyosuke. This show is known as Psychic squad on disc release

**Review Edited as of Episode 9** 
 
Well, it's odd i haven't seen a review of Zettai Karen Children yet. Well anyways.. 
 
Story: - 8.2/10 (B-) 
The story is about a trio of girls who have superpowers and save the world. Before you start accusing it of being like the Powerpuff Girls, i just gotta say this: The way they made it, it makes more sense than PPG. The first episode was hilarious, with Okami Muscle (Gay Muscle..? lol) just made me laugh in a good way. And Kaoru, man oh man she's hilarious. Acts like a perverted guy when it comes to boob sizes and weird fantasy stories. I really like this show already.  
 
Animation: - 8.6/10 (B+) 
The animation is really well made. With the entrance for the trio, and Muscle's er..flashy attack. Of course, i need to watch more to fully review it. 
 
Sound: - 7.7/10 (C+) 
It's not the BGM is awesome or crappy, sometimes it fits and sometimes it doesn't. But the Opening, &quot;Over the Future&quot; is at some parts, really well sung and some other parts, kinda annoying. Each break of the song, and the singer's voice is way high-pitched. Haven't heard the Ending yet though. 
 
Characters: - 8/10 (B) 
Well we have Aoi, Shiro, Kaoru and Kouichi so far including the members of B.A.B.E.L. So far, so good. Hopefully i get to see some new characters soon. Now that more and more characters 
 
Enjoyment: - 8.6/10 (B+) 
For now, i really like Zettai Karen Children. As someone who is easily turned away from fanservice, i thought that Zettai Karen Children would be just that, but i was wrong. I think everyone should watch this show. 
 
Overall (Averaged): 8.4/10 (B)

          
 
       Helpful A fairly enjoyable series which has either been watered down too much, or not enough. 
 
 
Overall - 6/10 
 
From the Animesuki thread, I read that the manga is more hardcore with blood and depth in comparison with the anime.  While I have not read the source material, I can already sense in the anime that things have been watered down to an extent.  This has all to do with the series airing at 10am on a Sunday.  I feel things are still too hardcore (i.e. targeted at Japanese Otakus) with the constant perv/service/loli references, to be suitable for kids. 
 
On the other hand, the general over-action of the BABEL boss, and the limiter de-activation scenes have certainly been created to make kids laugh and enjoy.  While I thankfully do not know the tastes of a hardcore Japanese Otaku, I found my attention span dropping in the scenes that are meant for kids. 
 
So where exactly does this series want itself to be placed? 
 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
The story follows the daily lives and missions of 3 children who are exposed to events that usually, only grown-ups can comprehend mentally.  Thus the events, missions, conversations and the experiences that the Children face are crucial in influencing the way that these children grow as characters.  It is known in the story that these Children have an almost equal chance of becoming ""good"" or ""evil"" when they grow up and I liked the latter episodes where the events may greatly influence their mindset. 
 
The style is standalone episodes with quick action and conclusions, but they follow a logical and linear timeline and the way they made it so episodic, yet so continueous in a smooth manner is commendable.  However, the time constraints per episode may have compromised depth. 
 
The scene is where a government organisation called B.A.B.E.L is responsible for policing and looking after espers, with their objective to show the world that both espers and non-espers can peacefully co-exist.  B.A.B.E.L. faces against both extremes, organisations that are determined to create a world ONLY for espers, and those who want a world without espers.  This creates a Gundam SEED-esque mess which I like because both sides have very ""human"" reasons for their opinions and objectives.  Such a setup also creates potential for depth and involvement.  All in all, the story has a very solid foundation. 
 
The series ends nicely, but with lots of loose ends that were left untied.  It seems to be implied that a sequel is possible, which would justify the loose ends. 
 
 
Art - 5/10 
 
Being a 52 episode season, one couldn't expect spectacular art due to budget constraints and indeed, the art and animation are nothing spectacular.  I found the art and animation to be of fairly average standard where nothing really stood out.  Animation had jerky moments but it was far from ""framelaggy"" as in the case of You're Under Arrest - Full Throttle.  The art does its job and is fairly consistent.  To sum it up, it was good enough. 
 
 
Sound - 6/10 
 
The music and sounds are  fairly repetitive and what can one expect from (supposedly) a kid's show?  I found the BGM to be fairly convincing and I definately liked the music where the limiter was deactivated.  However, not much else really caught my attention aside from... 
 
...Over The Future, the first OP.  The voices sound a little weird because it had been transposed up a minor third for the TV series - the full song has a lower pitch.  This song definately caught the spirit of the series and I really love the feel-good feeling.  I do question the use of *real* kids to sing this.  While it gives them opportunity to shine into stardom (and what a solid performance in the MV), this show screams ""Japanese Lolicon"" at times and I feel there's a moral issue.  The seiyuu's could actually sing this to an acceptable standard as heard on Youtube. 
 
I found the voicing of the characters to be very good, with excellent performances from cast of The Children - Hirano Aya, Shiraishi Ryoko and Tomatsu Haruka, all who have provided great performances in the past. 
 
 
Character - 6/10 
 
After the initial 10 episodes or so, when The Children are tamed down enough to be sent to school, I feel there was limited character development, save for Kaoru being subtly manipulated.  I felt that the episodes in the runup to the finale would have a real impact in defining Kaoru's future (and turning evil or not), which I throughly enjoyed. 
 
We however get to know the backstories of the major characters which were definately interesting and links in well with their current behaviour. 
 
If there is a second season, then I would feel that the limited development is justified, as Zettai Karen Children by its nature is a dragged out series. 
 
 
Enjoyment - 7/10 
 
I actually enjoyed this.  The dumb things and the abuse of power that The Children can get up to is just entertaining, including whacking people into walls, when there was a lesser option that is just as effective.  Watching the antics of moderately bad kids is definately funny.  Of course, I also got a lot of enjoyment from the story. 
 
However, I didn't really feel as involved (glued to the screen) as I could have done.

as for me it left something to be desired but it was truly a good series.

          
 
       Helpful BBB seemingly sets out to do one thing - entertain - and it certainly achieves that goal. There's not a huge amount of depth to this, no particularly deep characterisation or complex theme's and moral shades. It’s just a cool setting with cool characters doing cool things, and I can really appreciate that. You can sit down in front of BBB and your guaranteed to be entertained for the next few hours. And at the end of the day that’s really all one can ask from a media product. I'd suggest getting the first episode and watching that, if after the first five minutes your not interested then you might as well move along (its rather like Samurai 7 in that manner).

       Helpful To be an OVA, this anime is pretty informative in filling in gaps in the main season storyline.  It explains what Ban did immediately after the death of Elaine, how Meliodas and Hawk meet and start the Boar's Hat, and how Merlin healed the King.  The first episode is about Ban and Elaine. It just expounds a little more upon how they met and grew to care about each other before the attack by the red demon. The second episode is a series of shorts that fill in some backstory and side events in a humorous way. It follows around various characters from the anime and pretty much just pulls off gags, but is also pretty good at explaining some aspects of the anime that the main series didn't cover.   
 
It's nothing spectacular, especially if you've already seen the main series, but it is entertaining in its own right.  It's something that fans of the series should check out.

I do not hand out 10's easily and anything I rate 7 or higher I consider recommendation worthy. 
 
In my opinion it is necessary to watch BOTH Kanons in order to get a full appreciation of the series. So I will give my review for BOTH at the same time, comparing and contrasting what I believe to be the key advantages and disadvantages of each. I will be rating them separate however. Please keep in mind that one series is primarily drama while the other is primarily comedy. Because of this it is very difficult to accurately compare the two. Chances are that if you see people saying they liked one much more than the other, then they probably like that GENRE much more than the other. 
 
Story 8/10 
Despite popular opinion, it is actually the original story that has the better storyline. The stories of Nayuki (8/10 &amp; 4/10) and Shiori (9/10 &amp; 2/10) were not done very well at all in the remake. Neither was Makoto's (10/10 &amp; 8/10) as they attempted to make her story ending seem light, happy and even cute which significantly lowered the impact of it. Ayu's story (8/10 &amp; 9/10) was probably done a little bit better in the remake, though I liked the way they handled the story about the hair band in the original more. Mai's story (4/10 &amp; 10/10) was obviously done better in the remake, and is the remakes biggest attraction. The main thing that the original story lacks is humor, which Kyoto Animation makes up for with interest in the remake, giving depth to an otherwise flat main male lead. The original series started slowly due to the lack of humor, unlike the remake. However, the ending was done better in the original because they did a better job with Nayuki as well as added more importance to the accidents, which the remake glossed over a bit. A nice touch in the remake is the incorporation of Pachelbel's Canon in D as a minor theme for the series. 
 
As for the story in general, it wasn't really that original of an idea. Main male character returns to a town he lived in as a child, but he can't remember anything about his time there because of what appears to be a tramatic experience he had 7 years ago. He ends up spending part of the series trying to regain his lost memories of the time he spent there, and who he spent that time with. It's pretty much all been done before, but I strongly believe that something doesn't necessarily have to be completely original to be good. And Kanon was good, though you need to see both in order to better understand exactly what happened 7 years ago, and to understand why certain characters are the way they are. In other words Mai in 2006 and Nayuki and Shiori in the original, both Ayu and Makoto lack certain bits of important information in each series. Like it's predecessor, AIR, Kanon is at times very emotional. They don't call them &quot;cry games&quot; for nothing. There will be times when you will laugh (especially in 2006), there will also be times when you will cry (especially in 2002), and if you appreciate a good drama then you should find the series to be enjoyable from beginning to end. If I had to rate the overall story, then I'd probably have to rate it 8/10 for the original and 5/10 for the remake. Unfortunately the butchering of Nayuki and Shiori severely hurts my rating for 2006, otherwise it would have been 8/10. The original would have been 9/10 had Mai's story been done better. Also, Kanon had a more obvious haremish feel to it than AIR did, and had less flow between character arcs, though it didn't really affect my rating it may have if the review system worked with decimals. 
 
Art 4/10 
I don't think there can really be any debate here. The art for 2006 was much, much better than the original. The original had a very obvious h-game art style. The characters had very rough designs, though the detail was good. The backgrounds were dull and flat. Overall it seemed very early-90ish, which is a bit hard to handle considering it came out in 2002. Overall I'm being generous when I give it a 4/10. You would expect them to do a better job than they did. However, Kanon 2006 was extremely visually pleasing. The art is very reminiscent of AIR TV which is a very good thing. I love the way the background art was done. The scenery was spectacular, the skies were amazing. The attention to detail was stunning with an excellent choice of colors, color techniques and appropirately placed CG enhancement. As with AIR, the thing I liked most was the eyes. The way they combine CG effects with contemporary art to make the eyes shine like that is beautiful. Kyoto Animation gets full marks from me for art, 10/10. 
 
Sound 8/10 
The sound is pretty good for both shows, but 2006 definitely has the edge. The BGM were good for both, though I give 2006 the advantage in the theme song department. I loved Ayana's songs. Last regrets was powerful and beautiful and Kaze no Tadori Tsuku Basho was extremely catchy and uplifting. Flower and Floresence just didn't stir the same kind of emotions in me. The voice acting was good in both, the edge again going to 2006 mainly because of the one change they made from 2002 to 2006. The decision to change Yuuichi's seiyuu to Tomokazu Sugita was pure genius. His highly sarcastic tone was a perfect fit for a Key leading role. His interaction with Ayu's and Makoto's characters was pure magic. However, Makoto in episode 9 of the original was much better done than in the remake version. Overall I give the original a 8/10 and 2006 10/10 once again. 
 
Character 8/10 
The characters follow some of the typical Key stereotypes. Plenty of mo&eacute; provided by Ayu (very similar character to Nagamori in ONE, only difference is Ayu's mo&eacute;ness) and Makoto (sort of a cross between Nanase from ONE and Michiru from AIR, similar hairstyles too, again with added mo&eacute;ness), the quiet and seemingly unpersonable Mai (nearly identical to Akane from ONE in personality and looks almost identical to Nanase from ONE also), the childhood friend (in this case a cousin) Nayuki (sort of like Misaki from ONE personality wise) and the seemingly cheerful girl with a dark secret Shiori (similar to Kano from AIR) and of course the highly sarcastic (in 2006 anyway) main male lead Yuuichi which seems to be a Key trademark. I made no comparisons with CLANNAD, because unlike ONE and AIR it came after Kanon and thus had no influence on the series whatsoever (even though Jun wears a CLANNAD t-shirt in episode 13 of the original series, other things to watch for are ONE's Nanase making several cameos in episode 17 and 18 of 2006 and a Moon poster seen in the theater in 2006). Stereotypes aside though, they were great. Some were done better in the original (Nayuki 9/10 &amp; 2/10 and Shiori 7/10 &amp; 3/10), other were better in 2006 (Mai 7/10 &amp; 10/10, Makoto 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Ayu 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Yuuichi 2/10 &amp; 10/10). Overall I rate both an 8/10. This is due to the fact that the highly humorous nature of Yuuichi, Ayu and Makoto (as well as Akiko at times) in 2006 made it easier to watch. However, the characters in the original (despite having the same seiyuu) seemed more dramtic to me and better portrayed the more serious elements of the series. 
 
Entertainment 9/10 
The entertainment value for both series are high. The original's main source of entertainment is the more dramatic elements of the story, while 2006's main source of entertainment is the more humorous elements of the story. Depending on which you prefer it will drastically affect your opinion on which series is better. Also, a lot of people tend to like 2006 more because of Mai. As I said earlier, 2006's main shortcomings arc-wise were Nayuki and Shiori, who aren't nearly as popular as Mai. It is these 2 factors, combined with the difference in art, more than anything else that I attribute to 2006's much higher rating than the original. Maybe it was because I saw the original first, but I found that the story in the original was much more engrossing than 2006. Possibly the light atmosphere in 2006 made it easier for me to take breaks while watching, but when I watched the original I couldn't put it down. For that reason, combined with the effectiveness of the drama in the original I have to rate it a 9/10 for entertainment. It would have been 10/10 had Mai's story been done better. If you like sappy, slow paced drama, then you will love this series thoroughly. Even though I really enjoyed 2006, I have to rate it a little lower at 8/10 due to the fact that certain elements that I felt were key were missing. They did a marvelous job with Mai, but Shiori's story was confusing and Nayuki was completely glossed over. So i'm docking 2 marks for ruining 2 stories. 
 
Overall 7/10 
Though I rate them 7/10 for the original &amp; 8/10 for the 2006 version, it would actually be closer if I could use decimals. The original was more like a 7.5/10 for me. The remake was slightly better overall even though I split the category ratings 2 for each with one tied. The bottom line is; if you like drama more, then you'll probably like the original more, but if you like comedy more then you'll probably like the remake more. I tend to appreciate both roughly the same so I ended up liking both versions for completely different reasons and disliking elements of both versions for completely different reasons. In order to get a more complete story it is recommended that you watch both as the original did a poor job with Mai and the remake butchered Nayuki and Shiori. The main reason why most people like the remake more is because Mai is an extremely popular character, the art was much better and there was a lot more humor.

          
 
       Helpful Kanon 2002, the predecessor of our beloved Kanon 2006. Since Kyoto Animation released the remake of this highly acclaimed eroge by Key, the Toei Animation version has been overshadowed and underestimated. Is Kanon 2006 really that superior as many will want you to believe? 
 
Well, in my personal opinion, Kanon 2006 definitely surpasses its predecessor in almost every category, due to reasons that I will keep to myself, as this is a review for Kanon 2002 and not a comparative essay. But believe me, those two are not that far away. 
 
Kanon's 2002 story, although crammed in 13 episodes, is consistent and well developed, at least in a superficial way. You will realize at the end of the anime that many questions were left unanswered. Although they're not highly relevant, and would only serve as an aid to understand the story in a more in-depth manner. After you watch the first character arc you will realize what I'm trying to say. 
 
The artwork is not that bad at all, judging from the year, but what really gets on my nerves would be the exaggerated big chins the characters have. Trust me when I say that it's going to take you time to get used to seeing those abnormal chins throughout 13 episodes of 24 minutes, if you manage to control the urge of dropping the anime due to this factor. It is one of the major reasons Kanon 2002 is discriminated, and not without reason. It's just weird. 
 
The sound was average, nothing too flashy or too boring. They match well the mood of the anime, although the opening theme is kind of boring and monotonous if you ask me. Again, Kanon 2006 wins over 2002 because of this; it clear when you listen to 2006's opening theme. 
 
Character development, in my criteria, was where Kanon 2002 gains an upper hand. The character development, in my opinion, was very realistic. They behave in a more humanly fashion, and their emotions are really strong and human-like. You'll be able to witness love, fear and resentment that will let you sympathize and identify yourself to the characters. Personally, it is this factor that kept me sitting down in front of the monitor for about three hours straight, watching the last half of Kanon. 
 
Well, Kanon 2002 is a good watch, and probably is not going to disappoint you as many people will have you think. It's a very decent piece of work and deserves a good place amongst the innumerable drama anime we have out there. 7.5/10 I would have to say, but since decimals aren't available I'll round it up to 8.  
 
And as a small piece of advice: watch this one before 2006, it's going to boost your experience. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I apologize in advance of this review is too much of a series comparison rather than a review, but here goes. I watched Kanon 2006 first, and it is definitely my favorite anime of all time. The music, the characters, the voices (I'm partial to english dubs, sorry), and the atmosphere were all perfect and I didn't think anything could top it. Kanon 2002 was not as good (for the most part...I'll get to that later) as Kanon 2006, but if you watched 2006 first, which I recommend, then you will really be able to appreciate Kanon 2002. 
 
Story: It's Kanon! What could possibly go wrong? The story is the same as the visual novel and anime remake; Yuuichi Aizawa moves in with his cousin in a town he hasn't visited in 7 years, and he can't remember anything from his past visits. During his time in the town, he meets a bunch of girls who connect to his past and he slowly begins to remember what he forgot. 
 
13 episodes plus an OVA is a pretty tight schedule to tell all of Kanon in, but Toei did a pretty good job. They missed explanations on some important details, such as the way the title relates to the story, or Sayuri's 3rd person speech (which the sub I watched didn't even acknowledge). Overall the main arcs were handled pretty clumsily compared to 2006, but Mai's arc still shocked me at the climax, and Makoto's nearly brought me to tears, just showing how well written those two were. The one thing Kanon 2002 definitely did better than 2006 was Nayuki in the ending. In 2006, Nayuki was really important throughout the whole series, then gets completely shafted at the end when her arc comes about. In 2002 however, she is ignored most of the main series, until her arc comes. She's my favorite heroine by far, and I feel she came really close to the ending she deserved. Sadly I disagree with both series choice of which girl ""won"" (for lack of a better word).  
 
Overall, the story was great from a nostalgic point of view so 9/10 (I'm a fanboy sorry) 
 
Art: Kanon 2002's art style is infamous. There is a scene in Kanon 2006 in which Shiori draws a portrait of Yuuichi and he acts completely offended and repulsed by it. I like to picture that portrait as Kanon 2002's big chinned Yuuichi. Besides Yuuichi though, I think the art was rather good for what it was. I feel like the grainy lo-fi quality helped it gain sort of a nostalgic feel, and made the atmosphere a bit darker. I imagine it like this, listen to a band like Merchant Ships or I Wrote Haikus About Cannibalism in Your Yearbook, then listen to a band like William Bonney or Old Gray. They play the same style of music, but the production values completely change the atmosphere. 
 
Overall, art is 7/10 
 
Sound: Let's start with the voices. As I mentioned before, I'm partial to english dubs, but that doesn't mean I can't at least try to objectively evaluate the original Japanese version. That said, this had a pretty good dub. One thing I realized was that the English dub VA's had very similar vocal timbres to their character's Japanese counterpart. For example, Sayuri's VA's in both languages sound very similar, as does Mai's. The only ones that took some getting used to for me were Kitagawa and Nayuki. It's hard for me to see any blonde Visual Art's/Key character that doesn't have Greg Ayres' voice. As for Nayuki, the difference between Jessica Boone's interpretation and Mariko Kouda's interpretation if the character is more than noticeable. While I prefer Boone's voice for Nayuki, I can definitely appreciate Kouda's performance as well. 
 
As for the music, it was mostly forgettable. The only tracks that stood out to me were the tracks I recognized from 2006 (I really dig 2006's soundtrack), and the opening and ending themes, which were freaking phenomenal. 
 
Due to a mostly forgettable soundtrack, I have to give sound a 7/10 
 
Character: Oh boy, this is gonna be a fun one. I love all of Kanon's characters. Or should I say Kanon 2006's characters. Mai, Sayuri, Shiori, Ayu, Akiko, And Kuze were pretty much the same in both versions (though Kuze got way more screen time in this version than 2006). I feel there wasn't enough focus on Makoto until her arc, which was only one episode. Kitagawa felt kind of random and his personality shifted a lot. Kaori made a complete 180 at the end if Shiori's arc, as if someone magically flipped a switch that turned off her mean glands. Nayuki was pretty much ignored until the last 3 episodes, though they have her story a more proper conclusion in this one than 2006 
 
My biggest problem with Kanon 2002 is Yuuichi. He's barely a character. He's more like a vessel for the plot. In 2006, Yuuichi is quick witted, caring, a bit mean at times, but still an all around good guy. In 2002 they could've replaced him with a piece of toasted cardboard and the series wouldn't have been too much different. 
 
7/10 for characters 
 
Enjoyment: I'm a Kanon fanboy. Watching this version was almost like my first time with Kanon 2006 all over again, but through a nostalgic looking glass with a grainy filter that made everything that much more dark and melancholy. I'm a sucker for romance, and I love winter, and anything that's kinda dark in a bittersweet way (my favorite movie is Lost in Translation and I listen to shoegaze #sadbois4lyfe) so this was a great ride for me, despite all the criticisms I may have. 
 
For pure enjoyment, I give Kanon 2002 a solid 9/10 (for myself personally). 
 
Overall: I would recommend this, though I would recommend you watch Kanon 2006 first, then enter this one with and open mind. It's an emotional story and despite it's flaws it is a very touching series, regardless of which incarnation. 
 
Overall, I give it an 8/10. Now time to play the Visual Novel.

       Helpful This is one of those animes that was absolutely flawless in its execution... but doesn't let the story or characters be what we want. This is a drama + romance + school anime that isn't a fairy tail love story. Without spoiling in the end, all I can say is that no matter who you like in this anime, you will be broken hearted by the end.No spoilers so everyone can enjoy this review. :) 
 
Story: 10/10 
It was FULL of drama and romance at every turn, the epitome of what a drama romance anime should be. It doesnt have dull moments or pointless filler. However, just because I rate the story highly... its an awful story. I hate what happens. Not that the story is written poorly, its just that I can not stand what is happening. Similar to an anime like School Days or Clannad... where you dislike what is happening or what is happening to the characters but it is INTERESTING and you cant put it down. So I just want to get that straight... the story is 10/10 but what goes on inside the story is SO crappy, and I hated it.  
 
Art: 7/10 
It's fairy cute with a strong 2000s vibe - as it should as a 2003 anime. It's not awful and I enjoyed it (I love that 2000s art after all) but its nothing to hype over.  
 
Sound: 6/10 
Soundtrack is pretty much just background noise. It's alright, and pretty expected of the 2003 anime, but nothing special. I wouldnt mind listening to the soundtrack over again though. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Theres three main characters. I wont say who is who... but... One I LOVE. This character is perfect all around and enjoyable and likeable. The other two are disgusting and I hate for different reasons. HOWEVER, just because they are bad people doesnt mean they didn't play their role perfectly in this romantic drama, which they did. The reason horrible things happened in this anime was because of these two... no they didn't kill anyone lol. The characters are well developed and are solid characters... I just don't like them because of what they do. You'll know who is who after a while. XD 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I know I keep saying I hated this anime, well I do... but you cant always like what goes down in a drama anime. Especially when its paired with romance. The ending was completely painful and emotional... but it was the only ending that really made sense.  
 
Overall: 
This anime was enjoyed NO DOUBT... but I still can't believe all the things that happened... this anime is a must watch for hopeless romantics who want a deep PAMDS and to be emotionally scarred forever. Maybe not forever, but at least for a while. If you love drama and romance, this is a perfect anime. It is a 10/10 anime... and like I said absolutely amazing... but you'll hate what is happening and wish you could change it! But thats romance for you!  
It's too incredibly emotional for words and will make your heart go </3

       Helpful rumbling hearts. just watched it a little while ago and this really made me fucking sad and depressed as hell in a good way, this is pretty refreshing to me haven't watch an anime that is pretty moving and at the same time a story close to real life.  
 
rumbling hearts is an anime that  reminds me of how being an adult really fucks you up so bad and events in your life that you think is irrelevant at first could drastically change your life and shape you to a whole new person. plus it reminds me that the past will bite you in the ass.

rumbling hearts revolves around 4 ordinary students.  
 
Narumi - really nice guy. kind but too kind. guy that i'm sympathetic with. you won't get a hint of douchebaggery on him. his put with so much shit that he completely becomes insane in some point 
 
Mitsuki - athletic beautiful long haired girl. many guys courts her but he all refused them. Haruka's best friend. swimming prodigy champion been on news papers and expected to be on the Olympics when she graduates  
 
Haruka - fragile high-school girl who loves to read books. secretly in love with Narumi.  
 
Shinji - Narumi's bestfriend very supportive with Narumi. This guy is a bro. (BRO'S FO LYF MOTHAFOCKAZZZZZZ!!!!)  
 
they are all experiencing the so called rosy high school life, but it seems that having a rosy high school life sometimes is a pain in the ass when friends hides somethings from you, as they say too much kindness is cruel.

it's starts with Mitsuki befriending narumi and shinji to let Haruka become closer to Narumi, in the end Mitsuki succeeds after 5 freakin years and the 4 of them becomes inseparable. 1 day Mitsuki called out Narumi and said that she needs to say something important. narumi waited on his favorite spot, a tree in the back of his school with a really good shade and view, while waiting for Mitsuki.  
 
Narumi is thinking that Mitsuki might be confessing to him but rather than Mitsuki appearing, instead haruka appeared, narumi thought it will be a meeting of the 4 of them but instead haruka confessed to him narumi didn't answer. haruka started crying, then narumi remembered mitsuki's face as we now know that narumi really likes mitsuki but still said yes to haruka's proposal seeing Haruka cry, Mitsuki being the one who planned this for them, the poor bastard narumi can't really refused now since in narumi's head that's a sign that mitsuki has zero feelings for him and just sees him as a friend as kind as a person narumi is he accepts haruka feelings and moves on.  
 
but what narumi doesn't know is that mitsuki has feelings for him secretly. everything is fine and dandy and everyone is ready to move on but a certain tragedy occurred and that's where the shitstorm starts. 
 
while dating, narumi and haruka was supposed to meet in a certain place. accidentally, narumi bump into mitsuki and they had a little chit chat. like friends narumi teased mitsuki how is she with his boyfriend, mistuki answered that she has none and got no time for that, but she likes a boy who said that her hair should look good if it's shorter (which is not . F-U! narumi!!) then narumi said that he and haruka is on a date and haruka is waiting and natsuki told narumi that it's her birthday today they chat and chat and narumi said she'll just apologized to haruka and explained that it's natsuki's b-day today after all haruka had the same experience before about narumi being late because of natsuki asking for narumi's help and of course haruka will understand since natsuki and haruka has been bestfriend longer than narumi and shinji.  
 
narumi and Mitsuki kinda stroll a little bit and Mitsuki saw a ring being sold in the streets and joke around if narumi could buy that for her since it her b-day. narumi refused sarcastically but in the end he bought the ring for Mitsuki and they laugh and parted ways. while in the train-station narumi hurriedly  go to the meeting place where he and haruka is supposed to meet.  
 
Narumi was looking for Haruka he saw some people pilling up in a certain area, he saw an ambulance and kinda wants to see what happening there, worried, Narumi try to force himself inside the crowed while searching for Haruka, he shouted for Haruka's name but no reply then he saw the scene. he saw a phone-booth nearly crushed with blood all over the place and he saw a familiar thing a ribbon that looks like from Haruka then a paramedic confirms who was the victim and Narumi in his head prays that it isn't Haruka but when the paramedic read the school I.D it confirms that it was really Haruka.  
 
the 3 of them rushed in the hospital including Shinji. while waiting for any news Narumi blames himself for being late(that's why Japanese people are always in time) if he came in time or earlier Haruka wouldn't be in this situation. while Narumi is thinking like that, Mitsuki is blaming herself because if she hadn't delayed Narumi's date with Haruka this wouldn't happened.  
 
3 years has passed. the 3 of them has moved on. but unlike before there is something that change the relationship of the 3 of them. while Haruka is on a coma Shinji is kinda much more distanced with Narumi and Mitsuki. of course this will happened because Shinji is 1 of the guys that confessed to Mitsuki in her high-school days and got turned down. (to be clear Shinji confessed to Mitsuki when he heard that Haruka and Narumi is dating. BRO'S FO LYF MOTHAFOCKAZZZZZZ!!!!!!) and to give Shinji a reason to go far away as much as he can it's because that Narumi and Mitsuki has become lovers that it's so close that they are like wife and a husband. there relationship is so serious as fuck that it reeks with maturity and when I mean mature they work, they talk, they have sex,they support each other in a very mature way, YOU WON'T SEE ANY ECHHI HENTAI CLICHE SHIT ON THIS ONE. no daame!  Iyaaa!  Narumi-kun ecchi tehee! shit like that in this one. they ARE REALLY FUCKIN SERIOUS WITH THERE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
now for the reason why Mitsuki and Narumi got together, blame the parents of Haruka.  
 
Mitsuki is so broken that I wanna give her a hug shiiiiiittttt. she lost everything and the most broken character in the series. T.T 
 
now that's just a summarizes pretty much the story of rumbling hearts. 
 
rumbling isn't for everyone. i believe rumbling hearts is much enjoyable to watch if your age is on the verge of transitioning to adulthood or higher it will really make you connect with them but if you are old and jaded It can't do shit for you man. you watched to much real drama in real lyf. lol 
 
reaction and negative criticism: 
 
 rumbling hearts can be a masterpiece if they kinda make the scenes much more dramatic and other scenes should be more explained. like for example. the coma of haruka- they should have made a scene that haruka known the truth that it already passed 3 years now but she becomes unstable and her memory resets when someone tells her the truth. and that where narumi enters and haruka gets better and remembers more better when narumi visits and lies to haruka that it's only a few months since the accident. 
 
for an anime like this. it's pretty old like old as hell they use betamax tapes for this one and some viewers may not like it because of that. 
 
if rumbling hearts had a scene that kinda like in clannad that everyone turns back in time but not literally but just thinking of what if. what if Mitsuki was honest in her feelings in the first place. what if narumi confessed to Mitsuki. what if Mitsuki didn't bothered narumi on his date going to haruka. what if they are all in the same university. what if they are all the same like before scenario. 
 
not sure if the Bluray and the normal episodes are different but i suggest you watch the blueray one since it has the sex scene of haruka and narumi before the accident and that's pretty crucial. and some other sex scene on why akane hates Mitsuki.  
 
about Narumi visiting Haruka in the hospital. remember that he is doing this for months or even more. just think about that. that's why Narumi and Mitsuki is beyond their wits that they feel like going insane, scared ,pressured, responsible sometimes doubt i wasn't surprised when the two of them breakdown to the pressure. 
 
if rumbling hearts have a little bit of emotion squeeze on it and a scene like that just like Mitsuki is always saying this anime will surely be a masterpiece for me. 
 
special mention for Daikuuji YEAHHH Daikuuji for the win!!![/spoiler]

These specials have a crap ton of references to not only the special portions of the series and parodies them but also drags other anime into the mix as well. 
And it doesn't stop there, they even drag the voice actors into it. 
 
In terms of comedy and a job well done, these specials are far superior than the originals and I think I enjoyed the MC in this rather than the Holier-than-thou face-puncher-kun in the original series. 
 
rated the original series 6/10 I think, but the specials are a 9/10.

          
 
       Helpful This is a parody anime as you can see. This special produces a humorously exaggerated imitation of this anime. Without any reviews of this special on MyAnimeList. I'll just desperately try my best to write one for this... 
 
It reuses scenes from the anime, but it changes the navigation(I seriously couldn't think of any more words...)and made it like short comedy scenes. I like the VA jokes and it talks about the current status of this anime during the its airing. 
 
I'll keep it short and clear as always. It's funny, no actual plot, just comedy. Art style is the same but with a chibi Index. Character same as usual. I'll give it a 6.7 in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful If you're writing a gag special, then this is the one to beat. 
 
Gag specials usually suffer from overplayed jokes and poor art but not Index-tan. These two specials take scenes directly from the original anime and add comical twists to each one as their own independent skit. Along with taking scenes from the original series, the animation, sound, and voice acting are all just as solid too, if not better and more over the top at times. 
 
Index-tan is the first gag special that's truly made me laugh out loud, not just a few times, but over and over. The sound effects were one of the greatest additions to the humor, and added some fun off screen moments. 
 
Whether you enjoyed the anime or not, if you've seen the first season in full then I highly recommend watching these shorts!

One such child, Renge Miyauchi, the youngest of the group, looks forward to the entrance ceremony of the upcoming school year, signalling her entry into first grade and the beginning of her elementary school life. Attending the only school in town, Renge and her friends, seventh grader Natsumi Koshigaya and her eighth grade sister Komari, make the most out of their rural lifestyle, playing and studying everyday.

Nyanpasu! Are you ready to repeat the whole experience of relaxation in the countryside once more? I hope you are! Repeat is another seed planted on an already wonderful garden. And it's a sequel that has flourished into a daisy symbolizing the purity and innocence shared by Non Non Biyori. 
 
Asahigaoka. It may just be a small village, but it knows what purity is all about. Like an aromatic wave of petrichor after the pitter patters of rain, the lingering sweetness marks the cycle of pleasant experiences bounded by freshness and positivity. Many new adventures are awaiting them as the sun celebrates the time to rise and shine! For these blooming flowers, Asahigaoka is their special home. The country life is full of rejuvenating activities, and these children continue to enjoy each other's company while living in that simplistic joy. They play with the elements found in nature, from exploring the floras to gazing at the bugs. And they also interact and form new memories with one another, speaking volumes to the young and carefree nature they all have. Together alongside the nonchalant comedies, these aspects are able to produce a lighthearted spirit. It's only packed into a small circle of friendship but the expressed friendliness emits out an aura that will make anyone smile brightly. To be able to feel this much warmth, it's not everyday that you'll experience such a purified emotion. So let's cherish it. March along the path laid out by these girls. There's a soothing oasis waiting to greet us when we reach the end of the trail! 
 
Here we go! It's time to advance forward towards that refreshing sanctuary. Feel the freshness as we walk through the lush playground. With nature bringing a bountiful supply of life and love into the village, the entire place is decorated with a verdant beauty composed of hues chosen from a rainbow-colored spectrum. This palette paints a landscape with emotional attachments. And whether it takes place in the glassy daylight or the starry night-time, just embracing the pastoral setting is enough to cause many strong feelings. You can always feel the joy as you stand on Asahigaoka's ground. It's a reminder of all the harmonious and melodic qualities found in the outside world. Similar to the wafting wind that blows gently against our cheeks, the rhythmic music balances each scene together and reflects an image with soothing effects. It's no wonder why the girls of Asahigaoka can enjoy the rural environment. Their elation taking form with childlike personalities can be seen in the opening sequence, which serves as a great set up for the happy tranquility that follows on. All these genuine smiles are a bliss worth more than a thousand words. They are the treasured experiences. Not something to be forgotten through the four seasons, but something that will always live on as the days change and grow. After all, happiness is a paradise right? 
 
In this rural idyll, Repeat has blossomed into a daisy with its white petals and yellow disc floret. It represents the purity enveloping a warmth brought upon by the wonderful memories of Non Non Biyori. And together alongside other daisies, it will forever continue to spread its relaxation around.

          
 
       Helpful When you go about your daily life, what do you normally do?  My guess is, you either go to school, work a full shift at your work, or freelance your own kind of work in order to support yourself.  Either way, we're always busy doing something and not completely focused on just not doing anything.  So, what if we were to peer into a world where all we could do is relax and not think about what comes in the future, but focus of the here and now?  With its second season, we have Non Non Biyori Repeat.  (Technically this is marked as a side story, but I am still calling this the second season because its synonyms have be considered as a second season.) 
 
Story: If you haven't see Non Non Biyori before (which would be a mistake reading this review cause this is of its second season), basically, the story of this little slice of life revolves around the four main girls, Hotaru, Komari, Natsumi, and Renge, as they go day by day in the Japanese countryside playing around and nonchalantly having fun the way kids back in the day used to do, by going outside.   
 
With its premise being the exact same as its predecessor, Repeat changes up the formula for the entire series slightly but still keeps everything very much the same.  The only difference to come from this season and the original Non Non Biyori is the fact that the in Repeat, the show puts a little more emphasis on each character.  For a good majority of its episodes, Repeat focuses particularly on one of the four major members of its cast.  One episode may be devoted to Renge and her mini accomplishments in life, while another may focus of Natsumi and her status as a tomboy, or so on and so forth.  As a result, you get to see into each particular girl's life a little bit more contrary to before where you just saw two or more of them in every scene and they just sort of meshed together.   
 
In the end though, Repeat is still the exact same story.  Chronologically, it meshes with the original season, weaving the whole story together since the entirety of both seasons takes random points in time over the course of an entire year in order to present it as a show.  As a base idea, Non Non Biyori itself is the same as a horde other of other slice of life shows involving girls, with its main gimmick being that it involves itself in the countryside.   
 
But even though Repeat is in a sense, a rehash of Non Non Biyori again (because it literally is the same show with different scenes), there wasn't anything particularly bad about it.  It has a certain unique charm to it and plays to its strengths with its characters and setting.  And it also just gently comes to a close like a falling petal; it was a quaint little end. 
 
Overview: 
+ More Non Non Biyori (because that was a good show) 
+ Made some character focused episodes 
+ Good ending 
-  Kind of an overused idea (Think about how many anime there are about a group of girls) 
 
Characters: Characters in Repeat are literally the same cast as who you see in Non Non Biyori.  We still have the main four character, we still have Candy Store and all of the various sisters of Renge, and we still have Natsumi and Komari's mute Nii-san.  This cast doesn't change at all in the grand scheme of things.  They're all still the exact same character and there isn't much character development, if at all, for the entire series.   
 
However, what I did find interesting about the characters was the fact that while you don't get to see any true development with how they are as a person, you get to sort of get a glimpse on how they came to be.  Several episodes contain some ""backstories"", and showcase the progression of how something came to be like Renge's recorder, what life was like years ago when Renge was just a baby, and the true story on how the Koma-chan dolls came to be.  It showed how several things and relationships in the series came to be, and I found that to be which created a nice touch on the series. 
 
Overview: 
+ Good ol' same Non Non Biyori cast 
+ Backstory elements to see how things came to be 
-  No true character development 
-  Nii-san still does not say a goddamn word in this series (Personal Complaint) 
 
Art: Created by Silver Link once again, Non Non Biyori Repeat comes back to us with its ever bright and colorful world of the countryside.  Filled with detailed backgrounds, pretty, bright colors, and above all, quite a lot of interesting countryside stuff to do.  Like its first season, Repeat doesn't stray from what the animation wanted to do.  While the art is very nice looking, it doesn't take away from the show wants you to see and adds an aesthetic to the series rather than being the complete focus on what they want you to see.   
 
As this is a comedy series, Repeat also utilizes a lot of exaggerated expressions and overdramatic scenes in order to capitalize on the current moment at hand.  However, contrary to a lot of comedy series that utilize this, Repeat doesn't completely capitalize on it and mostly stays the same with its normal animation even when it goes to that extreme.   
 
Overview: 
+ Nice, simple artwork 
+ Consistent quality 
+  No overuse of overdramatic tropes.   
 
Sound: Like a lot of Slice of Life anime, the songs that are used for the series aren't really all that memorable.  Because they use the soundtrack to compliment the tone of the series, the songs usually are quite lackluster in terms of a wow factor or memorability factor.  As such, Non Non Biyori Repeat follows this similar trend by having two, while nice and calming songs for its OP and ED, aren't particularly noteworthy.  They sound nice and fit well with the tone of the show on account of its lightheartedness and nonchalant sound with recorders, light instruments, and overall upbeat tone, but there isn't anything about it that's going to particularly stick in your head like glue.   
 
Personal Enjoyment: Non Non Biyori Repeat was well, exactly the same show as Non Non Biyori except you replace the entire series with completely new scenes.  There isn't any progression in the series as everything still follows the exact same year of school, and there wasn't really anything outstanding about how the series presented itself, but that's the charm in this whole thing.  It was meant to be simple, it was meant to be calm, and I loved it for those reasons.   
 
Did I enjoy this series? 
 
Yes, I did.  While it's not the most complicated thing that I've ever watched, its simplicity was a virtue.  Every little character interaction, every antic Natsumi or Renge got into was fun in its own right.  I come out of this season with several new favorite scenes and there really wasn't anything I didn't like about this series. 
 
What didn't I like about this series? 
 
Nothing, I'll be honest.  While there are a couple technical issues for the show seeing as it was actually a rehash of the same show, there wasn't anything that I would outright dislike about Repeat.  It was fun to watch and it was peaceful and enjoyable; I have no complaints, period.   
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
If you want a relaxing series that isn't all that thought-provoking, Non Non Biyori is the series for you.  (Although, if you want to watch Repeat, I would at least say watch the first episode of the original Non Non Biyori first since that is the sort of background for the entire show.)  It's a very relaxing show that doesn't have too much beyond its simple ""kids playing in the countryside"" story but it doesn't need it.  Sure, it's like a whole lot of other shows but I still think if you're curious about it, give it a chance to cleanse you of any troubles you may have.

He appears at dusk where children gather and recites sinister tales based on Japanese urban legends, to which his young audience eerily intakes. However, the Storyteller is no ordinary teller of tales. He incorporates a kamishibai, a traditional paper-scrolling device, to add visuals to his already demented narration. 
 
A series of short horror stories,  Yami Shibai  begins with a bachelor who, after moving into a new apartment, immediately starts sensing a malevolent glare being pressed into him. A single talisman rests on his ceiling, but he has no way of knowing it is one of the few safeguards that separate him from a bottomless pit of suffering. Each story is more terrifying, more appalling, and more sickening than the last as the Storyteller's audience find themselves being sucked into the vicious world of his words. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","Remember those ghost stories your uncle told you when your parents left you at his house for the night so they could have a good time? Well here are those very ghost stories in anime form. 
 
I would like to start with the anime art style yes it is quirky but it fits the mood of the narrating and actual story as well as that when the characters do speak the actors who play the characters sound like they are actually very terrified so all due props to them for doing such an excellent job at acting.  
 
If you are looking for a short 5 minute anime with quirky art style and great voice acting then this one is for you.  
 
As for scary ""meh"" i did not feel it to be honest but then again everyone is different and someone may get the jitters but that still does not make this a bad anime for 5 minutes of condensed anime it's a great watch.

       Helpful This is my first review, so please bare with me. Yami Shibai is a different kind of horror anime. It's not your usual 24 min per episode, but rather a 5 min per episode anime. Simply, it's a collection of short stories. 
 
--STORY-- 
The story was't anything special. Considering each episode lasts only for 5 minutes and the stories being standalone, there wasn't any sort of story development or anything. Some of the stories had something deep, while some were just about a quick scare. So, don't expect much. 
 
--ART-- 
I really liked the art style of this anime. It felt weird in the beginning, but it soon grew over me as I watched the show. It's very different compared to our usual anime out there. It reminded me of cardboard cut out characters with stop motion animation. It's simple but very effective. I would say, this really elevated the show.  
 
--SOUND-- 
The sound was really good. It was perfect for this show. Some of the sounds really helped in creating the tension and suspense leading to good scares. The voice acting was really good and was spot on. The emotions of the characters felt realistic thanks to the voice acting . 
 
--CHARACTER-- 
Like the story, there isn't anything special about the characters. They are there to complete the story. Since, it's a collection of short stories with new characters you can't really care for anyone of them, and there's no actual need too. Some were interesting and some were not. Also, some of the character designs were really weird and creepy. Which imao worked very well. 
 
--ENJOYMENT-- 
I really had fun watching this anime. It was totally a different experience for me. Some episodes scared me and some didn't. But all the episodes were outright creepy. I like being creeped out or scared. So, yeah. It was fun. 
 
--OVERALL-- 
This anime is for people who love horror and want something weird and creepy to watch in a short format. For others it's mostly gonna be a hit or a miss. Don't come here expecting a great story or characters. Because, it's not made for that. 

          
 
       Helpful Ghost story's have been told for generations, since the dawn of man. Its one of the earliest form of entertainment humankind engulfed themselves with. Before television electricity even before literature, people where gather around the fire to hear does chilling tales.Humans like to be frighten and immersive themselves in a world full of ghost goblins and demons .So lets gather around and i will tell more of about some horrifying Ghost story's.. Welcome to my review of Yami Shibai! 
 
 
 
Rather then one big story this is a collation of shorter ghost tales. And with only four minutes of time they are surprisingly well done, and being told in a creepy menacing way!!They are unique ominous and extremely well presented .Before I start watching this i thought the short time could be a problem but that was a misconception!!   The style itself may be extremely simplistic and first appears as child's play. Created by elementary students for a school projected,That is a mere deceitful illusion, that are fragmentized early in when presenting its true nature!. Its unsettling disturbing and very threatening.The art-style fits in tremendously well, and substantially adding to the scare-factor and give that eerie feeling  
 
 
The music is not that imposing. It's rather other sound effected that just add to its ominous atmosphere and making it feel even more sinister. Sometimes the sound effects are weird sometime creepy.And it always works with the scene itself . The voice actors are doing a monumental job.You can hear the distress and fear even hate in the characters voices .Witch brings life and credibility as a good ghost story should have!!!! To build a great and lovable character in such sort time is unreasonable and totally unnecessary. This is a horror and the character is mere cannon food for our sick enjoyment.The Ghost Stories are the star here. All the characters are support and their only obligation are to raise the fear factor!! And to die in the most gruesome ways possible 
 
 
 
When everything comes together we have collections of ghastly story's.That never feels monotonous or tedious. And it succeeded with its main purpose and made me feel uncomfortable!!  
 
 
I going to lock my door and sleep with the lights on tonight!! If you wonder why,watch this anime and you will understand better. Good night sleep tight, Don't let the ghost and goblin bite!!

","Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita: Ningen-san no, Yousei-san Memo' or 'Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita Recap' is quite literally a recap or summary of the original show. 
 
- What to expect: Well if you've seen the original show you can expect to have all the plots/arcs whatever you want to call them summarized in 1 minute or so segments narrated by our main character Watashi/Okashi-chan. 
 
There's also a slightly modified or longer version of the shows OP with visuals from throughout the various episodes of the original show. 
 
- The bottom line: It's a recap, with no new real content. 
 
If you've already seen the original show you should have no reason for watching this other than wanting a refresher on what happened in the show (but it's a good show so just watch it again :P) 
 
If you haven't seen the original show already then go watch that instead of this, all this will do is detract from the main show because all it really offers is spoilers. 
 
Final Score 5/10 for being average in every way possible.

It doesn't work, but one of the girls—Tuan Kirie—grows up to be a member of the World Health Organization. As a crisis threatens the harmony of the new world, Tuan rediscovers another member of her suicide pact, and together they must help save the planet...from itself.

Beyond country boundaries, society is controlled by the ""Admedistration"" and its WatchMe medical nanotechnology, devoted to protect and extent life, and is governed by a powerful ethic of social welfare and mutual consideration.
In Japan, three young women—Cian Reikado, Miach Mihie, and Tuan Kirie, the protagonist—reject this supposed ""utopia"" that lacks any true form of personal autonomy, and attempt suicide together, thereby committing the crime of rejecting life itself. While Miach succeeds in her attempt, Tuan and Cian are saved at the last moment.
Thirteen years later, Tuan is working as a senior investigator for the World Health Organization, but remains faithful to her ideas and delights in punishing her body. When she re-encounters her friend Cian and they recall their suicide pact and the loss of Miach, events unfold that will once again force Tuan to question her world and discover the truth behind this ""perfect"" world.
","I just finished the movie and this one definitely left some thoughts to ponder and question which wasn’t answered. I might’ve not really even caught onto what it was even about. However, in my own opinion, my generalization of this movie is a story about A HOSPITAL IN WHICH YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM that is in a form of a utopia. Perhaps the goal was to reintroduce the topic of well-being that is depicted in other forms aside from the usual hospitalization, suicidal symptoms caused by disorders, disability and the like.  
 
Now, onto my question which wasn't answered: Was Miach able to escape that hospital and if she did, how did she? No, can you actually really even escape that? You see, the society depicted in this anime is probably the closest depiction to the one we would be approaching in the future now that people are becoming more aware with mental health issues. Is it alright for society to manipulate us or maybe even reset our brains to shape us into an ideal citizen, one who is not sick or poor in any aspect, from physical health to mental health?   
 
I can empathize with those who found this boring. I couldn't deny the fact that people will find this boring because it really is when you are into the climatic-build-up type of literature. I personally like those stuff. However, once in a while I love to immerse myself in these kinds of works that sends a message or pose interesting ideas after watching. And so far, that’s been fairly enough for me. 

          
 
       Helpful Two words to describe this anime. NICE SAFE. Yes, to be honest this anime suffers a lot on the story writing and they managed to safe the whole story by that one final dialogue between Tuan and Miach. The very last dialogue just made me chill down my spines as I sympathized with Miach while feeling horror at the same time. Lured by the theme song by EGOIST, I watched this anime as soon it landed on our local streaming site. While the ending was thrilling, the ride towards there is not so much enjoyable. 
 
As I said before, this anime suffers a lot on the story writing. This is caused by many coincidences thrown into the story and sometimes unmentioned plot suddenly appeared just to continue the story. One example is the story of Tuan's father that they did not mention until it was in the very middle of the story and made his character underdeveloped. Not just that, they are using too much dialogue for expositions and those expositions alone could make somebody confused and bored halfway of the anime. Thank god they did a nice safe with Miach and Tuan's last dialogue that definitely will made you sympathizing with Miach while felt horror at the same time. 
 
I must say this that I think while they are working very hard to utilize 3DCGI on cameraworks, the cameraworks need more improvement as sometimes the cameraworks did not fit the theme of the dialogue. And maybe that's the only flaw in animation department. I love the character design tho. It feels very redjuice. 
 
Overall, I really don't know if I should recommend this anime to you or not. But if you could stand the boring ride in the beginning, your effort will surely be paid at that last Miach and Tuan's conversation. With that, there's only one Project Itoh left that I haven't watched and reviewed that is Genocidal Organ. Look forward to it!

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story for Harmony at least for me was confusing (without thinking) after I thought about everything throughout the movie and then after to make sense of anything I finally understood most of it if not all. It's a very beautiful story and the telling of it was very well done. 
 
Art: Holy, the art in this anime is insane. It's the best animation I have ever seen. the movement of the characters and backgrounds (especially in the finally clips) is so beautiful and I love it. One of the best things about it is the animation.  
 
Sound: Not much to say about this it was good in general nothing really great. The music was fine but nothing more. 
 
Character: Tuan really changes throughout the movie. With a lot of emotional conflict she goes through and the choices she makes changes her, I think it changed her for the better but that can be debated. I loved following her and  get through those conflicts. 
 
Enjoyment: At first I didn't really like it that much then after certain things come around I start to love it more. The ending in particular was the selling point for me.  
 
Overall: In general if you don't understand whats going on I don't think you would like it. If you do understand however you will love it. The ending was amazing and this will definitely be in my top 5 anime movies.

Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, however, feel differently. Naruto is jealous of his comrades' congratulatory families, wishing for the presence of his own parents. Sakura, on the other hand, is angry at her embarrassing parents, and wishes for no parents at all. The two clash over their opposing ideals, but are faced with a more pressing matter when the masked Madara Uchiha suddenly appears and transports them to an alternate world. 
 
In this world, Sakura's parents are considered heroes—for they gave their lives to protect Konohagakure from the Nine-Tailed Fox attack 10 years ago. Consequently, Naruto's parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, are alive and well. Unable to return home or find the masked Madara, Naruto and Sakura stay in this new world and enjoy the changes they have always longed for. All seems well for the two ninja, until an unexpected threat emerges that pushes Naruto and Sakura to not only fight for the Konohagakure of the alternate world, but also to find a way back to their own. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Super Power', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen']","Following his encounter with his mother, Naruto has returned to the Hidden Leaf. He and the rest of the Konoha 11, led by Kakashi Hatake and Might Guy, drive off a group of White Zetsu posing as fallen Akatsuki members. Upon their return, everyone's parents decide to have their children recommended to become jonin, with the exception of Naruto due to his parents being deceased, and Sakura Haruno, whose parents Kizashi and Mebuki dismiss her capabilities. Naruto begins to feel depressed about not having had parents growing up, leading him to lash out at Iruka Umino. Sakura, after arguing with Mebuki, later uses Naruto as an excuse to avoid her. Alone at the park, the two are confronted by Tobi (who at this point they believe to be Madara Uchiha), who proceeds to blind them with a great light before fleeing.
Regaining their senses, Naruto and Sakura discover the world around them significantly changed: their friends' personalities are the polar opposite of their original demeanors; Sasuke Uchiha never left the village and is now a womanizer; Naruto is referred to by others as ""Menma""; no one knows who Madara is; and Kizashi was the Fourth Hokage, him and Mebuki sacrificing their lives to seal the Nine-Tails inside Menma, leading Sakura to become adored as the ""Child of Heroes"". It is revealed that Tobi subjected them to a genjutsu-based, limited version of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, the Limited Tsukuyomi, in the hopes of claiming the Nine-Tails without resorting to the Fourth Great Ninja War.
Naruto and Sakura begin investigating the world in the hopes of finding a way back home, but Sakura begins relishing her lack of parents and newfound fame. They eventually meet with Tsunade, who reveals the existence of a masked ninja who has been attacking villages in order to obtain an object called the Red Moon Scroll; Jiraiya found and hid the scroll before being killed by the Masked Man. With the location known, Tsunade assigns a mission to find it, being led by Naruto's parents Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, who never died due to the Harunos' sacrifice and are active, regular ninja. Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, and Guy also join the mission (the former two hoping to use the scroll to escape the Limited Tsukuyomi), but Naruto becomes enraged at his parents' presence, believing Tobi to be taunting him, and refuses to reciprocate when they show him affection.
During the mission, the team is attacked by Jiraiya's toads, who never developed a kinship with Minato and Naruto and thus treat the group as intruders. In the ensuing fight, Kushina injures her ankle trying to shield Naruto from a poison attack. Minato eventually obtains the scroll, and Sakura heals Kushina. Naruto's parents lecture and console him over the turn of events, overwhelming Naruto with emotion. Upon learning the scroll can only be activated during a red lunar eclipse, Naruto and Sakura realize they have to wait till then. Sakura soon begins to realize the loneliness Naruto felt as an orphan, while Naruto accepts the fake Minato and Kushina as his parents and begins enjoying spending time with them.
The village is then attacked by the Masked Man, having allied himself with Tobi, who has used an incorporeal form to observe the Limited Tsukuyomi, The Masked Man captures Sakura to hold ransom for the Red Moon Scroll, then proceeds to destroy the village. Naruto attempts to leave to save Sakura, but Minato and Kushina hold him back. Realizing they are not like his actual parents, Naruto reveals his true identity to them and thanks them for spending time with him. Wearing Kizashi's Hokage cloak, he takes the Red Moon Scroll and leaves to save Sakura and face the Masked Man, finding them at an old training ground used by Jiraiya and Minato.
While the Akatsuki - a group of mercenaries led by Itachi Uchiha in this universe - dispatch the Masked Man's puppets, Naruto battles against the Masked Man, who is revealed to be the real Menma. Menma absorbs the defeated masked beasts to manifest the Black Nine-Tails, with the Nine-Tails making a temporary truce with Naruto to defeat its counterpart. However, this all plays to Tobi's plan as he possesses Menma so he can personally extract the weakened Nine-Tails from Naruto while completely wiping his mind. Sakura saves Naruto before the Nine-Tails is extracted from him, and Naruto regains his memories from looking at the scroll. Naruto and Sakura, along with assistance from Minato and Kushina, then force Tobi out of Menma and undo the Limited Tsukuyomi. Once back in their reality, after informing Tsunade of their ordeal, Sakura tearfully reunites with her parents while Naruto makes amends with Iruka and realizes he already has a family in his friends.
","Highlights: a Blonde Naruto fighting a black-haired Naruto, Sakura's rare moment of understanding Naruto's feeling, and some Uzumaki's family love. 
 
In this movie due to a jutsu done by Madara, both Sakura and Naruto, are sent to a parallel world, where their wishes are granted. Sakura is granted the wish to live by herself with no parents, and Naruto is given the chance to spend some rare moments with his parents, Minato and Kushina.  
 
The film has some very funny parts where the characters' characterstics are all reversed, we see a player Sasuke, a shy Ino, an idiot Shikmaru, a Kiba who loves cats, a Guy who's lazy, and a -kinda- good Akatsuki. 
 
The Nine-tails fight was great too, but what got me was the whole Naruto's family moments. 
 
All in all, the film is definitely great! not action-packed, but it's a nice breath of air. 

          
 
       Helpful I'd have to say out of all the movies that I've seen thus far this was probably one of my favorites because it wasn't a completely different universe or theoretical country we never heard of but rather an extended development of the on-going TV series. 
 
The strong-points of this movie focuses entirely on that development regarding Minato and Kushina. If you enjoyed watching episodes including backstory on them because of the powerful emotion involved than you'll definitely enjoy this movie.  
 
The story was predictable in it's outcome from beginning, middle and end. So there wasn't really nothing of note. The art and sound were actually pretty good at times and I loved some of the dramatic parts and emphasis they created with the art style and animation and sound. I'd have to say the worst part of the series was the characters..not necessarily because they sucked..but this movie's take on the characters were amusingly average. 
 
Overall I enjoyed the anime, for some of the good art and sound but mainly because the plot elements at the end and character development was good for the two main characters.

          
 
       Helpful This is the ninth Naruto movie, made around the time when the Ninja War began. The main idea behind the plot is interesting, as Naruto and Sakura are sent to an alternative dimension where there is no war. That is supposed to show what Madara plans to do if he plan succeeds and thus excuse his satanic plans. 
 
Sadly this is still a kids’ show, thus the whole thing ends up being nothing more than a badly written fanfic. I mean, really, you are watching this just because you are aware of how one-dimensional everybody is and want to laugh with a “what if” anecdote. You are presented with an alternative dimension where everyone is supposed to act differently and all you get is them acting in the exact opposite way than they do in the normal world. Hell, they don’t even wear different clothes. Do you know what that means? That the Naruto cast is so simple in personality that the only way they could be presented any differently is by reversing the one and only character trait which defined them. Hell, in some cases that trait couldn’t even be reversed and all they did is removing it. Like, the dog dude now being bad with dogs, the insect dude hating insects, and the scroll girl being bad with scrolls. And that doesn’t even happen with all the characters as many others such as the Akatsuki (yes they are present too) have retained their personality for no given reason. 
 
What makes it even worse is that the script was not written by some retarded 10 year old narutard but by the very creator of the show, Kishimoto himself. Really now Kishi, is this how low your writing skills dropped? People usually improve over the years you know; you are given a fresh new canvas and all you do is reverse the colors? 
 
Anyways, this is all a big excuse to see Naruto’s parents and the Akatsuki members being still alive. I mean who cares about story continuity if you have a dozen cool cameos such as those on screen doing their stuff? And we got a second evil Naruto to fight our hero to boot. Where did he appear from? Who cares! Oh, there is also that side story where Sakura is the orphan in this world and she starts to feel as bad as Naruto for growing up alone. But that is thrown away in, like, 10 minutes and she is useless as always so who gives a damn. 
 
Ah, I find so little to write about this. Seriously, by the time the “what ifs” are over, so is most of the film. It is definitely more mature as a concept than the rest of the movies since it’s supposed to be more about the psyche of the protagonists and less about some global threat. Naruto still ends everything with a Rasengan as always but that was not the point of the film. They could have definitely done far more if they had spent more time on the drama of parenthood and had skipped all the silly reverse personalities. I mean, jeez, what was the point of presenting all the reversed rookies if none of them mean anything to the plot? They literally disappear from the story towards the end. And Konoha ends up being nuked again but this time nobody gives a damn about it; thus trashing the whole idea of the world not being better after all. 
 
Damn you Kishi; all these good ideas, trashed by the ridiculous fanfic flavor.

(Source: ANN) ","['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Shounen']","
","Spiral is one of those animes that gets a lot of mixed reviews.  In my opinion, however, it is one of the greatest animes ever created for many reasons.  It\'s not completely perfect, of course -- I don\'t believe anything is perfect -- but it comes pretty darn close. 
 
---Story--- 
 
\&quot;I\'m going to pursue the mystery of the Blade Children.\&quot;  This single line, spoken by Kiyotaka Narumi, is the premise for the entire show.  Above all else, Spiral is a mystery anime, and it centers around what, exactly, the Blade Children are.  It\'s a fascinating idea, that, most unfortunately, is never fully fleshed out in the anime (I won\'t give spoilers, but the ending is definitely... not the best).  Despite its shortcomings, the plot is gripping, fascinating, and, on a level, horrifying (and no, I don\'t mean that it\'s just that bad, although some may disagree. :P).  I would suggest reading the manga -- which comes out in October 2007 -- to fill in all the holes the anime leaves. 
 
---Animation--- 
 
I was completely overwhelmed by the characters and story so, honestly, the art didn\'t really catch my attention the first time I watched Spiral.  The character designs are all very pleasing, but there\'s nothing really spectacular. 
 
---Sound--- 
 
The music of Spiral, without a doubt, always fits with the current scene.  While I thought the opening song was absolutely horrendous, the ending theme is one of my personal favorites.  The music definitely catches the mood, going from bouncy to dark and dangerous in a heartbeat. 
 
---Character--- 
 
Aaaah, here\'s where Spiral really shines through.  In all the anime I have watched, I haven\'t come across a single one that matches Spiral in terms of characters.  Every single one of them is interesting, multi-faceted, and has both strong points and weaknesses.  Spiral simutaneously holds my ultimate favorite character (Kousuke Asazuki) and my most despised character (Kanone Hilbert).  At some point or another, every character in this show goes through some developement and revelation.  Ayumu Narumi, the protagonist, is pleasantly different from most main characters you see in anime.   
 
I must also give a nod to the females of Spiral.  There are no weak damsels in need of a rescue here!  They are resourceful, brave, and just as good as any of the guys.  For those of you who are tired of wishy-washy, constantly-screaming females, Spiral is your answer. 
 
---Enjoyment--- 
 
Obviously, I enjoyed Spiral very much.  While there may be things about it I didn\'t particularly like, the sheer pleasure I recieve in watching it far outstrips those little quibbles. 
 
So, my friends, I highly encourage you to at least give Spiral a try.  If you haven\'t seen it, you really don\'t know what you\'re missing. 
 
Pros: Amazing characters, theme-fitting music, engaging storyline 
 
Cons: Less-than-satisfactory ending, somewhat corny dialogue

          
 
       Helpful Spiral is one of those series that I really, really want to love. It had the makings of a hit. But somehow, it ended with more unfulfilled potential than it started with, and I felt cheated for watching the entire 25 episodes. 
 
After a bit of exposition when we meet Narumi Otouto (as the Blade Children refer to him) and the other characters, the story poses a question to Narumi, his detective sister-in-law, and the viewers: What are the Blade Children? Almost halfway into the story, we finally learn what Blade Children are, and if you're not watching carefully you'll miss it. Probably better that you should, though, because while the series would be actually good if the secret of the Blade Children was heinous and horrendous, it's actually laughable and anticlimactic. The Blade Children seem to constantly pity themselves as ""cursed children who should not be allowed to live in this world"". As vague as that notion is, it's also a better answer for what the Blade Children are. 
 
At least half of the series is dedicated to the Blade Children trying to destroy what they believe is their one and only hope for redemption -- a storyline that is, at best, the Blade Children acting out their feelings of confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness. From my point of view, however, it was ridiculous and the writers made no attempt to use logic and reason in writing the story. 
 
Voice actors are some of my favorites, and Suzumura Kenichi did a smashing job as Narumi. Ishida Akira's treatment of Eyes Rutherford was flat and monotonic, but appropriately so for the character. Hiyono's recurrent ""weird song"", as sung by Asano Masumi, is nicely done as well. 
 
The best part of this series is the artwork. Although Spiral was made in 2002, making it 10 years old at the time of this writing, the style of art is almost the same as anime series currently airing. Other series from that period would have typically looked much different, I believe, with gigantic female eyes much larger than today's eyes. Narumi especially is attractive, with a style not found in contemporary anime. As a sign of the times, many of the male characters are wearing tons of ear jewelry and hair is even more elaborate. 
 
Overall, Spiral could have been something great, but it didn't even try to be. As a result, the whole series suffered terribly. That one decision could have made my review better by 2 stars.

          
 
       Helpful I'm a bit surprised at the mixed reviews this anime has received, I personally feel it was very entertaining and I enjoyed it greatly. When I first watched it it indeed grabbed my attention, and I must say I was addicted! Yes, there are quite a good amount of flaws but beggars can't be choosers, and nothing can be made to perfectly suit ones taste, but this one gets fairly close. I finished this anime back in 2009 so this review is VERY late. :o 
 
 
STORY: 
 
If you are intrigued by the idea of mystery and problem solving, boy you are in for a treat! Not to give anything away but the plot has to do with one main question, who exactly are the Blade Children?  It's a original idea I must say, but sadly it isn't fully understood in the anime. My only true complant is the ending of the anime, it was rushed and very unresolved, but do not let that turn you away just yet. I myself loved the plot so much I finished the entire manga, and it gets only better! Not to say the anime wasn't entertaining, it's just that most anime tend to cut a lot off from the manga. I highly recommend to watch the anime then read the manga, and you will be quite satisfied 
 
 
ART: 
 
Maybe it's because I enjoy watching older animes (huge fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, Ranma 1/2 art) But I actully liked the art style, it's something I find conforting. The only real complaint I could give would have be hair being see-through when overshadowing the eyes on this one specific character and I just found that bothersome. 
. 
 
SOUND: 
 
I found the background music was always suiting to whatever was happening at that moment, so that would be a plus. Though I really disliked the opening song, it was too annoying for my taste. -.- Though the ending song  was cute. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
My personal favorite, they have so much dept to them it's diffcult to NOT like them! Each and every one of them have their own layers, weaknesses and strength to them. If I could I would give an 11 just because it is VERY hard these day to find a strong willed female, best of all theres a bunch of them! I have serveral favorite characters, and typically I'm a bit picky when it comes to choosing more then a few. Another plus in this anime is that all the characters do develop a bit, and that doesn't happen very often in short cut animes. You will be rooting for the main character, and I have yet to come arcoss someone like him again. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
As you may have noticed, I really loved Spiral, and though I really disliked how the ending was made, I can't help but to add this anime into my personal favorites. :) I would also like to blame the manga for making it even more loveable then it already is. 
 
To you guys debatiing out there, it never hurts to try! Really anime viewers Spiral is highly refreshing and better then your run of the mill anime! Perhaps you will find your new obsession!

There was a machine invented as a prototype for the typewriter. It was originally made by Professor Orlando, the authority on letterpress printing and a researcher of mechanical dolls. His wife, Molly, was a novelist, but she became blind and could not write anymore. Dr Orlando then created the first Auto-Memories Doll for her, meant to register everything said by a human voice. In the present time, the term refers to the industry of writing for others.

","Violet Evergarden is a show that has more to offer in its looks than its story (though its story is still good). If there should be any reason to watch this anime it should be for the looks and stellar animation alone. I can't even tell you how much my jaw dropped on to the floor because of how amazing this anime looks. More than half of the time this art looks on the quality of visual art cg's , but higher quality and animated. Lets be honest there are mostly 3 reasons (possibly four) for watching this show.  
 
1. The outstanding artwork and the fact that almost the entire time this movie looks like it could high tier movie quality.  
 
2. the fact that this was made by the reputable kyoto animetion.  
 
3. The amazing score.  
 
(4). the source material. 
 
Arguably the worst thing about this show is the characters. thats not to say that their annoying its just that anyone besides Violet (the main character) is severely under developed. to the point that even when i binged the show i forgot some of the supporting cast. Violet is an amazing main character, though she does seem a little boring at first, i soon found her to be a more emotional character as she progressed thought the story. Unlike most anime characters nowadays violet actually has character development too so thats a huge plus.  
 
the sound does its job, its nothing spectacular.  
 
the story is also pretty good I love abandoned soldier stories. its also episodic kind of like mushishi, kino's jounrey, or cowboy bebop. I always like episodic shows because there much more calming then non episodic shows.  
 
good show you should watch it.

STORY : 8/10 
I never read the source material of this series so I judged the storyline of what was shown in the anime. The premise offered is actually interesting. Self-rehabilitation of Violet who was created only as a weapon of war without having the slightest feeling and desire. But since the Major gave the last sentence, she began to look for what the meaning behind that sentence by becoming an Auto Memory Doll. Walking to one place to another meets the client's request. The journey unknowingly begins to make herself understand the feelings of a human being. The problem of each client who wants to pour into a letter is that slowly build the character Violet for the better. Until finally he understood the loss of someone and began to understand what it means to love. From a soldier who moves only if given the command to a human being who can shed tears. An interesting premise for a drama series derived from the light that lately is mostly filled by isekai genre 
 
DIRECTION : 6/10 
This series begins its story from  Violet's condition after the war and what she will do to find the meaning of the last sentence of Major. Then entering Episode 2-7 the direction of this series turns into episodic. Violet goes somewhere to answer client's request. Each episode is actually presented with the client's first point of view instead of Violet as main character. Every client has their own problems and from this problem Violet's character grows more human. With the direction of this story. Not everyone will understand how Violet character develops every episode. In fact, we will focus more on the client's problem. For example when most of us cry at the end of episode 10, but maybe many of us are not aware of the Violet character changes at that time. Episode 8-9 direction changes back to focus on the major plot. The transition from episodic episode clients to major episodes that has linear progress is poorly executed. I'm sure not everyone can understand how the story of this series if not paying attention to every sentence and scene with care. That was disturbing me in enjoying this series. 
 
CHARACTER : 9/10 
Violet Evergarden is a character with the greatest development among all the characters that exist in this season. Starting from a soldier who even just to eat should be given orders by Hodgins to be a human being who is even determined not to lose the life of someone as she once did. The thing that I love about Violet's character is that she develops not because she is being advised by others, but she learns by listening to the client's problem. she began to understand a feeling precisely after knowing what problems hers client was experiencing. So after knowing facts that ""facts"". She understands the meaning of losing someone. The scene in episode 11 when Violet performs the ""last request"" of the soldier also shows how she began to understand the meaning of affection. Perhaps what she's been doing lately is naive. But it shows that Violet has changed from a heartless weapon into a human who understands the sense of losing someone. 
 
ART : 10/10 
This series is a series with the best animated quality in winter of 2018. My favorite scene of course when Violet tried to pass the lake using an umbrella. The scene really shows the high quality animation presented by Kyoto Animation. The character design and color selection in this series reminds me of the Koe no Katachi film which is also made by KyoAni. Even for a television series, Violet Evergarden has the same quality as Koe no Katachi. Each frame is well drawn so the animation runs smoothly. Details on the character design also shows the hard work of key animators in making this series. Every female character feels so beautiful and every male character feels so manly through the way key animator draws each character. The selection of colors taken fits perfectly with the theme of this series which is thought to be similar to the period after the second world war in time and technology. Plus the quality of backgrounds such as clouds and water are so beautiful to the eye. Overall, this is one of the best quality anime other than Kimi no Na Wa and Koe no Katachi 
 
SOUND : 8/10 
Maybe what makes us sad and cry when watching this series is not because of Violet's personal problems, but the client's problem. But still this series still able to make us shed tears. The existence of the soundtrack in every sad moment in this anime really strengthens the atmosphere. Without proper selection and soundtrack composition, sad moments are not necessarily can make us shed tears. It also should be appreciated is the sound effect. Especially when the scene is related to the war. The sound of weapons, bombs, airplanes or even the sound of a soldier dropped from a shot. My favorite part in terms of sound effects is when an army is shot. Everything feels so fast that we do not realize that someone has been shot. 
 
Overall, this series provides  best animated quality and also provides an interesting story premise. But direction in this series can make us confused in following Violet's journey to find his true self. So not everyone will judge the story in this anime executed properly or not. But for a drama series. This is an anime with good character development. Violet is the character with most massive development among all the characters in the winter of 2018.

          
 
       Helpful For those skimming through reviews to decide if they are going to watch I will say this: ""Violet Evergarden is a sight to behold and a must watch. Easily a 10/10"". 
 
Violet Evergarden takes its time drawing you into it's fictional, post-war world. It invests you in almost all of its characters. It earns each and every emotional character moment and doesn't hold back tugging at your heart strings. 
 
If you ask what the central theme of the show is, it would have to be ""loss"". 80% of the episodes deal with loss and how individuals cope with it. Other themes could include ""self discovery"", ""love"", and even ""PTSD"". There's a lot to swallow when you watch this show, so prepare your heart for a good tuggin'. 
 
When it comes to storytelling, and how the showrunners move the plot along, there's really no better studio than Kyoto Animation to handle this. They, over the years, have become masters of the art of ""Show Don't Tell."" There are so many significant character moments that aren't explicitly stated, but are understood by the viewer without a single word being spoken. They take their time to show us the important things, and they do so in a way that ensures you will understand. Occasionally they play mean tricks on us by making us assume one thing only to turn the tables and subvert our expectations. This anime is a marvel of storytelling and is worth studying for anyone aspiring to be a writer. 
 
Music is the force that drives any good show, movie, or anime forward. Without music a show says less than it could. Violet Evergarden has one of the best accompanying compositions I've heard in an anime since Akagami no Shirayuki Hime (Snow White with the Red Hair). Just a orchestral masterpiece that not only builds upon the world, but packs a serious emotional punch when played at just the right moment. The moment I finished the show I IMMEDIATELY purchased the soundtrack - this was a no brainer and a worthwhile purchase that will enrich my musical library. 
 
Characters and pacing was handled superbly, as we have come to expect from KyoAni. The progression of our protagonist (Violet) is apparent as the show rolls on from episode to episode. We see her overcome numerous hurdles and learn to cope with her complex emotions -- and of course deal with loss. Even side characters are given plenty of attention. Each episode has a nice arc with a pleasant payoff by the ending credits. 
 
Overall this show gets a solid 10/10 from me. I plan to purchase the Blu Ray of this - I want a physical copy by all means necessary! I cannot recommend this show enough. Bring tissues, watch on the highest resolution display you own, and prepare for one of the best shows of the past few years.  
 
This show gave me that feeling -- you know the feeling. That void. The ""I'll never experience anything quite like it again"" feeling. Yeah, it's that good. 
 
 
 
--- EDIT --- 
 
I wanted to append this to the end of my review. I've been reading a lot of the other reviews, and I think there's a silly trend. One thing that I never do when I look at an anime, is I never compare it to its source material (if it's an adaptation). I judge it on its own merits -- i want the anime to stand on its own two feet. To me, there's no sense in taking a perfectly fine anime and saying ""well it's not the visual novel"". Of course its not the visual novel. If that's what you want then just read that. I came to see an anime, and when I wrote my review I judged the ANIME. It honestly upsets me when I see someone discredit an otherwise good anime because it's not 100% loyal to whatever source it came from. But hey, to each his own am i right? Everyone's got their opinions, and now you know mine.

","This is my first review and I've decided to review Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time because I'm lazy and don't want to tackle an anime that requires thinking or a lot of typing to review. These are essentially just 2 minute shorts based on the currently airing show Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu so the target audience of Break Time is people who are watching and enjoying Re:Zero and can't wait a whole week to get their next Subaru fix. The shorts are humorous in nature and occasionally add a little bit to plot points that were tackled in Re:Zero but are generally unnecessary and are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary. 

          
 
       Helpful Yes, character and voice actor deserves a break, in other words, just for fun, but also feels like trying to add something beneath the middle of the episodes.  
 
For example, how Subaru confuse as Apple in real world (Ringo) and Fantasy World, Appas (Ringa), Beatrice hate Subaru calling her Loli, and just small random stuff in the whole episodes. 
 
Other than that, is just for your pleasure 3 minute break time after done doing voice acting the main series. 
 
Indeed its funny but not from what we expected from short video.

Released as a special.,['Kids'],"True Tears revolves around a high school student named Shin'ichirō Nakagami with a high artistic ability. He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home.
Shin'ichirō has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shin'ichirō knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shin'ichirō teases her.
After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box, and he finds out from her that she ""gave her tears away"". Shin'ichirō also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endō at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns, and she helps out at the shop too. Shin'ichirō juggles all of these problems on a day-to-day basis as he learns about love and the sadness of those around him.
The opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in Nanto, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality Nanto is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping center from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop and the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the series—Isurugi, Kurobe, and Takaoka—are place names in Toyama Prefecture.
","If you are interested in the ending of the book which Shinichiro wrote in the original series you will find out from this short. For me it was the only reason to watch it. Wasn't disappointed. The story ends really comforting. There is no music at all, so I just gave it the half of the score, beacue there is nothing to rate.

An anime doesn't need to have a great story, stunning art and music from popular bands. Enjoyment knows no such thing. Sometimes it is just the way characters interact in a particular scenario or just the sheer ridiculous answers the Hagemaru gives to questions that will make you laugh, but you will laugh.

The series offers a good laugh here and there and sometimes it's just sad to watch because you can symphatize with the main character so much. 
 
A drunk husband, two stupid and annoying kids and a housemother who despises them (yet loves them more then anything else), who wouldn't want to watch that?  
 
The series is easy to get into, each anime episode has short stories about laughable situations. The main focus is the mother, who tries to become a mangaka while taking care of her kids and (stupid) husband, not everything goes smoothly as her work often gets interrupted, ruined or she doesn't do anything due to a writer's block. 
 
The art is also one of the good things of this series, the style it's done in really gets the humor out of it, it's perfect for facial jokes, angry scenes and of course for the cute and cuddly scenes when everyone makes up. 
 
About the sound, I normally don't talk a lot about it, not that it's any different now. The opening song fits the series greatly and so does the ending. Both are fun to listen and watch. The voice-actors do a good job and there's nothing wrong with the background music. 
 
In short, it's an anime series, basically for everyone who enjoys a good laugh or simply likes anime without the great plots, character development etc.

Since the episodes are only a promotion for the manga, there is no depth story in the episodes, it's all surface, all summation. If you are interested, just go read the manga!

If you are not sure about the manga, I recommend watching the first OVA, with the same title but was made in 2014. The episode is 15min or so, and it gives you a before-taste of the serie and how the characters are.

14,5032,51,7.986922274,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Cobra The Animation,"This Cobra adaptation features short arcs of Cobra saving the world, his friends or himself.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Sci-Fi']","In the far future, an office worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporation—a company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.
In his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes ""Cobra"", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.
On his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about ""Cobra"" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.
Johnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as ""Cobra"". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.
Johnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.
","Cobra is a show that is very much out of place in today's world. It is a pulp sci-fi action comedy that is ripped directly from the 1980s, and is a fantastic throwback to the days when anime was fun, over-the-top and testosterone-fueled. Gun arms, impossibly proportioned women, and comedic one-liners. 
 
If you sat down to Cobra for the story, you would be sadly disappointed. As with most shows that could be described as pulpy, the plot is more a way to give Cobra things to do to be a badass. It does that well, and that is really all the show asks. There are a few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots. They're entertaining enough, but hardly memorable. 
 
The animation is fairly good. There's no glaring animation errors, and the entire production has a low-budget, old school feel to it that lends a lot of flavor to the show. The CG is (intentionally?) fairly poor, but is perfectly suited to the throwback style that the show is trying to cultivate. 
 
All in all, Cobra will a bit of a hard sell to most anime fans, looking for the next androgynous pretty-boy protagonist. However, if you yearn for the days where men were men, women were ""dames,"" and arms were guns, against a backdrop of cool jazz... well, I think I have a show for you.

          
 
       Helpful Being the latest installment to the Cobra series (2010), Cobra The Animation feels more like its original anime of 1982 as it follows the episodic storyline with the occasional story arcs.  
 
If you seen everything Cobra related, then this series does deliver the same content we gotten before, perhaps even manlier than ever. We see Cobra fight in an illegal underground fist fight, battles a gladiator which briefly turns into a DBZ fight, dives under the sea, climbs a mountain which may not exist, explores a planet filled with the most disturbing plants with faces & ends the series with a King's rescue mission.  
 
While the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series. In my opinon, the women somehow look at their sexiest in this series. The stories featured here are more tragic especially episodes 8 & 9 as it goes in a much darker route than Cobra usually goes to. Out of all the episodes I'd say the mountain story arc (6&7) is probably the best one in terms of mystery & suspense. As for action, it never really peaks or stays engaging all the way through, it instead has some action highlights in bits & pieces rather than a full episode.  
 
Overall, the same fun is found here although 13 episodes feels way too short. I also felt it wasn't as creative when it came to exploring the universe of Cobra(again comparing it to the first anime). Not a bad addition as the episodes are based on certain manga chapters, but the original series still remains the best of the Cobra franchise.  
 


          
 
       Helpful There are two ways you can look at this series:  
 
1) It's something that's trying to be a serious action series and fails because it's terribly cheesy, 
or 
2) This is ~meant~ to be a throwback to cheesy cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, and the cheese is, at least in part, self-satire. 
 
Personally, I lean more towards the second interpretation, and find that the series is accomplishing what it's set out to do. If you don't like cheesy old-school or satire, you're really not going to like this series at all, I'll give you that as a fair warning. 
 
First, you've got the typical daredevil macho hero with an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there's the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I'll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled. (I want to say again, but this is only the first episode so far) 
 
Second, you've got what looks like a pretty typical plot - keep the key to the Universe from the bad guys while you get it to where it needs to be. Nothing fancy at all here. 
 
So, why the (somewhat) high rating?  
 
Maybe it's just that something feels almost nostalgic about this, or maybe it's that this type of ""typical"" is actually pretty uncommon in anime. I'd say the main character almost feels like He-Man with a gun arm, and certainly seems like he'd belong more in an American-style cartoon rather than an anime. 
 
I also appreciated a couple of satirical bits in the first episode: Normally, when the hero blasts away a vehicle as it races towards him, the flaming debris that should remain seems to conveniently vanish. This wasn't the case with Cobra, as the flying vehicle speeding towards the hero simply became a flaming flying vehicle speeding towards the hero instead. 
 
Given that we're only at the first episode right now, I could be wrong and this could turn out to be a terrible series, but so far I'm leaning towards believing it's satire and am enjoying it thoroughly.

One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.  She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a ""fickle god"" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests.  Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church.
","There are shows with better specials than these, but these 2 episodes are still a good way to spend about 10 minutes of your life.  They don't really add anything important, but it's fun to watch.  It's worth the watch just to see Holo again.  The first one gives a little history about the food they eat and the wine.  The second one is just an episode with.  Holo showing off how she stretches.  Overall, it's nice to see Holo again and it's a decent watch.  Don't expect anything major from these specials.  A 7/10 is a good score here, but don't take it as a bad thing

          
 
       Helpful If you notice the length of each episode, you figure out pretty quickly that these two mini-sodes are really just cuteness. The first is a neat one about the bread and alcohol in the show, while the second one is a fan-service of Horo showing how to stretch. No real story to speak of, and with that, not much in the character section. The art was done by one of the animators of the show, so  while it is slightly different from the main style, it's not particularly noticeable. They used the sounds that you're probably used to if you've seen the rest of Spice & Wolf, so no surprises there. 
Overall, it's pretty cute, but mostly useless fluff.

","Let me be frank, this is essentially a recap episode (and we all know now well those go down in the anime community!), a 60min recap episode at that. 
 
The gimmick here is that it is a retelling of the events of the 1 season from the perspective of Reigen, embellished for the purpose of making some profit. I call it a gimmick because it doesn't take very long for it to wear on the nerves. Reigen's manipulation of Mob is an essential aspect of the story...but an entire episode of it is far more than I can take. 
 
Regarding all other aspects, apart from few additional scenes to move the recap along, it is a highlights reel of all the best fights from season 1, nothing more.

Easter Egg...apparently Reigen has a Saitama screen saver on his mobile phone.   

          
 
       Helpful I give it a middling score because it's executed very well, but I don't think it's worth watching. Maybe peeping if you're curious. It's just a recap of Season 1, but it's framed as Reigen using it as a plot to write his book. This results in him narrating the story and inserting himself in scenes or even over characters (say, if they're doing cool fighting stuff) to make it about him. It's definitely a funny twist for a recap  (especially when it's just Reigen's giant head superimposed over other characters') and it's entirely befitting of Reigen. 
 
However, it's not ENTIRELY Reigen-ified. There's much more time where the anime is the exact same (even down to characters' thoughts being heard), so I was skipping ahead a lot until there was a Reigen or two, then went back to skipping. Eventually I stopped because the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. 
 
I guess you can watch it just to see what Reigen does to the recap yourself, but don't expect to strap in for the whole thing unless you want to rewatch Season 1 in an hour.

          
 
       Helpful Story: Recap of season 1 but in a whole new twist~ HILARIOUS! I won't tell spoilers but haha.. those ""encounter"" stories.. a little delirious but hey, who wants to just see a boring recap when you can have Reigen's version of it instead? 10/10 
 
Art: No changes there. So.. yeah. 
 
Character: Reigen is hilarious as always, telling the whole season 1 recap his own way. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
Fantastic! Hilarious OVA! They did well on it! I recommend people to watch this if they wanna see a summary but hilarious version of Mob Psycho 100. 
 
Not a spoiler, but like, one time, Reigen's phone was edited to show Saitama as his picture cover for his phone. Nice edit! Hahaha!

","This anime has cute girls in it, and interesting monsters and fights. I liked it so much I made a wiki for it in 2011 but sort of stalled on ep 10 
 
The fansubs that exist are nice and small and good for watching on low-res computers that can't handle all that 1080 stuff coming out nowadays. 
 
There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility. 
 
Pink for the woman is a little stereotypical following after Beast King GoLion (pretty sure Voltron preceded power rangers) but it's manageable.

          
 
       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

Due to this, he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall. 
 
However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.

The Kawamoto family's home is set in Tsukuda which is connected to the town Rei lives in through the Chuo bridge. The shogi hall of the manga is set in Sendagaya area and it resembles the headquarters of the Japanese Shogi Association that is situated there.Rei Kiriyama's parents and younger sister died in an accident in his childhood. He then started living with the family of Masachika Kōda who was a friend of his father. Reaching adulthood, Rei left his foster family thinking he was only causing trouble. He now lives alone and has few friends. Among his acquaintances are three sisters of the Kawamoto family—Akari, Hinata, and Momo. As the story progresses, Rei deals with his maturation both as a professional shogi player and as a person, all the while strengthening his relationships with others, particularly the Kawamoto sisters.
","Hate slow-paced anime? Then this isn’t for you. Hate generic sub-characters? Then this isn’t for you. Hate heavy narration? Then this isn't for you. Hate when an anime spends a good portion of its time depicting a board game that you don’t understand? Then this isn’t for you. Have a short attention span and don’t like slow-paced series? Then this anime is definitely not for you! 
Nonetheless, I genuinely LOVE March Comes in Like a Lion!! So what about this series makes me love it despite rating it a 7 and being Debby Downer? Easy: the main character, the art, and the heavy narration. 
 
Characters: Rei is probably one of my favorite character that has come into fictional existence over the past few years. He is different from all the melancholic male characters out there. Yes, he does mope around and feels sorry for himself, but he doesn’t whine nor does he have an undesirable urge to play victim and guilt trip all those that are around him. He is this unique quality character that is not found in stories that often. His growth does not happen immediately. It’s a very slow process. It’s the people around him, the small mundane things, and the ruminating thoughts he has that allows him to grow. His ability to come to terms with his circumstance and his attempt to widen his perspective is a breath of fresh air for me. He really embodies an insecure 17 year old who is trying to become an adult. Observing Rei grow makes this whole series worth watching. He is a wonderful example of creating a slice-of-life/coming of age character. Furthermore, as a viewer who overanalyzes everything and is stuck in my own thoughts while living a monotonous life, Rei’s (and his “mentors”) numerous insightful quotes are always worth reflecting upon.  
 So what about the other characters? First and foremost, most of the characters are mainly there to highlight the story of Rei. So the fact that Rei’s development is incredibly slow means that other character growth are undeniably slow. It’s so slow that unfortunately they are only seen as the typical stock characters. I’m only going to discuss the three sisters (Akari, Hinata and Momo), and Rei’s actual “sister” (Kyouko) to make my point, but the other side characters have similar problems.   
Like Rei, Rei’s ""sister” is also the melancholic type. However, the difference between these siblings are noticeable. She is the “woe unto me” type with a Kurt Cobain flare (more like the obnoxious Sasuke Uchiha from  Naruto). The femme fatale, the woman who comes to ignite the flame to the series. Anytime she brings herself into Rei’s life, drama is inevitable. To add the chaotic-ness of her personality, there also seems to be some uncomfortable (“sexual”) tension amongst Rei and her; this point could hopefully be proven void later on, but as a viewer it does create a natural curiosity to keep wanting to know what had happened to both of them prior to Rei’s current living situation.  
As for the three sisters, they are the exact opposite of Rei and Kyouko. They are introduced at the very beginning of the series, and they are there to radiate love and happiness to Rei’s black and white existence.  Together, the sisters represent the warmth and compassion that a family unit could be filled with. However, the main concern I have with these ladies is that even though March Comes in Like a Lion is half way done, they are not even slightly fleshed out. Momo, the youngest sister, is basically there to be cute. Nothing else. Just to be cute. Akari is the typical sweet female character. She is considered to be beautiful, gentle, mild-tempered, and extremely maternal: the epithet of “perfection”. Hinata is probably the sister that stands out the most which is quite the irony, because in reality she is so normal that she wouldn’t stand out at all. She’s not too cute. She’s not too perfect. She is just an average girl. The problem I have with these 3 sister is not that they are stock characters, but they have so much to offer and it is not being showcased. There are subtle hints and moments that makes it obvious that their life is not as simplistic as it appears. They have a gloomy history and they have struggled a lot. It is unfortunate that this is a slow-paced anime because their potential as characters is obvious. Although there is no doubt in my mind that this series will do these sisters justice and gradually mold and shape them, I find it a little sad that many viewers will only see them as just shallow/uncreative archetypes. 
 
Art: The art is possibly my favorite part of March Comes in Like a Lion (Studio Shaft is remarkable). It honestly feels like I am watching a book because this series manages to wonderfully combine heavy narration (which I usually tend to dislike) with divine imagery.  As I mentioned a thousand times already, this is a very slow- paced anime. However, even when nothing is happening the art is able to speak volumes.  
I am an impatient human being and I lose interest easily. So when the show focuses on a shogi match (which I have difficulty fathoming), the one thing that keeps my attention asides the dialogue is the art. For instance, while the characters are playing shogi, they are consistently drinking liquid. Water and liquid is something that is always brought up in the art throughout each episode, and this does not surprise me. Water is able to give life and hydrate the body, but at the same time it is able to drown and suffocate a person’s soul. The artistic style can be observed and reflected on for days if one wanted to understand the atmosphere and tone of the story. 
 
 Rei and the art are probably the key reasons one should watch this series. Although this anime does feel boring, that does not mean it is awful. The story is executed in such a way that character development and growth feels realistic. Again, this is not a series for people who need to be stimulated with action/philosophical scenes every few minutes. Nonetheless, the writing and concept of March Come in Like a Lion is so well thought-out that I actually would recommend people to watch this series even if they may drop it after a few episodes in. The only suggestion I can give a person who is interested in wanting to view a slow-paced series but is unable to focus, is to watch it with another person so the uneventful section of the show can feel somewhat less intolerable. 
 
(On another completely irrelevant note: the creators of this series really love cats; there are so many annoying cats in this show)

          
 
       Helpful 3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft's other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei's journey.  
 
8/10 Story: 
The story resonates with me a lot. It's like a combination of figuring out life in the present and how to deal with your past at the same time. The story is more than just about shogi, it's more about the player. How he decides what pieces to use, what pieces to move, and try and overcome his next opponent/obstacle. It also applies to his life. He has his new family which currently guards him and his past (pieces he lost) which keep coming back to attack him.  
 
9/10 Art: 
This is pretty self explanatory. The art is unique and defines each situation perfectly. You can properly see how everyone is feeling in each scene. It's powerful and really makes you think back when you were hurt but then got through it thanks to a loved one.  
 
9/10 Sound: 
The opening/endings always seemed to tell Rei's story just by listening to it. Everything was made well to fit the mood. It wasn't forced like laugh tracks from 90s comedies but I knew when to smile, be sad, and root for them thanks to the sound.  
 
8/10 Character: 
As far from how much I like their characters, It's pretty much 10/10. The only reason it's an 8 is because some of the characters got underdeveloped in comparison to the main few. I love them all as characters from their realism, supportiveness, and silliness. Even the characters we know little about, I wanna know more about them cus they seem interesting. Rei's sister, Rei's future opponents, and pretty much everyones past.  
 
8/10 Enjoyment: 
3-Gatsu was that one anime I kept coming back to weekly. It was at times heartbreaking, heartrelieving, and at times very intense. I enjoyed the characters and the story that came with them, but at some points it was a little slow. I enjoyed it overall, and was happy as fk when they announced season 2 coming soon.   
 
9/10 Overall: 
Another one of Shaft's animes that I actually liked. Hope you give this anime a chance because everything about it is relatable and enjoyable at the same time.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Story 10 
This is slice of life at its best.  The story moves slowly, and I was unsure whether I liked it at first.  Then, somewhere along the winding path that is Rei Kiriyama's life, I was hooked.  This isn't just a sports anime, where it's only about the protagonist progressing through a shogi championship.  It isn't just a comedy about a lonely outcast making friends with the Kawamoto sisters.  It isn't just a drama about a boy dealing with his family.  It's all of those wrapped into one.  It's a truly interesting mix that I can't wait to keep watching in season 2.   
 
Characters 10 
Rei Kiriyama may fit into the ""troubled young prodigy"" archetype, but to me he seems different.  He slowly grows on you, you start to understand him, and soon you care about him more than anyone else in the world.  He's genuine and complex, and a fascinating character to watch.  The Kawamoto sisters (and their cats) are hilarious, and you just fall in love with them at first sight.  The shogi players Rei meets are interesting and well-developed, especially Shimada.  Rei's adoptive sister Kyouko is a despicable character but well suited to the story.   
 
Art 10 
The art matches the story perfectly.  The style and colors shift depending on the mood, and much like the anime itself, I found myself initially hesitant about it, then completely immersed.   
 
Music 9 
Very good openings and endings that capture the feel of the anime.   
 
Overall/Enjoyment 10 
This is a profound, must-watch anime.  As I mentioned, the art, music, and story all work together to create a unique and distinctive feel for this anime.  I am completely hooked and fully invested in the story now.

","Bus Gamer was made by the same author of the well known Saiyuki series. Thus you can expect handsome men and fun battles, which the anime does provide.

The team has its variety in fighting styles and motivation. Each character is shrouded in mystery and the short series slowly reveals hints of why this mismatched trio so desperately needs cash to the point of risking their lives in an illegal street fight. 
 
To say anything about the characters would spoil the series, however, the series itself only scratches the surface of those potentially interesting characters. My only complaint is that it feels very much unfinished with only hints of their past being revealed and their main rival hardly getting started on the chase.  
 
Though the series does show enough to let us get a taste of what it's like and leave us wanting more. So if you don't mind being left with the feeling of lack of closure, check this out and you'll at least enjoy what little is available.

       Helpful I just wanted to put this down.  I think this anime brings something new to the table(from what I understand), wether it be good or bad.  I like that it took me out of the typical anime feeling, I get when watching most animes.  You really don't have to absorb that much information to get it.  I like that it skips most of the bullshit that tends to get reptitive in animes.  Also if you watch anime alot or know alot of stories, or imaginative, or w/e I believe this anime was made so you use your knowledge to fill in the blanks. 
 
Story:  I like the story.  I would say the story is presented in a poem form as opposed to a novel, for the lack of episodes.  Their is still a story to this anime.  Six indivduals are put together inside an arena, and it is a three on three battle, and the winners get cash.

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

During another clash with Fate, Negi also learns that the main objective of his group ""Cosmo Entelecheia"" is to make use of Asuna's secret powers to erase the magically created inhabitants of Mundus Magicus and transfer the rest of its population to Earth before it eventually collapses.
By joining forces with the various armies of the Magic World, the members of Ala Alba storm Cosmo Entelecheia's stronghold where Asuna and Anya are being held captive, to stop their plans. During the confrontation a magic gate is opened to Earth just above Mahora, having Negi's remaining students who stayed behind along with the academy's faculty members joining the fight. After rescuing Asuna and convincing Fate to accept a plan to save the people of the Magic World without the need of any sacrifices, Negi discovers that the true leader of Cosmo Entelecheia is none other than his father Nagi, possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who vanishes after asking his son to look for him and release him once and for all.
After being celebrated as heroes for stopping Cosmo Entelecheia, Negi and his friends return to the academy, but instead of resuming his duties as a teacher, Negi leaves Fate as his substitute and with the help of some of his students he starts working on his plan to terraform Mars for the people of the decaying Magic World to relocate there. The plan involves sealing Asuna's body for one hundred years, and she bids farewell to Negi and the other students after she graduates from middle school. Waking up 30 years after the estimated time, Asuna finds that Negi's plan was a success and that Negi and all her classmates had happy and bountiful lives, but had long since died, all except for the immortal Evangeline, and Chao who exists in this time and has since invented a device to jump between realities. These two appear before Asuna to take her back to the present so she can live out her days with Negi and the others.

At the time of this writing, this is (sadly) the latest animated incarnation that integrally adapts the Mahou Sensei Negima manga. As you can infer from the title, this OVA is about Yue and what happened to her after separating from the rest of the members of Ala Alba. Just like Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba and Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, this was created for the people who read the manga. Still, from the three OVAs sagas, this is definitely the more self conclusive, and if you are willing to take it as an elseworld, fans of the first two animes can watch it without much trouble. 
 
Story: After the incident in the Mundus Magicus's portal, Yue is transported and instantly broom-hit by Collet Farandole, a student at the Ariadne academy of magic. Yue ends losing her memory, and to keep an eye on her, she's accepted in the academy, where, with Collet help, she'll study to become a magic knight. During one class, the name Nagi Springfield is invoked, and Yue feels it have something to do with her past. But Nagi is not only a historical hero: right now, a young gladiator with the same name (and same appearance) is causing a great commotion in the annual Mundus Magicus's fighting tournament , whose final will be held in Ostia. And this last thing is important, cause the academy has a contest where the winners will travel as guardians of that event... 
 
Animation: Outstanding, like the other OVAs, though here the computer effects/drawing are a bit overused, especially in landscapes... They're well done, and maybe it's just a personal preference, but the two-dimensional drawings seem more beautiful. 
It sometimes happened with magic, too. 
And just a little detail, when a pactio card is activated, the transformation is similar to that of Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sound: Both the opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, which has the most comical animation of all the adaptations) and the ending (Good vibration!) are interpreted by the four Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily, and Beatrix. Both songs are very good, and the work of the seiyuus is impeccable, as we are used to these OVAs (and that's admirable, since the entire cast, with the exception of Yue's voice actor, are new to the series). 
 
Verdict: Yue fans, rejoice! This is more than you could have ever imagined, a special devoted entirely to the Blue Baka Ranger. Despite being just one chapter, I have to say it did the best job in this whole manga adaptation project: the story makes sense all the time, no sudden jumps between scenes, and although the end is open, the story itself (of this special) is completed (as opposed to Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, which sadly ends up in one of the very best moments of the manga). This is the only Negima OVA that i could recommend to fans of the first two animes, and not only to the manga readers. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you take it as an elseworld (which it isn't, since is part of the main story, but it could have been one), you can actually see it without much confusion (obviously there will be details that aren't gonna be understood, but the action in general can be appreciate). 
And the usual recommendation: If you didn't read the manga, then read it! It's one of the best things going on right now, if you don't mind the obscene amount of fan service in its early chapters (later... I wouldn't exactly say is attenuated, but certainly the focus of the series changes to the fights). 
-------- 
Al momento en que escribo esto, esta es (tristemente) la ultima encarnación animada que adapta de forma integra el manga de Mahou Sensei Negima. Como podrán deducir del título, este OVA trata sobre Yue y que fue lo que le paso después de separarse del resto de los miembros de Ala Alba. Al igual que con Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba y Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, esto está pensado para que lo vean las personas que leyeron el manga. Así y todo, de las tres sagas de OVAs, esta es decididamente la mas auto conclusiva, y si están dispuestos a tomarlo como un elseworld, los fans de los primeros animes pueden verlo sin muchos problemas. 
 
Historia: Luego del incidente en el portal de Mundus Magicus, Yue es transportada e instantáneamente atropellada por Collet Farandole, una estudiante de la academia de magia de Ariadne. Yue termina perdiendo la memoria, y para cuidarla, es aceptada en la academia, donde Collet la ayudara a estudiar y a convertirse en uno de los caballeros mágicos. Durante una clase, el nombre Nagi Springfield es invocado, y Yue siente que tiene algo que ver con su pasado. Pero Nagi no solo es un héroe histórico: en la actualidad, un joven gladiador con el mismo nombre (y misma apariencia) está causando estragos en el torneo de lucha anual de Mundus Magicus, cuya final se celebrara en Ostia. Y esto último es importante, porque la academia tiene un concurso en el que las ganadoras viajaran como guardianas de ese evento... 
 
Animación: Soberbia, al igual que las otras OVAs, aunque acá se abusa un poco de los paisajes hechos con computadora... Están bien hechos, y tal vez solo sea una preferencia personal, pero los dibujos en dos dimensiones me parecen más bonitos. En la magia también pasa esto.  
A modo de detalle, cuando se activa una carta pactio, la transformación es similar a la de Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sonido: Tanto el opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, que tiene la animación mas cómica de todas las adaptaciones) como el ending (Good vibration!!) son interpretados por las cuatro Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily y Beatrix. Las dos canciones son muy buenas, y el trabajo de las seiyuus es impecable, como estos OVAs nos tienen acostumbrados (y eso es admirable, dado que todo el cast, con la excepción de la vos de Yue, es nuevo en la serie). 
 
Veredicto: Fanáticos de Yue, regocíjense! Esto es más de lo que podrían haber podido imaginar, un especial dedicado íntegramente a  la Baka Ranger azul. A pesar de ser un solo capitulo, tengo que decir que es el que mejor adapta el manga: la historia tiene sentido en todo momento, no hay saltos bruscos entre escena y escena, y aunque el final queda abierto, la historia en si misma de este especial, es concluida (a diferencia de Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, que tristemente termina muy cerca del momento máximo del manga). Esto es tan así que es la única OVA de todas las lanzadas que podría recomendar a un fan de Negima que vio los primeros animes, pero no leyó el manga. Como dije al principio de esta review, si se lo toma como un elseworld, realmente puede verse sin mucha confusión (obvio que va a haber detalles que no se entienden, pero la acción en general puede apreciarse). 
Y la recomendación de siempre: si no leyeron el manga, léanlo. Es de lo mejor que hay dando vueltas en estos momentos, si no les molesta la cantidad obscena de fan service que hay en sus primeros capítulos (esto después... no voy a decir que se atenúa, pero decididamente el enfoque de la serie cambia hacia los combates).

(Source: ANN)",['Music'],"Eriko Tamura is the only daughter of Yuusuke Tamura - chairman of renowned music company Tamura Productions - and former idol singer Minako Tamura. Having had a talent for singing since birth, she has always loved her parents’ media world. Then one day tragedy strikes when her parents get into a horrible car accident, which kills her father and leaves her mother in a coma. Now Eriko must take the path of singing, a path her parents did not want her to pursue. Things get worse when her uncle sets out to destroy her career. But in spite of all the hardship, she becomes an idol and wins hearts all over Japan.
","I'll try to keep spoiling to the minimum. TL;DR: This is the life story of a future star singer.  
 
Tamura Eriko is not your typical usual student as her parents are rich and famous people. Her life could be a sugar bowl but not everything is happy in the real life. Life of a starting singer of 80s has its advantages and drawbacks. 
 
Unlike most of recent romance comedies this anime has surprisingly strong and consistent plot. Yes, fillers are present but not too often. Predictability of the story development is about 40-60% (vs 95% in modern anime) and this is why I liked it. 
Characters are well written. Every single one, even minor personage has a believable character without much overacting (like in modern shows).  
No grotesque tsunderes, no stupid average school boys, no stereotypes. Awesome! 
 
Eriko herself is too naive and sweet sometimes, but she's only 14 (in the 1989) so it isn't much of an eyesore (unlike the ""TRASHY MAN"") or Mary Sue. She has bright personality, hardly ever gets angry, excels at every activity and always puts the needs of others before herself, also can be described as a hard worker on the whole. 
 
The music is nice and not easy forgettable. I really liked ""Serious"" song (真剣).  
Soundtrack is good (like most anime soundtracks from the end of 80s). 
 
Designs were pleasing to my eye. Sure, secondary characters sometimes have derpy faces, coloring is off, backgrounds are mostly simple and Eririn's expressions from 48 episode are creepy. 
But! Those faces are not copypasted plastic mannequins (like in Sailor Moon Crystal). 
 
Cons: show is repetitive (songs, some scenes), sometimes prolonged where it not supposed to. 
 
Overall, I did enjoy my time with Idol Densetsu Eriko, and I'm definitely not a romance fan.  In the end, there was plenty of room for improvement, but it was quite a charming show. I'll give it a 7+.

Join Irisviel as she helps Disciple No. Zero understand more details and history relating to the Holy Grail War.",['Comedy'],"The story of Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The Holy Grail War is a contest, founded by the Einzbern, Matou, and Tohsaka families centuries ago, in which seven mages summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete and obtain the power of the ""Holy Grail"", which grants a wish to each member of the winning duo.  After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.
The Einzbern family is determined to achieve victory in the Fourth War after three consecutive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the notorious ""mage killer,"" Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs all means necessary to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person often comes at the cost of another's life. Thus, this is the source of conflict he once sought to eliminate due to finite resources/abilities. For the sake of humanity, he resolves to ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.
However, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family – his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya – and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest. The latter is trying to discover his true nature in his quest to find the Holy Grail, which is revealed to be monstrous and full of hate. He sets his sights on Kiritsugu as a kindred spirit and possible answer to the emptiness he feels.
Towards the conclusion, the limitations of the ""Holy Grail"" are found to be in the fact that, while omnipotent in its wish-granting abilities, it is not omniscient, and therefore depends on the victor's knowledge and methods to determine the way by which the wish is carried out. And, to make things worse, the last war fought over the Grail has corrupted it, causing any wish granted by the Grail to be a Monkey's Paw.
","This anime is for those who have played the Fate/stay night VN, as it is very reminiscent of the Tiger Dojo. To be clear, the Tiger Dojo is the room that the FSN player ends up in when he chooses a bad ending in the VN. The Einzbern Soudanshitsu plays much the same role for F/Z. 
 
Story: The consultation room carries very little of its own story, instead relying on the parent work of F/Z for the story. It does help to fill in some missing information for the new-to-Fate series watcher, at least in the first 2 episodes, and even VN readers will discover a new thing or two. 
 
Having watched this after watching F/Z, I might suggest that this show can or even should be watched in line with certain of the Fate/zero episodes so that the watcher can create (partially) the same tone that FSN VN has when when the FSN reader hits a bad ending. While there may be some references which the watcher won't understand without having read the FSN VN or without having seen at least the FSN Fate and UBW paths in their entirety, I didn't see anything in particular which might spoil F/Z in particular episodes. 
 
Episode 1 can be watched any time after F/Z episode 1. Episode 2 can be watched after F/Z episode 4. Episode 3 is a little weird from a timeline perspective but should probably be watched after F/Z episode 4 or later. Episode 4 can be watched after F/Z episode 15. Episode 5 can be watched after F/Z episode 16. Episode 6 can be watched after F/Z episode 24. 
 
Art: The art resembles the ""cheaper"" art that one would find in the Tiger Dojo of the FSN VN, which when compared to F/Z is still nothing to scoff at. Animation wise, there is much less movement than in F/Z. 
 
Sound: The sound was merely good (I didn't notice it in particular). 
 
Character: I think this actually adds to the character of the involved parties. While it might not be canon, episodes 3 to 6 carry an interesting tone for each of the characters and aid in understanding what that character was thinking or feeling given the corresponding time period in F/Z. 
 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it, given my general enjoyment of the Tiger Dojo. The consultation room is not however what many will expect tone-wise compared to F/Z, given that it does create a more similar atmosphere to Tiger Dojo. The tone in general is much lighter and may even cause laughter (shock) compared to F/Z.

          
 
       Helpful At first, sorry for my bad english. This is my first review. 
First off, I expected cute little descriptions and facts about what is going on in Fate/Zero for people that are new to the franchise but I got so much more than that and the ending was outstanding and made me love the whole thing even more. I already really loved the Tiger Dojo in the VN, so to see this reminded to this wonderful time. I am not the best critic because I love this franchise just so much but anyway, I recommend everyone who is at least a bit interested in the franchise to watch this. I guarantee that you won't regret watching this if you have already seen Fate/Zero. 


          
 
       Helpful This is Fate/Zeros version of the Tiger-Dojo from Fate/Stay Night. As such it explains quite a bit of background-information, both on the war in general and on certain servants. While this is mostly lighthearted fun (“you snuck in all proud of yourself just because a cool-sounding Kajiura theme was playing”), there soon starts to be an increasing amount of weirdly dark scenes. And while Irisviel seems to be quite nice for the most part, some of her decisions become questionable... 
 
All of this would already be quite nice, but the thing that really turns this into more than just an explanatory series is the absolutely magnificant second halve of the last episode which takes a sudden turn into a MUCH darker direction.

The story centers on the fight between Tenma, one of the 88 Saints following Athena, and Alone, the reincarnation of the God Hades. While the two were close childhood friends in Greece alongside Alone's sister, Sasha, the trio separated. Sasha was sent first to the Sanctuary and then, a short time later, Tenma was sent to the Sanctuary too; while Tenma had the Cosmos, the Saints' energy, awaken, Sasha was revealed to be the reincarnation of Athena. As years passes, everything that Alone paints is destroyed, and he is convinced that death means salvation by the god Hypnos and his follower Pandora. Alone then gathers Hades' soldiers, the 108 Specters to start a war against Athena.
During the war, the Saints and the Specters face off. Tenma and Sasha have to deal with Alone who starts making the ""Lost Canvas"", a vast painting of the earth, in the sky, so that after he finishes it, the entire world will die. With Alone still not being fully controlled by the soul of Hades, Pandora, alongside Hypnos and his brother Thanatos lead the Specters. However, as the two Gods are sealed by the former Saints Pope Sage and his twin brother Altar Hakurei, Alone invites the few remaining Saints to the Demonic Temples located in the Lost Canvas. Once the Saints go through the Temples, it is revealed that Alone is not possessed by Hades and is instead using the god's powers for his own motives. Additionally, Tenma's parents, Mephistopheles Yōma and Owl Partita appear as Specters in the Temples to force their son to transform his protective Pegasus Bronze Cloth into the most powerful armour, God Cloth. With the God Cloth, Tenma and his future reincarnations will be able to fight the Gods and aid Athena in ending all wars.
Following several battles in the Temples, Tenma faces Alone one-on-one with the former managing to defeat the latter, causing the Lost Canvas' destruction. Shortly afterwards, Alone is possessed by Hades who aims to kill Athena. Hades is forced by the souls from the deceased Saints to escape to the last Demonic Temple, and Tenma, Sasha, and Alone decide to follow him. The three manage to defeat Hades but they never return to Earth. The two surviving Saints, Libra Dohko and Aries Shion, then prepare for a possible future war against Hades. Libra Dohko was assigned to permanently watch over the seal of Hades and 108 specters, while Aries Shion reconstructs and leads the Athena's Sanctuary.

       Helpful What is it about? If you are asking yourself this question, and have never seen Saint Seiya, then this is definitely not for you. 
 
Indeed this is only for Saint Seiya fans. Its basically a remake of the Hades saga but in an alternate universe. There are major changes in the plot composition though - enough changes to make it unpredictable enough. The characters cast are very different and fans will get an appreciation of the characters which have been traditionally left out or marginalised in the canonical Kurumada's original Saint Seiyas animes. 
 
Effectively this seems like a reaction to fans's eternal complains about certain characters e.g. Jabu of unicorn, Aldebaran and Aphrodite of Pisces among others who are always, so to say, left out of the big picture. Here we do get a better appreciation of these Knights and their abilities, and also a fair amount of airing time is devoted to the other Gold Saints too. 
 
The series seems to revolve around the previous holy war between the Hades camp and that of Athena, and often devolve into mini stories exposing the powers and personality of each Gold Saint and other important characters. 
 
For Saint Seiya fan this will not fail to be a 10. But those who have not watched the whole of the Saint Seiya saga will somewhat lack the appreciation needed to fully enjoy this and could be bit lost and probably might find the battle meaningless and boring since they can't relate well to the characters.

A colorful children's music video about a clumsy bear, what he is—and is not—and what he likes and dislikes.","['Kids', 'Music', 'Slice of Life']",none,"I'm a sucker for cute animals. When I accidentally stumbled upon the music video Boku Wa Kuma, I was delighted to find that it was about the cuddliest bear I've seen since the Care Bears. While the music video does not offer much in terms of character and story, it's a good waste of two minutes if you want to see a loveable bear do adorable things. 
 
There isn't much of a plot to begin with; it's about an average day in the life of a bear. The problem is the bear's life is pretty mundane and boring – he doesn't do much besides sweep his room and wear buttons for eyes. In fact, the high point of the music video is when he uses milk and orange juice to grow a plant. This is a very easy-to-follow video. The only thing that is any bit confusing is why a baseball falls from the sky and comes crashing into the bear's window. Where did it come from? 
 
Although this music video is short, you learn quite a large amount of important information about the bear. The bear's rival is a fried shrimp. He thinks he was a chocolate in a previous life. He doesn't like to fight. While this crustacean-hating pacifist with a sweet tooth isn't cleaning his room, he's playing his guitar that sounds remarkably like a piano. He's also very easily-entertained and has a broad imagination since at one point he draws himself being scorched by what looks to be Godzilla's long-lost cousin. Make of that what you will.  
 
The music is the best part about the music video. Hikaru Utada's voice is very soothing. However, the lyrics aren't all that great – half the song is the bear singing over and over that he's a bear. No, really? There's also some bad French that was added in the middle of the song for no reason whatsoever. 
 
The whole video is all in stop-motion animation. It was pretty well done, and the bear begs to be hugged to death. The only ugly thing is when his crayon drawings start to move – he can't draw worth a damn. 
 
This is a simple music video for children. If you've had a hard day at school or work and want to relax, or have young siblings, I recommend this video to you. Otherwise, pass it up.

They embark on various adventures while contending with an extremist group called the Eye of the Midnight Sun, whose leadership is manipulated by a Devil in avenging an injustice committed against the Elves by the Clover Kingdom at the time of its founding. The Magic Knights then face the Dark Triad of the Spade Kingdom, with Asta and Yuno learning of their Devils’ influence on their lives and of the Dark Triad’s plan to fully manifest the Devils into their world.
","As low as I've rated the first jump festa, I couldn't imagine it there could be a record-breaking bedrock. This was almost an insult. 
I get they were trying to pull something off on the fans as a sort of thank you for your support, but they could have gone a different way and still make it better. 
The humor in this was just one forced shitfest that tried a lot harder and ended up very cringy and with no results. There were key moments and jokes that get to you, but only as far as making you almost crack a smile, nothing more. 
The stupid looking hats were there and got me triggered on how color vibrant they are, which doesn't fit in the cold atmosphere of Black Clover, they stood out way too much it was annoyingly distracting, and let's not forgot how weirdly American they look, totally ruined a lot of the episode.

       Helpful I usually never watch specials since they are mostly fillers, but depends. This one is kinda weird, captains and guests get asked questions about certain parts of the anime. It was kind of a reminder of the previous parts that took place before.  
Nothing special, but the ending was really nice. Loved the characters breaking the 4th wall as if the creators / studio was talking to the viewers.  
 
Other than that, there's nothing of much interest other than silly questions and moments. Unless you want to attend the quiz yourself or something.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

It will feature a new story.,"['Mystery', 'Horror']","The story about the boy named Hiroshi, who is trapped with his friends, investigates a deserted mansion that is rumored to be haunted. Upon entering the mansion you and your friends discover that the mansion is haunted by a mysterious creature named the Ao Oni (青鬼 in Japanese, literally ""Blue Demon"") a tall creature with a deformed face that proceeds to chase you and your friends through out the mansion. Sealing all exits.
There are four different versions of the game, each with their own puzzles, maps and endings. Only the two latest versions have been officially translated.
","I'd like to start off this review with a few warnings. First and foremost this review will contain spoilers. Second; if you haven't seen the movie here's a tip. DON'T. 
 
I've been a fan of the ao oni game for a long time. I was excited for the short animated series to come out but unfortunately it was a flop. Then I heard there was going to be an animated movie. ""At least it can't be worse than the series"" I thought to myself. I was wrong. 
 
Story: 1 
 
The story(?) revolves around a club who finds out their town has a urban legend that's similar to the ao oni game. They get in contact with the creator of the game in hopes to find out more about how the two are connected. The first half is mostly talking. Just a bunch of students sitting around a desk talking. So exciting. In the second half we find out that the ao oni is living... under the school.... One by one the students start to get picked off but it's impossible to care since none of them have anything close to a personality. In fact I just found myself laughing every time it happened. Then somehow it turns out one of the students has been having sex with a plant, which caused his genitals to rot and fall off and turns him into an ao oni. I wish I was joking. I really really do. People keep dying and then the movie throws one last plot twist at us but honestly all I could think about at the time was how close I was to finishing the god awful thing. 
 
 
Art: 1 
Studio Deen why. The art is purely CG, which if done right isn't usually that bad. In this case though? It was bad. Real bad. You'd find better animation watching one of those stupid Vocaloid MMD music videos on YouTube. It was painful to watch.  
 
 
Sound: 2 
The only reason I'm giving the sound a 2 is because I'm in love with Shikata Akiko who does the films ending theme. The background music was bland and forgettable, but at least they kept the classic Ao Oni theme in there. The voice acting was nothing special and I honestly pity every voice actor who had to be a part of this. 
 
Character: 1 
The characters were unlikeable and none of them had a personality. It's hard to find a character death sad when you have no attachment to said character thus every single one of the deaths made me laugh. Hell I don't even remember any of there names even though half of the movie was them shouting each other's names not to mention the fact that I started writing this right after the movie ended. The character designs were bland too. It was just a horrible cast. 
 
Enjoyment: 1 
N O 
 
In all this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even worth a watch for the comedic moments and by that I mean character deaths. How can something like this even be considered a horror. Instead of watching this movie I suggest just going back and playing the game, or maybe watch a playthrough of it. All I can do now is wish for that hour of my life back and try to somehow cleanse my brain of this shitshow they tried to call a movie. Please love yourself and don't watch it.

          
 
       Helpful If you thought the Ao Oni comedy shorts were bad, wait until you see this - it's even worse. The comedy shorts are a masterpiece compared to this tripe. 
 
Story: This is apparently a story based off the game; too bad there is no story. The majority of the hour long movie is the characters sitting around talking and nothing happening. It takes place in a school, not in the usual mansion. There is a story there somewhere, but it's lost in the boring, awkward telling. 
 
Animation: Studio Deen, who brought us such animation fail classics like Axis Powers Hetalia and Higurashi, are the animators of this. I was hardly surprised when I found out they were responsible. Needless to say, Studio Deen have kept up their trope of animating badly, leaving the series looking like a slightly updated version of MMD. The expressions of the character are poor and almost ridiculous even by anime standards and the characters move slow and stiff like machinery. And the animation of the monster is just terrible. It's also in 3D, not that watching it in 3D makes it any better or easier to get through. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is pretty decent but not great. The music is irritating and drove me to despair. I had to pause every few minutes just to take a break. Honestly I wonder whether the voice actors will have careers after this. 
 
Characters: The characters in this movie aren't Hiroshi & co, but a bunch of new characters. There's zero character development, the characters are one-dimensional, boring and have the personality of a gnat. There's no way you can form connections with the characters or even like them. I don't even remember their names.  
 
Enjoyment: I hate every single second. I get more enjoyment from watching paint dry. There's no horror, no nothing. 
 
Overall: 0/10. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and if I could give myself amnesia so I could forget this, I would. Avoid this and the comedy shorts, watch something better.

Many reviewers are very harsh about this movie but they're just judgy don't you worry! 
Although the art style isn't perfect the overall movie was just amazing. 
It had me surprised, shocked and bursting out of laughter <--- at the end of the review I'll say why 
Many people say that the chibi anime was better but let's be honest it's not :3 
We don't know the story of Aoonie and the game doesn't need to be the only example of Its story, we don't always need to be in a mansion -_- (We're no Ricegum or Pauls) 
This story is amazing and it takes Aoonie to the whole other universe :P BUT I GUESS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THE AOONIE IS CAPTURED AND KEPT IN THE MANSION UNDER SOME MAGIC TALISMAN AND HAVE A SCENE AT THE END WITH THE 4 CHARACTERS FROM THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD FINALLY FEEL F*ING GOOD HUH? (Hey that's a pretty good idea XD) 
 
 
 
==SMALL_SPOILERS==== 
When we find out about the lady in the mountains and the whole Aoonie creation I was like BOI... BOI U F*ED A F*ING FLOWER  
And that whole SUCCing scene I was like WHAT THE F IS HAPPENING?!?! AND THAT FACE (XD) BRUH WHEN SPRING COMES U KNOW WHAT PLANS I HAVE... LILIES ""IM HARD AND IM COMING"" ~Counselor David

clueless to what was said as indicated so rather than grading via the usual lyrics, tempo and misc. I will stick to the last two in general.

art:some songs are sad(country/slight pop/some classical/ mostly opera, grabs tissue). While some are angry(heavy metal, some rock). This being what i saw as comecial matched the song. You have a goofy main character and his somewhat wacky antics. Not only are you getting some listening pleasure but a small show worth watching. Which is mostly why this got a 6 for me. If you can make a song slightly better with video you have done your job on the music video. Take Mc Hammer of example. good songs but his video ""can't touch this"" was superb!. I wonder why(smirks)?

       Helpful To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Aruite Mikka. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also GlassesBoi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Aruite Mikka truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in GlassesBoi's existential catchphrase “Ochinchin sugoi desu,” which itself is a geniusly outplanned reference to humanitys downfall. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as i touch myself with GlassesBoi in thought... What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 
 
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Aruite Mikka tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

However, he unexpectedly runs into ""the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level""—Taiga Aisaka—who just happens to be Minori's best friend. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and has a habit of snapping violently at people. She takes an instant dislike to Ryuji, and it turns out she is living in an apartment facing Ryuji's house. When Ryuji discovers that Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, and Taiga finds out about Ryuji's affections towards Minori, they make an arrangement to help set each other up with their crushes.
Over the course of the series, Ryuji and Taiga try to set up romantic situations to help each other get to know their friends, but many of the situations backfire. Their classmates observe that they are spending a lot of time with each other, leading to rumors that they might be a couple. Although Ryuji and Taiga try to dispel the rumors, they find that they do enjoy each other's company, with Taiga visiting Ryuji's house to share meals, and Ryuji checking up on Taiga to get her to school, and cleaning for her.

In spite of this, Taiga tries to put up with her antics as Yusaku wants them to all get along, and Ami begins to grow feelings for Ryuji. The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them.
","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

","The series starts off okay with what seems like a standard dark vs light story. However midway through the series they throw a curve ball and from there this series kicks into overdrive with 2 fantastic episodes. 
 
The 3rd episode is mostly an action horror and does a great job at it with the intimidating villain that cuts his way through everyone in his path. 
 
Very sad well thought out ending. If I were to keep a list of the best endings in anime this would be on it. I have a weakness for parent child stories and the ending hits that weakness very hard.

          
 
       Helpful I actually rather liked this anime, it's one of those good old ones where there's a girl that ALWAYS loses all of her clothes at some point and ALWAYS has to be saved.  
The actual storyline is pretty sweet, and does actually make sense eventually, and completely fullfills all the supernaturalness it promises.  
 The amount of blood and guts is satisfactory, and mixes nicely with the amount of 'love' (both maternal, friend and sexual).  
 Overall i'd say it's worth a casual watch, if only for the sake of having seen yet another anime where the main charecter is a supernatural being that get's blonde hair when they power up... not that it's common or anything *wink wink*

Eventually only three are left: Conan, Rachel, and another child named Hideki Moroboshi. They follow Jack the Ripper to a train and reveals Jack among the passengers. However, Jack captures Rachel and sets the train on a runaway course. After being unable to stop the train, Conan and Hideki confront Jack on top of the train where he has tied himself to Rachel. Hoping that Conan can figure out the situation, Rachel sacrifices herself by jumping off the train and into a ravine, pulling Jack with her. As Conan begins to lose hope, Sherlock Holmes appears and gives Conan some useful advice that eventually helps Conan and Hideki survive the game when the train crashes into the station.
After winning the game, Conan reveals that Hideki is actually Hiroki, who has manifested himself as Noah's Ark. In a private conversation, Hiroki says he was satisfied with the outcome, as he was hoping the kids can paint a brighter future than their parents, and that he was happy he could also participate as a player in the game. He releases the children from the game and then erases himself.
","This movie used to be one of my least favorites in the series. Back then, I found it to be weird and somewhat contrived. I understand that this statement may displease some fans. After all, Detective Conan: The Phantom of Baker Street is unarguably a very popular movie among them all and is often considered the best one in the whole series. To this day, I still don't necessarily agree with these opinions. That said, I can finally see why it is that people love this movie so much and why it is still worth recommending to this day. 
 
One of the things I found to be very fun about this movie is how it implemented the fiction of Arthur Conan Doyle into the world of 19th century London. The environments of industrial London are very well designed and the fan service for Sherlock fans is, admittedly, a pretty fun treat. The movie felt a lot more like an action-adventure story than the usual ""stay-in-one-place"" murder stories in most movies.  
 
One of the things that I originally didn't liked was the perpetrators motivation to trap all of the children under threat of death. Even now when I do understand what he really meant to do, it still feels kind of weird, ya know? You don't just go saying things like that only to reveal that you meant completely different. Among other criticisms, the fact that the whole movie takes place inside a game is pretty silly, I thought Yusako's case in the real world was basic(the fact that he had to wait for Conan to reveal the culprit's motive was contrived), most of the dialogue is pretty clumsy and hammy(e.g., the villain revealing his goal), and how there is barley any lack of tension when one of the characters gets offed in the game. 
 
My criticisms may look many, but I assure you that this movie is still quite good. If you just choose to let things be as they are and not worry too much about it, then The Phantom of Baker Street can still be a fun, good time.

Obvious clue of intrest can be told from the Movie's title, that the storyline will deal with Holmes. This asspect of the storyline for Detective Conan fans is a good thing, because if you know Conan/Shinji, you know that he is a major Conan Doyal fan. 
 
Also, there is the odd technollogy which does not exist yet, the virtual reality system. This is a change from most Detective Conan storylines as we are dealing with something that has not come into being yet. For the most part, new technollogies are introduced as possibilities when they become possibilities, so this adds an interesting effect. Even Dr. Asaga's inventions have some bases in current reality. 
 
Also, the story line is quite involved with the details of who when and why, the clues being dropped all throughout the virtual reality world. If one doesn't yet know about Sherlock Holmes, I do suggest learning somethings, as that would make the movie even more enjoyable then it is.

With a burnt out drunk named Eiichi Suo for a coach the girls must not only contend with problems in the arena but also unforseen circumstances that arise in day to day life. Only through protecting their friends, understanding their enemies, and eventually challenging their idol Aquamarine, can Miku and the girls understand Eiichi's purpose and the shady secrets behind Neo Wrestling.

In this, Miku, a young flighty girl is set to join her friends as the tag team known as the Pretty Four. However, the competition is fierce, and their opponents are ready to do whatever it takes to win. Against this, the Four manage to obtain the services of an eccentric coach who trained their hero, Aquamarine. With his guidance, the four start on their fight for the top as they must train with almost inhuman discipline while their matches become more and more challenging as their opponents raise in the ranks.
","I came across this title by accident, but the concept sounded interesting, so I gave it a try and I did enjoy it. 
 
Story: 
 
The story is straight forward. It's about a group of pro wrestlers by the name of The Pretty Four, who enter a tournament to be the best.  
 
The plot is easy to follow. The girls fight their opponents, and in some episodes face deeper dilemmas. It's nothing ground breaking, or complex, but it is entertaining, and something light to watch.  
 
There is one episode that strikes me as out there (I just didn't think it fit with the rest of the series), but the other twelve are good.  
 
The pacing is pretty fast. I would have liked a little more depth, and more build up, but that's just my personal tastes. 
 
I like that what little romance is present takes a back seat to the main story. There are a few hints that a character might like another, but it's never expanded upon. The only time that actually happens is used more for  plot and character development. 
 
Characters: 
 
There is some decent characterization in this anime (not as good as some other titles, but decent).  
 
The title character Miku is likable. She is not perfect, nor is she annoying, and she has some character growth throughout the series. Ginko has some good character development, making her one of the more interesting cast members. However the other two of The Pretty Four -Nana and Sayaka- are pretty forgettable. 
 
Yoko serves a strong and respectable antagonist. Her father, however, comes across as two-dimensional-I still don't understand his motives. 
 
Still, the character I find to be the most developed of the bunch is the coach, Eiichi. I find him to have the greatest depth, an interesting backstory, and a believable personality. 
 
Art: 
 
I found the art to be decent. It was standard for its time, but it may not hold up to the art of today's anime.

The art is nothing spectacular, but it serves its purpose.

The opening song is catchy. It's light-hearted and upbeat, perfectly matching the show itself. The ending song is also rather enjoyable. There is also a song that the girls sing (yes, they are singers in addition to wrestlers), and I think it's a cute song. 
 
The voice acting (at least with the English dub) is average for some characters and less than impressive with others. I wasn't blown away by voice talent with this one. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I did enjoy this series. It is fun, it's easy to understand. For the most part, the main characters are likable. There is some good comedy thrown in to keep it from being a serious drama. There are plenty of cheesy moments as well, but I think that adds to its charm. Mostly, it kept my interest, and I was curious to find out what would happen next. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
I like the anime, and I'm glad that I stumbled upon it while looking for something else. There is action, drama, and a good bit of comedy. Some parts are corny, but in a good way. If you want something that is fun and easy to watch, I recommend this one. 

          
 
       Helpful This anime was truly amazing when I watched it as a child. The beginning and ending songs were catchy, the characters were likable, etc. If you like animes that have the girl character that grows into some type of role, then you'll love this one. 
 
It kind of reminds me of Sailor Moon, how Usagi was ridiculously clumsy and stuff for awhile but then she grew into her role. It's also similar in that respect to Kaleido Star. Sora wasn't the best until she worked at it. So is Miku :) I definitely recommend it to any who are looking for that type of anime :)

Due to his parents’ business plans, Sana Hidaka has to move away from his quiet childhood home to the boisterous city of Tokyo. Though it pains him, he must say goodbye to his precious friends—the kind-hearted Aoi Oribe, the spunky Wakatsuki twins, Shuri and Shuusuke, and the cheerful and upbeat Nanaka Yatsushiro. But even though he is reluctant to leave them behind, he believes that no matter how far apart they are, they will always cherish the memories of their friendship. 
 
Five years later, Sana, now a 16-year-old high school student, returns to his hometown with the hope of restoring his old life. However, he quickly realizes that although his town may not have changed drastically, the friends he left behind are not who they used to be. Unsettling shadows loom over Sakuranomori as his friends hold new secrets and bear burdens that threaten the bonds they once shared. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","Myself ; Yourself is set in 2007 in the fictional town Sakuranomori (桜乃杜) in W Prefecture which is modeled after Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. The town is in a quiet, rural area on the southern tip of the prefecture and borders the Pacific Ocean. Sakuranomori is the birthplace of Sana Hidaka, a sixteen-year-old high school student, who grew up with his childhood friends Nanaka Yatsushiro & Aoi Oribe, his best friend Shusuke Wakatsuki, and Shusuke's fraternal twin sister Shuri Wakatsuki. Sana left Sakuranomori when he was eleven years old, but returns five years later living on his own in the apartment building Aoi's family runs. Sana soon finds out that while some things have stayed the same, there are still just as many things that have changed.
","Myself; Yourself is the story of Sana and his four childhood friends, whom he gets separated with after having to move away. He comes back after about five years, finding some of his friends remaining the same, and others very much different. Though it might come across as a stereotypical harem, at a closer look much more is unfolded in the story. It&rsquo;s a romance, but often steers towards friendship as well.  
 
It&rsquo;s not a bad watch, but I certainly can&rsquo;t say I loved it. The plot was a little hard to grasp on what it really was. Through the first half of the series before it started going anywhere it was more like a weak thread of events. Some episodes were dramatic and interesting, but not all of the emotion seemed very real.  
 
Character development was okay, but I really disliked the main character, Sana. That&rsquo;s not very good when you&rsquo;re watching a series: you don&rsquo;t even like the protagonist. I suppose those type of leads I never really like, he just annoys me. Nanaka, too, the main girl, was a little irritating. She acted depressed and moody, and it doesn&rsquo;t come clear until late into the show as to what her problem is. Mostly it just seemed like she was on her time of the month throughout the show, considering her emotions, which were all over the place. However, I did like some of the other characters, like the twins, Shuusuke and Shuri. They were very sweet towards one another&hellip; I was wishing they weren&rsquo;t even brother and sister as I watched episode ten, but I won&rsquo;t tell you what went on: you have to see for yourself! Generally the majority of characters seem stereotypical, except for Aoi, her character was pretty unique. She was very amusing. There is also Asami, a classmate of our characters&rsquo;, who appears normal and helpful. However, it is not all what it seems with her, and I much changed my opinion of Asami later on. That was very surprising, and added a twist to the story. Lastly there&rsquo;s Hinako, a young girl desperate to be referred to as mature, who gets infatuated with Shuusuke after he helps her out against some bullies. 
 
The animation was fairly nice, and I liked the way the faces and characters were generally drawn. However, inconsistency often was portrayed in the animation movements, and it lacked fluidity. Some of the poses or stances they were put in, too, were awkward. The colors however, were pretty, and though it was definitely not outstanding it was all in all pleasing to the eye. 
 
The sound was really nice, and I liked the opening and ending themes, enough to get both the mp3s, they're both very good and fit the anime nicely. Background music was standard, nothing that stands out, anyway. As for seiyuu, everyone did a fairly good job, with the right amount of feeling put into their voice. Sana&rsquo;s voice fit him, as did the others. Aoi&rsquo;s voice might be the most annoying, but I actually liked it, even though it&rsquo;d be a bit hard to listen to, ahaha.. ha. 
 
Myself; Yourself is nothing of great value, but it&rsquo;s a nice show to watch. I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly heartily recommend it, but try it out and see what you think. Obviously there&rsquo;s mixed reviews, if you check out the reviews written prior to mine (and that&rsquo;s a lot!).

          
 
       Helpful I've had a lot of first impressions when I see an anime. Most of them end up being what I've had predicted while a few changes my perspective. 
 
Myself; Yorself is an example of an illusion. Seeing pictures of anime high school friends in one picture always seem to look like a typical comedy, romance, shoujo or a harem anime. That was what I thought. 
 
Story: 9 
To be honest, I was part of the majority who thought ""Myself; Yourself"" was a harem anime. I've seen Myself; Yourself a number of times in different sites but the only reaction I usually get was ""oh another stupid harem anime. give me a break"". It took me about a year for me to take the initiative to watch this anime only because one of my favorite Seiyuus, Ami Koshimizu, voice acted the main character. I rarely rate a Romantic-Drama ""9"" because I rarely see one that can execute well. You can say this anime, has more of a dramatic based genre rather than romance because of the friendship link between the characters. Every episode gives you a glimpse of the story of these characters and true enough the story does get more interesting as you go further. It made me want more and more. Soon enough, I was able to finish this anime in just 2 days (It could have been 1 day if I slept at 3 AM). Yes, the story was that interesting. 
 
Art: 9 
I can't deny that the art/animation I see nowadays does progress and becomes much more beautiful than the animes that were made in the late 2000s. But seeing the animes made during that year (Code Geass, School Days, ef-a tale of memories), I'm sure that the art was on par with every anime back then.

I really don't like the Opening ""Song"" although I love how the Opening ""Animation"" went (there's a difference). Although, the Ending song is much different. I actually liked the Ending song just because it reminded me of Steins; Gate (same singer) and it felt catchy. 
 
Character: 10 
Character development, sure flourished the whole anime series. The characters were explained very well. You can see that their lives were acted on each of the person's lives. Some secrets were revealed during the anime and it did surprise me. I can't say I don't hate a character but then seeing how these characters went by during the anime made me understand how different people can be behind the naked eye. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Knowing that I watched this 13-episode Anime within just 2 days clearly explains how I had a great time watching this anime. I don't think it's the enjoyment that led me to watch the anime in 2 days. I guess it was because I was curious to know what would be next. The anime was such a thrilling anime to watch that I was seeking for more answers from the upcoming episodes. I could have enjoyed this anime much more if only there was a different ending. To be frank, the ending was kind of laid back for me. For me, there was no spark at the ending. 
 
Overall: 8 
Seeing how an anime can create romance in such a serious dramatic anime won me over. This anime is one of those ""don't judge a book by its cover"" because if you do then you will surely miss out something worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful Friendships, reuniting, departure, all of these 3 make the theme of the story. This isn't a dating anime despite Sana being surrounded by girls because he never took the initiative or had interest in any of them other than Nanaka. Aside from that Myself;Yourself revolves around the importance of friendships and why they should be valued.  
 
Story: The moment I saw the first episode I knew this would be a great anime. Story wise I liked it every aspect of it, but I do feel like Sana's background regarding his past was presented too late. Still every character made the story very good. The twins with their hilarious comedy, Aoi and her child like voice, Hinako and her pretend to be mature self. Every character added their own qualities and characteristics to make the story strong. 
 
Art: Not much to say here except for the amazing background and character designs. I'm not a fan of red eyes, but Sana's red eyes fit his personality and show his past that he keeps for himself. Aoi on the other hand grew a lot up there, short hair, and still kept that child like voice. Aoi's characteristics sure suit her voice.  
 
 
Character: My least disliked character was Hoshino not because of what she did, but because of her actions with Sana I didn't really like. The characters I hated the most was that lazy employee always next to the principal because he never stated adequate reasons when a student was in trouble, he always took the principals' side because it was convenient. The other character I hated was Sana's father because of his actions he took. I will never forgive him for that. Nanaka is one of my favorite characters despite being reserved she is a sweet, caring, and also pretty. One thing I will never forget is that pout face she showed. 
 
Did I enjoy Myself;Yourself? Absolutely. Why? 3 reasons, story had my full attention, always wanted to know what the next episode was about, and Nanaka captivated my heart. I hope there's a second season or at least an OVA episode where Sana and the others reunite because the ending was a bit rushed. We can imply what happened, but as viewers we want to see what happens after, not imply what happens.Still I haven't had a good cry since the first anime I watched last year, and Myself;Yourself executed that perfectly, enough to make me cry again. 10/10

Yuuji planted the seed in his garden and watered it. The next morning, it had grown into a small toy-like blue house. Yuuji chanted, ""Grow bigger!"" while continuing to take care of it. Before long, it had grown bigger and a small chick started living in it, saying, ""This is my house!""
The house continued growing bigger and bigger. A cat and a pig took up residence there as well. Yuuji's friends all came over and had a great time in the house. Soon, all kinds of forest animals and neighborhood kids came to the house as it grew larger and larger. When the house had grown really large, the fox came by and was astonished at how large the house had grown. He told Yuuji he would like to return the model airplane and take back the house. So, all the animals and children in the house left.
The fox entered the house by himself and quickly locked all the doors and windows. Yuuji said, ""Oh no! The sun is going to crash into the house!"" The sun did just that, causing the house to crumble and disappear. After that, the fox collapsed in a faint where the seed had been planted.
","I know, I know. How could I rate something by Ghibli so low? 
 
One reviewer even said it was on par with their other works! Rather that review was serious or not, I have to disagree.  
 
First off, the art is okay for a ""made for kids"" television short. Not great, not good, just okay. That's fine though, as obviously that wasn't the focus here. 
 
But then, just what was the focus? The story is simple, the characters aren't memorable. Sure, they are memorable in the sense of ""there was a fox in this short"", but not memorable in a sense of actual character work. Again, story and characters probably aren't the focus of a less than 2 minute short either. 
 
If I had to wager a guess, I'd say this short was made solely for the purpose of being pleasant for any young viewers watching at home between TV programs. In that regard, it's successful.  
 
This is a pleasant short with a relaxing song playing in the background. If you never end up watching it, you aren't missing out. If you do decide to spend a minute of your time, you'll get a pleasant short that might not stick with you for what it was, but for the relaxed feeling it gave you.  
 
Even if only for a little while.

          
 
       Helpful It's funny, but even though this is one of the shortest animes I have ever watched, it still is one of those with the deepest meaning in it. 
 
It is just like a insight in the human mind. The more you give, the more you share with others, the better you feel, the merrier the company and the bigger your home, life and heart. But who wants to have everything for himself and himself alone will be left with nothing in the end and fall down from his imaginary house. 
I can just recommend everyone to watch it, it is very cute in the way of art and the short, deep story is simply amazing :)

          
 
       Helpful Transfixed? Yes. No other words can depict my emotions after watching Sora Iro no Tane. My natural conscious is overwhelmed by the beauty and intricate style of this masterpiece. With brilliant deliverance, Sora Iro no Tane tops my list of short anime. Why? 
 
The art is brilliance. In a whirlpool of elephants and other animals, one will feel the experience of living through the episode. The character designs are flawless for the one minute they appear. All characters are distinct with innate characteristics.  
 
If you have a minute, sit down and watch because this is on par with Studio Ghibli's other works.

Troubled by the news, Yuu decides to take a walk, on which he spots a girl he falls in love with at first sight. He decides to follow this unaware girl and falls more in love with her. However he discovers who the girl really is...she's the daughter of his parents' new lovers.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Romance', 'Shoujo']","Miki Koishikawa's ordinary life as a sophomore in high school is turned upside down when her parents suddenly announce that they are getting divorced in order to swap partners with a couple they met back in Hawaii. They seek her approval of the shocking change, and while at a restaurant during dinner where Miki meets the other couple as well as their teenage son Yuu Matsura, who is around her age, she reluctantly agrees to the arrangement. At first, Yuu appears to be a complete jerk who takes every opportunity to make fun of and tease Miki, but he actually turns out to be fun and attractive, and Miki finds herself falling in love with him. Little by little, she accepts her new family arrangement and opens up to Yuu as they become best friends.
After a while, Miki and Yuu's relationship starts to become complicated because of the former relationships that they've had and developed with other characters. These include Miki's long time classmate and former crush from middle school, Ginta Suou, and Yuu's former girlfriend from his previous school, Arimi Suzuki. A secondary subplot develops when Miki's best friend, Meiko Akizuki, herself starts to have her own problems because of the relationship she has gotten into with one of the school teachers, Shin'ichi Namura.
Throughout the series, Miki and Yuu's relationship is further developed and tried, influenced by the other characters around them and the relationships that they develop with these characters.
","Marmalade boy was a drama about about two sets of parents getting a divorce, and swaping partners. When their the son (yuu) and daughter (miki) of both couple meet each other, they fall in love, however the anime countinues on with rivaley, new discoveres and so for.  
 
Marmalade Boy the movie, take you back to the start of the anime, and show how yuu fell in love with miki, which was before miki meet yuu, which was not shown in the anime.

          
 
       Helpful Marmalade Boy the movie really isn't what most people would think a movie would be like. It is quite short. So don't go into this movie thinking it's a full length movie, think more along the lines of it being a bonus episode.  
 
I really did like this a lot and it made me understand the character of Yuu a lot more. When watching the TV series I found myself frustrated at Yuu. I could not understand how he could love a girl when they had only just met, plus a lot of the time I would question what Yuu's true feelings for her were. This movie helped me cast away all my doubts about my Yuu and made me really fall in love with the idea of Yuu/Miki. The story is brilliant. It really makes you get how Yuu felt when his family said they were getting a divorce. The shots that were showed helped understand what it is about Miki that Yuu loves so much about her. It was also great seeing other characters and what they were like before the series begun.  
 
I definitely do think Marmalade Boy the Movie is great for those to watch who have seen Marmalade Boy. It was very sweet and funny. 

          
 
       Helpful This movie definitely gave me a lot of closure. Marmalade Boy has entirely been about Miki's point of view, but this movie actually makes Yuu to be an actual person. I mean, for those who have seen or read the series, didn't you ever wonder how Yuu suddenly had feelings for Miki? It seemed all of a sudden. Too sudden. This movie makes a lot of sense of that thought.

The creature claims that within a year, he will destroy the planet next. However, he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate.
In class 3-E, the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, the creature starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion to whomever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named ""Koro-sensei"". However, this proves to be a highly unachievable task, as he has several superpowers at his disposal including accelerated regeneration, visual cloning, an invincible form, and the ability to move and fly at Mach 20. He is also the best teacher they could ask for, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and prospects for the future.
As time goes on, the situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction, and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the school year. 
The series is narrated by Nagisa Shiota, one of the students in the class whose main strategy in killing Koro-sensei is making a list of all his weaknesses over time. At first, Nagisa appears to be one of the weaker members of Class 3-E, but he later emerges as one of the most skillful assassins in the class.
","Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is basically a recap/epilogue of all episodes in both seasons of the original Assassination Classroom, so it is advisable to watch both season before coming over to the movie. 
 
(This is my first review, and I am a fan of Assassination Classroom sooo...) 
 
Plot: 
Nagisa, now older, comes to pay a visit towards their old classroom. As he explores the place with nostalgia, he recognizes Karma inside. I must say that it seemed a little rushed to get into that position, and maybe if there was more backstory towards all the others, it would have created much more feels. They find Koro-sensei's graduation book - creating the epilogue/flashback through the whole series. I'm glad that they nailed adding the last, emotional ending, which led me to tear up once again. I wish at least the whole class would have one last reunion to finish off the Assassination Classroom series, as it would make so many fans with tears, although they did show the class photo of 3-E 
 
Character: 
The movie focused more upon the clips within the series, however, I did enjoy those little moments between Nagisa and Karma,  as it felt heartwarming to see their friendship hasn't changed one bit, even if they are apart. 
 
There isn't much I can talk about the art-style and music since it is an epilogue, and they are using clips from the prequels. 
 
Overall: 
Overall, it was a nostalgic trip, and much I would cherish. It just reminds everyone how enjoyable Assassination Classroom was and how much that journey with Koro-sensei really meant for all - the students and the audience. 


          
 
       Helpful Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is a compilation film of the Assassination Classroom TV series. While the film is mostly a compilation, I strongly advise that you finish the whole series before watching this. 
 
There's not much to say about the Art and Sound since it's almost the same with the TV Series. When it comes to enjoyment, I couldn't say that I ""enjoyed"" it since ninjas are cutting onions in the film.  
 
So here's the question: Should you watch it? 
 
Definitely. One thing worth noting is that the film have anime-only epilogue scenes. Unfortunately, many details were left out since the film only has around 90 minutes of run time. I was also hoping for more epilogue scenes, or maybe some adapted scenes from Korotan D (search it if you don't know).  
 
Nevertheless, it still managed to give an emotional impact especially for those who loved the series.

          
 
       Helpful If there was anything most Anime shows are lacking, it's a solid recap to sell a rewatch out. In Ansatsu Kyoshitsu's case, that was exactly it, what you read in the title is what you get. A bittersweet heartwarming refresher that really takes you back. Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it. 
 
I really like the fact that they actually put in some work into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect. 
 
As a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort. Or at least, it was for me.

","Overview: 
 
Time for a totally random review! Today, I'll be covering the always polarizing Bokurano. One of my offline buddies loves this series, so he let me borrow it. I really wanted to like it but...yeah. 
 
 
Story: 
 
The story is that God is an utter asshole. He arbitrarily decides that there are too many universes and now a fighting tournament is needed to see which universe survives. This series has the same plot as Dragon Ball Super Tournament of Power, but plays it DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS! You are setting yourself up to fail if you create a plot that Akira ""poop on a stick is funny"" Toriyama would come up with and take it this seriously. Each parallel Earth chooses a bunch of random children and forces them to pilot a giant robot in a best of 12 contest. However, the robot is powered by the souls of children, so the kid dies even if he or she wins. The kids of our Earth decide to name their robot ""Zearth"" because I guess Dio copyrighted ZA WARUDO! Zearth is OP as fuck and easily wins each and every battle...then the kid dies. That's basically every episode. Our universe survives, the others die and...that's really it. 
 
Characters: 
 
Bokurano has a lot of characters...but they all die shortly after introduction and leave zero emotional impact. You're left going ""oh no...so and so's dead...what a shock!"" Let's introduce kid #1. He's an athlete who was sad that his dad never came to his games, so he quit sports. Then he pilots a giant robot and says goodbye to this cruel world. I don't even remember his name. I can't remember what he looked like. Is that the point? That we are all disposable cogs in the machine of this horrible existence? Is this anime just a sophomoric foray into nihilism? Maybe there is some deeper meaning the author intended, but I sure didn't see it. I was probably a tad distracted by how fucking stupid the plot is. 
 
 
Art: 
 
Did you think the CGI in Full Metal Panic aged poorly? You ain't seen nothing yet! I think this anime at least looked sort of acceptable upon release, but now it's a visual abortion.  
 
Sound: 
 
I at least liked the opening theme and its chorus of DELETE! DELETE! It sadly just reminded me that I could be re-watching Matt Hardy's The Final Deletion again, which is far better than this anime. Yes, watching 2 redneck wrestlers launch fireworks at each other and spew total nonsense is a million times better than this anime. 
 
Overall: 
 
I obviously didn't care for this anime, but maybe some other people found enjoyment or profundity where I didn't. That's cool. At least this anime started some fun conversations.  
 
Me: ""I'm sorry man...but this anime is just abject trash."" 
 
My friend: ""Oh really? Coming from the guy who loves Elfen Lied? At least my anime doesn't involve a plethora of naked children!"" 
 
My other friend: ""Guys! Guys! BOTH of your anime are trash! Instead you should watch a REAL anime...the first season of Slayers from 1995. 
 
everyone: ""Yeah...Slayers is pretty good""

          
 
       Helpful BOKURANO is a very very good anime .It starts out really slow but once it starts moving it doesn't stop,JET BOOSTERS FULL TURBO.It is real tear jerker so COME PREPARED!!! I am not gonna give away the storyline but it is pretty much a tragedy so...... Yeah there will be tears .This is the anime I will say that I felt the most attached to the characters cuz their fates are inevitable .It is really good and bases most on how children(or rather how humans ) handle being faced with an inevitable death so...... Yeah it is kinda dark but I really enjoyed it  and YES !!! I cried several times .All in all it's a really good anime so just struggle past the first few episodes okay.

          
 
       Helpful Story:  If you've seen Madoka Magica or Neon Genesis Evangelion then you are familiar with deconstructions. Well, Bokurano is a deconstruction of the mecha genre like Evangelion, however it takes to a completely different ride. Boys and girls from age 12-13 sign a contract to play a game where each pilot a mecha and have to defeat 15 enemies, each enemy for each child contracted. The story dwelves into plot twists that made my heart wrench, wich at a point I was scared to know what would happen next. 
 
Characters: Don't be afraid by the ratio of main characters and episodes, even tough there are 15 children and some other important cast who will appear later, the characters feel solid and they all have some sort of backstory that exemplifies their view on the situation they get.  
 
Sound: The sound has an amazing athmosphere, I would have it no other way. None is really iconic, but if I had to chose one OST that stood out, I would tell you to search ""Shizukesa no Naka de"". The OP and EDs are really good. 
 
Art: I can't judge 2007 animation because I mostly watch post-2010 anime, but I would say it's just alright, not bad but not outstanding. I did print some scenes with lazy eyes. It took me a while to understand which girl was who because Komoda, Chizuru and Mako seemed pretty alike at first. The way I understood it was that Chizuru has a mole, Mako has a ponytail and Komoda's face is long 
 
Enjoyment: I do have a soft spot for dramas, and this was a pretty emotional one, I'm the type to get emotional and this was incredibly depressing. Bokurano is in the list for one of my favourite anime and it's pretty underrated. Best girls are maki and machi, best boy is kanji. Also I now fear tattos that look like weird symbols even more. :_)

Most heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's black and yellow tracksuit (the colors of a bee). Although it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror, and action, the series primarily focuses on relationships and conversations between its characters, which make heavy use of Nisio Isin's signature word play and metahumor.
","I'll start off by saying that I initially had a higher opinion of Owarimonogatari in the first hour or so after I finished it.  While I still really enjoyed the series overall, my impression weakened after I gave it a bit more thought.  While many reviews break this show up into 3-4 mini storylines, there are really only two true arcs.  The first one revolving around the mysterious background of Oikura Sodachi was far superior to the second arc centering on Shinobu and the reincarnation of her first kin, and I'll explain why in my story breakdown. 
 
Story: 8/10 
     Starting with the Sodachi arc which was broken down into Sodachi Riddle and Sodachi Lost, I must admit that I was very surprised by the extremely dark direction this anime took.  I really liked it, however.  It went into a territory that this medium doesn't really tackle too often in a serious light, which is domestic abuse and mental disability.  Sure there are plenty of shows that have yanderes and yangires, but this time it was heart wrenching and real.  Owarimonogatari did a good job of unraveling the mystery behind Araragi's relationship with Sodachi at a decent pace.  The story was presented in the form of a giant riddle which needed to be solved to wholly understand the relationship between the two characters, which was something new to me that I found engaging and interesting.  The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that Araragi ""forgot"" about this new character that he was supposedly childhood friends with.  It's a theme I feel like I see too often and it's such an easy way to introduce new storylines like this one.    
     As for the second arc revolving around Shinobu, I feel like it was entirely unnecessary and rushed.  Essentially, her first kin is reincarnated after 400 years and wants to join her side again as her only kin.  Of course he sees no place for Araragi in the picture, so there is conflict between the two.  This lasts for two episodes and is resolved with little fanfare.  I will say that I enjoyed the final scene with Shinobu.  It was a touching moment of beauty, and one reason I felt more strongly about this anime immediately after it was finished.   
     I give the first half of the show a 9 and the second half a 7, therefore my rating falls into an 8. 
 
Art: 7/10 
Unfortunately I can't comment too much on how wonderful the art is for this show.  My review is coming like 4 years too late, so I feel like I missed out on being one of the people who were raving about the art.  It was still very nice, especially the Yotsugi and Shinobu characters. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters were definitely a strength in this show.  While some main characters like Senjougahara, Kaiki, and the sisters were nowhere to be found (Senjougahara had a brief scene), we got more of Gaen, Ougi, and Kanbaru.  Kanbaru pretty much stole the show and pushed her way into best girl conversation.  Her dialogue remains as hilarious as ever, and she even got into an argument with Shinobu!   
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
This was a very enjoyable series in the grand scheme of the Monogatari universe.   At the time of writing, I haven't scene Owarimonogatari Second yet, so I can't truly rank this show yet among it's counterparts. Again, I enjoyed the first half of the show more than the second half, but it evened out and ended on a high note. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
Overall, this was a fantastic show.  There were some minor issues I took with how the story was created in the Sodachi arc, and especially the forced narrative of the second arc, but aside from that I can recommend this show without reservation.  Be prepared to be a little shocked with the brutal reality of the Sodachi arc.  I can't say it hits home to me personally, but I know many people out there suffer similar realities, and I empathize with anybody in such a terrible state of mind.  

          
 
       Helpful Love it, hate it, indifferent to it, or once-loved-then-hated-now-extremely indifferent to it, Owarimonogatari (literally 'end story', though the series doesn't conclude here) will most likely meet your expectations of the long-running light novel adaptation. For me, that means occasionally witty dialogue shoehorned with ecchi, traces of pedophilia, and genuinely interesting ideas muffled by execution. And yup, it's got all three. NisiOisiN really knows how to keep his writing consistent!  
 
See, the joke there was that Monogatari is as inconsistent as can be, and widely varies in quality from arc to arc. Got it? No? I'll wait. 
 
…OK? Let's move on. 
 
While technically a four-arc series, there are three distinct arcs in this season's offerings: Ougi Formula, the one-hour premiere, Sodachi Riddle/Lost, and Shinobu Mail. Part of what makes this season strange to review is that each and every one can be summarized with a single sentence, but I am generous enough to provide you with multiple sentences. I will do my best to go over them all without spoiling anything, because Monogatari is serious business.  
 
Ougi Formula is the series' standard fare. Not only is it a locked room mystery, it's forty-some minutes of dialogue that's not exactly justified by its contents. Were there no philosophical questions and characteristically abstract classrooms, it could be concluded in ten minutes, or even a heavy twenty. Instead, you will spend roughly five percent of your day watching Ougi and Araragi solve a seemingly unimportant puzzle. You almost reach a point where you think all this time spent will be inconsequential, yet that is saved by a graceful transition into the second arc.  
 
Thus ensues Sodachi Lost and its conjoined twin, Sodachi Riddle, which go above and beyond the series' standard fare. It's maybe the most straightforward, mature story the Monogatari series has given us, which concerns a classmate's displacement and the unknown circumstances of her family. Marina Inoue's fantastic (or shall I say phantasmic) portrayal of Oikura may send a chill or two down your spine, and there's no lack of interrogation or detective work on Araragi's part. Unlike the previous arc, there is a feeling of consequence to every word muttered or yelled, which helps portray the shattered mental state of Oikura rather sympathetically. It's an approach most artists wouldn't dare to take, so I wholeheartedly appreciate the effort and delicacy put into handling it. There are still the rough points along the way, like a few boob jokes and some off-topic discussion, yet they're minor enough to be promptly excusable. The whole thing is best summed up by the words of the show's official subtitles (which are garbage that you shouldn't use): ""I'm terribly sorry. I had underestimated you, to be honest."" 
 
To round it all out, Shinobu Mail is well below the series' standard fare. After how much I was impressed by the Sodachi stories, I was hoping for the best. All of that hope left my body after watching the first episode of Shinobu Mail. There are some parallels to be drawn to your typical superhero movies—there's a big bad which everyone works together to defeat, yet nobody thinks they'll be able to. It wouldn't be such a major issue if any of the major action was shown, WHICH IT IS NOT. NOTHING IS SACRED. We instead follow Araragi and a piggybacking Kanbaru, who continues her trend of making annoying sexual jokes and innuendos toward him wherever possible. It's like being alone in a room with a 12-year-old, which is something that Araragi would probably like. Later on is a twenty-minute infodump which concludes with Kanbaru and Shinobu sharing an unnecessary and crude sexual pose, a cake that is topped by the most anticlimactic of endings. I don't want to ruin that, but it's definitely an open-ended conclusion you've seen before.  
 
I'm not going to say much about the directing, other than that I think it uses artistic value as a crutch. There is no attempt made to portray things as-is, so everything is abstract. Maybe the director and I just value different things. 
 
Unless you're telling an overarching story, variety is the spice of life. Then it gets questionable. Unlike other shows in the same supernatural episodic vein (Mushishi, Cardcaptor Sakura), there's no consistent tone or guideline for the Monogatari series' plot. It's a bit all over the place. Maybe you, unlike me, are a fan of these random variables, and therefore may like Owarimonogatari a lot more than I did. If you do like this more than I did, good job. If you dislike this more than I did, good job. Having an opinion is the first step, and you are fantastic for that. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.  
 
Unless you're using the official subtitles. Then you're wrong. 

          
 
       Helpful What else can be said about the Monogatari series at this point in the game?  It's been around for what feels like forever, presenting one of the best examples of dialogue, character and story-driven excellence in anime.  Owarimonogatari is literally just a handful of prolonged conversations.  The action within it can be summarized with one slap, a retaliatory punch, a brief fight with a samurai, a face grab and a touch to the chest.  That's it.  If any other anime that is supposed to be a mystery/action show tried getting away with that, it would be panned as boring.  But, that is the strength of all of the Monogatari series, even those with more action.   
 
The dialog is so excellent, so engaging, they don't really have to do much in the way of action.  You find yourself glued to the screen reading every line as they unwrap each mystery, and for this season, the mystery was particularly morbid.  While funny, everything isn't a joke.  Why witty, nothing becomes pretentious.  It's just flawless writing, which produces flawless characters, which in turn produces flawless stories.  That is what the Monogatari series is all about and Owarimonogatari is just another prime example of it. 
 
This is like the 10th installment of this series.  You already know you should be watching it.

","I'm writting this review for those users who have already seen the 12 caps of the anime, so if u haven't, i really encourage you to do it, because it is funny from the first episode to the last. 
Taking this into account. This OVA is mostly everything you could ask for at this point. It perfectly concludes the first season, and all I can say is that it is even funnier than the other episodes. 
 
-Story: As I said before, it continues the story that was left in the last episode from the anime. I gave it just a 9/10, since i think there are some features missing to introduce the new season, or at least the next part of the manga. However, it keeps on where the last episode left the story, and thats all I could ask for. 
 
-Art: Personally, I find Prison School's art awesome. It fits perfectly for this genre, and it lets the characters perfectly show every emotion. You can even watch the series without subtitles or sound, and you could just laugh for many of the reactions, so i gave it a 10/10. 
 
-Sound: I'm not really sure of what to write in here. I love the opening theme, and the effects included are good enough. The voices, as the art did, expressed the feelings perfectly, I am a fan of voice acting, and I can say I enjoyed it ^^ 9/10 
 
-Character: Same stereotyped characters as in the anime. However, this show makes this stereotypes into something great. In other animes, u can see those repeated and overused personalities, with a shy guy as the main character, and some innocent and tsundere girls. I think this is the fact that makes this show so awesome. They exaggerated everything so hard, that it turns into a funny quality of the characters. 9/10 
 
-Enjoyment: Definitelly one of the best comedy manga/animes ever created. At least from my point of view. I enjoyed every chapter, and this OVA is not an exception. 10/10 
 
-Overall: I love Prison School, and I hope it gets a second season soon. Hope you agree with my honest and personal review :3

          
 
       Helpful This is a review for Prison school + OVA. 
 
Story: Prison school comes into those anime that never fails to amuse and same goes for this OVA. 8/10 
 
Art: What most surprises me is it's art, I feel like art is the main reason which makes this anime so awesome. 420/10 
 
Sound: There isn't much to talk about sound except that it seems fine. I didn't notice anything special about it probably because the focus was more into art and comedy. 8/10 
 
Characters: OMG the characters, they are always pervy and funny. Definitely a big point in this anime and OVA. 10/10 
 
Enjoyment: It was amazingly funny from starting to end. Couldn't ask for more that's how enjoying it was. 10/10

This Review will have spoilers: 
 
Plot (2 of 3): The OVA adapts the arc of the manga ""Mad Wax"" which focuses on characterizing Joe, the only character in the group of the boys who hasn't developed and also shows the boys lives after being released from the prison. Joe wants to go back to prison because his life is boring and without any fun, all the boys have got (or almost) girls to talk to and they are happy with freedom, except for Joe. Even Gakuto was able to relate to a girl. Joe wants to go back to prison by any means necessary and does everything for it, he's the only one in the group that is no relate to anyone, not even to the boys, Joe does not seem to have a great friendship with any of the boys , his only visible friendship is with his ants, Joe tries in all ways to return to prison, because he believes that it is freedom, for him that world inside the prison is what really puts him on the same level as the boys, he feels alive and sees that his colleagues are in the same situation as him and sees them as equals, out of prison he is the only one who feels lonely and dislocated, for being a very strange guy. The plot approaches Joe very well and characterizes it in a simple way and still manages to make you a little more interested in the character, my impression that he was the most interesting of all the boys was not wrong, Joe is undoubtedly the most mysterious and flashy character of Prison School and this arc works him very well, the plot is simple but straightforward, it serves to develop Joe and does just that. Aside from Joe's development, OVA also shows Gakuto and his relationship to a new character, Mitsuko, a cute and clumsy girl, but this is not deepened by the simple fact that Gakuto is not the focus of the arc, it was still fun see the moments of the two. Overall the plot did what it was proposed: Develop Joe, nothing more, nothing less. The comedy remains bizarre and very funny, without doubt one of the strongest points of the series. 
 
Characters (2 of 2): They are still incredible and very charismatic, but I will only talk about Joe: His loneliness is understandable and his reasons for going back to prison makes sense, it shows his side and how he sees the whole situation from his point of view and everything makes sense. Not having friends, girlfriend or purpose in life is something painful and this is visible in he's characterization. Joe is not made to be cool, pervert and super excited character like the other boys. He is well written and difficult to deal with, a fascinating character who had not received his due focus on the series and when received did not disappoint me and managed to take my interest not only in him, but in the OVA as a whole. Mitsuko is a cool character, too, but not very relevant here, she's the arc fanservice and Gakuto's romantic interest, that's it. 
 
Art/Animation (1 of 2): Much worse than the original series, really bad... the character design is beautiful, but the rest is ugly and bland, the direction is still excellent, all scenes are very well directed and this is the positive point of the production. 
 
OST (1 of 2): Nothing new, most all tracks are from the original series and the new ones are very weak, OST was not much needed, but still important. 
 
Personal Taste (1 of 1) I really laughed watching the OVA. I was intrigued by Joe and I really enjoyed his characterization, it's a fun OVA and it fulfills his role well. 
 
Final Verdict: 7/10. It's worth watching if you want to know a little more about Joe, it's really fun too, for me, a good OVA.

Enredo (2 de 3): O OVA adapta o arco do mangá ""Mad Wax"" que foca na caracterização de Joe, o único personagem do grupo dos garotos que não tinha tido um desenvolvimento e tbm mostra a vida dos garotos após saírem da prisão. Joe quer voltar para a prisão pois a sua vida é chata e sem nenhum divertimento, todos os garotos conseguiram (ou quase) garotas com quem conversar e estão felizes com a liberdade, menos Joe. Até Gakuto conseguiu se relacionar com uma garota. Joe com isso quer voltar para a prisão de qualquer maneira e faz de tudo para isso, ele é o único isolado do grupo, não consegue se relacionar com ninguém, nem mesmo com os garotos, Joe não parece ter uma grande amizade com nenhum dos garotos, a única amizade visível dele é com as suas formigas, Joe tenta de todas as formas voltar para a prisão, pois ele acredita que aquilo é liberdade, para ele aquele mundo dentro da prisão é o que realmente coloca-o no mesmo patamar que os garotos, ele se sente vivo e vê que seus colegas tbm estão na mesma situação que ele e os enxerga como iguais, fora da prisão ele é o único que se sente solitário e deslocado, por ser um cara bem sombrio. O enredo aborda muito bem os aspectos do Joe e o caracteriza de maneira simples e ainda sim consegue deixar vc um pouco mais interessado pelo personagem, a minha impressão de que ele era o mais interessante de todos os garotos não estava errada, sem dúvidas Joe é o personagem mais misterioso e chamativo de Prison School e esse arco trabalha muito bem isso, o enredo é simples, mas direto, serve para desenvolver o Joe e faz exatamente isso. Fora o desenvolvimento de Joe, O OVA tbm mostra Gakuto conhecendo e se relacionando com uma nova personagem, Mitsuko, uma garota fofinha e desastrada, mas isso não é aprofundado pelo simples fato de que Gakuto não é o foco do arco em si, ainda sim foi divertido ver os momentos dos dois. No geral o enredo fez o que era proposto: Desenvolver o Joe, nada mais, nada menos. A comédia continua bizarra e muito engraçada, sem dúvidas um dos pontos mais fortes da obra. 
 
Personagens (2 de 2): Ainda são incríveis e muito carismáticos, mas apenas irei falar do Joe: Sua solidão é compreensível e suas razões para voltar a prisão tbm, ele mostra o seu lado e como vê toda a situação de seu ponto de vista e tudo faz sentido. Não ter amigos, namorada ou um propósito na vida é algo doloroso e isso é visível na caracterização do personagem. Joe não é foi feito para ser personagem legal, tarado e super extravagante como os outros garotos. Ele é bem escrito e difícil de se lidar, um personagem fascinante que não tinha recebido seu devido foco na obra e quando recebeu não me decepcionou e conseguiu ter o meu interesse não só nele, mas no OVA como um todo. A Mitsuko é uma personagem legal tbm, mas não é muito relevante, ela é o fanservice do arco e o par romântico do Gakuto, só isso. 
 
Arte/Animação (1 de 2): Muito inferior à série original, bem ruim mesmo... o character design é bonito, mas o resto é feio e sem graça, a direção continua excelente, todas as cenas são muito bem dirigidas e esse é o ponto positivo da produção. 
 
OST (1 de 2): Nada de novo, a maioria das tracks são da série original e as novas são bem fracas, a OST não foi muito necessária, mas ainda sim é importante. 
 
Veredito Final: 7/10. Vale a pena assistir se vc quer saber um pouco mais sobre o Joe, é bem divertido tbm, um bom OVA.

14,199,82,7.497767436,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi,"Stubborn, spoiled, and naïve, 10-year-old Chihiro Ogino is less than pleased when she and her parents discover an abandoned amusement park on the way to their new house. Cautiously venturing inside, she realizes that there is more to this place than meets the eye, as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls. Ghostly apparitions and food that turns her parents into pigs are just the start—Chihiro has unwittingly crossed over into the spirit world. Now trapped, she must summon the courage to live and work amongst spirits, with the help of the enigmatic Haku and the cast of unique characters she meets along the way. 
 
Vivid and intriguing,  Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi  tells the story of Chihiro's journey through an unfamiliar world as she strives to save her parents and return home. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama']","Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father decides to take a shortcut. The family's car stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Chihiro's father insists on exploring, despite his daughter's protest. They find a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have been transformed into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.
Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji refuses to hire her and asks worker Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, and is eventually given a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name, renaming her Sen (千). While visiting her parents' pigpen, Sen realizes that she had already forgotten her real name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names, and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.
Sen faces discrimination from the other workers; only Kamaji and Lin show sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face (Kaonashi 顔無し) inside, believing him to be a customer. A ""stink spirit"" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic emetic dumpling. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it, then swallowing him. No-Face demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers.
Sen sees paper Shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse, and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.
With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts an engorged No-Face, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.
Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that that Yubaba used the black slug to take control over Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and offers to fly them home. No-Face decides to stay behind with Zeniba and become her spinner, while Sen and Boh leave with Haku for the bathhouse. In mid-flight, Sen recalls falling years ago into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Nigihayami Kohakunushi). When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything after eating at the restaurant stall. They walk back through the tunnel until they reach their car, now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, her hair tie from Zeniba still intact.
","Loved it! 
 
Chihiro and Haku(Kohaku) is so cute! I totally ship them! 
 
This had an ""adventure"" feel to it. I love it! 
 
Their little romance is cute too! 
 
I wonder if Haku kept his promise and met up with Chihiro. If he did, it would be wonderful!~ 
 
The plot is interesting too. It has a ""wavy"" feel to it. And I like it. 
 
I don't really care about the art, but it was still pretty good. Especially how Haku is drawn.  
 
Overall, this was a pretty good movie. I'm hoping to find more Studio Ghibli movies and watching them. They must be good, if this movie and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is pretty good.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, I don’t even know where to start with this work of art. “Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi” - or in English referred to, “Spirited Away”, honestly swept me off of my feet. Before I go on though, I’d like to address one thing. This is in fact my review, and my opinion towards this anime. I’m only speaking for myself as everyone has their own thoughts. None are “better” or “more legitimate” than others.  
 
Starting this off, I’m not going to lie, I saw this anime movie feature when it first came out. I was a child back then, and this film managed to scare me. However, recently I decided to revisit this due to high recommendation of a friend. Never would I have ever guessed that this film would rank so high on my list. Being a child that was easily frightened, the unique animation had sent chills down my spine… but with age, I’ve came to enjoy the plot and characters within this series.  
 
First, let’s go over the basic plot of this anime. It might seem stereotypical, but this anime introduces the idea of a young girl stumbling into a magical and unheard of world. However, despite previous adaptations of this simplistic idea, Studio Ghibli brought something fresh and interesting to the table. We’re brought into a world featuring a bathhouse for spirits, complex characters, and blooming romance. For those who don’t find amusement in the romance genre, don’t fret. It’s not a major thing in the plot considering that the main character is ten, whoever, it does introduce the power of ‘true love’. With that essential power at their disposal, our protagonist learns how to work with this world to save her parents and to escape in the meanwhile.  
 
Next- let’s jump into the characters. The first thing I’d like to announce is that the characters are in no way bland. Each person has their own personality, appearance, and importance in this. Character reliability is also put into play here. Our main character, Chihiro, is at first terrified by this whole experience. However, with the help of Haku (a strange boy who aids her in her search to go back home), she’s introduced into the basic lore of this world. Along the way she meets a series of foes and friends who she later learns to get along with. They bond, and over a period of time she becomes content with these spirits. The characters all play important parts in Chihiro’s journey even if it’s a faceless spirit, a huge baby, or a dancing light post. I don’t know if it was only me, but I loved being introduced into the different types of characters in Spirited Away.  
 
Okay, now onto the more technical parts of this anime ; the anime and sound qualities. The animation is pretty good, as it’s not that straining to watch. I don’t have much to compare it to, but definitely it gets the job done beautifully. The sound quality was good, as they gave distinguished noises to multiple things.  
 
Now to wrap this up. I highly enjoyed this feature. Hands down, I recommend this to both anime fans and not. It’s a good movie, and it DEFINITELY deserves the high rating it has on MAL . Even though it might not be for everyone, a bigger half of anime fans mark this film as one of their favorites. And after watching this, I can definitely understand why. 

          
 
       Helpful This was such an amazing movie, one of Ghibli's and Hayao Miyazaki's best works. I would highly recommend this movie if you want something wholesome that still engages you with action the whole way through. Spirited Away, or should I say Blew Me Away, is cute and fun all the way through and all of the characters are loveable in their own unique ways. Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi is a must-watch for all Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki fans. At some parts, the sound was a bit off but it is an old film - you cannot tell it's age with ease either.

Den-noh Items
Useful items that can be used within the Den-noh space. The children of Daikoku City purchase them at the Megashiya or mail-order Den-noh candy shops. Den-noh items include the Megane beam, which can destroy a small amount of Den-noh material, black bug spray, which artificially generates bugs, defensive walls such as brick walls and iron walls, and missiles called Tyokushin-kun (Mr. Straight) and Tsuiseki-kun (Mr. Chase).
Meta-Bugs
A mysterious Den-noh Materials that looks like a gemstone. It tends to occur in spatial distortions, and is thought to be the result of spatial bugs that have solidified.Since it can only be mined in Daikoku City, it is unofficially considered a specialty of the city. Most of them are useless bugs, but very rarely they have useful features that contain information such as sounds and images, and from their unique properties they can be refined into items or Meta-Tags by skilled craftsmen. Because of this, they sometimes fetch high prices and are used as virtual currency for trading Den-noh items only among children. The unit of currency in illegal stores on the Internet is ""meta,"" and 1 meta = 1 yen. However, as Searchmatons delete damaged or corrupted spaces from one side to the other, the scarcity value is gradually increasing.
Kira-Bugs
A kind of special Meta-Bugs that is said to be sold at a high price, some say 30 times the price of a normal one. It is one of the urban legends, and few people have actually seen it.
Meta-Tags
A kind of Den-noh item made from Meta-Bugs, it is a Den-noh talisman with various programs that affect Den-noh space and Den-noh pets. It can only be made by Megabā, so it is sold only at Megashi-ya, and is the basic tool of the Coil Den-noh Detective Agency. On its surface, it has a pattern similar to the Code Formula. In fact, the Code Formula has its roots in it, and Isako calls it the ""old school"".
Coil-Tags
A Meta-Tag used to return the Den-noh body back into the real body when the Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs.
Imago
A hidden feature of the Den-noh glasses, rumored in urban legends, that allows users to manipulate Den-noh space without using Den-noh items or gestures, just by thinking about it.
Code Formula (暗号式, Angō-shiki)
It is one of the programs that manipulate Den-noh space, and is activated by drawing geometric patterns on the ground or walls with Den-noh chalk. According to urban legend, those who use it are called ""wizards of Den-noh space,"" and are rumored to be hackers who also do illegal things.
Code Reactor (暗号炉, Angō-ro)
A structure that is directly connected to imago and can read Code Formula directly from thoughts. By embedding it in a Den-noh body, the Code Formula's features can be used freely and continuously, but it also has dangerous side effects such as damaging the human body and nerves.
""Old Space"" (「古い空間」, ""Furui Kūkan"")
An unstable old version of the Den-noh space, first created and still left in the city. However, it is gradually expanding for some reason in Daikoku City. This is where Den-noh fog, the Illegals, and Meta-Bugs come from.
""The Other Side"" (「あっち」, ""Acchi"")
It is a place rumored in children's urban legends that Kira-Bug and Michiko come from. According to the legend, some children have gone to ""the other side"" in their dreams by sleeping with their Den-noh glasses on. The true identity is a medical Den-noh space created by Coils, the developer of the Den-noh glasses, using Imago, and abandoned by Megamass, which took over the business after Coils' bankruptcy, in order to cover up something. Unlike the Den-noh space, it is an isolated virtual space that is not linked to the real world, so in order to enter it, one must separate their consciousness from their body and become a Den-noh body. This is when the Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs.
C Domain
The official name is Coil Domain, which was used by Coils that developed the first Den-noh glasses.
Daikoku City
A regional city famous for eyeglasses on the Sea of Japan side, not far from Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture. It is one of the oldest cities in Japan with many historic shrines and temples, and at the same time it is the second largest Den-noh city in Japan in terms of infrastructure related to Den-noh glasses. It is the second semi-governmental special administrative district in Japan, and some people said that its administration is carried out by an affiliate of Megamass. The city hall's space management office manages the Den-noh space in the city, where Yasako's father and Tamako, who are seconded from Megamas, work.
Urban Legends
Among the children of Daikoku City, various strange incidents related to Den-noh have been passed down as urban legends.
Megashi-ya
Den-noh Megane's Dagashi-ya (candy shop) run by Megabā, abbreviated as ""Megashi-ya"". What she sells to children instead of cheap snacks are powerful Den-noh items that violate the rules of the Daikoku City Space Management Office and are subject to extermination by Searchmaton. She also buys Meta-Bugs, which are used as virtual currency ""meta"" for purchases in her store.
Coil Den-noh Detective Agency
A detective agency led by Megabā that solves Den-noh-related problems on request. Their main job is to search for missing Den-noh pets.
Daikoku Heikū Club (大黒黒客倶楽部, Daikoku Heikū Kurabu)
A ""cool"" club formed by Daichi with the boys from his elementary school's biology club. ""Heikū"" means hacker in Chinese. The club was later taken over by Isako. Daichi launched a new club, Original Heikū (元祖黒客, Ganso Heikū), with Denpa.
Megamass
Megamass is a Japanese global technology company that specializes in Den-noh related businesses, selling products such as Den-noh glasses and Den-noh pets, and providing services to maintain and manage Den-noh spaces and Den-noh navi that manage self-driving cars.
Coils
The official name is Coil Coils, a company that first developed the Den-noh glasses and did some challenging research, but went bankrupt about five years ago. Its technology and research results were taken over by Megamass.
","An abnormally mature anime for its cast. 
 
I will start my review with what is in my opinion the main theme in this series. You have to pursue reality at all cost even if it is sometime quite harsh. The majority of the cast fall into the illusion of that virtual reality depicted in this series. I will go into more details later on. 
 
The story is all about growing up from your childhood and being confronted with reality for the majority of the cast. It tells the story of a young girl and her young sister that arrive in a new city where augmented reality is completely established. In fact, augmented reality is all around town and is making a complete network trough everything. The glasses that connect your brain to the network make possible for you to see the different things that exist only in the virtual side of the city. Things like virtual animal, hacking, false walls or even invisible walls are completely common. 
 
The first part of the anime will only present the different aspect of the city and will give the initial basic background of the different character and their interactions. It will slowly build upon these interactions to something much more interesting and deep than what you may think with the four or five first episodes. 
 
The second part will be about the different difficult pasts of the entire cast and their pursuit of different illusions they have. This part of the show even goes through some terrifying moments for a general quite dramatic atmosphere. Telling more than that would be spoiler. 
 
The art and visual effect inside this anime are remarkable, the virtual side of the city really comes to life and you can easily understand why the children start to believe that these virtual things are as real as the normal world. There's a brilliant use of distortions when some of the virtual things are bugs created by a low maintenance rate. These distortions are also absent when the object has been updated properly. That means you can easily identify a threat to the safety of the children when you see the distorted objects because these objects are borderline always quite dangerous. That is also why some parts of this series are spooky. 
 
The different actors are quite good and credible for making you believe that there are indeed children in the show while there's actually none. The sound effects are always effective and the soundtrack is always in line with what goes on screen. Even the lyrics in the opening section of the show are actually so valid that they are a small spoiler by themselves. 
 
The character all have quite a steep learning curve about accepting their past and present. In the lapse of half a year, they started as people that only wants to escape reality to people that have come full circle with themselves and their past. Traumatic accident and different secrets regarding the new technology present in the city truly make them the only people that can and actually want to find the truth about what has happened in the last years.  
 
All characters go through much development in the course of the show, but five characters go through a lot more than the others. Daichi and his rival seem like a total imbecile, but will be way more than it seems for about half the show. Yasako will, of course, being the main character, have a lot of development, actually way more than one may think. Isako seems selfish, but is actually quite caring. Haraken seem to be quite the normal boy, but knows certain things that will make a lot happening by the end of the show. These three all pursue illusion in the form of memories of a dead someone that have been imprinted inside the network. 
They will of course have to accept these death has been reality instead of relying on that false memory imprint. 
 
My personal enjoyments toward this show comes from the fact that I never think how far the subject of augmented reality could go before watching this series. I learned a lot about how this could be real later on. I also like the mature themes present in that story and I actually liked the fact that the series pretty much put a big middle finger to all those that were thinking that this show will be gentle and relax all the way through. 
 
In conclusion, I recommend this flick for fans of sci-fi and fantasy and also to fans of serious story that have a lot to tell.  


          
 
       Helpful Remember when you were a child? You and your friends were playing, talking about different urban legends and stories. Imagine this situation but add to it another layer of reality. That is Dennou Coil. That and much much more.  
 
Dennou Coil starts in a pretty unforgivable manner. You are thrown into a world of near future where people can access virtual reality via special glasses. This VR is connected to everyday life and exists as another layer of reality. There are virtual pets, lasers, big funny looking antiviruses called Satchii and much more. And there is something else. Something perhaps more sinister hiding inside this space.  
 
The story slowly builds up. Stakes become higher, and as the mysteries begin to get solved you are left with your jaw on the floor.  I have no idea how creators of this anime accomplished task of having incredibly smart and somewhat complex script, which encompasses themes of loss, grief, obsession, humanity, reality, love and hate while still being a kids show.  
 
The characters are relatable, funny and quirky. Each of them has their flaws and each of them has their goals. No character exists only to move plot forward or be a cliché role player. 
 
Production is great. Even though the series slightly suffers from bland colour pallet it is intentional and meaningful. The animation itself is very soft. The way some characters act and move reminded me of works of Hayao Miyazaki. My only problem with the production are the character designs (especially their noses, they kinda look like monkeys)   but that’s purely subjective and won’t really affect the overall score.  
The music is noticeable in a good way. Playful tones during comedy scenes mix well with violins during serious scenes, creating good contrast. Some anime tend to overblow the playfulness or seriousness but Dennou Coil creates a good mix.  
Voice acting is good. One of the characters sounds older than she should but I understand why it is the case so I can overlook it.  
 
As for enjoyment I had a blast. The main storyline is excellently structured. Few of the episodes from the middle of series could be considered as “filler” since they don’t really add much to the main plot line but these episodes in on itself are very well written and serve as simple exploration of deep themes . Once again I must praise the way writers handled such things in understandable and meaningful manner. There is one half recap episode but I think I can forgive the show for that one.  
 
Overall this is an excellent anime that works for kids and adults alike. The story is simple enough that a child could understand it but complex enough that an adult would be interested. It teaches valuable lessons, is funny, smart, scary at times, and overall enjoyable. According to rumors, it also has best dog in anime.  


          
 
       Helpful The series was very slow and child-like in the very beginning...but about halfway through it was CRAZY AWESOME! The plot thickened with every episode and the cliffhangers were outrageous. The animation is beautiful, and it captures science fiction in a very realistic perspective, as opposed to the usual sci-fi that just has stylized robots and space ships. The character development is interesting, but really the show is all about how creepy the technology is. I can honestly say I am thoroughly impressed with Denno Coil. NOT what I expected at all.

14,14227,84,7.491896527,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun,"Shizuku Mizutani is apathetic towards her classmates, only caring about her grades. However, her cold view of life begins to change when she meets Haru Yoshida, a violent troublemaker who stopped attending class after getting into a fight early in the school year. He is not much different from her, though—he too understands little about human nature and does not have any friends. Much to Shizuku's surprise, he proclaims that she will be his friend and immediately confesses his feelings towards her upon meeting her. 
  
Because of her lack of friends and social interaction, Shizuku has a hard time understanding her relationship with Haru. But slowly, their friendship begins to progress, and she discovers that there is more to Haru than violence. She begins to  develop feelings for him, but is unsure what kind of emotions she is experiencing. Together, Shizuku and Haru explore the true nature of their relationship and emotions. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","My Little Monster focuses on the relationship between Shizuku Mizutani, who has absolutely no interests except in studying and her plans for the future, and a boy named Haru Yoshida, who sits next to Shizuku in class but rarely attends school. After Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to Haru's home, she meets Haru, who immediately greets her as a friend, starting their new relationship. Nicknamed ""dry ice,"" Shizuku is renowned as a girl who is emotionless and cold. However, when she meets Haru she is touched by his innocence and his lack of knowledge concerning human relationships. Though known as a violent and uncontrollable monster, Haru is actually kind and gentle. Haru immediately declares his love towards Shizuku, but it takes much longer for Shizuku to realize and accept her own feelings towards Haru. Together, as two previously unsocial beings, they help each other learn how to care for each other and relate with their friends and family.
","When I first started watching My Little Monster, I was already following Say 'I Love You' and I must admit, the initial impression I was left after three or four episodes with was mixed. One of the strengths of this show - and this is already strikingly clear from its first episode which was a very strong start - is the amount of content and fun it can cram into 20 minutes. However, I was a little bemused at the first-glance appearance of the relationship. 
 
Haru's casual rape threat in the first episode, and repeated use of his physical strength to have his way made me wary, given Shizuku's remaining at his side without much objection. The relationship definitely has some interesting moments and eventually becomes much more appealing and less tasteless than it seemed at first - both are very interesting, flawed characters (especially Haru, whom you might not even end up liking much) and their differences certainly enrich the experience. Shizuku is by no means a weak lead character. 
 
However the underlying truth is that, despite all of the teenage turbulence, ups and downs etc. their relationship hasn't really gone anywhere throughout the one cour of MLM that we'll (probably) ever get. Shizuku can't be straightforward and sees the distribution of her energy between Haru and studying as a zero-sum game in which the latter is more important. Haru is alarmingly frank about his feelings but is repeatedly self-sabotaging in his attempts to unravel her defences and by the end, since the first episode, we feel that he has in a way made as many steps backwards as he has forwards in pursuing her. At this point, much of our attention is captivated by the other characters. 
 
Normally, a romantic primary plot that doesn't really get anywhere wouldn't be too much of a problem, but it actually becomes fairly noticeable in this show simply because of how pumped full of content and activity each episode is - a fact that the very exciting first episode only exacerbates. Sure, quite a lot can go on in a single episode and this is definitely, overall, a forte in terms of fun, laughs and subtle developments. However, the big problem is that the fact that there is such a limited sprinkling of the dramatic over this whirlpool, and the fact that our character's stories only change very gradually somewhat trivializes most of the content and makes it less deliberate or meaningful, as you would get from some of the other great rom-coms. I consider myself a fairly patient viewer, but by the end I was really hoping for some zest, some drama, some passion, which I think would really add completion to MLM and bump it up to a 5-star rating, but which never really surfaced in these 13 episodes. This isn't really a big deal though, the high-school setting managing to overcome the absence of feels quite passably and charmingly. Besides, MLM is quite full of laughs and it isn't a dull show. You will be enjoying yourself. 
 
As for the secondary characters and their relationships: Surprisingly, these are the hidden strength of the series. You can relate to MLM's secondaries quite strongly. They emerge gradually in line with the show's ""fast but actually slow"" pacing and as I said before, at the end they have somewhat forced their way onto the centre stage alongside the primary relationship. Jaded romance-viewers might find the character line-up a little standard, but I think they were overall well-handled and endearing. Things weren't particularly predictable to me. Despite this, the sluggish progression of significant events means that we haven't really seen much more movement with the secondaries than we have with the primaries, even though they are all well fleshed-out. It seems that this season has been a big preparation - ie. gradual introduction of characters etc. which will precede the crescendo. But then as I said, that crescendo will probably never come as this may have just been a big advert for the manga. 
 
Last but not least, on the technical side it's very solid. The art is superb and sometimes the movements are quite impressive. Character designs are good and quite unconventional in this day and age, supported by plenty of fun expressions. No complaints here. The music is also great, with a fantastic OP and ED to wrap each episode in. 
 
Overall, MLM has some great moments hidden within. It's highly entertaining, and seems destined to become even better if it's ever given a second cour. The lack of both potent drama and a more determined linear progression in the relationship dynamics have been the main weaknesses of this season, but they are not significant. It's a solid and fun watch and deserves its recognition. 
 
7.5/10

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so I wanted to wait for the anime to finish before writing a review because I wanted to have all my facts straight. Let me be a bit frank here: 
 
I am going to make a lot of people mad with this review  
 
Please keep in mind that I rate a lot of anime highly on the premise of entertainment. If I enjoy something and finish it then I rate it highly. However, enjoying something and thinking that a series was well done can be two completely different things.  
 
But, as someone who is a huge fan of romantic comedies, who hasn’t read the manga and has re-watched certain scenes, I feel the need to mention a few things regarding this anime: Both what’s great about it and what’s wrong with it.  
 
Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (or The Monster seated Next to Me) tells the story of Shizuku Mizutani, a very serious student who only cares about her grades. One day, Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to the home of a boy named Haru Yoshida, a delinquent who rarely attends school. Upon meeting Shizu, Haru immediately considers her his friend and a new relationship sparks between the two as they begin to experience things that neither of them have felt before such as friendship and love.  
 
The series itself is very episodic and appears to be well paced. Every episode contains at least one moment that will make you laugh and at least one moment that will make you go “awwww, isn’t that cute”. 
 
Brains Base did a great job with the animation for this show. Such amazing detail went not only into the main characters overall design, but even the side characters appeared to stand out. The backgrounds and lighting were also well done. Combine this with the animators bright color choices makes for the series to have an overall relaxing and cute atmosphere that most will enjoy.   
 
Now at this point you’re probably saying “Well, this anime seems interesting so far, why would you make people angry with these positive remarks?” 
 
Let me explain (spoilers).  After the first episode of the series, the premise of the story was presented to us in a way that made us think that for once, the female lead would be the one being chased rather than the one doing the chasing. I, personally, as a fan of Shojo, was happy with this because Shizu, while being extremely stoic, seemed to be a rational thinker while Haru was presented as………well…….. a possessive delinquent. The fact that Shizu WOULDN’T be interested in Haru makes sense to us.  
 
Then the third episode happened and this premise does a complete 180 with Shizu doing the chasing more or less out of nowhere. 
 
This, I’m sorry to say is one of the main problems with this series. While the premise and characters seemed good at the beginning, as the series goes on, you begin to realize how scattered and poorly structured the overall series actually is. You expect for the characters to move the overall story in a slice of life romantic comedy which has such a simple setting. But here, stuff happens almost at random and the characters actions at times seem to completely contradict what their characters SHOULD be doing. 
 
You could argue that the characters are growing and are trying to adjust to an environment that their not use to. After all, this series is about how two socially awkward people make friends and fall in love. But if that were the case, then we wouldn’t see them break out of character one moment, but then immediately regress to the way they were at the beginning. This makes everything done seem very forced and unnatural when there were maybe a dozen different ways the story could have been done right. By the end of the series, it’s really hard to claim that the main leads really changed between the first and last episode. 
 
If this were like say School Rumble were the series revolves around randomness and contradictions for the sake of comedy, then this would all be ok. But the producers are making the characters do this for the sake of unnecessarily expanding a series, making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be.  
 
“So if the series has such cookie cutter story progression like you claim, then why does this series get such unreal praise?” 
 
Simple: Gimmicks and quirks sell more than story. 
 
While one might THINK that the story is interesting and engaging, what’s REALLY interesting and engaging are the non-perverted comedic moments as well as the cute confessions which are done so well that I almost get a nose bleed from a cuteness overload. Who cares who confessed first, they’re cute together. Who cares if Haru’s not well put together, he looks adorable.  
 
Again, I don’t think this is a bad anime at all. If you are a fan of Shojo and or romantic comedies then it’s defiantly worth a look at least till the third episode. But it is a little……..misguided and manipulative to not be a little upset by it.

Story: 
 
Mizutani Shizuku is the main character, She is only focused on her studies and nothing else should get in the way of her learning, Some might say a book worm or teachers pet, Her attitude is very harsh and times and leads you to think she doesn't understand nor care for other peoples emotions. 
 
Yoshida Haru changes this, He is a troublemaker at school, when he turns up, and also beats people up, Has anger problems and friends who only use him.  
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Art/Sound 
 
Both really nice, For me this seems a hybrid of styles and not focused on the stereotypical ""Shoujo"" looks, Although they are their in the art in a subtle manner. 
 
Sound is really good, All characters styles and how they present themselves and suits by the voice acting work, Fond of Haru's voice really suited him. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Final Views:  
 
Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was a lot of fun for me, I enjoyed watching most episodes, and enjoyed the array of characters, Some points i thought this would be a very high contender, But this isn't the case, Don't get me wrong this is good series, but it could of been better. 
 
Some of the ""Comedy"" aspects and hit or miss, Sometimes his silly behavior is laughable, sometimes just annoying, and usually is a core part of an episode. The development of their relationship from Friend to an ""Item"" was really good, but after then it somewhat didn't progress at all, and even by the end i feel both characters were roughly the same development wise as from early on. 
 
Another thing that bugged me was how they would start little ""Side"" stories with the sub characters, but for the most part they didn't go no where, and even one of the key ones involving Asako Natsume was just left without anything happening to it. 
This just feels to me a little rushed, and even the ending, I had to look at this site to know their was 13 Episodes, It left me wanting more, But not in the good way, Felt like we missed out on a lot. Not sure if thats because they might of pushed for a S2? Who knows. 
 
Overal, I liked the series and enjoyed it alot, But the reasons i've stated, it just felt a little rushed and story somewhat took a back seat. 
 
Would recommend it if you like Toradora, or a series like that, The whole Comedy/Romance in this series is good.

       Helpful This review includes the G-Taste OVA as well. Diving into this hentai raw was quite the interesting experience. My head was constantly in conflict with my other head on how pleasurable this show was.  
On one hand the art was easy on the eyes and the girls were hot but seeing how every episode they end up in the most retarded situations really stroked me the wrong way. There was one memorable song in the whole series (G-Taste OVA red dress woman) but man, that shit fucking slaps. Most of my enjoyment of the show came from the fact this it still left quite a bit to imagination. Because of this, it felt like a more ""mature"" hentai and not some tasteless garbage. It felt, in a way, more refined than most shows.

There isn't anything to talk about with this one. Those who watched the parent show should watch it, because it's short and had the same energy as the other one.

          
 
       Helpful Short little special inserted after the performance in ep13 of tari tari and runs in parallel time until the ending. Probably worth watching if you like Tari tari. 
 
Random personal rambling: I think i watched the tv series in 2013 and its quite an weird experience going back to this after 3 years. Makes me wonder why they bother making such a short after the anime's been done for quite a while. The short gets quite sentimental and reiterates the bittersweetness of graduation and parting ways, and it makes me wonder if I would've gotten sad had i watched it back then or perhaps that effect works better after the fact. Because, I was in university back then, and now I don't keep in touch with the friends i had back then i anymore, so in a way the timing in which I watched this short with 2 different perspectives time fits more appropriately.

(Source: Wikipedia)",['Comedy'],none,"Di Gi Charat Christmas Special was a 20-minute episode loosely based around the Christmas theme; present giving. I actually enjoyed this 1 episode more than the other specials and the 16-ep original series. 
 
Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least. 
 
This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter. If you watch this, you won't be disappointed pyo~

From being unable to confess to not knowing what real love actually feels like, various obstacles can arise when learning about romantic attraction for the first time. But underneath all that, young love is something truly beautiful to behold, leading to brand new experiences for those young and in love. 
 
 Tsurezure Children  depicts various scenarios of young love coming to fruition, along with the struggles and joys that it entails. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","Tsuredure Children tells various romantic stories about how it is hard to say ""I love you"", between young students attending the same high school, in an omnibus format. The characters in each story are connected to each other through their various friendships.
","Another example of a brilliant short anime. The ""Love, Actually"" for otaku. 
 
The overall premise is very simple: high schoolers learning how to fall and stay in love in their own different ways. Within those different ways, though, there comes the fragmented short stories carried by different characters whose one thing in common is they all happen to be pursuing education under the same roof. Admittedly, the whole thing may seem sappy at first glance but with excellent execution, the saccharine could become something genuinely sweet-- and Tsurezure Children did just that. 
 
It is difficult to pick the best pairing out of the bunch because each pairing is relatable in their own way. However, Gouda-Kamine pair does manage to be the most grounded and realistic because it deals more into what happens after the classic love confession. Chiaki-Kana pair is totally represents that hilarious phase in life on which no matter what one does, friendship can truly ruin the possibility of romance. Takao-Chiyo pair is probably the most adorable as the two of them navigate the life irony of which ""what is unlikely is not necessarily impossible"". Nonetheless, there are pairs that, unfortunately, do not deliver the equally satisfying sweetness. Takano-Sugawara pair takes more screen time than other pairs but somehow their stories ultimately feel more anticlimactic. Kaga-Nanase storyline feels exciting yet it ends very abruptly. Lastly, there is that Casanova named Katori who, as more episodes roll in, feels like he has overstayed his welcome. 
 
Is Tsurezure Children a good fixture? Yes. However, the fragmented structures may not be for everyone. Like a double-edged sword, the more we as the audience invest ourselves into one of the pairings, the more we crave for longer screen time for our favorites. Funny enough, this anime truly captures the reality-- that sparks always fly all too fast and that more romance always requires more time.

       Helpful This is a solid, romcom show. 
 
It's certainly not your normal, slow romcom. In fact it flips many of the common tropes on it's head. Slow development? Nu uh, how bout they're all mostly in relationships already. Holding hands??? Well yeah, but how about kissing too!!! This show is cute, funny, has great pacing. Tons of cute couples and couple hopefuls. My details are a little fuzzy so I'm being vague. As I remember it's about multiple couples who are loosely tied together one way or another. Most scenes only featuring one or two couples at a time. A loose thread holding the show together is good enough though as the characters really do carry the show on their own. I feel like i didn't enjoy this show as much as some people, it's probably deserving of an 8. To me it's a passable show with many tropes turned on their head. It's sweet, short, and the ending is cute. The manga is probably recommended as it's longer and complete, but this show does what it wants to accomplish, and does it well. Fully recommend for romcom and slice of life lovers!

          
 
       Helpful Was watching this while each episode came out each week. I ended up forgetting about it and just now finished it.  
 
But this was a fun show that has some pretty awesome moments in it. Such as one of the characters sister being messed around with by the girlfriend. 
 
While i do enjoy this and it's fun . The issue i have with it is two things. 
 
1. The story doesn't have an actual ending for a lot of the characters. Such as the Student Council President and the Delinquent and more.  
 
2. While it isn't really bad. It can be annoying how its not just one story in a row. We get one story chopped up into pieces over multiple episodes. This can be alright but for me i just wish we could watch all of one duo's story with it not being over the span of 12 episodes.  
 
The show also has in my opinion two of the greatest couples in anime of 2017 
AkagixRyouko and TakanoxTakurou  
 
I really love these two groups. I would honestly love to see AkagixRyouko have their own story. They are really good on screen and funny. The other Duo is also pretty good. I don't know if they could do their own story by them self. 
 
Really good story and is fun to just watch.

The animation is completely amazing and gorgeous; I've never seen anything like it before.  The images and lyrics of the song match perfectly.  There is well-chosen symbolism representing the events of the anime.  I still don't understand all the symbolism...  I like how they incorporate real-life images into the animation like the hand that represents Mr. Outside.   
 
Overall, this is a must-watch for fans.  The images of the video capture me every time.  Glimpses of the outlines of the two main characters are included just like in the opening for the anime.  Actually, a good bit of the animation from the opening is used in the video...I like that about the video, though.  I also like how the lyrics of the song is posted in creative ways throughout the video.  The only downside to the video is that I think it's a little repetitive, but the song is also repetitive which makes sense, I guess.

She puts a lot of effort into academics and athletics and earns the trust of the teachers. Eventually, she becomes the first female student council president.

However, despite her reputation, she secretly works part-time at a maid café to support her mother and younger sister by returning the huge debt their father had left them.
Unfortunately, Misaki's secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at Seika High. Instead of exposing it to the school, though, Usui keeps it for himself and even becomes a regular customer at the café, much to Misaki's chagrin. Known for being a genius in pretty much everything from academics to athletics and for having rejected numerous confessions of his female peers, Usui takes a liking to Misaki because he finds her 'interesting'. After going through various awkward situations, including being confronted by a forgotten childhood friend of hers, Misaki falls in love with Usui, who reciprocates, and the two soon become a couple.

Being an illegitimate child of a wealthy English noble family, Usui technically cannot form a relationship with anyone not in his social standing, Misaki included.

Their encounter ends with an uneasy truce and a plan to force Juno to negotiate with Thor. When Thor finally meets Odin, the President of Juno, the mystery of Thor's and Chimaera's secret origins are revealed. Odin tells Thor he is a genetically engineered human created from the DNA of all the previous Beast Kings. His mother Eve was the lead researcher at the facility where he was created, and was a surrogate mother to him. Thor's genes adapt to survive under any circumstances, so they mimicked Eve's physical appearance. This is the reason Thor appeared to be Rai's twin. Odin also reveals no new children are being born in the colonies, and that Thor is humanity's last hope for survival. Finally, Odin reveals a long-kept secret: that Earth was destroyed by an asteroid collision long ago, and humanity cannot return there, so they must adapt to survive in the Balkan Star System. However, Odin's plans involve dissecting Thor in order to mass-produce more genetically engineered humans capable of surviving in Balkan, and terraforming Chimaera, which would kill the planet's current inhabitants. With the help of Third, Thor stops the terraforming process, though Third dies in the process. Thor returns to Chimaera to live with Chen, Zagi and the rest of the planet's inhabitants.
In the end, it is revealed that Thor's genes have adapted once again, causing him to take on Third's physical appearance. He and Chen appear to be together. He adopts an orphan girl they both found, naming her ""Tiz"", saying it means hope.

       Helpful Before you begin watching this anime, think to yourself. Are you ready to be depressed? Because that's exactly how this anime makes you feel. This however isn't a bad thing as it is also a wonderful story. If you are in the mood for a happy-go-lucky anime. I wouldn't watch this one for the time being, however it is a must see. 
 
Story: 10 
 
Jyu-Oh-Sei is set in a futuristic time and there are humans living on other planets outside of Earth. There is plenty of symbolism in this anime like power, greed and control. Although futuristic, this anime combines both futuristic and historic elements. The story follows twins Thor and Rai as their parents are murdered and they are sent to a mysterious planet full of carnivorous plant life. The story is depressing and revolves around death and survival but is also very beautiful. My one problem with the story was a love triangle that although helped contribute to the story, I feel could have been replaced by something else. The story is fast paced so it requires full attention. 
 
Art: 8 
 
The art in Jyu-Oh-Sei was good. It was quite crisp and was very appropriate to the story. It was quite gloomy but also very pretty. I didn't feel that the art blew me away, but I never felt like the art never fit a scene. Most of the characters looked good, especially Thor and ""Third"". Overall the art was very good. 
 
Sound: 8 
 
I really enjoyed both the opening and ending songs and the music fits well into place throughout the show. You don't notice it too often because it fits the mood well. Although its good, it isn't outstanding. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The Characters in Jyu-Oh-Sei are outstanding. You get to know a lot about each character as the show doesn't focus too much on action but rather character depth. In it's short time Jyu-Oh-Sei does well to give you insight into all the characters. Thor easily became my favourite character as he is just so cool. He is wise, completely determined and an amazing fighter. He is a natural born warrior both physically and mentally. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
I watched the whole show in one night. Not because I wanted to get through it quickly, but because it was so enjoyable. I couldn't just not finish it. Every time I finished an episode, I had to watch the next one. I enjoyed it so much that I almost fell into the story myself. It was fast paced and quite complex with many twists and turns. The show was like a ride. Although many people may not like the ending, I thought it was good. 
 
Overall: 10 
 
Overall Jyu-Oh-Sei had to be one of the best shows I've seen lately. Wonderful story and really emotional. Definitely one to see. 


          
 
       Helpful Jyu-Oh-Sei was an anime that felt like it could have worked better if it had more episodes to properly develop and flesh out its characters. The anime creates a Lord of the Flies scenario for Thor as he finds himself forced to survive on a penal planet he was tossed onto following the murder of his family and struggles to retain his humanity in an environment where survival of the fittest is key. The series does do a decent job in painting the type of harsh world that Chimaera is with the plant life being quite hostile and finding it tough to judge who to trust on the planet as some characters have ulterior motives in taking Thor under their wing throughout this series. Thor's character is decently fleshed out as you get enough sense of the type of life he lived before being sent to Chimaera and his character as he wants to retain whatever human morality he can on the harsh life of the planet. 
 
However being only at eleven episodes, the show just doesn't have enough time at fleshing out everything it has to offer. Certain characters like Tiz and Karim are never properly fleshed out as you don't get to learn much about their characters other than their personal connections with Thor. This also makes it tough to connect with the character relationships formed in this series as it felt rushed at a number of points, particularly in the time skip that takes place during the middle of the series. I found it quite disappointing that I couldn't get a peek at just how Thor became the competent and influential leader he became on Chimaera when he claimed the position as the show skips five years in time following Thor's defeat of the colony leader in a duel to the death. 
 
Visuals to this series were a mixed bag for me. While it sports great-looking settings and designs for spaceships and plant life, the character designs looked rough with character lining and details with animation looking subpar at a number of points throughout this series. 
 
Jyu-Oh-Sei felt like it was trying to be a grand series focused on Thor's struggles on the harsh penal planet of Chimaera. While it does show effort in portraying Thor's character and depicting the harsh way of life on the planet, 11 episodes just isn't enough to fully flesh out other elements to the world of the series.

Miki discovers wonders she had never seen before, opening a way to change her withdrawn life. 
 
On their way home, Miki and Aya see their class representative Midori Oono entering Saikoro Club, a store specializing in board games. After trying out a German board game, Miki soon understands the kind of fun she had been looking for: playing various games after school along with the friends and acquaintances she makes from her newfound pleasure. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen']","Miki Takekasa is a shy high school girl who prefers to keep to herself. One day after school, she encounters a new transfer student named Aya Takayashiki, who convinces her to go on an adventure together. Sometime later, they spot the class representative, Midori Ono, heading into the entertainment district. When they follow her, they learn she works at a game shop. This discovery causes Miki, Aya, and Midori to realize that they share a passion for board games. As such, they spend time playing different games together.
","Board games is probably not the most mainstream hobby out there but in my experience, it is one of the best social experiences you can have with your friends. For the past 5-6 years now I've regularly hosted board game nights at home with my former high school classmates and it's one of our most regular ways to hang out and reasons to meet. Board games are a great way to interact with each other in a fun, intelligent and rewarding way which also offers flexibility and versatility, and just in general it's one of the most social experiences you can have. I just wish more people gave it a chance because it sure beats going out clubbing, I'll tell you that much. 
 
In case it wasn't obvious, Houkago Saikoro Club is a slice of life anime about exactly that: board games and the social experience that they provide. Despite the cover, it is not really a cute girls doing cute things kind of show, because while the main cast is primarily female, there are also numerous male characters in this show and more importantly it never really tries to go too excessive with the moe. Instead it focuses more on the actual games, and this is something I very much appreciate. You see, the games they play in this anime aren't just random made-up ones, but rather all 100% real board games that you can likely find in any sizeable store that sell these types of games. Even the ones you see in the background on the various shelves that are never actually used or even mentioned in the show are all real too. I've played several of them myself and even own a handful so for any fan of the medium then it's also a show which is packed with relatable references in that sense. It's almost like an easter egg hunt for trying to see how many of them you can find. 
 
On the downside, I guess for anyone that doesn't play board games themselves and/or is relatively unfamiliar with them, I think a lot of the intended appeal of this show goes out the window. If you're solely trying to watch it for the cute girls factor then... you'd probably be better off watching an anime more directly dedicated to that end goal, because again that isn't really what Houkago Saikoro Club is about. Don't get me wrong, the girls in it are likeable enough as they are, but I wouldn't really call them outstanding either. 
 
Overall, it just feels like an anime made for people that are fans of board games, and for those of us at are it's a very relatable, realistic and enjoyable watch. But for anyone else, they'll probably miss the point of the show to some extent. That doesn't make it bad, but it definitely makes it niche. Take that as you will.

(this review is structured and meant to be read as if it was a board game manual) 
 
-- General game info -- 
> game idea and concept by Xiaraith  
> inspired by LIDENFILMS  
> original story and art by Nakamichi Hiroo  
> for any player count, age 13+ 
> Playing time: 5 minutes, potentially leads to another game of 276 minutes 
 
-- Game Material -- 
> models of 3 girls, board game shop, manager 
> locked boxes to be opened when instructed 
> decision board, pawn 
 
-- Game Setup -- 
Prepare the game by taking the two models of the introverted (Miki) and the cheerful (Aya) highschool girls out of the game box.  
Initiate their starting situation by allowing them to meet, which results in them starting a quest that they'll try to achieve for the foreseeable future. As trivial as it might sound, this quest is an adventure to learn about fun and friendship.  
The remaining unlocked models are now added to the mix (the board game shop+manager and the class representative girl named Midori). After making the three girls meet in said shop, the main bulk of our game (and the actual anime) commences. 
Prepare a way to note or remember your personal score (which starts at zero), place the decision board in front of you, and the pawn on the first spot.

Well played, and a worthy score for someone who might be looking for something comfortable to watch in order to calm down or explore the world of gaming. This anime is able to offer the desired variety. 
(Treat this review as if it's rated 7 instead of 9) 
 
(4-6) 
If you are one of MAL's rare board game enthusiasts, Houkago Saikoro Club will almost certainly give you a blast of a time. And if you feel good about cute art and slice of life vibes while also being open to new ideas, this anime is a legit option too. In the end, you'll likely not have to worry about ending up with major things to criticise about this show.

(Less than 4) 
Hmm, even though it might have come down to poor luck or other unfavourable circumstances, the chance of Houkago Saikoro Club not living up to your anime expectations has to be feared. The thing is, while this anime does offer a lot to those who scored highly or are otherwise intrigued by its vibes and themes, there isn't exactly much to find here for the rest of the anime populace. But hey, rather some specialised entertainment than everything trying to please everyone.

First things first, you probably wonder what the locked boxes contain and how/when to open them. Well, do you like to be surprised?  
LIDENFILMS's adaptation of a comfy manga will introduce characters and games that you might have not expected, but which all add to the entire concept. A game needs to be played after all in order to fully realise the special emotions and interacting mechanics, and same goes for this series. 
 
All games in the anime (aside from those created by voiced characters of the show) are real existing games, and details of all the game boxes are all legit. 
 
The genuine interest in board games by the mangaka, Nakamichi Hiroo, is easily noticeable in both the anime and manga, thus having the board game topic is not done in a cheap way as quick attention grab, but to provide a window for everyone to realise that board gaming is a thriving hobby.  
 
Speaking of which, modern board gaming is in a very healthy spot these days, and people like me can easily spend hours daily just to read about new games or play some with friends/family/coworkers/etc. Board gaming isn't physically demanding, which is also why virtually every age group from young to old can enjoy it, something we also notice in the anime. 
 
And you know, speaking from personal experience, I've noticed board game friends (those who generally don't know about the existence of anime) share trailers and details about Houkago Saikoro Club, and some of them did start watching it. A broader appeal is absolutely there, which I can't say about a lot of other anime/manga that feature certain sports/hobbies as their main activity and quirk. 
 
If there is something I've got to criticise, then that the episode length doesn't allow for actually complex games to be part of the anime, even though I would have loved to see some of those. Well, reason enough for me to get a hold of the manga and see what else we get gaming-wise. And isn't this what a good anime tries to achieve, making you want to deal with its source material~ 
 
May these girls and everyone else keep enjoying the activity of board gaming. Its potential is infinite!

Beginning with a sad story of an introverted girl due to the bullying she faced from her shyness. She has little in the way of friendship but this changes with the arrival of Aya. Later Midori and Emilia join the fold too. They all share a past time going through the series with analogue games. Miki the introverted girl meets various people and solves a few misunderstandings with some pointless romance devices shown. Pointless because they are barely touched, they could have been not shown and the show would hardly change.  
 
Initially, I thought this would be a hidden gem, however, I, unfortunately, was mistaken. Initially, it had a slow pace but that was expected and my issue is that the show is just boring.  
 
I gained so little joy out of watching it, for the first time ever I actually considered (but didn't) speeding up the playtime slightly. I watch everything I start to finish. 
 
There is nothing majorly wrong with the show but nothing right particularly either.  
 
The art is average at best. It often can drop its quality a little too often. The characters also have very little charm to them which ruins the viewing a bit.  
 
The show itself I really did try to enjoy, I really wanted to enjoy it but I personally couldn't.  
 
Take my review however you wish. Ultimately the show had a lot of opportunities and instead it failed for me. It could have even been cute girls do cute things but it can't even do that.

This alternate reality presents cutting-edge Japan, the first country to promote the integration of non-human species into society. After the incompetence of interspecies exchange coordinator Agent Smith leaves Kimihito as the homestay caretaker of a Lamia named Miia, the newly-minted ""Darling"" quickly attracts girls of various breeds, resulting in an ever-growing harem flush with eroticism and attraction. 
 
Unfortunately for him and the ladies, sexual interactions between species is forbidden by the Interspecies Exchange Act! The only loophole is through an experimental marriage provision. Kimihito's life becomes fraught with an abundance of creature-specific caveats and sensitive interspecies law as the passionate, affectionate, and lusty women hound his every move, seeking his romantic and sexual affections. With new species often appearing and events materializing out of thin air, where Kimihito and his harem go is anyone's guess! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Seinen']","
For years, the Japanese government had kept a secret: mythical creatures such as centaurs, mermaids, harpies, and lamaias are real. Three years before the start of the story, the government revealed the existence of these creatures and passed the ""Interspecies Cultural Exchange Act"". Since then, these creatures, known as ""liminals"", have become a part of human society, living with ordinary families like foreign exchange students and au-pair visitors, but with other duties and restrictions (the primary restrictions being that liminals and humans are forbidden from harming each other or procreating).
In Asaka, Saitama, Kimihito Kurusu is a normal student who initially has no connection to the exchange program. However, when coordinator Kuroko Smith delivers the very scared and embarrassed Miia to his door by mistake, he cannot bring himself to send her away and allows her to live at his home, taking advantage of his parents' extended absence. As the story continues, Kimihito meets and gives shelter to other female liminals, each of a different species. Some arrive more or less by accident, while others are forced upon him by Smith or simply insinuate themselves into the house. Before long, Kimihito finds himself in a hectic environment, struggling to live in harmony with his new housemates while dealing with both their constant affectionate/romantic advances and the dramas of helping them get along in the human world. The situation takes on a new twist after he is told that because of expected changes in the law dealing with human-liminal relationships, he is expected to marry one of the girls as a test case, thus increasing their competition for his attention. However, as time passes, other liminal girls become attracted to him and begin to vie for his attention, much to Kimihito's embarrassment and the annoyance of his housemates.
","Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Harem anime's are always a mixed bag for me, they could be either bad and boring or good and surprising luckily Monster Musume is actually one of the more surprising aspects of the harem genre. 
 
Our story begins with Kimihito Kurusu who ends up having to take care of a Lamia (Half human, half snake) called Miia and help her integrate with human society however despite her affection for him Kimihito also encounters more monster girls and as his harem grows his life just get's crazier. 
For something that doesn't really have a story this was actually very fun to watch as it mainly relies on the personalities and comedic everyday life of the characters plus I think this probably the most destructive harem yet because these girls are part monster they have something that pretty much most harems don't have which is animal powers so because of these extra body parts they can cause a lot of damage for the MC even if they are not trying to hurt him. 
The show despite being full of sexy monster girls and fanservice it actually brings in a sort of ethnicity because it would be interesting how the world would react to something like this happening and probably wouldn't be as peaceful however this anime does give us some insight into what could happen although considering how the girls react I doubt it'd be like this, plus there's also how people would think of people like this and you get that with some of the characters like Miia or Rachnera who have the monster half of an animal that humans aren't particularly fond of so the show does show off it's racial views pretty well in this. 
 
There is actually quite a large cast of characters most of them being monster girls, but it was interesting how each was a different type and all had different personalities, though there were a few that didn't do much for me. 
Kimihito the male MC is our lucky or unlucky protagonist depending on how you see it that has to put up with the many girls that live with him, compared to other Harem MC's he's actually pretty good despite doing the usual embarrassed look if he see's slightly nude he does from time to time get's his hands dirty like whenever a human picks on one of the girls he will actually give them a piece of his mind and kick their ass plus he does care about each and every one of the girls and isn't really put off by their appearances whatsoever. 
Miia is the first female MC of the group and she is a Lamia, despite being half snake Miia is actually a very sweet, naive and carefree person however being the first does make her the most jealous of the group as the more girls joined the less time she was able to spend with Kimihito though over time she does start to get on with the girls despite always getting into arguments with them and one more thing just make sure you don't eat anything she makes unless you really want to upset your stomach. 
Papi is the second girl and is a Harpy so she is half bird and because she is half bird her body to age ratio is a lot different to the others as to them she looks like a child while she is actually an adult however her personality is very child like as she is always wanting to play though she has been given the term birdbrain because of her short term memory which always makes conversations with her difficult. 
Centorea the third girl is a Centaur making her half horse and she is a very noble person often trying to shield Kimihito from dangerous situations and is always on constant alert this can however make her very strict with the other girls who always rebel against her words thought she can be a sweet and vulnerable person if you are able to get onto her good side. 
Suu is the fourth girl and she is actually a humanoid slime making her the oddest member of the group, she doesn't communicate well with the others and mainly copies what they do, but she doesn't hesitate to cling onto them especially when their sweating so she can collect it for herself and she even has mind reading and transformation abilities yet despite all of this she is definitely one thing and that's adorable. 
Meroune is the fifth girl and is a Mermaid, her tone of voice is much like Centorea's, but to the point where it sounds like she is of nobility and as a little girl she enjoyed stories that involved tragedies so she wants to be with Kimihito so she can experience it for herself which can make her a little loony sometime's. 
Rachnera is the sixth girl and is an Arachne, despite having the body of a spider Rachnera is a sexually devious masochist as she likes to use the other girls as play things for her webs and other things, although because of her body she is looked at as a monster and finds it difficult to socialise until Kimihito came along and thought her legs looked sexy which then changed her perspective. 
There are also other characters like Miss Smith and her MON group who do help Kimihito from time to time to help out with his monster girl situation although most of the time they use him as way to get a free meal although the monster girls in the MON group did actually get to spent some time with him at some point and see why the other girls like him. 
 
The artstyle was actually pretty good especially when it came to the design of the monster girls, there was a nice variety of them and they nicely detailed plus there was some interesting choices of the body types that the girls had and I have to give some kind of applause for making a monster girls sexy because if something like this happened in real life i don't think the reaction would be the same. 
 
The fanservice in this anime was definitely high as the first scene started with bare breasts and you definitely see a lot of bare breasts throughout this show although you would think with this amount of fan service it would take you out of the show, but it surprisingly didn't and actually made a lot of the moments very funny. 
 
Which brings me onto the comedy which was hilarious each of the girls would cause some kind of mayhem for the MC and it was always funny how he either got out of it or how he suffered it because this MC went through so much crap and is still alive by the end, considering these are monster girls that is definitely an achievement. 
 
For Romance I'm surprised the MC was able to make each of the girls happy even though he has like six of them in his harem and will probably keep on growing so I'm surprised none of the girls have tried to kill him yet, but that's mainly because unlike most people in this anime he doesn't care about their monster half in fact he thinks it makes them unique and special because they can do things that normal humans can't do which is what makes the girls envious of him. 
 
Overall for a Harem anime this was actually pretty fun and somewhat different since instead of normal human girls we have monster girls and thanks to anime even something that isn't fully human can be sexy.

          
 
       Helpful Monster girls, monster girls everywhere. Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What's that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don't blame you. Great harem shows as of late have been a dime a dozen, besides the ones that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything that is new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse? Put in cute and sexy monster girls in it, of course! 
 
It is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a modern edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just normal girls, I don't think it would've had as much as an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state-of-mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn't find in a typical harem show. This uniqueness is where Monster Musume has a lot more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things all add something interesting that we aren't used to. 
 
On the topic of the story, there is not really much to say about it other than the fact that it involves a slightly exciting world of monsters being integrated in the human world. The only issue I have with it is the fact that it does not really explain it very intuitively to the point where I just kinda nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it clearly knows how ridiculous it is and runs with it. Hell, even the title itself is translated as, ""Daily Life with a Monster Girl."" Which is what most ecchi/harem anime should try to strive for when developing a story of this nature. 
 
I will briefly go through one by one of each character, since this is after all a character-driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonist are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. For starters, Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is by far the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the adorable voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious to say the least. Not to mention her ""darling"" catchphrase is one that I can't preface about how heart inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at trying to be noble and knightly to her master. 
 
Suu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can't speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and starts to learn how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body is pretty amusing to see. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I've always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, we have Rachnera, the giant spider monster, who is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. Mostly because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters that makes her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won't spoil for those who are not aware. 
 
Our protagonist, named Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the highlights of the show. His brash and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery among females. Not only that but his actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, in particular one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there but in context to the situation at hand, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are completely different from human girls. He is not even an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for like Tomoki from Heaven's Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji, but he manages have a subtle sexual interest that comes up at the right time. 
 
My only big issue with the cast is the fact that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we'd like. Sure there is Sumisu who has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito's care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad, in particular, has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that it was hard for me actually to give them any thought compared to the main girls. It's apparent that they will explore them more in the 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and a separate body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it's worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone. 
 
From a technical standpoint, Monster Musume's art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are. I also enjoy the funny character face reactions whenever there is something lewd, scary, or surprising happening every time they happen. The backgrounds, however, are not something to write at home about. It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay; I liked the chorus of the girls chanting ""Monster! Monster!"" at the beginning but the rest just felt underwhelming.  Same with the ED, although I tend to question how it fits with the tone of the show at all. I know it features the monster squad, which are the action characters of the anime, but it felt like an ED to an action anime overall, not a comedy/ecchi one. 
 
I had read the Monster Musume manga a little before getting into this, so I was expecting much of what I got. And what I got was enough for me to say it was an entertaining harem that reminds me how harem shows can be incredibly enjoyable. All you need is to add a different spin to the genre, and Monster Musume proves that you can do that successfully. Is it a game-changing spin that will change it? Not at all. There's so much add to the genre, but so little for it to be anything but enjoyable escapism. 
 
Grade: A-

          
 
       Helpful This is a pretty big stinker. The shameless ecchi gets annoying after a while, though sometimes the shamelessness itself was amusing. There were a couple funny moments that made me laugh. It  also seems to be aware enough to know that it's a stupid show; that doesn't *not* make it stupid, but at least that's something. Voice acting in the English dub is respectable. The animation and character design aren't bad. It's very goofy yet not that funny. And if you're not laughing or in it for the ecchi then you've got nothing left here. 
 
I think this would've been a way more interesting anime if the monster part of the girls was their heads instead of their legs. Just picture it. Now that would've been something.

 Kakurenbo  follows the story of seven children as they play Otokoyo for the first time and discover why if you play, you never return. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Horror', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']",none,"This was an extremly well done movie! One of my favorites in fact. The feel of the movie itself was freaky as hell! (watched it with my friend at 2:00 in the morning!) The animation was top notch as the creatures were quite horrific. The plot was very interesting and gave you just enough information to keep you interested. Though at times it was a little confusing. The sound was ok as the silence added to the chill, but the characters themselves were given very little depth. The overall feel of this movie was great (in a scare the crap out of you sense) as it blended perfectly to the genre. It left you to decide for yourself. The ending was great! 
 this really is a spoiler: 
  All those lights on the tower were kids! Not to mention the fact they were screaming as the things plugged into them!   
Its a movie that I would seriously love to watch again if I could find it and I recomend you do the same!

          
 
       Helpful There are 2 reasons to write a review.  
 
1. Is this anime for you? 
A: If you are easy to trick and get lost in atmosphere quite often, or don't watch horror much or are frightened easily then yes.  
 
Now part 2 is justify why you hate something to the people who love it. (Fair enough since you should at least provide good reasoning for liking or hating something.) Past this part has SPOILERS. 
 
 
It is a game of 7 children. There are 8 children. This is the start. Gee, WONDER WHO THE 8TH IS!? Also, she looks exactly like the one kids sister (despite wearing a mask), and they all wear fox masks. Now they spend 16 minutes running around the city looking for the girl (8th child) as well as being chased by monsters. During which period, they find a poster with 4 monsters and a fox in the middle. 
 
Right then I stopped the movie, walked to my brother's room and explained to him That I'm watching a OVA in which there are kids running around with a fox mask, an extra kid pulling a Silent Hill 2, and that the fifth monster was a fox. We said IN UNISON ""She's it"". She literally is ""It"" btw. To catch the children. Then after 16 minutes elapse, we get to see that SHE IS THE MONSTER! Oh wow, shocker on shock street. They still feel the need to then explain that however. Then she says ""When we play Hide And Seek the city gets brighter, but only for a minute"". Right then I said ""She's using them as batteries"" then that's revealed, as if that's a surprise. Then it's revealed the last child is it, go figure.  
 
So in addition to being 100% predictable, how is the atmosphere since that's a key aspect of horror! It's not great. The music is poor, it's often annoyingly dark despite being animated, the creatures are not that scary, the characters are not particularly likable. They're UNLIKABLE CHILDREN, how is that possible!? Probably because they're soulless, in a 20 minute production, designed primarily to serve as fodder for the monsters.  
 
The only thing it does well is somehow make 3d cell shading not look horrible for 20 minutes.  
 
So I guessed the plot, I wasn't afraid or creeped out despite watching it at midnight in a dark room, and it didn't entertain me. Enjoy! I am being generous with my rating.

          
 
       Helpful Kakurenbo is a short flick involving an urban legend that tells of how those playing a specific game of hide-and-seek at a certain forbidden, deserted neighborhood all goes missing without a single trace. This being of the horror genre can mean only one thing: a group of kids got curious and were lured into the game, with obvious disastrous consequences, as they found out just why the game is a taboo. 
 
I'm not expecting much from the characters, since this is such a short film (and a horror one at that). You have the bully/ jerk jock archetype and his cronies, followed by the stoic and quiet characters, the obligatory mysterious creepy child and so on. The cast may not be outstanding, but they suit the show just fine, though it would be nice if the movie were somewhat longer so as to allow a little more characterization; a bit more background on the characters' motivations, maybe a little bit about the town and so on. While the idea of having the entire cast wearing the fox masks in order to play the game prevents the audience from seeing their expressions, it does add to the ambience and that's the crucial point. 
 
Indeed, because the story is such a simplistic and short one, the movie relies heavily on its audio and visual elements. As such, the animation quality is unsurprisingly impressive. Things such as the way shadows are cast, as well as how the various lighting effects are done all helped to create a spooky atmosphere for the story. Furthermore, the abandoned buildings in the background are detailed and appear to have a tint of cyberpunk feel to it, suitably adding to the mood. Last but not least, the music compliments the movie well. Using an orchestra of traditional Japanese instruments certainly helped in creating a haunting, chilling soundtrack throughout the movie. My only complaint however, goes to the demons themselves. They are too obvious. A large element of horror and paranoia stems from not knowing what you’re up against; yes, the demons need to be scary looking as well (and they do look menacing) but it is building up the suspense of them appearing that really sets the tension. In this case, the demons are properly seen right from the beginning. We see them too clearly and that results in the show being less spooky than it could have been. I guess this is attributed the fact that film is simply too short to do proper build-ups. On the other hand, the designs for the demons are interesting: traditional Japanese folklore sort of demons but part mechanical – further contributing to the subtle cyberpunk feel. 
 
All in all, Kakurenbo is a reasonably decent show to watch. While not downright spine-chilling scary, it is nonetheless relatively creepy, particularly with the reveal and the stinger at the end. It being such a short film thus bears resemblance to those series of short horror stories prevalent on the net (also known as 'creepy pastas'). If anything else, Kakurenbo is at least worth the visual treats it offer.

Besides that, the animation can suffers sometimes with repeated shots and sequences. This is troublesome since was on the big screen and not in the smaller screen, but I let these thing pass since it was made in the 60’s, where even Disney was doing it. 
 
It follows the source material well, even if they changed Joe from being juvenile to a race car driver since he would look better I guess.  But this movie is more of an adaptation than a retelling, which I think the movie suffers the most of. The story seems to be cover the first chapters of the first arc and the last chapters of the second arc. Which weird in the narrative when you consider 2/3 of the movie introducing the characters and escaping Black Ghost, just to have a time-skip and a final fight at the climax. 
 
Even if we spend most of the movie introducing these characters, we know more about the cyborgs power than their personality. If you go through the movie, it also seems that this movie is more aimed at the leader of the group rather than the group itself, which can be a disappointment for those who wanted to see a chemistry with all the characters. 
 
The movie is good for those who wants to skip the first two story arcs of the manga, but for those who already have, this movie will not give you anything new. Especially that first tv series started two years afterwards. 
 
But I can say that the opening was nice :> 
 
Go and see it if you are into some cheesy 60’s Cyborg action. 

          
 
       Helpful Usually there are two conflicting aspects when it comes to rating something as old as Cyborg 009: Compared to more recent series or movies it goes without saying that it is going to feel dated and unpolished; applying today's standards would be more than unfair, modern media is a beneficiary of an evolution that spanned several decades after all.  
 
At the same time it would be equally as unfair to justify all of its shortcomings by stating 'It's old! They didn't know better back then!' Not every piece of media ages as well as the other and some works, no matter how old they are, will always remain timeless. 
 
Cyborg 009 is the brainchild of Shotaro Ishinomori, pupil of Osamu Tezuka, the god of manga himself, which explains the evident similarities in both their art and attitude to work. Just like Tezuka, Ishinomori was incredibly productive during his lifetime, publishing an incredible amount of manga; on top of that he also created numerous tokusatsu-franchises which are popular till today (like Kamen Rider). Working as an assisstant on Astro Boy certainly left its mark on Cyborg 009, as well as the ever-looming shadow of the cold war and the increasing western influences brought by Japan's opening after WWII. 
 
The story goes as follows: Nine people from all over the world are abducted by a mysterious organisation named `Black Ghost' and are forcibly transformed into cyborgs with various superpowers. Black Ghosts goal is benefitting from warfare and conflicts by selling weapons and destabilizing countries - and the cyborgs are just one of the many tools they use to achieve it. Of course the cyborgs themselves are not pleased with the new part they are supposed to play, so they plan to escape and end Black Ghost once and for all.  
 
Joe Shimamura with the number 009 becomes the cyborgs unquestioned leader from the get go and is the flawless, perfect hero who knows and can do pretty much everything. Compared to him the others are mainly there to show off their powers or to provide comic relief. It soon becomes clear that the story is mostly about Joe and not about the team itself, since all the others remain characterless and their backrounds are never mentioned. 
 
The movies main focus is the fight against Black Ghost, told through numerous battles against various robots or monsters. Conflicts are resolved quickly without serious consequences or surprises and there aren't really any twists worth mentioning. One the one hand the tone tries to be serious but on the other hand it is full of cartoony slap-stick gags that make you think you're watching Tom & Jerry.  
 
The animation is okay for the most part. Many of the movements feel pretty wacky, especially the ones of the characters with more realistic designs. Of course Cyborg 009's age has to be considered and I also assume their budget wasn't that high, however if you compare it to some of the movies Disney has put out at the same time or even prior there are a lot of deficiencies. Japanese animation still had quite the way to go.  
 
Cyborg 009 has not aged well. Unless you are interested in the history of anime and its beginnings or seeing one of Japan's first superhero teams in action there is little reason to watch it. Checking out one of the newer adaptions or reading the manga, if you happen to be curious about these characters may prove more rewarding

She falls asleep but wakes up hearing mice squeaking...","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","Narrated by the adult Clara, she tells the story of Ragman, a mysterious old man who roams about the city looking into people's houses and turns children into mice if he catches them up past their bed time.
Clara is excited about her friend Fritz coming to visit the next day and refuses to go to sleep. Her Aunt Gerda  tries to frighten her with stories about the Ragman, but Clara says she's too grown up to believe in him. Uncle Drosselmeyer startles them with his arrival. He gives Clara a nutcracker doll, which she adores. She promises to go to bed immediately if she can keep it.
Clara awakens in the middle of the night to find her nutcracker gone. She sees a group of mice carrying it down the stairs and follows them into the living room. As she takes back the doll, she's confronted by the leader of the mice, a two-headed rat queen. The queen orders Clara to hand over the nutcracker, but she refuses. Clara is knocked out just as the nutcracker springs to life to defend her against the mice.
The next morning, Clara finds herself back in her bedroom. She tells her aunt about the mice and her doll being missing, but Gerda insists that she is talking nonsense and is ill with a fever. In her delirious state, Clara goes down to the living room and stares at the grandfather clock. Thinking she sees Uncle Drosselmeyer inside, she climbs in, only to be scared by the Ragman.
She wanders, looking for Drosselmeyer, until she finds herself in a palace. There she sees a portrait of a girl identical to her and a glass coffin containing a sleeping mouse person. A king and a group of mourners appear, believing Clara to be their Princess Mary returned. After Clara corrects their mistake, King Goodwin explains that she's in the Doll Kingdom. They were at war with the mice, led by the two-headed queen Morphia. When defeat seemed inevitable, the dolls surrendered. However, the King refused to agree to Morphia's final term: Princess Mary must marry her son, Gaar. As punishment for refusing, Morphia cursed the princess to look like a hideous mouse and lie in sleep until King Goodwin agrees to the marriage.
King Goodwin gathers all the world's wise men in hopes they can find a way to break the curse, but all their ideas are far fetched and illogical, and an argument quickly breaks out between them. Despairing that no one knows how to help, Clara leaves the castle and wanders the streets. A street singer points her in the direction of The Queen of Time, who is known for having the answer to everything. Clara goes to her and asks if she knows how to save the princess and defeat Morphia. The Queen of Time uses her magical crystal ball to spy on Morphia, revealing the only way to save the princess is to destroy the queen's source of power, the Nut of Darkness. This can only be done if the magical Sword of Pearl is wielded by someone with a pure heart. The Queen of Time provides the sword, but it's up to Clara to find someone to carry it into battle.
Clara returns to the castle, believing Franz, the captain of the guard, has a pure enough heart. She tells him what he must do in order to save the princess. King Goodwin promises Franz his daughter's hand in marriage if he's successful, and Franz leads the doll army off to battle. They arrive as the mice are celebrating Gaar's eminent marriage to the princess. Just as it seems the toy soldiers are losing, Franz destroys The Nut of Darkness and kills Morphia - but not before she places a curse on him, turning him into a nutcracker doll.
Clara carries the Nutcracker back to the palace, where she finds the court and King Goodwin are celebrating Princess Mary's awakening. Seeing Franz's new state, the princess abandons the marriage promise and calls the Nutcracker ugly. Clara leaves the kingdom to wander in search of anyone who knows how to return Franz to human, unaware that Gaar survived the attack and is following her. She eventually comes across the Watchmaker, who tells her the only way to save Franz is through an act of true, unselfish love. Clara declares  she loves Franz, but the Watchmaker says that isn't enough.
Exhausted from travelling, Clara falls asleep. She dreams that Franz is human again and they enter a magical kingdom made of candy. As they're about to ascend the stairs to live happily ever after in their castle, Clara's foot becomes stuck. Franz continues without her, leading Clara to grab his foot and beg him not to go. She wakes up to realize she's clutching the Nutcracker as Gaar tries to pull him away. She begs Gaar to spare Franz and kill her instead, but Gaar insists Franz must die for killing his mother. As he's about to stab the Nutcracker, Clara uses her own body as a shield. This frees Franz from the spell and destroys Gaar.
Clara wakes up in bed, with Uncle Drosselmeyer beside her. As Clara is recounting what happened and trying to ask Drosselmeyer what he was doing in the clock, Aunt Gerda comes in to say Fritz has arrived. He comes in, identical to Franz. Older Clara narrates that she and Fritz lived happily ever after.

Story 
A bit confusing to understand certain connections. Such as the first villain's connection to the the other main villain. While i don't think it was made clear one was sent out to build a force for the other to conquer with. Aside from that the story was a delightful romantic tale with some tossed in drama. As for the ending a true fairy tale ending. 
 
Art 
This movie has come a long way. It used to be painted in such a dark fashion. Like a dream which makes sense given plot. But more of a dream where one would recall bits and peaces. For depending what version you had that is all you saw. Luckily there is a brighter more refined detailed version(which is what i saw). However, there were some dark areas but a real remarkable difference compared to the vch version. 
 
Although one element that was somewhat featured in the show was the portrayal of a real life ballerina. Not quite sure aside from innocence that had with the story. 
 
Overall: If you are a parent and wish to present a young girl a memorable tale to ponder as she drifts off to sleep i would suggest this. While sure it does have a certain England feel to it but the happy message comes out clear.Love conquers all. With the added bonus of possibly encouraging a proper follow through with bedtime hours.

He returns to his old home, the noble Kannagi household, after being banished four years ago for his inability to control fire and his subsequent defeat in a duel at the hands of his younger cousin, Ayano Kannagi. 
 
Returning after such a brutal exile already gives rise to many conflicts, but to make matters worse, several Kannagi family members have recently been murdered with Fuujutsu. This leads the Kannagi family, including the hot-headed Ayano, to suspect Kazuma as the culprit. Now, Kazuma must not only clear his name, but also aid the family he shares a mutual hatred with, in order to discover the true identity of the killer. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","Kazuma Kannagi was the eldest son of the Kannagi family and presumed heir. However, due to his inability to use ""Enjutsu"" (炎術, Blaze Technique), the power to control flames, within his family he was considered to be useless. Despite his inability to wield fire, his father insisted on him competing for the right to wield ""Enraiha"" (炎雷覇, Blaze Lightning Supremacy), a powerful heirloom sword traditionally wielded by the family heir. The 18-year-old Kazuma was soundly defeated by 12-year-old Ayano Kannagi, his second cousin, and his father banished him from the family.
Four years later, he returns as a master of ""Fūjutsu"" (風術, Wind Technique), the power to control wind, and with a new name: Kazuma Yagami. Soon after his return, several Kannagi family members are killed by someone using Fūjutsu and Kazuma is presumed to have committed the murders in revenge for his banishment. Though innocent of the murders, he is confronted by various members of his former family who wish to fight him. However, the only person that Kazuma wants to fight is his father, the strongest Enjutsu user and whom he later defeats in a duel.
Kazuma is revealed to be a Contractor, a rare individual who has entered into a contract with the ""Kaze no Seirei-Ō"" (風の霊魂王, Wind Spirit King). Due to this, Kazuma is able to draw upon the wind spirits around him, which amplifies his inherent powers, and allows him to heal his wounds. When using this power, his eyes turn azure blue. However, this ability puts a strain on his body, as it is his stamina and will that limits the amount of power available to him.
After the duel Kazuma returns to his hotel and finds that his younger brother, Ren Kannagi, an extremely powerful Enjutsu user in his own right, has been eagerly waiting to see his adored elder brother again. Their reunion is interrupted by the Fūjutsu user who killed the other Kannagi and who kidnaps Ren. Kazuma returns to his former home to consult with the head of the Kannagi. Ayano intrudes into their meeting and, believing Kazuma to be guilty of the murders, attacks him on sight. Remonstrated by the family head, and her father, Ayano works with Kazuma to rescue Ren.
Further story arcs revolve around Kazuma, Ayano and Ren and the growing relationship between them.
","Kaze no Stigma  I can honestly say this one caught me by surprise. I went into watching this anime thinking its going to be your typical fighting and love romance that is  so over done.

You have your family issues, family dishonor, taboo relations and what wouldn't make this any more better is the lecherous acts from time to time mixed with some butt kicking action.

It features a 6-minute prologue of Freedom as well as various staff interviews.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","Freedom is about a child, Takeru, discovering a secret that could change the very society he depends upon.
Civilization on the Earth was destroyed by a permanent abnormal climate shift. Cities with millions of people had been built on the far side of the Moon and became the only place where humanity still survived. The remaining population declared the foundation of Republic Eden, then set forth expanding those lunar colonies that loved peace and freedom.
More than 160 years have passed since then. In Eden, children complete their compulsory education program when they are 15 years old. They are then integrated into the society as citizens. During their brief moratorium they are granted freedom. Like other boys, Takeru decides to take part in a race with his friends using machines particular to the Moon, called “Vehicle”. But what distinguishes Takeru is that he has constructed his own vehicle. When his vehicle catches fire on a public road he is sentenced to 10 hours of ""volunteer"" work outside the dome, where he discovers the remains of a small crashed capsule bearing photographs and articles seemingly sent from Earth. Structures visible in the background identify the location they were taken as the Kennedy launch facility in Florida.
Infatuated with a young woman in the photograph, Takeru attempts to research conditions on Earth and finds that the library's information on the home planet is heavily censored. Furthermore, nobody is permitted to travel far enough from the dome over the lunar surface to get within visual range. He discovers a small enclave of people living in a facility outside of Eden's centralized control, and after befriending the enclave's leader is given access to a moon rover with sufficient range to get a view of Earth. He sees that the Earth is blue; it has recovered from the disaster that befell it and is now habitable again. The authorities of Eden pursue Takeru, attempting to suppress this discovery, but Takeru and his friend Bismarck manage to commandeer an old ""escape"" rocket and leave Eden to explore Earth first hand.

Not only a tribute to the moon landing(sorry theorists, it happened.) but a reminder that we shouldn't relax. In other words, each step one stakes like on the moon jumps or kick-starts another. Slowly but surely we walk the path to our goal or flag. America while being gung ho(working together in Japanese terms) tends to forget about the present and live in the future. That necessary isn't a bad thing for it can bring new ideas to the table. Although, if we can slow our thinking and work with what we already have before kick starting the new thing more progress can be made. When further progress is made only than can we joy of freedom for we would be done with that task. A statement to greed and being hot headed.

","I haven't seen the anime this OVA is coming after, but if you have played the game and you want to see animations of the bad endings, this is the place to come to. If you like horror and yaoi mixed together, come here.  
 
If you watched the anime hoping for it to be BL like the game, but you were sorely disappointed and wondering where all the L went, it's here, so come here.  
 
If you like yaoi come here, unless you hate blood (then don't come).  
 
If you want a riveting plot, no, leave, quickly. 

          
 
       Helpful THIS OVA INCLUDES GAY SEX, RAPE, NUDITY AND BLOOD - if want to avoid those, don't watch it. The anime doesn't have these, so you can just watch the anime without watching the OVA. 
This OVA shows what would happen to Aoba if things had gone wrong on episode 11 of the anime. It has good quality animation because it came on DVD and there isn't much of a plot to insert here. The voice acting is really good on it and it's a great adaptation of the bad ends. Excluding how short each part was (but I understand why it is like that), I have no complaints. 
So,  nothing I wrote on the first sentence bothers you - go watch it.

          
 
       Helpful I believed the idea for the DRAMAtical Murder anime was not really to give an accurate adaptation to the source material, but rather to try and milk a successful game series by putting a SFW-not-really-gay version of it on TV. With that said, I'm really confused as to why this OVA exists the way it does. 
 
The story of the OVA adapts all of the bad ends from the first game (mixed with some elements of the second game). The TV anime took every route from the games and mashed them together in a rushed, impersonal, poorly pieced together story, and the same can pretty much be said for this OVA, but this time they actually kept in the horror and gay porn? 
 
Like, if you're going to cut out a lot of what the fans of the game like for the anime, fine. I can understand wanting to try and attract a new audience. But then after doing that they make this OVA, which is obviously something made for fans of the games. I usually see OVAs as being something like ""You liked the anime, so if you want even more here's a little bonus for you!"" but this OVA brings back exactly what they cut out of the anime when they tried to draw in a new audience, so do they think that the new audience really wants this? Was it really made just to try and milk the fans of the games?? I really don't understand.. 
 
It may sound like I have nothing good to say about this OVA, but I actually thought it was interesting, the way they pulled off showing all of the bad ends together in a way that made sense in terms of what they did with the anime. But while it was interesting, it wasn't exactly well done. 
 
The animation was poor. There was limited movement in general, and whenever a character did move a lot, it looked a awkward and unnatural. The art itself was fine for the most part, but when it came to actual animation, it was a bit hard to watch. This was all made worse by the fact there were sex scenes happening. Everything looked jerky and weird, it wasn't good. 
 
There were also a lot of times when the mouth movements didn't match up well with words and sounds, again, made worse and more obvious by the fact there were sex scenes. 
 
After ragging on it that bad, it's worth saying that I did actually enjoy it, but I am entirely biased as I was a big fan of how the bad ends were done in the game. Even if this OVA was objectively a mess, there are still bits that take after the game pretty well and it made me happy to see them. 
 
Should you watch this? 
 
If you really enjoyed the bad ends from the games and REALLY want to see your favs animated (cough Shiroba cough) then sure, but don't go into it expecting it to be as great as you remember. 
 
If you liked the TV anime and like yaoi, then sure, but again, don't expect it to be anything great. 
 
If you just generally like horror and yaoi mixed together, sure, that's pretty much all this is. 
 
If any of those don't apply to you, then don't waste your time, you more than likely won't enjoy this at all.

And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited.

I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag. 
 
Animation: 
Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...

But in the end it makes you cry rivers, one of the best masterpiece classics in existence. For an anime that was created in the 80s its animation, sound and story are much better then some of nowadays anime.  
 
I rate this anime paced in its timeline the 80s and not nowadays, in terms of its time everything is a perfect 10. If you were watching this when it aired you would give it a 10 but if you were watching it now it would still be a good 7.  
 
I recommend you do watch it and stick to the last episode, its where the underrated gem truly shine. Of-course throughout the journey it well shine in different episodes and it all connects towards its majestic ending.  
 
of-course theirs more that the journey offers after the ending so the manga well provide those answers, until one day we get a second season.

While walking in the park with Annette Tison, Talus Taylor thought he heard a child ask his parents for something called ""Baa baa baa baa"". Not speaking French, he asked Tison what the words meant. She explained that the child was asking for a treat called Barbe à papa (cotton candy, literally 'daddy's beard'). Later at a restaurant, the couple began to draw on the tablecloth, and came up with a character inspired by the candy: a pink and round character. When it came time to give it a name, Barbapapa came naturally.Several European publishers expressed interest in Barbapapa but did not wish to spend the publishing cost. Frank Fehmers, a Dutch publisher, subsequently set up a co-production and the first editions were published in 1970. The original editions were published in French by L'École des Loisirs, in Dutch by Frank Fehmers Productions, in British English by the Ernest Benn Company, and in American English by the Henry Z.

Now where the anime starts to fall off is the sound, randomly in the episodes you'll hear explained screeching noises which can cause your eardrums to rupture. I think if you combined all the screeching noises of the whole anime backwards you'll hear a secret message, which is a social commentary on why the A-Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.

I have only watched the first episode but here is the story for what I have seen: 
The first episode is split up into two 15 minute parts. The basic summary of the first part is a group of boys sexually assaulting a school girl. The second part is a bondage with some older guys abusing and sexually assaulting some young girls.

(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Laid-back RETURNS! and it's as amazing as it has ever been. What I really love about this series is its outstanding atmosphere that warms you inside and it does so impeccably. I have seen plenty of other moe anime, but yuru camp is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to the overall experience of the show. 
 
These shorts are three episdoes. The first two being mainly about room camp that we sometimes saw parts of in the end of the episodes of the anime. 
 
The first one talks about the beginnings of the camping club when Aki and Aoi first started it. It is in the same style that we're used to and is basically a chitchat between the two about camping and its equipment so nothing new is introduced in it and nothing is missing either. 
 
The second episode is one after Nadeshiko joined the gang and is also a chitchat episode, but we are introduced to new things about the characters especially Aoi and the loli Aoi, her sister, who makes an actual appearance this time as well. Nadeshiko almost always undeniably adds to the experience with her adorable character and I usually notice that at the scenes without her, but this episode is mostly focused on her and her cuteness so if you're a Nadeshiko fan, you're in for a treat. 
 
Last but not least, the third episode which I would encourage you not to read my take on as the surprise factor is key sometimes so I'll start by vaguely pointing out that it isn't another room camp episode, but an actual camping one and it is one that stands out from the rest of what we have seen so far so if for any reason you don't want to watch the room camp episodes I would encourage you to at least watch this one. 
 
Now I start talking about the episode itself. This time, the girls travel abroad to camp, but due to circumstances I won't get into detail about they end up on an uninhabited island with no means of contacting human civilization. It's time for some survival camping! But not so much. This show is yuru camp, not btoom. Even if survival camping is a unique experience I still want what I signed up for. And so they give it to us brilliantly. I have seen survival games incorporated a lot in anime, but this is definitely one to remember. Despite being stranded on an island the girls still hold it together and live through the hardships of the island as a team. They still give us the exquisite experience I'll probably never see in any other anime with such flair. It was a bittersweet episode with the slightest glimpses of the girls missing their home while still smiling so brightly and having their lightly comic moments we love. 
 
And so this review comes to a conclusion. Bottom line, if you liked the anime just as I did, definitely give these a watch. The cute squad is here, the laid-back moments are here and the experience as a whole hasn't been demoted in the slightest, rather these shorts have added a little to what the anime might have missed and don't exist solely for the sake of it. 
Side note: Give me season 2 already!

          
 
       Helpful The specials include three episodes: Every episode is different, so I am gonna talk about every episode individually.   
   
Episode 0  
It's simply how Aoi and Chiaki got the clubroom. It has some nice backstory for Chiaki and some funny jokes, but it is probably the weakest of the three episodes. Not all jokes land and it is overal not on par with the usual quality of the show. Still you should watch it, just for Chiaki's backstory Visuals alone.   
   
Episode 1 
Nadeshiko's inteligence is here tested. This has some really funny jokes and the end joke was probably my favorite of all the specials. It doesn't really add anything, but it gives me a good laugh. Also mini Aoi is there, so it is must watch.   
   
Episode 2   
Without a doubt the best of the specials. It is also the longest, while the other are around 6 minutes long, this episode is double that. The girls go on camping in Australia, but after a misunderstanding they land in a unhabited Island. Now they have to survive and maybe even have fun surviving. The Visuals are pretty, the jokes are funny and it is a nice change of scenery. If you are going to watch any of the specials, then you should absolutely watch this one.   
   
Conclusion 
The specials are nice. I didn't had high hopes for them, but it genuinely surprised me how good they were. If you liked Yuru Camp and you want more of it, it doesn't hurt to watch the specials.

          
 
       Helpful As the last of the yuru camp specials has been released i thought i would give my thoughts on the specials and the show as a whole as i have really loved it. 
 
If i had to describe this series with one world it would be joyful. It doesn't have a great story or an original premise or even really original or different characters but it doesn't need that. The show perfectly encapsulates a sense of fun which i find rare in a lot of other anime. Each episode was just a different fun little camping journey or such like that was just a laid back and fun thing for you to watch and every week i looked forward to this little slice of enjoyment.  
 
The characters are also incredibly enjoyable. All members of the cast, especially the two main girls nadeshiko and rin, are so fun to watch interact with one another and the world around them and are endlessly fun to watch. 
 
These specials have up till the 3rd fine and fun enough but the final one ""survival camp"" felt just as joyful and fun as the main series. It was great to see the gang again on an adventure and i would definitely recommend this special to anyone who enjoyed the main series. 
Also if you haven't watched the main show and remotely enjoy slice of life comedy moe shows then give yuru camp a shot. It is brilliantly fun

Gattai Movie!!,"This double feature comprises of Gunbuster and Die Buster (aka Gunbuster 2) condensed into a single theatrical release told in two parts with a musical intermission in between. The first part, Gunbuster the Movie, condenses the six episodes of the original OVA into a 95-minute movie featuring a new 5.1 audio remix and a redub by the original Japanese cast. The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Top o Nerae 2! Diebuster follows the story of Nono, a country girl who dreams of becoming a space pilot (or, to be more precise, ""like Nonoriri"", the meaning of which is revealed as the series progresses) who, due to a chance encounter with an actual space pilot, finds herself becoming part of the elite Fraternity. Made up of teenage pilots called Topless, and armed with quasi-humanoid weapons called Buster Machines, the Fraternity's mission is to protect the people of the Solar System from attack by swarms of space monsters.
The series revolves around Nono's quest to become like Nonoriri, her relationship with Lal'C Mellk Mal, the first Topless she meets whom she immediately idolizes (to the point of calling her onee-sama, or big sister), and the hard work she believes she has to do to be ""worthy"" of Lal'C's attention. It also explores her interactions with the rest of the Idols, her efforts to fit in and, ultimately, the truth to her forgotten past.
After dealing with swarms of space monsters, and the personal conflicts of the Topless themselves, the empire discovers a threat of a real space monster when the Serpentine Sisters attempt to awaken something they call ""an eternal Topless"", which could destroy the space monsters for them and provide them with a way to keep from ever losing their Topless power. This so-called ""Topless"" is actually a true space monster, as Lal'C learns when she witnesses its vicious attacks against her comrades and, horrified, asks Dix-Neuf (her Buster Machine) what this creature might be. The fact that the monsters Topless had been battling up to this point were merely first-generation alternate Buster Machines, used to protect the human race from true space monsters in earlier generations as a Solar Defense Force, is also revealed.
During these events, Nono's potent powers as Buster Machine no. 7 awaken, she and the Topless do battle with the real space monster and are victorious. Nearing the end of the story, they encounter the last of the space monsters carrying a black hole and utilizing it as an energy source to warp from system to system. The empire plans to use Nono's Buster Machine powers and the artificial Buster Machines to destroy the final Space Monster. However, Lal'C and the Fraternity find themselves useless during this time, and one of the Topless is permanently put out of commission when he has finally reached his age. Nono attempts to hold back the monster, but to no avail. Lal'C then brings Jupiter 2 out of orbit and seems to summon it the way she summons Dix-Neuf, causing it to crash directly into the monster - which shows no signs of damage.
The Space Monster warps closer to earth, and Nono suddenly departs with the Solar Defence Force, seemingly vanishing from the system. The empire decides to use Earth as a weapon to destroy the final Space Monster to ensure their survival. Meanwhile, Lal'C, for the first time, delves into Nono's past; how she learned to idolize ""Nonoriri"" and the man who found her in the depths of Space. She and the remainder of the Topless prepare for the Space Monster's arrival and the timely intervention of Nono, who now becomes the mega android DieBuster. However, frustrated with Nono's departure, Lal'C batters ""DieBuster"" in a fit of rage. Just as she is about to land a finishing blow using Douze-Mille's reformed components as a Buster Machine, her Topless powers suddenly expire. ""DieBuster"" attempts to attack the Space Monster, with no effect. However, the monster vaporizes ""DieBuster's"" hands. Dix-Neuf moves on his own to help Lal'C access the true cockpit in his brain, activating his true form, and coaxes Nono to come out of the disintegrating ""DieBuster"" and fight with her. With the two girls together once more, and Dix-Neuf's new powers, they defeat the final Space Monster with a Double Inazuma Kick.
However, in the wake of their battle, the Black hole tears open due to the Space Monster's death. Nono and Lal'C share one last moment together, their hopes, dreams and futures if they had survived, and Nono finally gives Lal'C a piece of her generator, or singularity, in the form of an origami crane, before using the remnants of the Alternate Buster Machines that comprised ""DieBuster"" to warp the black hole and herself away from earth. Dix-Neuf saves Lal'C, and brings her back to civilization, where she weeps at the loss of Nono.
Ten years later, Lal'C becomes an environmentalist and her Topless comrades have moved on from their previous life. She stays on a hilltop in the Okinawan coast line, musing about Nono before the city's lights shut off. She stares in the starry sky, and it is revealed all along that Nono and Lal'C's timeline is the setting of the last episode of the first Gunbuster OVA, as explicitly said by Lal'C when she first muses about Nono. Its two pilots, Noriko and Kazumi, descend from the remnants of the first ever Buster Machine, and Lal'C vows to tell Noriko about Nono's life and her sacrifice.
","Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.  
 
Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct here.   
 
Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort. With all the cutting they had to do, scenes jump around a bit more than they should. The brunt of the action's there, but the development to that action, and especially the reasoning for that action suffers in the movies. 
  
But please do try the original series!  They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.  Come back for these compilation movies only if you get the urge to rewatch both of these underground gems.

","Alright, so about kamichama karin. On the first sight a normal mahou shoujo, with happy graphics. But when you start really looking in it, you will find yourself getting in to the story and feelings of the characters. I must say, the story is quiye confusing at the beginning. It only came clear to me when i watched kamichama karin Chu. But if you dont think to much about it, you'll find yourself following the story in no time. The characters are very alive and unique, what i really like, and my favorite character of the whole series is..Micchi! I think he is very cute and funny. The art is i must say very cute! I do recommend kamichama karin, it has a nice and sometimes sad story line, and some fun characters!

          
 
       Helpful I watched this series a couple of years ago in fact and I absolutely adored it, however to all of you who are planning to watch this my suggestion is: watch the anime, then go to the manga straight after. However let's get started on the review shall we? 
 
Story: However childish and repetitive this plot seems like in the beginning, give it a chance kay? In the end, trust me, it's much more that meets the eye. At first you find yourself thinking: great another magical girl type anime, however under the surface there is much, much, more, almost to the point where we get into mild mindscrew.  
 
Art: I have to give this a 10 just because Koge-Donbo's art is so darn adorable and cute.  
 
Sound: I'm basing this score on the openings and endings songs.  
 
Character: The characters however good they are, are, truthfully, fairly predictable and nothing that hasn't been seen before in the anime world. 
 
Enjoyment: Overall this story is very appealing, you have comedy, some romance here and there, your serious moments, and the adorableness of the characters. 
 
Overall: I give it a 9, while individually some aspects of the show may look dull and repetitive, in it's entirety this series is quite original and very enjoyable through and through. While it does have it's serious parts, it is not a bad watch if your looking for something a little carefree and relaxing, while having a plot at the same time.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is very out standing and unique and has qualities that normal animes wouldn't have. This anime really related to Greek Gods and Goddesses and so does the plot. Kamichama Karin is addictive and very enjoyable. 10/10.

14,2557,110,7.072002111,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Trapp Ikka Monogatari,"Based on the same story that produced the classic musical 'The Sound of Music', this is the story of Maria, who leaves her life in a convent to take up the responsibility of taking care of Captain Trapp's children. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Music', 'Romance']",none,"Part of the World Masterpiece Theater, Trapp Ikka Monogatari is a classical story that is not based on any person’s misfortune or fighting fates for a better tomorrow. There are no evildoers; it is just a mellow and sweet series with day-to-day events of the Von Trapp family with Maria holding the most important role. 
 
The story itself is really simple and holds no real twists for the most part; Maria Kutschera, a nun in training, is sent to be the teacher of one of the girls who is too weakened to attend school. One thing leads to another and slowly, but unofficially, she takes care of everyone and helps them grow as a person. That is the main gist of it and while there is progress, the series stays the same pattern-wise and although that would normally mean it would get repetitive and possibly boring, it manages to keep a warm feeling throughout with almost every “adventure” of theirs, such as preparing a gift for the housekeeper or fight against a possible new stepmother. The pacing is quite good for a show like this and thankfully, the series does not spend too much time on one thing and thus, keeps the interest high enough and only towards the end it seemed to be a bit more abrupt. 
 
The characters have variety as there are 7 children and the story gives enough time for any of them to show their personality and gain some development (some more than others, since a couple of them are really too young to be able to portray complicated thoughts), through their own personal problems. The father is not as strict as he is awkward; an awkward father who has to work a lot out of his house, but the family values he has shine through. Each family member complements each other and one can really see how much they mean to each other and this makes the series a great family story. Maria is the one true change they all needed to move on and is probably the only person with the least development. She stays true to the main girl cliché that wants her positive and bright and helping anyone, but there is no change in herself. We do get to know more about her past and her personality is very likable, either way, but all in all, she will always be that happy girl only. 
 
Art/Music-wise, the show offers nothing much, especially since it is an older show. For anyone familiar with the movie “The Sound of Music”, this series is not a musical. There are songs throughout, though mostly they are only a couple of songs put on repeat, however the characters do not break in song at random times. The songs seem to be children’s songs, but they are nice and some are very easy to sing along too. The art is simple, not detailed and the animation is saving frames whenever possible, but it has bright colors and it is very easy on the eye. The characters are distinct and despite the fact that the characters wear the same outfits almost in every episode, they are easy on the eye too. 
 
As a family story, it did a good job generally. There were times it felt a bit more dragged on or not as interesting, but it is a very easy watch when in mood for some slice of life with no deep drama in every other episode, but enough to spice things up.

It's mostly a rather dry recap of the first eight (iirc) episodes hosted by New Generations' seiyuu, who also present their favorite scene (the concert with Mika). They don't talk much about making the show or anything. The one bright spot is when Producer's seiyuu joins them, and they do talk a bit with him about making the show. (His favorite scene, incidentally, is Uzuki's first meeting with Producer.) Moreover, he was a high schooler at the time and is pretty adorable actually. So, if you feel a desire to have a little behind-the-scenes knowledge of IMCG (and I do mean a little), go ahead and watch, just skip ahead to when Producer's seiyuu appears. Otherwise, you can safely skip it.

Kōji Nanjō is one of the most successful rock stars in Japan, with his hauntingly beautiful voice and very attractive features. But beneath all the fame and glamour, he is a damaged and hurt young man who has absolutely no happiness or interest in life.
One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.

","Each music video has a simple short story involving the two main characters. The stories are basic and short enough to be explored within the length of a 3-5 minute song.  
The music videos themselves are quite dark, surreal, and artsy looking, with good enough animation, nothing too special.  
The majority of my enjoyment came from the songs themselves, which I actually thought were pretty (and surprisingly) good. This is what made my rating higher. I've only *watched* this anime about once, but I've listened to it about 3 times. The songs can best be described as interesting, weird, and catchy. They won't be everyone's style, but I enjoy them and see myself going back to them every so often.

          
 
       Helpful Is very strange talking about Cathexis, is not my type of serie but surprisingly I could find on this many interesting things. 
 
Being just five (5) music videos, each one of them tell us a different tale based on koji and takuto. If we know just a bit about what is zetsuai or the characters itself are, we can see a passionate way of each one of them, mostly over koji nanjo. 
 
The video clips are totally Surrealist, harsh, a very personal way of presenting the persecution of koji over takuto, we can see  strong selfish feelings of love.  
 
I guess the most particular of this is how we can differenciate both character as an entity, they are so unique with that powerful personality, is sadist watch how they fight against each other, with a kind of invasive personality, they can wrap us with the most sad and painful expression as  anger and passion. 
 
The five music videos are represented by different phantasies; The Rock 
Idol star tale. The religious-angel tale. The studio tale, centred on koji nanjo recording a theme and watching the artist life view. The vampire hunter tale. The last music video is i guess the most strange of them, the most personal and sad over the characters, as lovers, the crash point of view. 
 
This is very familiar to those 70's - 80's old music video clips, surrealism of lover and different meanings, abstracts stuffs. some scenes are a bit shocking and rude, contains romantics scenes as agressive scenes.

Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.
The volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the Avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.
The Legend of Crystania setting places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by an ""animal god"" of Crystania. One of the prominent characters is Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.
","Totally cute! Always looked forward to these segments at the end of each episode of the anime Record of Lodoss War. 
 
These short parodies have chibi forms of various different characters from the main anime either doing one time skits or going on a non-serious adventure that runs through some episodes. It's all comedy and pokes fun at the main story and its cast. It would be enjoyable for anybody who would like to see the silly, childlike version of Lodoss War!

If you liked Digimon Frontier, or one of the early seasons (1 or 2) this movie is recommended, it gives a vibe which is used on the first two and the fourth season, and the movies that belong to those season.

These fairies are the extremely peppy Kururu, the reserved and feminine Chiriri, the samurai-loving tomboy Sarara, and the quiet yet quirky Hororo. 
 
Fascinated by the human world, these fairies arrived from the fairy world in hopes of participating in the annual traditions and overall way of human life. However, they have a very limited understanding of the human world. Luckily, they are befriended and guided by two humans—""Sensei-san,"" a university student who they live with, and a first-grade girl they call ""Tama-chan,"" who is sometimes as naive as the fairies themselves. 
 
Though these bottle fairies have strange ideas and sometimes have difficulty understanding this new world, they try to make the most of the human experience in their own cute little ways. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Slice of Life']","Bottle Fairy is a comedy series. The show follows a simple pattern, consisting of the Bottle Fairies misinterpreting the world around them. The fairies learn about Japanese culture and traditions with each episode taking place in a different month.
The Bottle Fairies, who have come from another world, are attempting to learn many things about the world so they can gain knowledge and turn into humans - a feat they finally achieve in episode 12, set in the twelfth month, thus making the series span a whole year. However, as their wish to stay together is stronger than their wish to become human, they merge into one human, while retaining their several personalities. The thirteenth episode shows the fairies attempting to function as a single human girl, before eventually splitting into four fairies again. This extra episode makes Bottle Fairy the typical length of a small anime series.
","Overall, this anime was pretty enjoyable to watch because of its mild humor and tendency to overflow with cutesy themes. 
 
The plot of Binzume Yousei, or in English, Bottle Fairy, revolves around 4 fairy girls named Sarara, Chiriri, Kururu, and Hororo, who are trying to become human by learning about the outside world and how humans live. With help from the one who looks after them, called ""Sensei-san,"" they do just that. But, in the process, their neighbor, a 7-8 year old girl named Tama-chan, misinterprets some of the things humans do, and passes it off as advice to the fairies. 
 
This gets repeated in each episode, as the fairies learn valuable information that could lead them to become humans.  
 
I think this series could be completely enjoyable to someone who loves anime that can make them laugh, as there is mild humor in it. But if you like more serious anime that actually follows the story well, then I wouldn't go for this anime at all. 
 
I liked this anime because of the abundance of adorability and the music. The opening theme is completely amazing, and I enjoyed the art that the creators put forth into doing.  
 
Overall, I'd give this anime about a 8 out of 10. Very enjoyable for me, and I recommend it to people who like comedy anime.

          
 
       Helpful Bottle Fairy is a cute show to fill time and make you feel better. 
 
Recommended if you like: K-On!, Lucky Star, anything with cute Moeblobs 
 
Bottle Fairy is low on plot and lower on sense, but that’s fine because it’s sweet enough to give you diabetes. Over the course of a year, four fairies learn about Human culture and life through guidance from a little girl and re-enacting things themselves using their fairy magic.  
 
The shows main appeal is the cuteness of its four characters, and they certainly deliver on that. Each of them has simple but memorable more designs and are voiced well too. They each fall into the same cliche character types (ie tomboy, Genki, ojou-san, airhead) but they’re done well here aren't annoying. Still, to be clear, it’s all very superficial. While the show is funny at times it’s not a comedy or a drama for that matter. The intended take away from this show is a feeling of peace and cuddliness. 
 
Which is why the ending is so bizarre. Without spoiling things, the last two episodes try to go for a sort of dramatic conclusion that falls flat on its face, and even worse, the girls don’t get a chance to showcase any of their cute personalities. 
 
Also, the show doesn’t do anything else of note either, but that’s fine, that’s not it’s the intention, and the episodes are only about eight minutes, not including the op and ed, so it doesn’t feel as if it wasted your time. 
 
Still, slice of life/cute girl fans only. 


          
 
       Helpful Bottle Fairy is all about going through each day and experiencing things. Four faeries want to become human but in order to do so they first need to understand what it means to be human. And so they take help from their human friend and Sensei to start their training. 
This series goes through the Japanese calender and bring up traditions and folklore. It is very funny most of the time as the different personalities of the faeries and the way they interpret situations vary a great deal. This, combined with the fact that the episodes are in a short format, about 11 minutes when neglecting opening and ending animation, make this series really worthwhile when you have a short opening in the schedule and want to have a good laugh at the same time. And ofcourse the faeries are so cute that you wish them luck all the way to &quot;adulthood&quot;.

","['Comedy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural']","
Keiichi Morisato is a college sophomore who accidentally calls the Goddess Help Line. The goddess Belldandy materializes and tells him that her agency has received a system request from him and has been sent to grant him a single wish. Believing that a practical joke is being played on him, he wishes that she will stay with him forever, and his wish is granted.
Since he is unable to live with Belldandy in his male-only dorms, they are forced to look for alternative housing, eventually seeking shelter in an old Buddhist temple. They are allowed to stay there indefinitely after the young monk living there leaves on a pilgrimage to India upon being impressed by Belldandy's intrinsic goodness. Keiichi's life with Belldandy becomes even more hectic when her elder sister Urd and her younger sister Skuld move in as well. A series of adventures ensue as his relationship with Belldandy develops.
The Oh My Goddess! universe is fashioned loosely around Celtic/Norse Mythology; various names and concepts are recycled for humor. Three worlds exist in the Universe of Oh My Goddess: Heaven (Valhalla), Hell (Niflheim), and Earth. Heaven is the realm of the All Mighty and goddesses, Hell is the realm of Hild and demons, and Earth is the realm of humans. Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system, named Yggdrasil.
Each goddess is assigned Class, Category, and Restrictions. Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic. First Class goddesses are held to a stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie. There are also three categories: Administration, Commercial (Field), and Special Duty. Limited and Unlimited restrictions indicates boundaries on permitted actions. Goddesses may be penalized for dereliction of duty and may have their license suspended for a time. A goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked. Belldandy is a Goddess First Class, Second Category, Unlimited License. Urd and Skuld are Goddesses Second Class, First Category, Limited License. Goddesses also wear power limiters, usually in the form of jewelry.
The goddesses' purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them. Toward that end, Heaven has created the Goddess Technical Helpline (also called Goddess Relief Agency), designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth, especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune. A competing institution named the Earth Assistance Center, also is staffed by goddesses. In most scenarios, a goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish. The wish must be approved by the system, after which a contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the Yggdrasil system as a file. The wish contract file is protected by a passcode known to the Goddess. As demons work toward the opposite end, the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance. Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and to prevent bloodshed between them, each god is linked to a demon by a life contract, thus if one of them is killed, the other perishes as well, with their memories of the contract erased to ensure no one knows who is paired with whom.
Demons have similar class and license restrictions, and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels. A seal exists between the demon world and Earth, named the Gate to the Netherworld. It was ""created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods."" As such, demons require a catalyst to manifest on Earth. The demons possess a system similar to Yggdrasil, named Nidhogg. Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away. The demons also operate in a fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes, but often at a price.A goddess does not have an angel automatically, but receives one in egg form. When her power matures, the egg hatches into an angel, becoming a lifetime companion. The angel always obeys the goddess, being a reflection of the goddess' inner self.Other creatures that exist in the Earth plane are a multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life. These include the spirits of Money, Wind, Engine and such. More specific entities include Earth spirits, which are guardians over a specific area of land. Morgan le Fay, a villain from the movie, is probably a high ranking Earth spirit (or a being from another dimension, but that is less likely because her tragic love story with a human must have happened on Earth) who demonstrates great strength fighting Belldandy and Urd, even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level.
","For my final review of 2017, I shall review Oh My Goddess!, the OVA anime. This anime version is a 5 episode OVA from 1993 that is loosely based on the long running successful manga by Kosuke Fujishima. Usually short OVAs are not much and don't contain much for character development, but this is a rare exception? Why? Well, let's delve deep into here and see why this anime OVA is a classic and favorite among many: 
 
Story (9/10): One day in a college dorm, a student named Keiichi Morisato calls on the phone to get some takeout for lunch, but accidentally dials the Goddess Technical Help Line and is visited by a goddess from heaven herself called Belldandy, who is there to grant him a single wish. Keiichi, who's never been successful at getting a girlfriend, wishes that Belldandy could stay with him forever and it is granted. After being kicked out of the male only dorm, Keiichi and Belldandy begin a series of events where they find a place to live, try to help each other out, meet Urd and Skuld, two other goddesses who are sisters to Belldandy, and when Belldandy receives a call from the Almighty himself, the two discover that their relationship may be more than they thought it would be... 
 
While I am currently reading the manga and am not finished with it yet (I may update when I finish it), I will say this: this version is not accurate to the manga at all when comparing it (certain characters don't appear in the second chapter and events in the last two episodes are original to this OVA), but that doesn't mean that it's bad at all. The writers were able to do their own interpretation of the love story of Keiichi and Belldandy  actually make it work in two hours time, and have a satisfying conclusion, something that some other OVAs I've seen have failed to do. 
 
What also makes this story work is the balance between the romantic, drama and comedy elements. Even though this is only two hours long, the romance felt between our two leads feels very genuine and realistic, their relationship grows easily over the course of the five episodes and in the end you can truly feel that it was earned. The comedy is also hilarious, relying on fanservice but also some slapstick here and there. The dramatic parts shine especially well in the last two episodes where the show successfully manages to shift from comedy to drama without effecting it in a bad way, unlike shows like Voogie's Angel, you might need the tissue box at the end. 
 
It does have flaws though. The aforementioned fanservice part of the comedy may turn some viewers off, and some of the problems Belldandy and Keiichi deal with may only seem minor or stuff you may see in other romantic stories, and some people familiar with the manga may complain about it not being too faithful but whatever good this series has, far, far, far outweighs the flaw. 
 
Art/Animation (9/10): AIC, or Anime International Corporation, mostly has great, if not good looking anime in their library, and this is one of their best looking ones yet. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful for a 1993 anime and OVA; all of the characters are very well drawn, the clothes the goddesses wear are imaginatively lovely, there's lots of bright colors in the background and characters, the backgrounds look full of life and easy on the eyes, and the animation for the majority of the time is fluid and smooth. The comedic expressions aren't as hilarious as Fujishima's art, but they still do their job very well. Belldandy and Urd look attractive and ravishing (Urd especially looks sexy), Skuld looks adorkable and cute, and a lot of the minor characters like Keiichi's dorm-mates all look unique and you can tell every character in here has their own personality to them based on their looks, no two characters here look the same. I will admit though, I did funnily think that Aoshima looked like Harry Potter (sans the scar) if he were an anime character. The only minor nitpick I have with the art is that some of the sunny backgrounds have a lot of white in them to the point where they look unfinished or not colored in completely, but other than that this anime is one of the best to look at, I'd even hang a still frame of some of them on my wall. The endings are also all unique as they all have their own animations to them, I liked the ending animation with the super deformed/chibi versions of them best. 
 
In terms of fan service and such, there is a good amount, mostly in the second episode; Urd is seen posing in a sensual way when she first appears and has a skimpy swimsuit and cheerleader outfit in the third episode, and Belldandy is shown nude briefly when transforming into her goddess form in the final episode, but it's no worse than a naked Barbie. 
 
Sound (8/10): The voice acting is spectacular in this anime. Kikuko Inoue (Reika from Battle Skipper, Shiori from Voogie's Angel, Sailor Aluminum Siren from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars) practically IS Belldandy, she gives the goddess a lovely, sweet, angelic, maternal, practically perfect voice that is so beautiful and makes one charmed by her. I don't understand why some people think it isn't that great, this really is one of her best roles. Masami Kikuchi captures Keiichi's silly, but kind, friendly nature very well. Yumi Touma (Kisenian Flower from Sailor Moon R movie, Reiko Takagi from Graduation, Marriage and Sailor Victory) is perfectly cast as Urd, giving the second-class goddess a sultry, passionate voice that fits her character. Aya Hisakawa (Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury from the Sailor Moon franchise, Voogie from Voogie's Angel, Lisa from Bubblegum Crisis) captures Skuld's childish, bratty, yet likable characteristic. Other highlights of the cast are Junko Asami as Sayako, and Nobou Tobia (Kamille from Zeta Gundam) as Aoshima. All of the VAs in the Japanese versions are excellent, well cast and do a great job delivering their lines and becoming the characters they play as. 
 
I have not seen the English dub, but will update when I do. I've heard it's actually good. 
 
The opening and ending themes are excellent, being performed by the VAs of the three goddesses, but unfortunately the rest of the music is sadly forgettable. It isn't bad, but not particularly memorable. 
 
Character (8/10): The characters are where this anime also shines through, a lot of the characters, while they may seem stereotypical or just tropes, are more than just that, they all have their own unique personalities, grow over the course of this OVA and are mostly likable. Belldandy lives up to being a kind goddess, she is very kind, sweet, and caring for Keiichi, doing her best to help him out and be happy no matter what happens. She could be seen as too perfect by some people, but it's not in a horrible, bad way; she proves why she is such a lovable character and displays so much positive qualities and energy she's earned it. Keiichi may be clumsy and isn't always perfect, but he too tries to make sure Belldandy is always happy and shows that he loves her too. Urd (who in the manga tried to seduce Keiichi when she first met him) is impulsive and tries to come up with plans that don't usually succeed and meddles with things, but it's usually with good intentions and though she does anger easily she does soften up near the end. Skuld's dislike of Keiichi, childishness and clingy nature may annoy some people but I still found her funny and to be fair, she is a child and children tend to act out if they're feeling alone and she acts more caring towards Keiichi . She is basically the tech member of the goddesses, building inventions and using technology (kinda like Mercury). For some of the minor characters, Megumi, Keiichi's little sister, does act like a typical little sister but isn't as childish as Skuld is. Sayako is jealous of Belldandy, loving Keiichi himself but does change a bit towards the end, Aoshima is the typical cocky rival, and even Keiichi's dormmates are goofy, not the brightest bulbs but still likable, even after they kick him out of the dorm. 
 
Unfortunately some characters you see in the opening (the girl with the blond hair and Sora, the girl with the short brown hair and glasses) either don't appear in the OVA or have more minor roles 
 
Overall (9/10): This has become one of my favorite anime series and makes me glad I discovered this amazing romantic slice-of-life comedy. The story is romantic and charming, the art/animation are wonderful, the characters are charming, funny, and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome and you don't even have to read the manga in order to watch this great anime, it is another perfect way to introduce you to this story. If you want a great classic anime series, like anime with magical goddesses, romance, slice of life, comedy, or any of those, check this one out, you don't wanna miss out. If that's not the case, then stay away. 
 
Now to check out the movie and hope, or in this case, pray, that it will be great...

          
 
       Helpful Ah! My Goddess OVA is the first screen adaptation of the long running manga of the same name.  Considering its over 15 years old it actually holds its age pretty well.  It manages to be a sweet and charming romance and is probably a fairly influential title in regards to the whole ""Sudden Girlfriend Appearance"" genre of storylines. 
 
If you’ve seen even a few romance titles you have most likely already seen a similar plot before.  Though in its time this may have been pretty original.  A college student Keiichi dials a wrong number trying to order food from his dorm and is accidently connected to a Goddess helpline in which a mysterious girl Belldandy appears in his room promising to grant him any wish he wants.  The girlfriendless guy asks for someone like her to be by his side forever and thus the story begins. 
 
Usually in these kinds of stories there is a lot of echiiness but there is none of that here.  So if that sort of thing bothers you and just want to see a haremesque romance without the boobs and panty face plants then you will likely find this series appealing.  The relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi is the focal point of the series.  It’s for the most part sweet and satisfying despite the lack of any real intimacy.  This is always a peeve of mine in anime and I think it has something to do with the Japanese mindset.  The story does a great job of building chemistry and romance between the pair but they don’t act like a couple that is in love as much as we are lead to believe.  Not that I ever seem to expect it anymore but how can you be in love this much and get embarrassed still about holding hands and cuddling together, let alone kissing, after living in the same house for nine months?  It detracts overall from my score despite me liking this series a lot more than my score may reflect. 
 
The story's pacing also fluctuates and skips around quite a bit.  Many months will pass with really no way of even knowing this is happening without the dialogue telling us or from just visually seeing the seasons pass by.  But you would never know it from how little progress the leads make in terms of their romance.  The shortness of the series doesn't make having a really intricate plot feasible but it doesn’t really feel like its going anywhere until the last episode.  I don’t know how closely it follows the manga since I haven’t read it but overall the story and the ending are satisfyingly concluded. 
 
Keiichi is your standard male anime lead.  By standard I mean he’s not all that special.  Like almost all romance series the male love interest is usually uninteresting, weak, and not very manly.  Despite Keiichi being in college he looks like he should be starting the 8th grade.  Now this is played up in the story as to why he doesn’t have a girlfriend but still if you’re going to make a show around college aged people then make them look that age at least.  However despite not finding him very satisfactory as a leading man he does tend to man up at the key times and grow during the course of the story. 
 
Belldandy is basically your perfect Japanese girlfriend/wife.  She’s moe for starters though not to the degree that we see in today’s anime.  She’s beautiful, a perfect cook and homemaker, and great at school.  Though the revelation of her attending school with Keiichi was a bit confusing since they just suddenly dropped that on the audience without any real explanation.  That’s another issue I have with Belldandy.  Of course I loved her, who wouldn’t?  But she lives for Keiichi and everything she thinks of and does is only for him.  There seems to be no will or drive of her own.  I know this anime is intended for guys, but well I think guys need to see things that are more realistic as well.  We don’t live to serve you; a relationship should be a partnership. 
 
The rest of the cast is pretty small and of the supporting cast there are some memorable characters.  Frankly Urd and Skuld steal the show and are much more interesting characters than either of the leads.  I thought they complimented each other nicely, with each being very different personalities.  Additionally I was pleasantly surprised that as they grew into the harem of pretty girls surrounding Keiichi they didn’t try to become love interests.  Keiichi's sister Megumi had some early promise but she faded from the story pretty quickly.  Most of the rest of the characters are forgettable and don’t get much screen time. 
 
The artwork and animation quality is very good.  You would honestly never know that it was made in the early 90s without being told so.  The characters are very detailed and realistic looking.  My only issue with the characters would be the much to youthful look for Keiichi.  This is a minor annoyance though.  The magic and special effects are well done as well whenever one of the Goddesses uses her powers. 
 
The voice performances are the weakest link of the OVA.  Keiichi's weakness is brought home by his un-masculine voice.  Also Belldandy's voice is a bit irritating on the nerves too.  While I have enjoyed Kikuko Inoue's roles before there is just something I don’t like about the way she voiced this character.  Again Urd and Skuld steal the spotlight in the category as well.  The OP/EN music were good however and fitting. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of Ah! My Goddess.  If you’re looking for a little light romance that is high on sweetness with a dash of comedy and very little perversion then I would recommend this series to you. 


          
 
       Helpful Aa! Megami-sama! or Oh! My Goddess is a 5 episode OVA series that released from Feb 21 1993 to May 17 1994. It's an adaptation of Kousuke Fujishima's manga of the same name. It was produced by studio AIC and directed by Hiroaki Gohda. 
 
The story follows Keiichi Morisato. He's a college student who's been left alone in the dorms as his friends have gone out. He ends up dialing the wrong number as he's trying to order some takeout and ends up summoning a beautiful goddess named Belldandy. She promises to grant Keiichi any wish he has, and he wishes for her to stay by his side forever. Because of this, Keiichi gets kicked out of the mens only dormitory and ends up moving out to an old shrine, where more goddesses and other people show up to get involved in his love life. 
 
Keiichi Morisato is a normal college student and our main character. He has no luck with women because he is short, but somehow ends up getting a beautiful goddess as a girlfriend. He's also a part of his college's racing club. 
 
Belldandy is the goddess who first visits Keiichi and makes the contract with him to stay with him forever. She is kind, warm, beautiful and makes a lot of heads turn. She's also really good at cooking. 
 
Urd is the second goddess that shows up. She's the cupid of love and she is also Belldandy's older sister. She comes down to earth in order to help close the distance betwee Keiichi and Belldandy and get them further in their relationship, although it mostly ends in failure. 
 
Skuld is the third goddess to appears in this OVA. She is Belldandy's younger sister and has come to bring her back to heaven. She does not like Keiichi and wants to try to seperate him and Belldandy. 
 
The animation and visuals in this OVA is nothing to write home about. For the most part I would even say that it's kinda poor. There is a lack of concistency in the designs and characters proportions, even when it's not moving, and the animation itself is very basic. Not that there is anything wrong with basic animation, but it is also not impressing anyone. 
 
The music in this OVA is also not that great. It feels like it always overpowers whatever is going on. Like in a lot of the dramatic scenes. It's usually very light drama, but the music seems to want you to think that the world is ending tomorrow. It's very off-putting to say the least. 
 
Despite these flaws, I have to say that I enjoyed this OVA. It was very short and sweet, but it didn't stick around on pointless moments, and got on with it and let you experience a lot of what happened between the characters, making the bonds between them feel more real. Sure, it could have been a few episodes longer so as to avoid some of those pretty huge timeskips, but it didn't really bother me that much. I really enjoyed the characters, and none of them got on my nerves. That in itself is a pretty good feat, cause I always tend to find at least one character that annoys me. Overall it was a short and sweet OVA that I enjoyed watching. I would recommend people check this out. It's only 5 episodes at 35 - 30 mins each, so it's not a huge investment either.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Supernatural']","The story revolves around Shirou Emiya, a hardworking and honest teenager who unwillingly enters a to-the-death tournament called the Fifth Holy Grail War, where combatants fight with magic and Heroes from throughout history for a chance to have their wishes granted by the eponymous Holy Grail. Orphaned and the sole survivor of a massive fire in Fuyuki City as a child, Shirou was taken in by a retired mage named Kiritsugu Emiya, who would die years later. His perceived responsibility to those who died and his salvation through his father formed a strong desire for justice and peace in him. Thus, he earnestly trains his body and minuscule ability with magic to someday greatly help others, even if people often abuse his generosity at his stage.
One evening, after seeing two devastatingly powerful beings trading blows at his school with swords and spears, he is attacked, as witnesses to the Holy Grail War are generally supposed to be eliminated. Chased to his home by the spear-wielding warrior Lancer and barely able to avoid his attacks, Shirou is about to be killed when he is saved by Saber. Saber, the personification of a renowned figure in history (Arturia Pendragon in her case), was created to aid participants in the War. In her supposedly accidental summoning and the appearance of the marks on Shirou's hand, his entry as a Master into the Holy Grail War is formalized.
","I watched this entire series over the weekend.  ""Why wasn't I watching this earlier?""  is my only question.  
Story(8/10)  
UBW has a few key differences to FSN in terms of who the story focuses on. It had an episode zero which focused entirely on Rin Tohsaka  the female main character of this series. The story tends to give more focus on Rin and Archer than its predecessor FSN did.  Since this is based on the visual novel UBW follows the true ending to the Unlimited Blade Works arc. I feel Unlimited Blade works universe set one of the darker precedents in the Fate Stay universe and the plot often reflects this tone.  
Art (9/10)  
This is partially what made me quit Fate Stay Night and kept me watching UBW. The art is gorgeous in this series. When it isn't a thrilling  action scene, it's a stunning background showing a colorful landscape. I really love the landscape shots in this series and how they bring life to the characters in this show.  
Sound(9/10)  
Most of the OST is great. I did watch the OP and ED the first time but skipped it subsequent times. The VAs on this show are also very good.  I can't think of a Japanese VA that wasn't originally from Fate Stay Night.  Due to there being more Archer in this series, you can tell the work Junichi Suwabe put into his lines and delivery. He plays the perfect manipulative jerk.  
Character (8/10)  
I only give this an eight out of 10 because I hate Shinji and they focused less on Sakura. Although it detracted from the focus on Saber, I felt that the focus on Tohsaka, and Archer and their relationship to Shirou was a very good thing in terms of character development. I didn't like Shirou at first as the main protagonist. Good selfless characters feel dull to me. This show did a good job of averting this and even addressing the problems with such a character. Shirou's flaws felt well portrayed. As for the 8/10, this might be a minor gripe, but out of two siblings Sakura and Shinji, they decided to focus more on the one I can't stand.  There are characters who are jerks in this show(i.e Archer, Gilgamesh) , but I felt like Shinji had no fleshing out character wise. He was just a borderline-rapist coward slime and every scene he lived was an irritating one.   
Enjoyment(10/10)  
Just the general environment of this show appeals to me. The action was amazing and I loved the OST . The characters were interesting and enjoyable(exception Shinji). I was hooked by the plot. In conclusion, I would recommend giving this show a watch.

The Fate/Stay Night series split into three routes.  
 
Each route features a different heroine/main female character and with Fate/Stay Night previously being an eroge visual novel game, Shirou the male lead ends up with the female lead at the end. Obviously, they can't add in the famous sex scenes in the Visual Novel into the anime as that would make it a hentai but fret not, Unlimited Blade Works features the best female lead and my number 1 waifu, Rin Tohsaka. 
 
Unlimited Blade Works contains alot of fan service for us viewers and even if it didn't, Rin's thighs would surely suffice. 
 
Anyways, this particular route focuses mainly on Shirou and the Archer servant whom coincidentally is Rin's servant. 
 
Rin was just there for fan service is what many may think but she plays a big part in Shirou's development. 
 
Unlimited Blade Works actually in its essence is actually just the main character following his self-proclaimed ideals 
 
- 
 
It's what I'd call the generic anime relationship with a very miniscule twist.  
 
 
The relationship between the aforementioned smoking hot mage Rin Tohsaka and the half-baked mage Emiya Shirou. 
 
Shirou is your typical dense anime main while Rin is the hot female senpai that everyone wants.  
 
Because of that, it's pretty safe to assume Unlimited Blade Works is the more casual side of Fate/Stay Night with Unlimited Blade Works leaning towards character introduction more. 
 
Unlimited Blade Works includes a perfect blend of action, slice of life, comedy, relationship struggles, tsundere (yea i love Rin) and introduction. 
 
It is the more casual route that more or less just introduces the personality of all the other characters in the series to prepare viewers to the real deal which is Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel. 
 
Since this was the TV remake of the UBW movie in 2006 it is better in almost every aspect. Don't get me wrong, the DEEN studios adaptation made in 2006 was great but during its time. 
 
You can't expect the 2006 movie to beat a 2014 remake right? 
 
So ufotable, the studio that made this remake and will be making subsequent Fate/Stay Night adaptations did a fantastic job. 
 
ufotable is becoming known for its beautiful artwork and overwhelmingly well animated fight scenes with great creativity and craft. The fight scenes are set in really fast paced situations but displayed in a manner easy to follow with timely after effects of attacks that lead to a mass explosion of colours bursting with vivid expression. 
 
Character designs are very well drawn with a huge improvement compared to the DEEN adaptation and with the same design as the prequel, Fate/Zero. 
 
ufotable actually beat many 2018 anime after rewatching Unlimted Blade Works in 2018, I still cannot believe Fate/Stay Night UBW is a 2014 anime to be honest, ufotable sugei na

Every character, servant and master have their own backstory and ideals and are all fighting for the Holy Grail. 
 
Like I said, this is just the 'introduction'. Neither Saber nor Rin actually make the real shit happen in Fate/Stay Night.  
 
The third route is where everything fucked up happens, where the most subtle female lead comes. 
 
Watching this is important as you are expected to know deeply what the Holy Grail War is about before watching Heaven's Feel 
 
but I'm also pretty sure most will get hooked by this nonetheless be it by the captivating characters, the many ploys and strategies, the animation or Rin's smoking hot body 
 
so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it, otherwise don't bother watching Heaven's Feel. 
 
Every route is set in a different genre and I love Unlimited Blade Work's slice of life action filled genre

The usual comedy is there, and the usual fun and interesting characters are there too. So you'll love it too! It's short and sweet, but still provides good laughs. 
 
You can watch all four mini episodes within one entire episode. It's a great watch if you want something short and sweet to watch for a bit. Really gets you hyped up for the upcoming Yuru Yuri ten in general. 


          
 
       Helpful Mini Yuri is a mini-OVA series hyping the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. The OVA series is 4 episodes with a runtime of 3 minutes each and for the most part having the cast in some chibi hijinks. 
 
Mini Yuri essentially gives us four scenarios within the four episodes, be it a Yuriympics, a ""murder mystery"", the core cast going big on YuruTube and a tongue in cheek ""Opposite Day"" with the core cast. The comedy is pretty much as to be expected with these 3 minute skits with again tongue in cheek flanderization of the cast to the core cast going in same ""crazy scenarios"" but mostly enacted by Kyouko for heck all the episodes just for the lulz (seriously) 
 
The animation done by W-Toon Studio and DMM.futureworks is ehhh ok even for an all out chibi OVA comedy skit. Like the animation is mostly chibi's but they do like to shake it up a little bit for the meta-sense or just again for the lulz. The voice cast is back so there isn't much to say on this front. 
 
Really like every intro for Mini Yuri, these mini OVA's are a vehicle to hype things up for the 10th Anniversary for the Yuru Yuri and the Yuru Yuri Ten anime and really it did it's job, comedy was to expected from Yuru Yuri and brought Yuru Yuri into focus again for the next full anime soon to be released.

In the time it takes you to read this, you could have watched Trigger-chan and experienced euphoria beyond comprehension, achieved nirvana, and transcended this pathetically limited mortal form and ascended to an infinitely more powerful, unlimited potential in two dimensions. 
 
There's not much more to be said about the perfection that is Trigger-chan. The culmination of many lives' work, saving anime, and a universal appeal make this mere 30 second advertisement for Trigger among the best that the entertainment medium has to offer. The delightfully rough-around-the edges animations sets it apart from anything not made by trigger, and with the bombastic, dynamic displays of vivacity and fortitude through intense characterization, not to mention a mind bending, once in a lifetime thrill of a plot, Trigger once again shows why they're the best in the business.  
 
It's plain and simple. In no way at all. 
Thank you Based Trigger.

       Helpful Never before have I seen an anime that has packed so much energy, heart, and plot into a single movie.  Enter Trigger-chan.  From what I've seen, I've deduced this young woman has years of hardships to come out on top and sink the competition.  Above the ranks of MAL's greatest, Death Note and FMA:B, this show shows that you can overcome any obstacle, no matter how great- and have friends that will be there with you until the very end [of 30 seconds].  Trigger-chan is the anime that made me a man, and is essential viewing.

       Helpful I am surprised this thing is here, as standalone animation. It's a bonus to livestreamed Luluco. It's like adding anime openings as standalone animations. Reading this paragraph would probably take longer than watching the animation. 
But what do I know, eh? Let's give this girl a rating, for cheese sake. 
 
Story: 1 
There is none. What did you expect? 
 
Animation: 7 
Trigger delivers. I personally love their works for animations, its sketchiness, exaggerated expressions, crazy action shots etc. I only give 7, because other than characters themselves there is little to no design. That's understandible, given the animation's length, so I think 7 is a fair note, eh? 
 
Sound: 7 
It ain't bad. Fast-paced, fitting the action perfectly. I guess full version would be cool to hear out. Seriously though, 31sec. piece is enough for a demo sample, but way too short for soundtrack.  
 
Character: 6 
They ain't bad. Given the studio's gun-related logo and name, characters are named after lock parts. Seems to me they were drawn during animators' leisure time, or as practice for upcoming series. And it turned out well. Other than their looks and affinity with weapons, it's hard to tell anything else. They're not much more than cool-looking OCs drawn by pixiv artists. Let's be fair then, 6 is actually above the completely-average-5-rating, and so are Trigger, Muzzle and Spring. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
So my statements may sound overly serious, criticizing and biased, but hey, Trigger-chan was a nice candy. I liked it. The trio worked together to deliver a bullet from Trigger-gun. That was a metaphor. Not a spoiler. What they do is something completely different. 
 
Overall: 6 
As I mentioned before, 6 is still better than nothing-special-5. This animation definitely excels at not being boring. I think it's impossible to skip this one before finishing it. It's not another K-On season. 
 
So, now some of you may be wondering about the pros and cons of Trigger-chan. Let me tell you then, just watch it. Grab the first copy you can, there is no need for a translation, and just watch it. 
 
Why are you still here, you'd finish it 5 times by now!

14,37779,120,6.933190226,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Yakusoku no Neverland,"Surrounded by a forest and a gated entrance, the Grace Field House is inhabited by orphans happily living together as one big family, looked after by their ""Mama,"" Isabella. Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage—a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family... never to be heard from again. 
 
However, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Shounen']","
It is the year 2045, and over 1000 years after an agreement called ""The Promise"" was made to end a long war between humans and demons. ""The Promise"" was an agreement where each would live in their own separate ""worlds"": the human world, free from the threat of demons; and the demon world, where human breeding farms were set up to provide food for the demons. By eating humans, demons take on their attributes which prevent them from degenerating into mindless monsters. In the demon world, a special breeding program was set up under the guise of orphanages; there, a human ""Mother"" would oversee the children to make sure they grew up as intelligent as possible. These children had identifying numbers tattooed on them and had no knowledge of the outside world. They believed that they were orphans and once they reached a certain age or intelligence, they would be taken out for adoption, but were fed to high-ranking demons instead.
The bright and cheerful Emma is an 11-year-old orphan living in Grace Field House, a self-contained orphanage housing her and 37 other orphans. They lead an idyllic life, with plentiful food, plush beds, clean clothes, games and the love of their ""Mom"", Isabella. Their education is seen as an important part of their development, and Emma with her two best friends Norman and Ray, always excel in the regular exams. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture beyond the perimeter wall or gate which separate the house from the outside world.
One night, a girl named Conny is sent away to be ""adopted"", but Emma and Norman follow with her favorite stuffed animal toy. At the gate, they find Conny dead and discover the truth about their existence in this idyllic orphanage – to be raised as meat for demons. Emma and Norman plan with Ray to escape from Grace Field House with the children, but Norman is taken off to be ""adopted"". Emma and Ray then decide to escape with some of their older siblings, leaving half of the younger children behind. 
The escapees find life outside Grace Field House is filled with dangers, but under the leadership of Emma and Ray, they become determined to return to free their remaining siblings, along with children from the other Farms. They encounter demons of all descriptions, including Mujika and Sonju who aid them in their quest. Emma and Ray later meet up again with Norman and together with their allies, they fight a battle for freedom against the demon queen Legravalima and the human Peter Ratri who manages the Farms. Eventually, through her own determination, Emma secures the freedom of all the children and re-forges ""The Promise"", bringing all of them to the human world, but at the cost of her own memory.
","This is the only anime I see it is very close to anime attack on titan and greater than death note ! , A masterpiece of all the meaning of the word, the story is new and completely unexpected, the mystery and horror envelops this anime, which is the successor to anime death note, intelligence, plot, horror science fiction, this is the appropriate description of the events of this wonderful anime! . The characters are very beautiful and very wonderful and you will definitely like them. The music is also excellent, the animation is excellent, there are no anti-literary clips and the confrontations are also distinctive. They rely more on intelligence than fighting. In general it is a masterpiece.

          
 
       Helpful From what seemed like a regular orphanage turned into a mind fucking psychological thriller. 
 
This anime isn’t for the pusillanimous. The anime revolves around a bunch of orphans, the oldest of which found out about what was happening to those that were sent to their ‘foster’ family. 
Those that know the truth about the outside world and their upcoming fate decides to escape and take everyone with them. 
However, their lovable ‘Mama’ is a psychopathic all-rounder that is extremely intelligent and not to mention athletically capable. 
 
In a world of demons and human farms, the children in these so called ‘orphanages’ or plantations are sent out to be eaten by the demons.  
 
So how are the kids going to escape from this not-so-typical Mama? With a clear large gap in strength, knowledge of the surroundings and almost full-proof escape prevention measures, the children have to outwit their ‘Mama’ to escape. 
 
 
This anime is the literal extent of cliffhanger, heck even the anime itself included a cliff for a cliffhanger (you’ll understand when u watch) 
 
Cliffhangers make you crave for the next episode more and every episode leaves us with a more extensive cliffhanger! 
 
What I love in this anime though is the passive despair or mutual hopelessness in every episode. 
 
Each episode features the children planning their escape and getting foiled by their ‘Mama’ it is as if escape is impossible. 
 
Every episode leaves viewers in despair as the children’s plan gets shut down/intercepted/foiled. And the sequential episode, the children rethinking and replanning or discovering certain exploits that ‘hopefully’ leads to their final escape. 
 
Whether or not they escape, we just have to hope. 
 
 
 
The Promised Neverland has beautiful sceneries and lovely character designs. 
Characters were also given western looks, the story probably takes place in a western environment since the food the children eat are western-looking meals, the orphanage has a christian-looking, church-like design and the names of the characters are clearly western. 
 
With beautiful scenes we need to compliment it with beautiful music. The voice actors did a great job along with the sound effects and background music. 
It brings every scene to the fullest by playing the right music at the right time. 
 
 
The Promised Neverland has a large arsenal of viewer enticing that will definitely not let you down. 
 
 
 
 
 
SPOILER BELOW 
 
So after all the plot twists and cliffhangers, the anime finally ended with what seemed like the most perfect ending I’ve ever seen. It was splendid, it answered many many many questions that was built during the course of the anime and also posed new questions that answers await us in Season 2 
 
The ending was made to perfection, we finally know Mama’s reason for being ‘evil’ and ‘psychopathic’ she actually isn’t a psychopath, she had no choice since it was for her survival. She genuinely loved the children and had no choice but to ship them. 
 
She tried to stop them from escaping to the best of her abilities but when she knows she lost, she wishes them safety and freedom. 
 
She wishes that her children find light and salvation. 
 
No matter how evil she was, the motherly love of Isabella is real except that survival is more important to her than her motherly love. 
 
The ending provides Isabella’s backstory as well as every single planning for the perfect escape featuring characters that only had snippets of appearances but was never shown fully throughout. In the final episodes those side characters were finally revealed to actually play a big part of the escape 
 
And everybody’s importance and significance in the escape. 
 
Truly a masterpiece 

          
 
       Helpful The Promised Neverland might be one of the best shonen manga to have come out on this decade. An intriguing plot, well written characters, gorgeous aesthetic and a wide variety of themes that make this piece become whatever it needs to convey a scene’s meaning the best way it can.  
As much as I like The Promised Neverland anime, I would have liked it better if it had been more like its source material. 
 
Story and Execution: 7 
 
The premise shown on episode 1 is apparently very good, complex, and interesting and could lead to some amazing presentation on its universe if well executed. While the anime adaptation is not bad at all at portraying the intensity and feeling of an specific scene it certainly lacks the essence of the original manga. 
The source material is way better at doing so, being more dynamic and sudden when plot twists come to table, supported by inner thoughts from different characters and astounding imagery. Unfortunately, the anime, instead, ends up resembling more to a generic thriller anime than to its source material. 
 
Aesthetic and Animation: 6 
 
A weak part of the show, indeed. If you pay attention a little to the surroundings of the characters you’ll probably notice that this anime relies more in visual effects and modern anime lighting techniques than in traditional ways. Most of the background, if not everything in it, is computer generated and looks bland and uninteresting and cannot be, by any means, compared to Demizu Posuka’s art in the original manga, which is way creepier and sets the tone for the psychological horror nuances that characterise Kaiu Shirai’s work. 
It is also worth remarking that it is a bit hard to get used to the wacky artstyle regarding characters’ design as they all have different faces and the mouth is almost right in the middle of the face.  
In terms of animation this anime shows some inconsistency. There are times when I have no complaints but there are some shots that look lazy, them being static images maybe experiencing some bad-looking rotation in 2D. I would lastly also like to highlight the 3D first person movement through the house corridors which looks absolutely terrible and offputting. 
 
Sound: 7 
 
Sound design in this anime isn’t bad at all. Opening and ending are both cool and energetic. 
The soundtrack is probably my biggest concern. I have to concede it is good, but I personally don’t think it works as well as it should. Despite this series phenomenal main theme, which achieves an amazing atmosphere and tone, there is just some tracks that are so bizarre that they don’t fit at all in the scene in which they are played. 
 
Character: 6 
 
This section is probably terribly biased because of me being a manga reader and this is the part that differs the most from it. 
I still don’t get to understand why CloverWorks decided to completely remove inner thoughts from this show, as it is the main narrative resource in The Promised Neverland. Characterisation is accomplished through inner thoughts from characters that show many different and interesting perspectives on the same subject. The anime, instead, replace this inner soliloquies with damn silence which provides us with no context to their actions. They are, obviously the same characters I like from the manga, they have a lot of depth and they are perfectly handled despite the high density of the cast in this series, but this fact doesn’t justify for me the unnecessary personality alteration that some characters experience throughout this show if they are going to end up doing the same things that appear in its source material. 
 
Overall: 
 
To sum up briefly all of this I would say that this show was enjoyable and definitely has some really clever dialogue and scenarios, but I think that the directing has resulted in wasting some of the potential of this series. In the case you like this show a lot I would consider catching up with the manga. It won’t dissapoint you, as it is better.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Lucky Star's story mainly portrays the lives of four girls attending a Japanese high school. The setting is mainly based on the city of  Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main character is Konata Izumi, a lazy girl who constantly shirks her schoolwork and instead uses most of her time to watch anime, play video games, and read manga. Although she is lazy, she has also proven to be very intelligent and athletic.
The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move on to their second and third years. However, the anime starts the story with them beginning their second year, and the other high school girls that are seen in the opening are only introduced halfway through the series. The storyline usually includes numerous references to popular past and present manga, anime, and tokusatsu series.
The spin-off manga, Miyakawa-ke no Kūfuku, focuses on the daily lives of two sisters, Hinata and Hikage Miyakawa, who live an impoverished life due to Hinata's wasteful habits.
","Well the thing about this review is it's directly compared to the other series, favorably or unfavorably. And after just writing a Lucky Star review, I thought it was only right that I write a Lucky Star OVA review. In fact, I only got up the energy to write a Lucky Star review to the community. 
 
So, now that I've filled out the preface, it's time to get to the individual qualities of the short movie. Or actually, just medium as an OVA. 
 
1. Story 
Well how does one comment on one story, that's slice of life episodic comedy? 
Well, you rate it on being an episodic, slice of life comedy. 
This one doesn't quite pace as the other one did. And has quite a bit of cool down and then short spurts of comedy. It's not so chatty and eventful as the main series. 
 
In this way it does make it feel a bit more like a movie. But at the same time, it doesn't do what it does quite well as it did with the main series. You expect more out of it than you get. It moves slow and uneventful, and ends before you know it. 
Well at least in it's favor, it ends long before you want it to end. 
 
2. Art 
It's the same great artwork as before. And there's no change at all. 
So there's really nothing to say about this. It's the iconic moe art style we know and love Lucky Star for. 
 
Ten out of ten. 
 
3. Sound 
Well you know...I didn't even notice the sound too much this time around. It doesn't have that memorable opening song that I remember. And it all seemed sort of quiet. Too quiet at times. It didn't really have to have all the music though. 
 
And the character voices were as cute as ever. 
 
4. Character 
I think I have to commend them for spending the time they did on characters like Patricia Martin. But overall, it felt like when it was supposed to be a party, that it was an empty party. I think this part...this...OVA..was lacking in some of the character charm and development that Lucky Star often had. In the case with everything with this OVA, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good. 
 
5. Enjoyment 
Even if an OVA isn't as good, it's a Lucky Star OVA. Meaning we'll love it. 
Seriously, how long were we starved for this? Too long. I went through every second of this thinking how I couldn't believe I was getting to watch more Lucky Star and fearful of every minute I drew closer to the end. It might have not been jam packed with the same about of fun as the main series, but it was still a lot of fun and well worth the watch. 
 
6. Overall 
Overall, it was what the number 8 says. It was very good. And well worth the watch and very much needed, beyond needed. It was almost cruel how long we had to wait. But it wasn't every thing Lucky Star was. I think a person is better off watching Lucky Star the series first, and then watching this because they're still absolutely starved like I was for more. It may not be one hundred percent as good as the original, but it's still got the magic. I don't want anyone to think and to get the impression that because it doesn't shine just as hard as Lucky Star the TV series that it's not every bit a good and enjoyable anime. It's a quality watch and I recommend it to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful This will probably be the shortest review I will ever write. 
 
As I said in my review for the Lucky Star series, KyoAni constantly references and criticizes the anime genre as a whole. Significantly, it also references and criticizes consumers of anime, including those watching the series. This OVA goes exactly one step further, exploring what would happen if the viewers’ volition filters back into the anime. What would happen if the fandom – and its associated theories, frustrations, and obsessions – become part of the show itself? Well, you get this OVA, which in Lucky Star fashion follows the same plotless, trope-filled, single-sided characterization that the main series is known for. 
 
For better or worse, you absolutely do need to have seen the main series before seeing this, as this OVA interacts differently with those who are familiar with its characters and style. Watched the series? Yes, you need to watch this too. 


          
 
       Helpful Ahh the Lucky Star OVA. While it didn't fully capture the spirit of the anime series, it's still great that we are fortunate to even see the clan again after the anime was finish, so I can't really complain too much. The only saving grace *for me at lease*  was that Konata was funnier and otaku as ever and I liked Tsukasa more in the movie then in the anime series because she was ""cuter"" I didn't like that the Lucky Channal was live action it was not funny almost unwatchable and it was much shorter then I expected to be only around 43 minutes long

While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

Moomin, along with Little My, Moominpappa and Moominmamma wake up in Moominhouse, while Snufkin also comes back from his south travel on the first day of spring.

The series concludes when the winter arrives, the Moomins fall into hibernation and Snufkin travels to the south once again.
","The producer of the Moomin series has stated that this second season should have never been made. And he is probably right. Across all fields, the second season pales in comparison to the first one. Still, it is hard to be mad about it, since we have already got an amazing sprawling first season that covers the original stories in almost entirety.  
 
This is a set of independent stories that, without a few excpetions, have nothing to do with the original stories. Writing original continuation to the stories is fine and all but from watching a few episodes you'll start to notice that the series does not feel like Moomins anymore. This review is based on the Finnish dub. 
 
Story 4/10 
 
The story is not bad, but it feels very unnatural when the main cast from the first season is put through them. In essence, the aspects that made the Moomins so enchanting in the first place, particularly the slice-of-life absent are  non-existent. 
 
Art 5/10 
 
In the art department, quality suffers tremendously when compared to the first season. Characters stand out in terms of lackluster animation and looks. Still, the characters are recognizable at a glance, but if you have seen the first season and the OVA it leaves something to be desired in terms of quality. 
 
Sound 7/10 
 
Sound department stands out still quite well, and the voice actors did a fine job. However, the second season suffers from out of place sound effects and music pacing, which is mostly due to the nature of the stories. 
 
Character 2/10 
 
This is the critical flaw in this season. The characters you witnessed in the first season are nothing like their second season counterparts. 
 
Enjoyment 1/10 
 
Let's just say that I get vastly more enjoyment from rewatching first season episodes for tenth-something time than delving into 2. season episodes a second time. 
 
Overall 5/10 
 
This series is unnecessary. Still, it doesn't take anything out from the adaptation of the source material which was done pitch-perfect, and this consists 75% of the total episodes. This is the main reason for the average score. The additional episodes don't bring anything to the table, nor take anything away from the originals. It is just out-of place filler that didn't need to be made.

          
 
       Helpful Hey, boys and girls!  
 
Say, what happens, when you take something, that was good - if not even perfect, to some degree - and then you hand it over to a someone, who's gonna make it... not necesseraly any better, but good nontherles, and then, you hand that project over to a some freaking pumpkinhead, who'll turn that into a freaking mess! I'll tell you, what'll hapen! It was Moomin, season 2! 
 
Overal, this isn't too bad of a sequal for a series, that really didn't needed a sequal to beging with - kinda like Little mermaid, or Lion king. The premise is still the same, just like in the previous one, and the characters are... more or less the same, like we used to know them. Couple of voices may have changed from the originals, due to the long age of the actors or such, and the personalities of most of the main characters may stray from the old and original traits a bit, but the Moomin Valley is still the same - again, more or less - and some of the little story arcs are at least decent, if not somewhat enjoyable. It's all about the viewing eye, and my eye, sadly, knows these episodes really, really well. 
 
The most notable difference between this season of Moomins, and it's actually good prequel, is the art style, characterization, and the stories. When the original was more or less cartoony, with it's fresh, fluid and soft animation, this one is straight anime-style, right down to the more ""obvious and exaggerated"" personality traits - whiny one, angry one, hopeless dreamer, etc. - facial expressions, and movements of the characters. And it shows! It is absolutely horrible to watch, and it doesn't fit with the format at all! It really is obvious that this season was mainly produced in Japan, because compared to it's more swedish-oriented prequel - also drawn in Japan, mind you! - this season almost feels like it's... dumned down, and it's really off-putting, to say the least!  
 
Another thing, like I said, was the stories. When the original Moomins were inspired from Tove Jansson's original books, these ones are entarily made up, and it also shows! I mean... Moomins in the ancient Egypt, destroying one of the most priceless treasures in our modern world today, the Giza's pyramid... I don't even know, what to say about that! And what about the antics with Da Vinci and Mona Lisa in the renaissaince era ... or how about wild west and Billy the Kid...? Is this a parody from Alfred. J. Kwak or what?!  
 
The musical track is luckily still the same, allthough some of the view new pieces really succeeded to pierce my ears really good, same with the new voice actors, when the old ones were too old, or died... I don't know which. Some of my favorite characters, like the Witch, Groken, and the Magician are also abcent, which is a real shame, since the latter was my first childhood crush.  
 
Despite all of my gripes with this season, this is not a bad sequel... it's just not needed to exist. The original series ended with the final winter, in Moomin valley, most of our loved characters are long gone on their marry ways, and Snufkin leaves forever from the Moomin valley, never to return again. This one... I don't even remember, how this ends, but let me tell you, it ain't good! Again, this is not bad... it's just different, than what would be expected... or should be. Give it a chance, but prefer to the original show. It's just easier that way.

(Source: Production I.G)","['Action', 'Samurai', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"I'm surprised that nobody bothered to review this 60 second anime. I get that it is essentially an add for Murphy's Stout (which essentially explains the absolute lack of story and character), but I do believe that something should be emphasized on why this anime has a certain appeal to it. 
 
For a start, I actually liked the art style - for a 60 second anime made in 1997, it actually is really well thought out and certainly stands strong even after the 19 years since its first release. The same goes for sound - the way each samurai enters the bar and the overall ambience they make just to get a stout (combined with the retro cyborg feel that these samurai were aiming for) makes this a unique ad as well as anime, to say the least. 
 
In hindsight, its an ad, but one which makes me want to have stout. Its nostalgic, well drawn, and the sound makes it hold strong even now.

          
 
       Helpful This is basically an advertisement for Murphy's Irish Stout, and its incidents are just as the synopsis says. 
However, it is an excellent ad which relays a strong atmosphere of a post futuristic megalopolis setting. The cyberpunk apocalyptic scenario along with its excellent design, superb choreography and smooth animation makes a very enticing experience for the eyes while an exciting music playing in the background. Production I.G. nailed it. And it ends it with an interesting unpredictable ending that serves like a cherry over a tasty cupcake. 
It delivers an interesting view of a futuristic world. There's not much to say about this 19 years old ad of 60 seconds. It perfectly does its job and is interesting to watch.

14,552,127,6.83622486,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Digimon Adventure,"When a group of kids head out for summer camp, they don't expect it to snow in the middle of July. Out of nowhere, the kids receive strange devices which transport them to a very different world to begin their  Digimon Adventure ! Led by the plucky Taichi Yagami, the seven children must now survive in a realm far from home, filled with monsters and devoid of other humans. 
 
Luckily, they're not alone: each child is paired off with a companion digital monster called a Digimon. Together, the children and their new friends must overcome their insecurities, discover their inner strengths, and evolve into stronger fighters - literally. 
 
A force of evil is spreading through the Digital World, corrupting all the Digimon. The DigiDestined have arrived and it’s up to them to save the Digital World, if they ever want to see their home world again.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Kids']",none,"When it comes to 'childhood shows' you grew up watching, there comes a certain kind of dissonance between the experience you had as a kid and the experience you would have as an adult. Rewatching Digimon Adventure recently, I realized that it's the kind of show that wouldn't sit well with you if you think too much, especially when compared to other better anime. Objectively speaking, it's not a classic, and one would certainly have to retain some sense of nostalgia to really enjoy having this adventure. For an anime created to promote the virtual pets merchandise, however, it is a well-produced series that offers a few surprises, even for the more cynical audiences. 
 
While it's definitely better than the other popular 'mons' anime franchise in terms of its overarching plot, the story is not the strongest aspect of the anime. The series is split into four major arcs, and like any monster-battling shounen shows, the storyline can get a bit episodic, with the children fighting a new set of villains with the beginning of each arc. Predictable cliches are commonly found without looking closely, and there are even a number of plot-holes and deus ex machinas that attack your common sense and logic. That said, viewers going in expecting a typical beat'em up will be pleasantly surprised by some of the darker plot-twists during mid-series. For a show seemingly targeted towards a younger audience, its angst and drama can become a bit mature for the little ones. This is where the strongest suit of the series comes into play - the character writing. 
 
For the entirety of the show, it's as if the writers had set out to place their focus solely on 'evolving' the seven children (and to a lesser extent, the eighth child) in the show. Most of the side characters in the show, even the protagonist Digimon characters, have little to no personality. Their morality and motivations are pretty clear, and it's definitely a good versus evil story at play. There's little intelligence to be found among the villains' cliche 'take over the (digital) world' scheme, and even the good guys don't give a satisfying explanation of why these particular children, and not any others, were chosen to be sent to the Digital World and fight the battles. Nevertheless, this leaves plenty of room for a singular focus - the Chosen Children characters. 
 
As the story goes on, each of the eight children are given a proper development scenario where they have to conquer their flaws and become a better person. Nearly all of them has an inner demon to fight with, and this can range from casual angst to realistically unpleasant situations. After doing some research on the show, I found out that the writers had decided to name each of the characters based on symbolical words that are related to good luck and fortune. This had me thinking that the writers really cared about the characters as they would care about a bunch of real children, and the writing really shows. While the manner in which the characters overcome their fears and anxieties can be overly convenient and even awkwardly forced at times, 'character development' is at its most literal sense here as we see the children evolve past their immature selves and be freed as a butterfly would. 
 
For an anime produced in the '90s, the art department did quite a decent job. However, the first thing I noticed rewatching the show is how blend the water-color backgrounds can be. While it's a common, traditional style among many anime of that era, the art of both the Digital World and the real world in this anime would be the least memorable thing in your mind. This can be effective in the sense that your focus is entirely placed on the characters instead of a picturesque backdrop, and considering that the characters are well-animated, this is hardly a problem. Given the angst the protagonists would face, the color tones at these grimmer moments do give the show the appropriate atmosphere, being cheery, thrilling, and emotional at the right times. 
 
However, viewers would be annoyed at the repetitive transformation sequences the Digimon would go through very often. While this may be fun for the kids, and it's certainly an effective business technique to promote the toys, they get old and tired for the more impatient viewers. Moreover, while the traditional animation transformations were decent to look at, viewers may find the CG animations to be cheesy and even cheap. The accompanying music, however, helps the audience through the ordeal without leaving things too awkward. 
 
Some of the scores you hear in the anime might feel familiar for you older audiences out there. That's because composer Arisawa Takanori had decided to recycle and remix a few of his old tracks from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars. Cheap productions aside, I noticed that many of the scenes in the anime have awkward silences where no track is played, and this can be sometimes anti-climatic. That said, there are more than a handful of enjoyable scores, character themes, and battle themes inserted in every episode to keep one entertained, not to mention the ever memorable ""Butter-Fly"" theme song by Wada Kouji. In addition, the theme song for the Digimon evolution sequences, Miyazaki Ayumi's ""Brave Heart"", would certainly fire up the spirits in your heart as you root for the heroes to win. 
 
One particular aspect I would like to mention about the songs in the original Japanese series is that the lyrics are definitely a lot more mature, symbolic, and memorable than those second-rated pop songs used in the dub series. In exchange for an opening about becoming a fluttering butterfly, the dub chose to use an over-the-top cheese-fest that repeats the word, ""Digimon"" over and over again. 
 
The overall enjoyment of the series is a difficult aspect to evaluate. As stated above, what one might enjoy as a child is vastly different than as an adult. Being a kid, I really loved this season of Digimon to death, more so when I discovered the original Japanese version. The values this show brings to children about courage, friendship, and love are more entertaining than preachy, and they really help the younger audiences relate to them as they journey on this fun adventure with these lovable characters. But as you grow older and become more cynical, you would start noticing the chinks in the plot-armor, the randomness even in the original Japanese dialogues, and you would wonder to yourself how the heck you had managed to sit through this show. 
 
Nostalgic factors aside, the anime series is pretty tame compared to better-written shounen shows out there, even with its above average character writing. However, for a carefree experience revisiting your childhood again, the show will serve up a more than decent entertainment as you travel with the Chosen Children on this Digimon Adventure.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The storyline of Adventure evolves (no pun intended) into something wonderful as the series goes on, however, the beginning is very shaky, and, for some audiences, a weak beginning is an automatic turn-off. It starts off very episodic, and, aside from the fact that the kids want to get home and have to fight a guy called Devimon, there is not much else for plot. However, after they get home, the series jumps into one of my favorite anime story arch of all times: The Eight Child arch. That part (which largely takes up the middle of the series) was masterfully done, and if the beginning wasn't so average, I would have surely given this anime a 9 or a 10 because of its splendid center content, which is like a bipolar carnival ride of smiles and tears. 
 
Art: For a show in the 90's, Adventure had very good art, and, even today, I prefer its style over that of many newer animes (Digimon ones included.) It is a hybrid of a toony style and a realistic one, giving the show a somewhat recognizable flare. Also, they have some amazing creature designs. True, there are some insanely cute Digimon (especially the babies) but, for the most part, the monsters actually look like what they are: Monsters! Adventure also uses a pleasant blend of CGI and traditional animation. Thankfully, they keep it low on the CGI (possibly due to the technology of the time) so it never looks stupid or overdone. 
 
Sound: What can I say, I love the soundtrack for both the English and Japanese versions. The dub and sub have catchy tunes throughout, however, in both versions there is nothing outstanding in the area of music. It’s mostly just songs that’ll get stuck in your head, but there are no memorable pieces destined to give you chills. 
 
Character: As someone who writes, I know that, the more characters you have, the harder it often is to develop them all. Adventure never seems to have this problem. The characters are all fleshed-out wonderfully, and are very relatable. Though they are young and clearly wise beyond their years, they are not so wise as to raise too many eyebrows, for they still make childish mistakes, and, despite their maturity, still act like kids. All of them have their own back stories and issues with their own images; at times the things they say are surprisingly deep, and I often found myself laughing and crying along with them. 
 
Enjoyment: It's not too often I can come back ten years later, watch a show, and enjoy it more than I did a decade ago, so Adventure deserves a ten in this department. When the creators said they wanted to make it a show that anyone of any age could enjoy, they were not kidding. 
 
Overall: Very good. Though it is definitely not perfect, due to a fun plot and great characters, it's still worth watching if you've never seen it, and rewatching if you have.

But when his new baby sister Mirai is brought home, his simple life is thrown upside-down; suddenly, it isn't all about him anymore. Despite his tantrums and nagging, Mirai is seemingly now the subject of all his parents' love. 
 
To help him adapt to this drastic change, Kun is taken on an extraordinary journey through time, meeting his family's past, present, and future selves, as he learns not only what it means to be a part of a family, but also what it means to be an older brother. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","Kun is a four-year-old boy born to an executive mother and an architect father. The family lives in a stepped house in Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama that Kun's father designed around a tree, where Kun spends his days playing with the family dog, Yukko, and his toy train sets. Kun's sister Mirai, Japanese for ""future"", is born, and he is happy at first but soon grows jealous when his parents focus all their attention on her. He lashes out at his parents, especially when his father becomes a work at home parent conducting remote work, while his mother returns to the office.
After one such tantrum, Kun stomps off to the house's garden, where he meets a strange man who claims to be the ""prince"" of the house. As the man whines about how he lost all the attention when Kun was born, Kun realizes that the man is actually Yukko turned human. He finds Yukko's tail on the man; when he removes it and places it on himself, he transforms into a dog.
On Hinamatsuri (Girls Day), the family set up the traditional dolls to wish Mirai good luck. Kun's father neglects to put the dolls away after the holiday ends. Frustrated again with his family, Kun runs back to the garden. This time he meets a 14 year old girl who claims to be Mirai from the future, whom Kun is able to recognize by the birthmark on her right hand. She has somehow come back in time, concerned because every day the dolls are not put away adds one year before she can marry. Future Mirai is able to put the dolls away with Kun and humanized Yukko's help.
Kun's mother shows him photos of herself when she was Kun's age but he continues to give his mother a hard time. In the garden again, he is transported years back to the past. In town, he runs into a little girl whom he recognizes from the photos as his mother. The girl is angry at her grandmother for refusing to give her a pet cat. Kun's mother leaves a note inside her grandmother's shoes asking her for a pet cat. They return home, where the little girl dumps toys all over the floor and food all over the table. Her mother, Kun's grandmother, furiously scolds the girl as she sobs. Kun returns to the present, and now shows sympathy for his mother, but continues to complain about everything.
Kun leaves a note asking for a bicycle in his mom's shoes and gets a bicycle with training wheels for a present, but wants to learn how to ride without the wheels after seeing the older kids. His father helps him but Kun seems unable to keep the bike upright. He goes back to the garden, where he is transported to the past, this time to a workshop in rural Japan. A young man with an injured leg takes Kun on a ride on one of the horses near his shop, then on his motorcycle. Back in the present, Kun successfully rides his bike using what he learned. Kun's mother shows him photos, revealing the man to be his great-grandfather, who has died just recently.
The family decides to go for a day trip. Kun once again throws a fit over his outfit. In the garden, he finds a train station (the Isogo Station). An 18 year old man warns him not to board the train but Kun disobeys him. The train takes him to Tokyo Station, where he panics about being alone. He finds an attendant who needs the name of a relative to call and Kun realizes that he doesn't even know the names of his own parents. The attendant sends Kun to a bullet train, telling him that if they can't find anyone to pick him up, he must board that train to take him to ""Lonely Land,"" which is essentially hell. Kun spots baby Mirai about to board the train and rescues her. At this point, he finally acknowledges that he is her older brother.
Baby Mirai disappears, and future Mirai arrives to take Kun home by flying through the air. They land in the tree, which houses the family's past. Kun sees that his father was physically too weak to ride a bike when he was young, that Yukko left his mother to become a pet, that Kun's mother stopped liking cats when she saw a stray one kill a bird, and that World War II left his great-grandfather's leg injured, and too slow to beat Kun's great-grandmother in the race she proposed to win her hand in marriage. Kun also sees the future, and discovers that the man at Isogo Station is future Kun. Back in the present, Kun, now more open-minded, goes on the trip with his family.

nothing much to tell about the story, and i'm not planning to drop the synopsis here, since the synopsys is kinda tells the whole story itself, so i recommend to watch this anime without checking the synopsis first.

about the voice actors, i'm kinda feel a bit uncomfortable and not used to it. Oota kun (the little boy a.k.a main character of this movie), his voice sounds too obvious that he's voiced by adult woman, anyway he's voiced by Kamishiraishi moka, and this is her first role in anime, so i can't expecting too much.

that kind of movie that when outside is raining while you sitting or laying in your bed, and sipping a cup of tea or coffee while covers yourself in a blanket (i know i'm sounds exagerrating, but at least that's exactly what i did xD) 
also the duration is not too long which is my favorite in this type of story. 
10/10 
 
overall rating : 8.5

          
 
       Helpful This is not a family movie, there is no warmth or heart in this. The ending felt brittle. The story focused more on his weak family bond rather than on his relationship with his sister, which felt like false advertising. 
 
I really liked the art, the backgrounds were so beautiful; although the CGI made it look like a sims game sometimes. I watched the dubbed version and the 4 year old sounded oddly mature for his age. I'm sure its just the post-pubescent voice. 
 
The situations that Kun were placed in were actually very well written for a terrible family. His mother lashed out constantly without repercussions and his father was weak (he had to get a manly lesson from his other dad). His entire family, even the sister, placed the blame of Kun's freak outs on himself even though he was in a very vulnerable spot (becoming the forgotten child, having the parents divide the love between him and his sister) at a vulnerable age. It's no wonder he grew up to be edgy and sad-looking (and probably in one of those isekai anime). 
 
I think it would've been more satisfying had the parents given some time to apologize to Kun for making him feel so terrible and trying harder to love the children equally; or having the sister help him through this difficult time throughout the entirety of the movie. It felt like all of the scenes where he travels in the garden were just snippets from a series carelessly strung together. 
 
What struck me was when the mother threatened to take his toys away when he didn't want to stop playing which led Kun to try to take away what was precious from her (aka Mirai). In the end, he feels like he belongs with the family because he basically doesn't want to be not a part of it (cliched leaves home, finds it to be rough out there, wants to go home routine). It's obvious that this family doesn't have anything holding them together other than blood, food and shelter. 
 
Overall, the parents learned nothing and the children learned nothing.

          
 
       Helpful Just saw it 2 days ago and wanted to jot down some thoughts. 
This is a fabulous film, probably Hosoda's most personal one. 
 
As a Pediatrician, I appreciated how detailed the movie animates 4-year old milestones, from temper tantrums to climbing up and down stairs with some difficulty to concrete versus abstract thinking. The facial expressions are top notch; very nice, exaggerated just to the point of not overdoing it. And the details on the baby! Hosoda really knocks it out of the park. Eye-tracking, babbling, cooing, to older toddler milestones of eye contact, grasping at toys, oral fixation, it's all there in wonderfully animated glory. 
 
But I digress. Others may find the detail a bit boring, as in its core it's a film about a 4 year old coming to terms with the presence of a new baby sister. The simplicity, however, is what makes the film wonderful. At the end of the film there was an interview with Hosoda and he was asked the question of whether this film was directly aimed at a young audience, and he makes a point that having such a simple down-to-Earth plot allows him to create a story that anyone can appreciate, an epic of sorts. I agree, there is something that someone of all ages can appreciate. I loved the realistic tantrums, the older-brother, younger-sister dynamics. The various vignettes offer a beautiful nostalgic feeling that reminds me of Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday. 
 
The plot, I admit, is threadbare. Once the magic portal gimmick shows itself for the 4th time, there's this feeling of ""Is this it?"" No grand narrative, no buildup to a villain is present. But I feel that the third act of the film is the strongest. The learning how the ride a bike scene, the scene with the Lonely Train, and the family tree vignettes were all very well done. Hosoda deftly builds up the family narrative to an emotional climax that eventually pays off very well. 
 
The sound and music is very low-key, and the color palette is very subdued as well. The CG is not too overbearing. The movie is quite technically proficient. 
 
Well worth the $16 with the convenience fee added on. I saw it in Mobile AL where on the premier showing there was only 6 people in the theater. Sad.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","In Victorian-era London lives a twelve-year-old earl named Ciel Phantomhive, who has acquired this position after the events of his tenth birthday on December 14, 1885, when the Phantomhive manor was attacked by unidentified perpetrators and set ablaze. Ciel, amidst the chaos, discovers his parents, Vincent and Rachel Phantomhive, to be dead along with the family dog, Sebastian. The same night, he is kidnapped by the attackers and then sold into slavery, where he ends up in the hands of a sadistic, demon-worshipping cult. Ciel then endures endless physical, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of his captors. Ciel was also heat-branded with a mark referred to as the ""mark of the beast"".
One night, during a sacrificial ceremony to summon a demon, instead of forming a contract with the cult members, the demon states that he was summoned by Ciel, therefore, he only agrees to form a contract with him, killing all the cultist members in the process. To show a contract was formed, the demon places a contract symbol referred to as the Faustian contract symbol on Ciel's right eye, giving it a purple hue, and his iris and pupil now showcase the symbol of the covenant. After the formation of the contract, the demon reveals that he will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal; revenge on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive.
Afterwards, Ciel names the demon Sebastian Michaelis, after his deceased pet dog. The duo then return to society as Ciel takes over his now late father's previous position as the queen's watchdog, a very high-profile individual who is tasked with investigating cases that Queen Victoria herself deems especially important or threatening to England and the crown.
","Book of Circus is a great series and is a great addition to the series as well as a good start point to newcomers. 
Actual Score: 9.4 
 
Story: 10 
The story revolves around a piece of the manga plot missing from the main anime known the circus arc; which is a fun story made up of your favourite characters while also introducing some new ones as well as dark and interesting story as well as circling around some events from Ciel's backstory that add more depth which also helps fit newcomers in understanding the story better as well as serving as a recap for fans already. The story is well driven and has good pacing even though its only 10 episodes long while also keeping up with an interesting story and the comedy fans know and love. 
 
Art: 9 
The art is outstanding with well detailed characters and amazing set pieces that make the world come alive as well as well done fight scenes that will make your heart pound. 
 
Sound: 9 
The opening of the anime is well done and fits the mood of the show with J-Rock band SID that set a dark atmosphere getting you ready for the show; while the ending was also well done it didn't have the same level as impact as the opening which made me neglect it fairly fast. The OST is amazing and helps portray the dark atmosphere the series portrays which is full of orchestral tones and folklore like music that fits nicely with the setting. 
 
 Characters: 9 
The characters that you know and love are back as well as some fresh faces that get a decent amount of backstory that opens that character more up as well as getting decent amounts of screen time. The most notable of the new cast was Joker ring leader of the circus who gets good screen time and has a unique personality that is refreshing as well as the other characters of the circus who all have interesting personalities and appearances.    


          
 
       Helpful Hi again!  
So, watching this season was a really pleasurable experience.  
 
Story (10)  
 
This one has a very good thing that the previous seasons didn't have. It's canon, it was manga based. So I feel I can take it seriously.  
I mean, I liked the ending of the first season, I enjoyed the second season but I put that things in my hands and I think... ""where I put this in the storyline?"" because I know that the manga will lead in a different way.  
So I kinda see the endings of the two seasons like alternative endings. 
I don't know if I already said it but I would have prefered that the second season would just focus on Alois and Claude without putting Sebastian and amnesic Ciel on the middle too. It left things kinda messy.  
But back to this season: I really liked the concept and development of things. It felt more organized overall. It has mistery, has some lines to think deeply about, and actually I don't see any problem with the story to point out, really.  
 
Art (10) 
 
It's absolutely gorgeous. It's different from the other seasons and it's not in a bad way. What got my eye first in the anime (first season) was the visuals. The art caught my eye, I read the resume, started watching, fell in love. Simple as that. And the art is still one of my major pleasures in this anime.  
 
Sound (9,5)   
 
Badass opening song and beautiful ending song? Checked  
Good voice actors? Checked 
Cool soundtrack in general? Checked  
Yeah, it was very good! 
 
Character (8):  
 
Oh, here I can point out a few things.  
I really like how imperfect the characters of this anime are, I probably already said it. 
The old characters keep being awesome and I really grow to like some of the new ones.  
But there are some of the characters in the circus that didn't have their ""time of show"". I mean... what we know about Peter and Wendy for example? 
I understand it's difficult to develop so many characters in 10 episodes, however.  
 
Enjoyment (10) 
 
Overall: 9,5  


          
 
       Helpful This is probably my favorite season out of all the seasons of Black Butler (current to date: Book of Atlantic) and its pretty straightforward why. I'll probably just go down the line of all the requirements though.  
 
Story: Its nothing special really; Ciel and Sebastian have a problem from the Queen and they're supposed to stop it. No ifs ands or buts. I've seen many people complain that the story is incoherent from the second (which we don't talk about) and the first season, but its not really hard to put together. There are many guidelines on many websites that say after the Curry arc in the first season, STOP and then go watch Book of Circus. That's how the manga goes.  
 
It follows the manga almost to an exact T (which is good because this is also one of my favorite manga arcs) with a few unimportant things missing here and there. The plot to it is good and it still very important and enjoyable. There's many things that are vague, but the further you go on into Black Butler is the more you understand what you missed from this arc. Reading the manga, everything from flashbacks to certain wording the characters use are important.  
 
Art: Very colorful. I don't know if different people worked on the art or if it was just the change with the times, but the art is very polished throughout all 12 episodes.  
 
Sound: Both sub and dub are good (sounding exactly like the first and second season for both). The same voice actors and even the same band does the opening like the ones before it. There's nothing much to praise and there's nothing much to critique. The opening and the ending songs are very good. 
 
Characters: Its Ciel and Sebastian. If you liked them before you'll like them now because frankly, they don't really change. The Noah's Arc Circus crew are very enjoyable from the beginning to the end. The only thing that deserves a lot of praise is the fact that the servants in the Phantomhive household get backstory and more time to show who they really are (we saw a little in season one, but that hardly counts compared to this). It happens in the anime enough for you to not question it, but I completely understand why they didn't add those parts because they were long chapters on their own. Either way it was very nice to see them more than the bumbling idiots they were in the first (and even the second) season.  
 
Overall Enjoyment: Like stated before, this is one of my favorite arcs in the manga, and it was very nice to see it adapted amazingly and not butchered. The only thing that stops me from giving it a 10 is the fact that neither the anime nor the manga are finished yet. Depending on the ending is if I'll bump this up or down, and the manga is nowhere near finished either.  
 
Truly, if you like Black Butler, then you're going to enjoy this season. Its nice to see one of my favorite mangas get the Fullmetal Alchemist treatment and it being done well. Remember to watch the first season to whatever episode the Curry Bun arc ends, and then go to Book of Circus.

A plan is devised to move over 300-million people from Earth. When the latest transportation fleet is attacked, Space Battleship Yamato comes to its defense, the ship is now commanded by Susumu Kodai, also aboard is daughter Miyuki, child of Susumu and Yuki.  
 
(Source: FUNimation) ","['Action', 'Military', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Drama']","The film opens as the Earth flagship Blue Noah leads the First Emigration Fleet to Amare. Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The warships of Earth's Fleet (EDF) counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but she vanishes mysteriously afterwards.
Thirty-eight-year-old Susumu Kodai, having quit the EDF sometime after Final Yamato, becomes captain of the cargo vessel Yuki. He picks up the distress signal from Blue Noah and quickly arrives at the wreck with a boarding party. Without warning, three enemy ships arrive. With Kodai at the helm, Blue Noah has just enough power to cover a small distance and fire one shot. Kodai's precise timing and maneuvering destroys all three ships.
Later, at the headquarters of the EDF, Commander Sanada discusses with Kodai about the approaching black hole. Kodai also learns that his wife became lost in the battle. Sanada wants Kodai to lead the Third Emigration Fleet, saying he should follow his wife's example of volunteering.
Kodai returns home, and is met by his daughter, Miyuki, who blames him for the supposed death of his wife. The two barely speak, and before Kodai can attempt to talk with her, he is called back to HQ with news about the Second Emigration Fleet being destroyed by three different fleets, the Beldel and Furide and Ethos, not including the enemy fleet earlier. This means Earth now has four enemies. Kodai accepts command of the Third Emigration Fleet without hesitation, and Sanada reveals his ship: the Yamato itself, newly rebuilt in the Aquarius ice asteroid. After arriving at its drydock and taking his seat in the captain's chair, he makes a solemn vow to find his wife, refusing to believe she is dead. On the other side of the galaxy, a meeting took place, the leader of the Alliance and the fleet that attacked the Blue Noah and the First Emigration Fleet is revealed to be the SUS. Metzler, the Admiral of the SUS Fleet, the other Leaders, Amare, Beldel, Furide and Ethos were present. Metzler deceived the leaders that Earth is an invader, and they are barbarians showing the leaders footgate of Escort Ships from the First Emigration Fleet firing their Wave Motion Guns destroying many SUS Ships stunning the Leaders However, one leader—Gouri, admiral of the Ethos fleet belonging to the planet Ethos—is unsure.
The Yamato takes off and joins the Fleet, taking its place at the front as Flagship. In the planning room, the crew lays out the mission. The plan is to slingshot around a small black hole, BH199, and boost the arks and warships into high warp, propelling them to Amarh much faster than usual. There is no other option, as there are enemy ships lurking around them and the previous fleets were destroyed at this area. Gouri watches the first group of arks slingshot and warp, and then, still unsure, orders an attack. Soon, the Yamato detects the Alliance Fleets and Kodai promptly orders all fighters on board to launch and the Emigration Escort Fleet to split into two groups to fight the Beldel and Ethos Fleets while the Yamato will fight the Furide. Soon the Furide Fleet begins their attack with the Yamato drawing first blood on a Furide Ship, the enemy responded with a barrage of missiles only to be stopped by Shield Rockets fired from the Yamato. On the other side of the battlefield the Beldel Fleet is faced with a group of Emigration Escort Ships,  both sides begin firing on each other in fury blaze of beams the Beldel launches their squadrons of fighters to battle, the squadrons of fighters from the Yamato intercepts the enemy squadrons and a dogfight ensures. The Furide Fleet begins a massive bombardment on the Yamato and the battleship responded with all guns blazing but 3 Furide Ships, the Furide Flagship among the 3, strayed off from the battle and straight for the Vulnerable Unarmed Arks and begins a bombardment of missiles,  the Yamato notices the stray ships but is under heavy fire preventing the Battleship from moving, with quick thinking the Battleship deploys 3 docked heavy bombers and managed to successfully destroy 2 of the unsuspecting Furide Ships, one of the heavy bombers continued firing on the last surviving Furide ship which was the Flagship of the Furides and succeed in destroying the alien vessel killing the Furide Commander  before they can cause more harm to the fleeing arks, meanwhile the Second Group of Escort Ships confronts the Ethos Fleet and started fighting taking losses on both sides, the Yamato was continuously hit hard by the Furide, thinking quick, Kodai orders a Missile Barrage which destroyed a large portion of the Furide Fleet, on board the Ethos Flagship Gouri notices the ferociousity of the Yamato in battle which inspires the Escort Fleet in battle, Gouri then orders the Fleets to concentrate on the Yamato, meanwhile the SUS Fleet which didn't participate the Battle, on board the SUS Flagship with Meltzlar onboard was quite surprised to see many Alliance Ships being destroyed, soon enough Escort Ships came to assist the Yamato in fighting the leaderless Furide Fleet, with majority of the arks successfully slingshoted from the black hole, Kodai orders the Escort Fleets to regroup and head for the black hole with the Yamato covering their escape, many ships were damaged while escaping, the Furide and Beldel Fleets turns their attention on the Yamato punishing the Battleship with barrage of fire, Ryo Kamijo, the Gunnery Officer of the Battleship prepares the Wave Motion Gun in anger only to be stopped with a slap from Kodai, explaining to him that if they fire the Gun, the Yamato will be drained of Energy leaving the Battleship Defenseless, obeying the Captain, the Gunnery officer turns off the Wave Motion Gun. As the Escort Fleet begins the Slingshot, on board the Ethos Flagship Gouri silently observes the Yamato in combat, Kodai witnesses an ark that didn't made the Slingshot and was under heavy fire from Alliance Ships, Kodai maneuvers the Yamato in between the Ark and the Enemy Fleets absorbing the fire to allow the Ark to Escape the Battleship was being pummeled heavily by the Combined Beldel and Furide Fleets even with the Shield Rockets being fired from the Yamato to defend the ark, both ships are still under heavy fire,  when Gouri witnesses the Yamato putting herself in harm's way to defend an ark, Gouri concludes that he has been lied to. He orders the helmsman to fly in between the Yamato and the Beldel and Furides preventing them from firing, since the action of the Yamato is ""not how barbarians act"". He contacts Kodai and tells him that they were misled, twisted to do the bidding of the SUS. Seeing that the EDF Escort Fleet fought honorably, Gouri allows them to go in peace. It had some repercussions — he is later threatened by Barlsman, Commander-in-Chief of the SUS. However, Gouri holds his ground and states that it is the Ethos code of honor to let go an opponent who risks their lives in battle to let others live. Angered, Barlsman gives Gouri a very stern warning if he ever fail him again, the SUS will destroy the homeworld of the Ethos.
The Third Emigration Fleet and Escort Fleet successfully arrives at Amare, much to the joy of the Survivors of the first two Emigration Fleet, the Yamato descends to the Ocean and was greeted by a huge crowd with loud cheers, soon enough Kodai reaches land and spoke to an EDF Member who is a survivor of Yuki's ship, they entered a large hangar where the remains of destroyed Escort Ships from both the First and Second Emigration Fleets is kept, the survivor told Kodai what truly happened, Yuki's Ship found was completely empty, the Survivor passed Kodai a destroyed Captains Hat which belongs to Yuki. As the sun sets in the evening, the Bridge crew of the Yamato wondered if the people of Amare will call their Moon, Earth.  Soon enough on Earth, EDF HQ was happy to hear that the Third Emigration Fleet successfully made it to Amare. Meanwhile, far away from Earth, the Black hole continues its journey to Earth. Back at Amare, Kodai spoke to Queen Iriya of Amare and she told Kodai about the Origins of the Alliance, they were then, the Victims of many Interstellar Wars fought by many Alien Species and as a result they were devastated, the devastation continued over generations and the devastation stopped when the SUS called for peace which gave birth to the Alliance. Kodai now realising the SUS is the leadership of the Alliance which the Queen confirms and stated that the Alliance is more of a Tyrannical Dictatorship under the guise of ""Peace"". The Amare came to hate the SUS but couldn't do anytjing as they were supplying the SUS with resources revealing that the Planet of Amare contain a rare Material which is sought by the SUS, in return the people of Amare receive protection from the SUS, after talking to the Queen Kodai was confronted by an Armed Amarean who is revealed to be General Pascal the leader of the Amare Military, he forces Kodai into a room, Kodai obeys the order only to be faced with 3 Armed Royal Guards upon entering, General Pascal demands that the Humans leave or they will be punished by the Alliance or destroy Amare, kodai refuses, the Royal Guards threats to kill him but the building shakes, realizing the SUS is attacking the City, General Pascal demands Kodai not to interfere, as it would make Amare-SUS relations worse. The SUS launches an Airstrike on the Amare City, dropping bombs on the streets killing numerous civilians, two Massive SUS Tanks and one Colossal SUS Siege Tank plowed the streets destroying buildings, the Amare Police along with armed citizens fought back, the Yamato floating at the distance, The Bridge crew was shocked, Ryo kamijo the gunnery officer demands the First officer to launch the Yamato to battle but they notices the SUS Bombers retreating, Kodai arrived on the bridge after returning from the City, he explains to the Crew of what he learned which stunned everyone, the Yamato goes on standby, the Yamato detects a second of wave of Bombers, this time with fighters among the groups of bombers they began their bombardment on the helpless city killing more civilians, the Amare Army now joining the fight against the SUS. The SUS War Machines firing at everything in their path destroying more buildings and killing countless. Above the skies the Ethos Fleet along with the Ethos Flagship arrives, seeing the devastation the SUS have created, Gouri contacted Metzlar asking why the SUS are attacking Amare, an ally of the Alliance, which Metzlar responses that Amare is sanctioned for defying the Alliance, horrified by the fact the SUS are attacking indiscriminately, Gouri confronts Metzlar that the Alliance wouldn't commit such acts which Metzlar finally reveals to Gouri that the SUS's decision is the decision of the Alliance and demands Gouri to start his attack on Amare which Gouri refuses, the SUS Fleet led by Metzlar descends from the sky to confront the Ethos Fleet, Gouri having enough of such Barbaric decisions, he insulted Metzlar ending the transmission, on board the Ethos Flagship the First Officer was surprised at Gouri insulting the SUS Admiral, Gouri, in an attempt to reclaim his honor and save Amare, orders the Ethos Fleet to prepare for battle. Back on the Yamato Kodak received a message from Gouri, both former enemies greeted each other with Salute, Gouri explains to Kodak of he's intentions on turning against the SUS and the Alliance, being pressed by the Alliance in exchange for ""peace"" which is how the Alliance operates, ending with a Salute, on board the SUS Flagship, Metzlar gives a big thumbs down and the SUS Fleet begins descending on the Ethos Fleet, both sides open fire on each other in a fury blaze of beams, Gouri aims for the Flagship of the SUS Maya on a Suicide Run, the Ethos Flagship bursts in speed towards the Maya in a final charge of honor, Kodai was shocked at what Gouri is doing, a vengeful Metzlar orders the Fleet to target the Ethos Flagship but the Resilient Ethos ship absorbs large amounts of fire and even ram pass a SUS Ship scaring Metzlar, the Ethos Flagship rams the Maya destroying the massive SUS Flagship killing Gouri and he's First Officer along with everyone else on both ships, but Metzlar managed to escaped with some surviving crew, both sides disengaged...

Back on the Yamato Kodai remembering that his wife always fought injustice, is inspired and informs Queen Iriya of his intention to declare war on the SUS. The Yamato fires volleys of missiles, destroying the SUS Fighters and Bombers and blowing up both SUS Tanks and the Colossal Siege Tank. The Queen is brought to tears and thanks Kodai and his crew for their bravery. As the arks return to Earth with a token force of escorts,  the Escort Fleet follows the Yamato into battle, General Pascal is also inspired by Kodai's decision, the Amare Navy led by General Pascal on board the Amare Flagship joins the Escort fleet for one final battle: an assault on the nearby SUS space fortress. If it is destroyed, then the SUS will lose control over everything.
On the SUS Space Fortress, Metzlar meets with Barlsman and informs him of recent events and Barlsman assures him that there's no reason to panic.
Outside the Fortress, a massive combined Furide and Beldel and SUS Fleet stands ready and waits for their opponents to arrive for battle. The combined Fleet led by the Yamato and the Amare Flagship warps in, the Yamato deploys its Squadrons of fighters and heavy bombers, both sides starts firing on each other losing ships, the Squadrons of the Yamato faces off with Squadrons from the Beldel Fleet in a massive Dogfight, the Yamato then suffers damage from enemy Fire losing one of its main gun turrets, the ship's Warp Core starts to malfunction but was quickly fixed by the Chief Engineer Saving the Battleship from destruction, as the Battle rages into dangerous close quarters, kodai orders the Yamato To break off and aim for the center with cover for their  squadrons, behind the combined enemy fleet, the SUS space fortress reveals itself from the mist of red clouds, surrounded by 5 massive pillars, Kodai surprised by the size of the fortress, orders Maho the Chief Navigator to analyse the fortress, inside the fortress, Barlsman was disappointed with Metzlar's tactics which he replied by ordering the Fortress Crew to prepare the Neutron Beam Cannons to fire on the Combined Earth and Amare fleet, the crew refuses as Allied ships were on the line of fire but Metzlar forces them to fire, outside the fortress, the 5 pillars are revealed to be the neutron guns, 2 of the pillars deployed its massive Gun barrel and fires a massive surge of neutron energy at the Fleets destroying almost all of the alliance ships, General Pascal orders the Amare Fleet to defend the Yamato the beam destroys the entire Amare Fleet and a large portion of the Escort Fleet, the Flagship of the Amare fleet was severely damaged defending the Battleship from the neutron beam with its shield, on board the burning Amare flagship, a dying Pascal bids the Yamato Good luck, the ship explodes, the bridge crew of the battleship was in total shock that the SUS fired on their own and was not so surprised when the surviving ships of the alliance turns and retreats from the battlefield, inside the fortress Metzlar requests they fire all 5 of the Neutron Guns on the Escort Fleet which Barlsman approves, the other 4 Pillars deploys their gun barrels and fires in unison, the Yamato and her Squadrons managed to escape the beam as they tear through the battlefield destroying the remaining Escort Ships, the Yamato fires a massive barrage on the fortress but they were deflected by its impenetrable shield, kodai orders the squadrons back to the ship, Maho reports to bridge about her findings and reveals to the crew about the inner workings of the space fortress, realising that the 5 pillars are also the shield generators for the fortress, the Yamato's First Officer requests to borrow the Shinano, Yamato's auxiliary ship but kodai refuses but the First Officer deliberately volunteers himself for this which kodai agrees, the Shinano fires a barrage of Wave Motion Missiles but they were ineffective, the Shinano was greeted with a massive barrage of anti air fire from 2 pillars damaging the Shinano, the First Officer already wounded, sacrifices himself and disables the defensive energy shield around the fortress by ramming destroying the Shinano shattering the shield like glass, inside the fortress a fearful Barlsman and Metzlar watch in horror while Kodai gives a Salute, he then orders the Crew to start up the wave motion gun while the fortress aims its Pillars on the Yamato, with the Wave Motion Gun ready, the Yamato unleashes five powerful shots, destroying the pillars revealing a massive sea and the main SUS Fortress sinks.
On board the Yamato, the crew celebrates but suddenly, an immense ship emerges from the sea, and bombards the Yamato with heavy beam fire before retreating into the sea and coming out from behind And bombarding the already damaged Yamato, the Immense Ship fired a Neutron Beam but the Yamato narrowly missed the shot, maho was in shock that such ship is Abel manipulate dimensions and wander them freely, the Damage Teams reports to Bridge of the damage the ship has suffered, the SUS Ship emerges from the front and pummels the Yamato with heavy Fire, when Kodai, realizing that the power source is the artificial sun behind it, uses the final available shot of the Wave Motion Gun on it, two small ships peeled off from the SUS Ship towards the Yamato pummeling the Battleship with fire but was swiftly destroyed by a missile barrage, the Yamato fires its last remaining Wave Motion Shot on the artificial sun collapsing the sun and turning it into a black hole. The Yamato escapes, while the enemy ship—with Metzlar and Barlsman in it—is torn apart and sucked into it. Metzler escaped the destruction of the SUS space fortress, and appears to the Yamato crew and reveals himself and the people of the SUS as energy beings that can change form, being sent to this galaxy from another universe. He then disappears.
The Yamato warps back to Earth, and the energy being Metzler appears again. He reveals that the black hole headed for Earth is artificially created and controlled: it will serve as a portal to ""steal"" Earth and take its resources, since they cannot be found in his world. Kodai realizes that it must have a power source. The Wave Motion Gun automatically reconfigured to enable it to fire all six shots in one go, a risky decision that could destroy the ship, but the crew unanimously agree that saving Earth is more important. The Yamato dives into the black hole, and as it reaches the core, the Wave Motion Gun fires, destroying the artificial weapon in a gigantic implosion. The blast from the Wave Motion Gun had ruptured and damaged the Yamato bow and front section; the third bridge (where the ship's navigation room resides) also suffers serious damage and is exposed to space, killing Chief Navigator Maho Orihara, who was working in it, and her assistants; but the ship is still space-worthy and orbits Earth in triumph. Earth can now be repopulated and the arks can return home. Kodai also reconciles with his daughter in the end.
","-This review may contain spoilers from the movie and from the original series- 
 
When talking about anime classics, there are not many series that rank higher than Uchuu Senkan Yamato, and with good reason, as Yamato is one of the greatest space operas out there. 
 
This movie takes place in the year 2220, 21 years after the original series (which also has a remake now), and it's a direct sequel, where Kodai will again be the main character and will be in charge of leading an inmigration fleet to an other planet because a black hole is approaching Earth, and the days of the blue planet are counted. 
 
This completely remade story shows us how CGI can actually be an incredible tool in animation when used well (and when having good budget). Yamato's animation, which uses CGI A LOT, is really mindblowing. Throughout the whole movie, there is always consistent great animation, with very well made battles between spaceships. Yamato is second to none in this. 
 
Music also plays a big factor in this movie, which uses a lot of beautiful classical music such as Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave, Chopin's Nocturne #1 or Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Besides that, there's always the classical Yamato theme played in grand fashion and in various ways and a very nice ending to close the movie. 
 
The story started good, but it did get worse by the second half. Still, thanks to great animation, sound and action, the movie never ceased to entertain one bit. The first half of the movie was pretty good story-wise. Kodai had a clear mission, we got to meet a great enemy general and, while not very complex, things were very good. Things got a little worse when we suddenly got a rather plain villain, making the series almost a simple evil vs good thing. Still action didn't drop one bit, and the Space Battleship Yamato proved to be as awesome as ever, showing its upgraded power to the fullest. The movie put the ship in some dire situations, which resulted in some of the best space action I've ever seen. 
 
Besides Kodai, who enters the movie as a memorable character already, there isn't really any character that stood out much to me. They fullfilled their role well, but they were definitely not as good as the original Yamato crew. 
 
Another slight problem is that for flashback scenes, they actually really just used things from the 1983 movie, which of course, looked very out of place in this 2010 movie. Still, that was just at a very specific moment of the anime, so it's not something that will really hinder the experience in any way. You can actually be positive and use the moment to see how anime has evolved in the last 30 years. 
 
You will notice that some major events happened between the original series and this movie... that'd be Kanketsu-hen, which hasn't been remade. While it's impossible not to notice, and while having watched Kanketsu-hen before would make the experience better, you don't really need to watch it. Just with the original series you should be fine. 
 
This movie's definitely not as good as the original series, but it's still a very nice sequel, and some of the main strong points of Yamato are kept intact. It is something very nice how Kodai has matured as a person between the original series and this movie, as you can see how, little by little, he's becoming more like the legendary Juzo Okita. 
 
And even if its not as good as the original series, if you enjoyed that one, Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Fukkatsu-hen should be one hell of a ride. But again, watching the original series is a must in this case.

","My enjoyment for these could've been much better.

The first one was really, really adorable and sweet. And the parts that weren't present time were fantastic. If it focused only on their high school days, I probably would've given it a much higher score. I feel like this OVA would've been better if it either did that, or was more than one OVA so it could successfully pull off going back and forth.  
 
The second one was... mild? Not boring, but not interesting. I guess mediocre is the best way to put it. Again it felt really like it was lacking/missing/incomplete.  
 
Don't think I'm just expecting too much out of OVAs... because I've liked other OVAs. I liked the OVA I watched for Junjo Romantica, for example. Was it a waste of time? No, I wouldn't say that. But I also wouldn't go out of my way to rewatch it, either. It probably doesn't deserve an overall 7, but I do like the art, sound, characters, and /parts/ of it. 
 


          
 
       Helpful My enjoyment for these could've been much better. Perhaps because the last Sekai Ichi thing I watched was the movie, which was basically my favorite yaoi anime/movie/ova I've watched, this felt underwhelming.

As I enjoyed previous Conan movies featuring Kaito Kid, I was really looking forward to this one. Conan movies are not without flaws, but I can usually look past those flaws based on enjoyment alone - but for this movie, not so much. 
 
Let's jam: 
 
Story (3/10) 
The story is quite straightforward: the Suzuki family wants to organize an exhibition featuring all of van Gogh's ""Sunflower"" paintings with the help of a group of hand-picked individuals called the ""Seven Samurai"", but for some reason Kaito Kid decides to get involved. This in turn causes the police to become involved, as everyone tries to protect the paintings from Kid while making sure the exhibition goes off without a hitch. 
There were two things that I found annoying about the story: 1) it was not well-executed. It felt like the writers wanted to make the story more interesting by adding random plotlines and events unrelated to the main story, but this only served to make the movie unnecessarily complicated. Since the characterization was weak to begin with, the movie was unable to justify these creative decisions. 2) It was quite predictable. Anyone who is familiar with the Conan franchise can pretty much tell how this story will play out after the first 15 minutes. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how the writers further develop the story, but in this case it definitely did not enhance the viewing experience. 
 
Art (7/10) 
The movie was well-animated, employing bright colors and beautiful shots of New York City and Tokyo. The animators also did a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for various scenes. One sequence taking place on an airplane really stood out for its great visuals and intense action. 
 
Sound (5/10) 
For the most part, the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and complemented the movie. Not the most memorable soundtrack of all time, but effective nonetheless. I do have to say that the ending song was terrible, and did not belong there at all. 
 
Characters (3/10) 
Characters can make or break a movie, and in this case the characters did the latter. We all know that the new characters introduced in a Conan movie are one-shot characters, but the Seven Samurai were boring and generic even for one-shot characters. When the writers tried to utilize them to further the plot, it was rendered ineffective because none of them possess any personality whatsoever. It felt like they were introduced for the sake of the storyline, and then completely abandoned. There was also an old lady character who had some sort of personal connection to one of the Sunflower paintings, but the writers spent extremely little time sketching out her storyline, therefore stripping it of all its emotional value. 
On the other hand, it was nice to revisit the rivalry between Conan and Kaito Kid. For some reason though, most of the main characters in the Conan universe play extremely small roles in the storyline and mostly let stuff happen to them, and even Conan doesn't do as much detective work as usual. Kaito Kid may be as charming as always, but the plot doesn't do him any favors as well. 
 
Enjoyment (6/10) 
I enjoyed most parts of the movie, especially the action scenes, while other scenes were utterly unenjoyable. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't look past the flimsy plot and ineffective characterization. 
 
Verdict 
Out of all Conan movies, this is one of my least favorite, along with the Jolly Roger one. For long-time viewers of Conan, I would recommend re-watching a previous movie featuring Kaito Kid instead of seeing this one. For anyone new to the Conan franchise, I would recommend movie #7 or #10 instead, since both feature well-executed and exciting storylines that also further develop the relationships among the main characters.  
 
I know the team behind Conan can do better than this, so I'll be looking forward to the 20th movie!

          
 
       Helpful Story 6/10: 
-The story is your usual Jirokichi Suzuki vs KID, but for the FIRST time he didn't collect the art to lure KID but for the pride of Japan?!. For Jiro-ojisan to have a reason other than luring KID to add it to his biography doesn't go well with him. 
- The culprit's motive was weak and there was barely any smart deductions. 
- Hibara's screen time was wasted randomly, while there could have been a well developed side story using it instead(the 4 scenes did nothing to the movie or development). 
+It was nice seeing Sonoko going around with her uncle to formal events and being more active. 
 
Art 7/10: 
The new characters are drawn plainly, but KID, Conan, and Ran looked great through out the movie and especially in the climax scene when Conan shows a touched expression and says ""KIDo"". 
 
Sound 9/10: 
BG OST wasn't anything unusual, but the credits song OH!Rival! was great♥ 
 
Character 6/10: 
Weak culprit, weak character development of the introduced team and at the end you forget that some of them even exists. I honestly felt like 6 new characters was too much and they barely have any bg, development, or presence. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10: 
-It was definitely disappointing for a KID movie. A lot of things weren't explained probably, especially with Charlie's hatred toward KID! we get no explanation to why he was in rage the whole movie and no worthy confrontation, we don't even know how they know each other.  
+ The final part of the movie was the most if not the only enjoyable part! btw, what's with the latest movies where Ran saves the day.  
 
Overall 6/10: 
--------------- 
The lowest score I've ever given to a DC movie till this day! I definitely was disappointed since I'm a Hibara and Kid fan, and wasting these two characters in the movie was a shame. 

          
 
       Helpful The most recent Detective Conan film has come and gone, and this one is a bit different. Similar to the 10th movie (Requiem of the Detectives), we have our littlest detective out to protect the fine arts, though in this case, Conan must save one of Van Goh's most important paintings, the Sunflowers. Is this movie an amazing art heist wannabe, or a copied flop? Oh, and did I mention Kaito Kid? Cause yeah, Kaito Kid. 
 
Story (6/10): After the Suzuki Zaibatsu purchases the originally thought destroyed 2nd Sunflowers painting, Kaito Kid essentially declares that he'll steal it. But since this is completely outside of the thiefs usual M.O., all characters involved become suspicious, especially after the messages and methods become violent. Conan and friends are now on a deadline to get the Sunflowers Exhibition up and running, but it still doesn't answer the main problem: why is Kaito Kid after the paintings?  
 
The story here is a bit of a mixed bag, to say the least. There's a lot right but enough wrong that it's hard not to address. The good things are that it really takes a smart approach to trying to defeat Kid, showing all the work that goes into everything behind the scenes. It's really quite fun to see just what Suzuki Jiro does to show off his extreme wealth. All the stuff that connects with the Sunflower paintings themselves is also interesting, and a little heartwarming.  
 
There are some problems with the movie. The resolution to who is after the paintings is WEAK. And I don't just mean weak, I mean WEAK AS FUCK. (Yes, f-bomb worthy weak.) True, the clues do tell you who it is, but God almighty is it a letdown. In connection to that, there's a random confession to a crime dead center in the climax that basically comes out of nowhere and does nothing to change the plot AT ALL. Also almost everything to do with Kaito Kid is basically worthless, and yes as a fan of his, that sucks to say. I'll elaborate more in the below section, but suffice to say, this is probably the weakest movie that Kid has been a part of.  
 
Overall it isn't a bad story, but man, the parts that are bad are standout bad. 
 
Art (8/10):  As is per the norm, the art is excellent, giving all the scenes wonderful color and action. Though I must point out that there are a few 'quality' background scenes here and there that are a bit more standout than I would usually critique.  
 
Sound (7/10): Back to basic Conan movie music, but as usual that isn't a bad thing. Though I must point out the track that plays during the climax of the movie, as it was really damn good.  
 
Character (6/10): I do have some positives and negatives in relation to the regular cast. First the disappointing: it feels like they dumbed down Conan and Ai. While nothing extreme or distracting, it just feels like the two smartest characters in the show almost don't have that much of an impact in solving the crime. Conan doesn't have to work hard to figure anything out and really only gets like 2 clues total to work with in the entire movie. It just feels like he got pushed out of his own movie. 
 
Not all is bad though. The Suzuki's (Jiro and Sonoko) are actually more entertaining here than they've been in a while.  Ran, her Dad, and Inspector Nakamori are also treated with respect and given quite a lot to do here. Basically the main side characters here are treated well and are really fun to watch.   
 
Kaito Kid is also barely in the movie. Technically he is in most of it, but he doesn't even have a freaking line until 20 minutes near the end. Despite being the main 'antagonist', he's just a non-factor in the story too much of the time. It honestly feels like the movie is trying to play Kid like he was back when his introduction was a bit more mysterious, but by today, where his manga is a thing and he had his own anime last year, it just doesn't work anymore.   
 
With the movie exclusive characters, they are just boring and forgettable. True, Inspector Charlie is the best of the bunch, but he's ultimately not that important in the long run. The other characters have literally 3-8 lines of dialogue and no personality at all. Hell, I don't even remember their freaking names after just watching it. They're close to the top of a Worst DC Movie Cast list for being just there and irrelevant by the end.   
 
(As is traditional at this point, I need to make my complaint: why are the freaking Detective Boys in this damn movie? Their scenes are worthless and they literally serve no purpose. I don't want to hate on them, since as Quarter of Silence has shown us, when given real purpose, they are great characters. But here? They should've been excluded from the entire second half when the exhibition takes center stage. Hell, even the Professor is kind of awkwardly shoved into the movie, with all his scenes being really bad comedy.) 
 
Enjoyment (7/10): I did have more fun with this movie than I did the last one, if you can believe it. Probably because I do like a good art heist film. Granted, as noted above, the second half is where I started getting lost. While the actual climax is really fun, I was just disappointed that we didn't really get a Conan vs. Kid film. I really should know by now that we'll never get one of those until a miracle happens, but I still held hope that this would be the one. Again, while it seems like I'm complaining, I really did have some fun with this movie. (Also there's a tiny call back to something from the 18th movie here, which is kinda cute.) 
 
Detective Conan: The Hellfire Sunflowers is probably one of the more average movies in the series, though it isn't awful by any means. While the side characters are really given a time to shine, the story has some major flaws in its second half and doesn't really feel like the Conan/Kid focused movie that it's trying to be. If you're a DC fan, I as always recommend that you watch it at least once for completions sake, but non fans aren't going to find anything interesting here. 
 
6/10 = average by DC standards; second half is weak, with the mystery reveal failing to impress; there are better Conan/Kid movies, like the 14th (being the best); the main older side characters do kind of get a chance to shine;

(Source: Wikipedia) ","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","In the future, a race of insectoid aliens, known as the Uchuu Kaijuu or Space Monsters , seem dedicated to the eradication of humans as the latter takes its first steps away from the Solar System, and they are getting closer and closer to Earth. Humanity has responded by developing space-going battleships and giant fighting robots. These complex robots—RX-7 Machine Weapons—are actually an advanced type of fighting suit, piloted by a single occupant. As advanced as they are, however, they are being used as trainers for a new weapon, the Gunbuster. Pilot candidates are selected from the best and brightest youth on Earth and the Lunar colony. These are trained at schools around the world.
In the year 2023, six years after the first battles with the aliens (the actual battle started in the year 2015 however due to time dilation, two years went by on Earth by the end of the battle), and centers on young Noriko Takaya (タカヤ・ノリコ Takaya Noriko) (voice: Noriko Hidaka). Although Noriko's father was a famous admiral in the space fleet who went missing following one of the first battles of the war, her own talents as a pilot are questionable—especially when compared to the other students. Nonetheless, she has entered a training school on Okinawa, where she is largely influenced by her instructor, Kōichirō Ōta (""Coach Ōta"") (voice: Norio Wakamoto), who was one of Admiral Takaya's crew. He has faith that she will overcome her early clumsiness, while other students are critical of her inability, referring to Noriko as the ""daughter of defeat"".
Noriko idolizes the beautiful, competent and talented Kazumi Amano (アマノ・カズミ Amano Kazumi) (voice: Rei Sakuma). Amano is the top RX-7 pilot at the school, and likely the entire world. Coach Ōta shows the extra training which Amano creates for herself, inspiring Noriko to look within herself for strengths which she did not know that she had.
Only two Gunbuster pilots from each school will be selected for the real mission. Amano, of course, will be going, and all of the others want the second slot on the team. Takaya is determined to win, not only to be with Amano but also to find (or avenge) her father. She is thrilled to discover that she has in fact been chosen as the second Japanese pilot.
Following that selection, conflict between Takaya and other students comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, Ōta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground—but does nothing. He is there to observe, and perhaps to save Takaya's life, if the combat gets too intensive.
Takaya is on the defensive from the start, and the older student humiliates her by action and over the radio. As Takaya's RX-7 is pummeled, Noriko realizes that her difficulties are a case of sensory overload—she is getting too much information from the electronic monitoring systems. She turns off her monitors, but as the systems go dark, her opponent is infuriated by the perceived insult and prepares the final, killing blow. Just as it appears that Noriko is doomed, she destroys her opponent's RX-7 with a ""Thunder Kick"". Her opponent muses that the school rookie has beat her with an advanced maneuver which she hadn't been taught. This is the proof that Ōta was seeking, that Noriko had an innate ability which would be invaluable in the battles to come.
Together, with Coach Ōta and Amano, Takaya is sent into space to train with other representatives from all over the solar system in preparation for the attack upon the space monsters. There they are introduced to a Soviet pilot from the moon base by the name of Jung Freud (voice: Maria Kawamura). On their first training mission, Takaya and Amano are stopped by Jung, and challenged to a duel. Amano and Jung become completely involved in the fight, as Noriko trails along, and all three get lost within the machinery of the space station. The fight stops midway, when all three come in contact with the first space monster that was defeated and captured.
Once they return they are scolded by their coach, but because of their importance to the missions success as well as building feelings between the coach and them, they are let go with a simple warning. Jung later apologizes for her challenge, and thus begins a friendship with the two.
As they move farther into space, the young pilots are placed in their quarters for subspace traveling. On a dare, Takaya is sent into the hangars and meets a male space pilot named Toren Smith (voice: Kazuki Yao). Amano comes into doubt of Takaya's abilities and asks the Coach to end their partnership. Takaya overhears the conversation and ends up partnering with Smith instead.
The first true battle between the aliens begin, and the humans realize how vastly outmaneuvered and outnumbered they are. They are able to retreat with limited casualties, but Takaya has lost Smith, and gained an uncontrollable fear towards deep space combat. As their second battle approaches, Takaya is determined to improve and asks the Coach for private lessons. Jung finds out and thinking that she doing so to control Gunbuster, challenges her in space. But even before they are able to fight, Takaya breaks down within her suit and is taken to the infirmary.
The captain decides to retreat to Earth, but the fleet is attacked in sub-space, leading to the destruction of the majority of their forces. Once they reach Earth's orbit, only the Exelion and a few minor cruisers are still active. Though their struggle appears bleak, Takaya manages to summon up her strength for the sake of her friends and crew members. She takes control of the incomplete Gunbuster and uses its high-powered weaponry to force the enemy to retreat. The battle is over, but those who remain are faced with the harsh reality of war and its aftermath.
Afterwards, the three pilots return to Earth, where things have changed significantly. Due to the effects of time dilation, 10 years of relative time has passed on Earth while the pilots were in space. Takaya's former nemesis who had previously challenged her at school is now the coach for new pilots. Her best friend, Kimiko, is now a mother with a 3-year-old daughter, and Earth has been working on a 70 km long space ship as a form of defense in the event of a space monster attack.
While in a peaceful lull, Takaya and friends try to re-adjust to living in a world that has already passed them by. Takaya tries to reconnect with her friend, while Amano tries to share her feelings with the Coach. The peace is broken, however, when Earth is notified that a space monster fleet of unprecedented size is headed towards Earth. After many arguments, the idea of sending the old Exelion as an unmanned black hole bomb, is proposed. The Gunbuster is nominated to escort the bomb there, and then to come home.
Takaya and Amano, in separate ships which combine into Gunbuster, are sent out, a trip that will last an hour or more to them, but half a year to everyone back on Earth. As they almost reach their goal, Amano breaks down, admitting that she does not want go forward, since each second forward means the longer she is away from their Coach, who is now dying from space radiation. Takaya is able to convince her to continue, and their mission is a success. Upon returning, they are relieved to learn that the Coach is still alive; he and Amano then get married.
The final episode takes place 15 years later. Amano has lived on Earth during this time, but after the Coach passes away, she decides to take on a final mission. The space monsters have resurfaced, and in retaliation Earth has been building a much larger black hole bomb, which has been created using the mass of Jupiter pressured into the size of the moon.  Known as Buster Machine III, this weapon is the size of a small planet. When detonated, the bomb and 3,000 'slave mines' placed around the center of the galaxy, will cause a black hole to be formed thereby sucking in and destroying the space monsters.
Amano is sent back into space to board the new ship Eltreum, where mobile suits called Sizzlers (buster sized machines, piloted individually) are now used in combat. With the crew present to welcome Amano, she and Takaya share an emotional reunion, though the absence has felt much longer for the former. Takaya has difficulty coming to terms with the fact that so much time has passed on Earth, after only 6 months relative to her.
When the final battle begins, Amano is ordered to man the Gunbuster with Takaya, and both fight alongside others to defend the bomb. The alien army is fended off, allowing the black hole bomb to be set. However, when the time comes to activate, they find out the enemies' attacks have damaged 2% of the 'slave generators' required for implosion. Amano and Takaya decide to dive down into the core of Buster Machine III and activate it by using one of Gunbuster's two Degeneracy reactors, even though doing so means they will likely be unable to leave without suffering severe relativistic time dilation during their escape.
After the bomb is set off, Noriko and Kazumi spend 12,000 Earth years objective traveling home, although for them only hours or days have passed. Upon arriving in Earth orbit in the damaged Gunbuster, the pilots cannot make contact with anyone nor see any sign of habitation on the planet, suggesting that human civilization is long gone. However, their despair is instantly dispelled when a massive light pattern suddenly appears on the planet saying ""WELCOME HOMƎ!"" spelled out in simplified Japanese (""オカエリナサイ"". The final letter ""イ"", however, is reversed, which indicates the current civilization was mimicking the bygone language). Delighted that their planet is alive and well, the pilots bid the Gunbuster farewell and return to Earth.
","These short episodes came with the original videos and star Amano and Noriko as they educate the viewer on the science and history of their universe. Episodes are devoted to the science behind warping, the Space Monsters, and other topics with the average two minute running time utilized well. The scientific explanations can get surprisingly dense, but following them isn't exactly rewarding as some or all of what it says is going to be fictional. Still, the care that has gone into these explanations is admirable and makes the Gunbuster world more respectable. Hideaki Anno would go on to combine super robot and real robot concepts in Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
 
These shorts didn't make me like Gunbuster any more than I did before but they're worth a watch and have a few silly moments.

With no direction in his life, a Tengu appears that gives him a special potion. With this potion, he gains the strength of a hundred men - but he can only use it when he is helping others. After drinking the potion, Taro, day by day, begins to understand what it means to help others, first by fighting Akaoni (Red Oni) to save Aya, a young girl gifted with the flute, then by helping others in his village collect fire wood.
One night his grandmother tells him of his mother's transformation into a dragon. Taro then begins his search for his mother. Before his search for his mother starts, Taro again confronts Akaoni after hearing from the animals that Aya was captured by Kurooni (Black Oni). After a brief fight, Akaoni agrees to help Taro save Aya from Kurooni. After besting Kurooni, Taro finds out he has also saved a village terrorized by Kurooni and Akaoni, the latter bullied into the former's service.
Taro then aids Akaoni by throwing him into the clouds to serve the thunder god. After the village celebrates Taro's deeds, he starts his search. He comes upon an old woman and is tricked into service in her rice paddies. After a successful harvest year and learning the truth from a giant serpent living in the lake next to the old woman's rice farm, Taro takes the fruits of his labor and gives it to the old woman's former employees and others, leaving her with little.
During his conversation with the serpent, Taro learns that nine mountains over lives a yamanba that could point him in the right direction. Taro takes that information and finds the yamanba. The yamanba tells him what he seeks and lets slip she was responsible for the serpent. After narrowly escaping the yamanba, Taro is overpowered by yukionna.
The following morning, Aya finds Taro near frozen and able to revive him. With her aid, Taro finds the lake where his mother, Tatsu, now lives. Tatsu tells Taro why she was transformed; as a mother heavy with child fulfilling her duties to her unborn child, she needed to eat, but neglecting her duties to the rest of her village, she left nothing of her catch for the other workers.
Taro then proposes a means to make the lives of the villagers back home better, by making for them a new home with large rice paddies. Taro and Tatsu them attempt to break the dam that formed the lake Tatsu resides in. Although they succeed, Tatsu's body is broken, and after seeing the lake had emptied, Taro concluded she had died. Mourning the loss of his mother, Taro is relieved to see her life was returned and she is yet again human. Their actions are successful and the new flooded low lands enable prosperity for all the villagers Taro has helped, not only along his way but from his home village.
","This film was pretty interesting, if a bit odd... 
I don't know much at all about Japanese folklore, so I was probably missing something. I thought the art was quite pleasant; it reminded me a bit of ""The Last Unicorn."" The characters looked alright. I think Aya was cute, and the dragon looked cool. The little horse was adorable! The old woman in the woods was scary, though... 
 
As a person with minimal experience with Japanese folklore, I thought this movie was pretty good. At times, it really freaked me out...And some parts were a little awkward.....I'm glad he found a loincloth. 
 
This is definitely something I will show my future children.

          
 
       Helpful Unexpectedly good.  This is an adaptation of Japanese folklore, dating back to the hazy distant past of many hundreds (if not thousands) of years ago - when the people were much closer to nature and interacted with the local supernatural creatures.  A small impoverished village ekes out a living in the rocky mountains, so poor that they don't even know what rice is.  Taro is a lazy child that would rather play with the animals than help with chores, until he is given the strength of a hundred men by a wandering tengu - with the condition he can only use it to help others, not himself.   
   
His ailing grandmother informs him that his absent mother was actually turned into a dragon, and Taro goes on a quest to find his mother.  Along the way, he meets many other villagers, learns about growing and harvesting rice, and helps everyone along the way.   
   
As far as the plot goes, it's a fairly straightforward ""quest""/personal growth-type folklore tale.  The artwork (especially the backgrounds) is reminiscent of classic Japanese artwork styles, down to the stylized crashing waves, swirling clouds, and watercolor mountains.  Overall a nice little movie aimed at children but can be enjoyed by all ages.

Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko.  
A short, cramped, minimalistic tale compacted in a 5min OVA. 
A lovely, unique, emotion-packed tale expressed at its best in a 5min OVA. 
 
Everything always has two points of view. 
Every point of view has a different interpretation. 
The everyday life of the Girl and her Cat. 
The everyday life of Chobi -the Cat- and its owner.  
 
Shinkai builds this short movie -this long poem- with the same elements old-school cinema were made. Before all the advances in CGI and other technologies, when few scenes and no dialogue were needed in order to make children happy and adults believe in fantasy again.  
First the introduction scene, the introduction of the characters, then followed by a monologue of one character conducing the narrative as the scenes keep changing. With a calm and relaxed pace, a whole story is told within 4:57 minutes.  
The artwork reminds some nostalgic home-made productions from the times of the first portable cameras that were still black/white, however, you can notice it's perfectly drawn and detailed, as expected from Shinkai. This plus an endearing background music by Tenmon only confirms that the focus is the story itself, without other interferences nor distractions. 
 
Great books doesn't need tons of volumes to be good. 
It's often said that sequences ruin the movies. 
The same way, Shinkai doesn't need more than five minutes to tell a story. 
 
In a review, I'm supposed to present the series, do a little analysis but not spoil anything. When we're talking about an OVA like this one, I must be honest and say that I won't be filling lines that goes nowhere and will simply state: Watch it. It is worth it. 
No, I'm not being vague. 
If you watch it and don't get it, watch it again. 
If you do it and still don't get it, you're probably too young for Shinkai's movies. 
 
Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko is a piece of philosophy after all. Packed with antagonism and metaphors just like this review.

          
 
       Helpful “Other Worlds” and “She and her cat” are Makoto Shinkai’s first works and his starting points in the anime industry. In particular “Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko” (“She and her cat”) raise his popularity and made him reach first place in 12th DoGA CG-animation contest. 
This five minutes animation feature the relationship between a cat, Chobi and his owner, “She”. 
The story, told from the cat's perspective, cover a year of his life, from the moment of their encounter to the next spring. 
The beautiful writing of the short story let you enjoy every second of the five minutes. From the words of the cat you can understand his feelings and immerse yourself in his story. 
In five minutes is almost impossible to define strong characters, but in this case we have “She”, Chobi’s owner, that through the cat’s word gets described and it’s not easy to forget, even if her name is a mystery. In general Chobi and “She” aren’t anonymous character you actually come to care about them. 
Mimi (Chobi’s cat girlfriend) is only a side character that helps with the flow of the story and its emotional impact. 
Just on a side note I think that Shinkai’s weakness are the characters and I find funny that the characters in “She and her cat” are better that the ones in some of his other movies. 
The animations and CGs are beautiful in their simplicity, also the choice of using black and white helps to create the right mood for the story. 
The music is nice; this soundtrack is Tenmon’s first piece for an anime. 
In the end I will recommend the vision of this OVA to everyone, if you haven’t seen it go and watch it immediately it’s only five minutes and you will never regret seeing it. 
And only one final word: 
""This world, I think we like it.""

          
 
       Helpful She and Her Cat is told from the perspective of Chobi; a cat that was recently adopted by She, an unnamed girl. Chobi is quite a philosophical little cat but his observations don't go past of what a regular cat might think. He notes how the girl cries, but does not wonder why, only that She is perfect and must not be at fault. He notes that She leaves during the day, but does not wonder where, only that the scent of the outside world comes through the door each time. He just knows that they are together, and that's all that there needs to be. 
 
Being that there is no color in She and Her Cat adds to the OVA rather than ruins it. This could've happened because of the popular belief that cats see in black and white (they really see in color), but it really makes this 5 minute story stand out that much more. There are many freeze frames in the OVA, with the most animation coming from the background images, but this makes the story more involved and focused on and therefore it seems to fit the mood. 
 
As with the simple, but highly detailed animation comes the sound. Chobi's voice is constant in this OVA; he gives his side of his conversations and tells everything from a narrative point of view other times. There are a few other sounds such as sound effects, but the soft background songs in it are great and soothing. 
 
There are just three characters in this: Chobi, She, and Mimi, the cat that Chobi dates in the summer. The unamed girl She is shown as a lonely person who's only true friend in life is Chobi. While Mimi, on the other hand, is a cute kitten who wants to marry Chobi. Chobi disagrees; he thinks it is a false promise due to her just being a kitten and that he loves the more 'adult' woman instead.  
 
Overall, She and Her Cat was delightful. Very rarely can you tell a great story in just 5 minutes, but Makoto Shinkai pulled it off very well for being his first project. While maybe a little rushed, it was still a wholesome work of art. It's short, it's sweet (yet dark on some levels), and it has just a bit of innocence everyone needs once and awhile. And even if you think you won't like She and Her Cat, just try watching it once. 5 minutes is all you need.

","Overall/Enjoyment: 
I've seen much worse. Much, much worse. This was reasonably solid and had a fair mix of good and bad points. At 3 hours it's probably a little longer than necessary, and the transitions between leaps in time are a little awkward. Although some cheese is present, it never gets ridiculous enough to where you can't take it seriously. In fact, part of the reason I kept watching was because despite being fairly silly at times, it still presented itself in a manner that at least made an effort to tell a real story. 
 
Story: 
Not the most original of stories, naturally, but few seldom are. I always say it's more important how you tell a story than the particular story itself. A good writer can make even mundane everyday situations interesting. So to that effect, I'd say Doomed Megalopolis brings just enough intrigue with the introduction of plot elements, the development and progression of events, and the characters involved. There were a lot of confusing plot moments, like the ending, where something may get resolved, but you are left wondering, &quot;So what was the point of all that?&quot; 
 
Characters: 
The chars are somewhat interesting, at least there was a respectable balance between realistic and symbolic ones. Not sure any of them are really developed well enough to be particularly memorable, or at least, the more memorable ones are probably the least likable ones... 
 
Art: 
The art was fine. Typical of its time. Nothing really stood out to me as bad or ugly, however, there was more nudity than really needed. (To make whatever point one tries to make by including nudity that is...) Also, the main villain really looks A LOT like Bison from Street Fighter :p 
 
Sound: 
Mind you, the only version I have is the dubbed. This was probably my biggest problem with this DVD. I had my volume maxed at 100 just to be able to barely make out what the hell they were saying.

          
 
       Helpful Being that this OVA has only one other review I decided to write my first review on Teito Monogatari. Directed by Rintaro as you all know from Astro Boy and Metropolis, Doomed Megalopolis is an adaptation of a historical dark fantasy novel that was written by Hiroshi Aramata. While I have not read the novel I have done some research and found out that this OVA adaption is much darker in basically every aspect. This OVA is in a way incomplete since it was based on the first 4 books of the novel so be wary while watching because like Berserk (Anime) you'll have to find out what happens in the end by reading the original source. Since this OVA was created in 1991 do not expect too much. While at times it was ugly and hard to watch it also had some moments that really surprised me. The story itself had a lot of potential but the focus on a more sexualized and violent direction held it back from becoming something much better. It had a good back story but hardly any character development made it lose it's depth and otherwise complex symbolism. What I did enjoy however were the crossovers between Japanese history and the world that Hiroshi was trying to create in his novel. It goes to show that past events can be interpreted and displayed in a artistic manner without losing the viewers attention. I won't go into detail as to what these events are since I would be spoiling the story but if you want to watch something that is not only bloody but visually striking at times I suggest watching Teito Monogatari at least once. I give it a 6/10.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Samurai', 'Historical', 'Drama']",none,"Being a single episode anime obviously has its limits, and this anime was no exception to the rule. However, when compared the the other three anime in Anime Mirai 2013, I definitely feel that this one fell short.  
 
My biggest problem with this anime stemmed from the story itself. Personally, I felt it was very disjointed. Although I get that there was a large time skip in between scenes, it just seemed too abrupt and not as connected as it should. Another problem I had with the story is that I just didn't comprehend it as well as I think I should have. This probably stems from the fact that I know nothing about Japanese history, however, I believe this should have been put in mind when this anime was being created. There are many non-Japanese viewers, and I could barely follow the storyline.  
 
The characters were something else. There wasn't much characterization, and Ryo's character felt a bit flat to me. By the end of it, I felt short changed.  
 
Art and Sound were alright. This whole anime wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. It was simply mediocre.

          
 
       Helpful What the fuck? I mean, WHAT THE FUCK did I just watch? 
 
There is no story, the characters are incredible flat and lame, and any of them are memorizable, really, what the fuck.  
At the start we can see a flashback of Sakamoto Ryoma fighting this dude, Hijikata in a ship, so when I was watching I really was expecting that they get to that point... And what happens? IT FUCKING DISAPPEARS, Ryoma get killed and anyone knows what the fuck happen with the Ship fight scene. 
I have to admit that the fighting scenes are really well animated, but the problem is that there is like almost none fighting scenes. The OST was good for an anime in this samurai ambient. 
 
Overall (1/10). 
Really, really disappointed, they invest so much money for this thing? Serious shit compared with Little Witch Academia or Death Billiards. But I have to say that I really enjoy this anime, because it was so stupid that it makes me laugh, and some facepalms too.

          
 
       Helpful Ryo is one of the four anime from Anime Mirai 2013 (Young animator training project). 
I'm going ahead and say that this short is probably one of the worst of the Anime Mirai’s shorts, but lest start with the actual review. 
The story itself is a little strange and quite difficult to understand, from what I read and from the title the story should focus around a boy, who lost his parents, who is given the name Ryo by Ryoma Sakamoto. 
He then follows Sakamoto as his bodyguard during his journey to revolutionize Japan. 
As for what I saw the story put Ryo on the side and take Ryoma Sakamoto as the main character and managed to never explicitly tell what he did. 
After the first time I’ve watched Ryo I searched for Ryoma Sakamoto and read everything I could, then I’ve rewatched it and I have to say that I enjoyed it a little bit more than the first time. 
I see this anime as recap of a 13 episode series, if you watched the entire episode you have an idea of what is going on otherwise you can’t understand anything, and since the series doesn’t exist you are screw.  
The characters are practically non-existent, the “main character” Ryo does not have a personality after seeing the anime you know nothing about him. 
Ryoma Sakamoto and his wife really existed and I think they are portrait really nicely in the anime, there are some touches that made you recollect their actual life, and they are probably the only comedy elements in all of the anime. 
The only other character that I should mention is Ryo’s brother that is introduced in the start of the anime and then forgot until the end. 
The sounds are nice, the music is nothing spectacular but it is good, the only issue that I had was that, in some points, the voice of the character that was talking was covered by the background sounds, but I hope that that was a problem on my end and not on the anime itself. 
The animation is good but absolutely not on par with “Little Witch Academia” or “Death Billiard”, the backgrounds are particularly well done even if they don’t have a lot of details. 
Overall this is an average anime, it’s only one episode so you can probably watch it anyway, I strongly recommend reading about Ryoma Sakamoto before watching Ryo, and this should mitigate the negative aspects of the story.     
 
 On a side note I'm not really good when I have to write a review so if you have any advices feel free to contact me. I'm always open to criticism.

Ranze has yet to manifest her supernatural powers, and her parents are beginning to get worried she might be normal. So begins the fantasy romantic comedy story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Vampire']","15-year-old Ranze Eto lives in an isolated castle in Japan with her werewolf mother, vampire father, and younger brother, Rinze.  Despite her lineage, she has yet to demonstrate any special powers of her own, and her parents are worried she might be a normal girl.  One day, Ranze's innate power finally manifests itself when she, quite by accident, discovers that she can change herself into a carbon copy of any object she bites, whether it be a person or an inanimate object like a piece of bread, and can return to her normal self only by sneezing.  Her parents are overjoyed, but Ranze's new powers make it difficult to continue living life as a normal teenage girl.
On Ranze's first day at her new school in junior high, she meets and falls in love with the brash yet handsome young athlete, Shun Makabe. The chief problem with this is that Ranze's parents will not allow her to date a human - although there may be much more to Shun than meets the eye. On top of this, she also has a bitter rival in the pretty but spiteful Yoko Kamiya (the daughter of a yakuza boss) who also likes Shun and doesn't take kindly to Ranze's intruding on her turf.
","Tokimeki Tonight is not a well-known anime (which is why there are no reviews for it). It's fallen to the wayside since it finished airing 35 years ago. Is it fair or is there more to this series than what's on the surface? 
 
Story: 
If you ever wanted an anime version of the Addams Family with your typical shoujo clichés thrown in, this is the closest you're going to get.  
 
Due to the episodic nature of the series, don't expect any significant progress. Yes, even after the dramatic events of episodes 25 and 26, everything turns back to normal when the credits roll. Also, don't be surprised if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground. 
 
The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze's love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers. (More on that later!) 
 
Music: 
I was rather taken aback by the score on Tokimeki Tonight. The score was quite infectious, to the point that some of it played in my mind while I was trying to fall asleep. A special shout-out goes to the fighting music with the saxophone in it. 
 
Of course, the main draws are the OP and ED. I must admit, this is one of the few series where I liked the ED music more than the OP. However, both are quite catchy and memorable (in accordance with the law of 80s themes). 
 
Characters: 
While there's no character I like 100% of the time (outside of the shark in episode 32, which, trust me, makes sense in context), the main cast tends to be likable more often than not. 
 
However, there were some I couldn't bring myself to like, no matter how hard I tried. The rigidness of Ranze's mother made any scene she was in tough to digest. She wants Ranze to fall in love with a fellow monster and repeatedly tries to sabotage her romantic efforts with Makabe-kun. In fact, her rabid traditionalism even puts Ranze in danger in episode 13. 
 
Yoko, Ranze's rival in love, is a brat at best and downright treacherous at worst. However, I believe she was intentionally written to be unlikable. 
 
Recurring characters Sand and Prince Aaron are borderline predators and that ruined any enjoyment I could have had of them. 
 
Art: 
One of the most unusual aspects of Tokimeki Tonight is the background art. While the series presumably takes place in Japan, most of the signs are in English and the architecture has an old European flair to it. 
 
As for the rest of the art, it's par for the course for an anime made in the early 80s. There was obviously a limited budget, which explains why the coloring is often basic and there's a lack of detail in the character's faces (you'll notice several times throughout the show, characters are drawn without noses). I'm willing to let this fly, as the art isn't vomit-inducing and anime wasn't the most fruitful industry at the time. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Tokimeki Tonight is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's good. Some stories are entertaining, while others can be borderline snooze fests. Like most everything else with this series, my enjoyment was about abverage. 
 
Final thoughts: 
While not the worst anime I've seen (*cough* Blue Flames), it's understandable as to why this series fell to the wayside. It's a 7 at its best and it's a 3 at its worst. I honestly thought I would have more to see for this, but it's just-so average. It's an obvious 5. 
 
So, all in all, I give this series five glasses of tomato juice out of ten.

Halo Legends has 9 episode's, with different story's and characters, and almost all of them are well writing and with great story to keep you entertained. If your a Halo fan those nine story's will give you new insite and a new look on the Halo franchise and I'm sure for those who like Anime also will have some enjoyment in this small packaged. 
 
Halo has always been know'n for their beautiful soundtracks, and they return in Halo Legends, many of them redone and it makes you come more in to the story. While I have some complaiment with the artwork and sound, some of the episode could have gotten better animation then it did, although this didn't ruin all that much, they could have spent some more money and time on the animation so it feels more real then i did. 
 
 I'm sure all Halo fans like myself will enjoy this, and if never have played Halo or been so interested in Halo this is your chance to watch what some of the story in Halo is all about.

The interesting use of varying styles is brilliant as it changes what to expect for each episode. Overall the storys are great, not only beacuse of the brilliant writers but also because it has been said they follow Halo cannon and therfore ARE part of the Halo universe we all know and love. Hopefully the remaining episodes do continue this great series and keep it at it's current level, just have a few more weeks to wait till they all have aired (YAY Waypoint) though I must say the last episode is the one I'm looking forward to the most....what can I say I love parodies >_< all in all great start can't wait to see the rest!

Thus, this one is more or less pointless in the sense that it doesn't add anything to the ""story"" of AD. It fulfills the role of teaser quite well, though; most of the characters get introduced rather properly, and you get a good taste of what the series is all about. 
 
The animation is better than the real series, even though I think they focused a bit too much on making the girls beautiful or even sexy. That is not what Azumanga Daioh is about, if you ask me.  
 
The ""happi hen"" song in the end is gorgeous, but a better take exists on the soundtrack CD.  
 
Since it is only five minutes long, you could as well watch this, you might actually like seeing the wierd girls look good for a change. Just don't expect anything new.

          
 
       Helpful ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is essentially a flashy, spiced-up episode of Azumanga Daioh.  
 
With a run-time of about six minutes, the show summarizes the original plot of the 26-episode Azumanga series, and it does so pretty well by combining many of the show's jokes, character interactions, plots, and themes in a way that doesn't feel forced or ham-handed. This show is pretty good in that regard.  
 
The story is a typical scene from any random Azu episode. It takes place in Miss Yukari's class-room, and features the main girls doing their usual thing. The plot has many twists, even for such a short show. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've watched/read Azumanga, it will be very familiar. 
 
The art is especially notable and good. It is much better than the original 26-ep. Azumanga, but this is not to say Azumanga doesn't have good art to begin with. But in the movie, the art is even better. Perhaps to stick to the idea of a ""movie,"" the art seems to have had more time, effort, and money put into it. The character's animations are smoother, the colors brighter and more vibrant, the lines sharper. it is a good look for Azumanga, and I like it. 
 
The sound is good, but in my opinion it is no better (or worse) than Azumanga 1-26. It is clear and understandable. As for the Japanese AND English voice-actors, they are the same as those who voiced Azu 1-26.  
 
The characters are quirky, unique, and each one funny in their own special way. Their actions and antics are similar to Azumanga 1-26. Those who've seen the original series will not feel alienated. The old characters are still themselves.  
 
The Azumanga movie is just as enjoyable as a regular episode of Azu, but it is unfortnately quite short. Just when you are getting into it, it ends. Yet, the show is quite enjoyble, and fun, for veteran Azu fans or newcomers to the Azumanga or even anime world. 
 
Overall, ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is a good watch that I certainly recommened, either as a compliment to Azumanga Daioh 1-26 or a stand-alone watch. But if you watch this short movie before Azumanga 1-26, some of the jokes may confuse you, as the show assumes you've already watched Azu 1-26. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the second short pilot film that JC Staff released, this one a lot closer(but still not quite matching) the animation style and budget of the TV release.  It’s a bit longer than Web Daioh, and while it’s not quite as funny, it does put forth a more accurate representation of what the series would eventually be.  Rather than a traditional intro, like Web Daioh had, this film opens with a shot of Chiyo riding on her dog, Mr. Tadakichi, introducing herself and nearly getting thrown off of him.  The opening features some of the show’s iconic background music, which is always nice. 
 
Splitting it into two halves, the first half is probably the weaker one.  It features a couple of minutes of Yukari’s class, squeezing several of the running gags and staples of the series into two minutes.  This includes Yukari being a dick, Chiyo getting good grades, the Bonklers(which I’ll always call them because it sounds better than knuckleheads) acting out, Chiyo trying not to be cute, Tomo standing outside, Kaorin being in love, Sakaki musing over a cat bite, and keep in mind, thisall takes place in the span of two minutes...  Including the opening.   
 
The second half, in contrast, plays out one joke on it’s own...  Osaka and her pigtail dreams.  If you’ve seen the anime or read the manga, you know what I’m talking about, and this goes on for almost 3 minutes.  Unlike the first half, this one doesn’t stick to the established material, instead taking full advantage of the surreal situation to try some new jokes, like Chiyo slowly turning her head like an owl(creepy) and the entire class thinking she’s a lost child that doesn’t belong there.  I’m not going to give away how this part ends, you kind of just have to experience it for yourselves.  It’s weird. 
 
The short ends with a thirty second credits, marking the second appearance of Chiyodaddy, and if i’m being honest, I don’t feel as though this one’s as strong as Web Daioh.  It suffers in terms of pacing, with so many jokes and in-show references thrown at you in such a short time that it’s hard to process what you’re watching.  The Osaka dream is at least new and interesting, especially the way it breaks away from the script.   
 
There’s actual music in it, which I definitely like, especially since upon reflection, this is the pilot for the show’s iconic score, too.  The dub is phenomenal, and the actors are on point...  Save for Mandy Clark and Nancy Novotny, big surprise there...  But I’d especially like to give a shout out to Jessica Boone and Kira Vincent Davis, as they play the most prominent characters in the short and absolutely slaughter their roles.   
 
All in all, not quite as good as Web Daioh, in terms of story, but a small improvement in the area of production values.  I give it a 7/10.

","Critic’s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #79: The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya. 
 
Let’s Go! 
 
This is about A comical spin-off of the popular ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" anime series that originally aired back in 2006 involving all the major characters in more child-like forms of their animated selves going through various spoofs of previous plot line; like Nagato and the dreaded laptop with a twist. face offs with the rack of costumes that were stuffed in the corner of the club room. and dodge ball tournaments on a sugar rush. 
 
Yeah, it’s a random spin-off. and this spin-off is awesome. Well, for the most part. During the first 4 episodes, there was some CGI animation, but afterwards… Kyoto Animation went back to the 2D Animation while staying true to the chibi designs that distinguishes the Main series of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi-chan is a Kyoto Animation production. It is indeed a spinoff of the series and this is not a TV anime, it is a web series. As far as web series go, the animation is quite good and for it being made in the same year as another web anime known as Hetalia. Haruhi-chan does look impressive for being an Original Net Anime, assuming ONA’s have lower budgets than TV Anime and OVA’s. Despite the first 4 episodes being CGI-animated, it looks great. 
 
The music compliments the spin-off and I don’t have much to say about it since it’s not heavily important in this spin-off 
 
Like the series, The Japanese cast and English Dub cast do not disappoint and both casts do step it up by making the comedy work. I already said enough about both casts when I reviewed the series. 
 
When it comes to characters, everyone is in chibi form and this helps to differentiate from the main series. Since this is a spin-off, I can tell you that you may want to give character development a pass since this is a spinoff that puts heavy emphasis on humor and laughs. Everyone is over the top and even Yuki Nagato is funny in this one. If you liked the characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. Chances are, you’ll like this spin-off just as much. 
 
If you got an hour and a half, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya does not disappoint as a spinoff. It’s just as fun as the main series but it is more funnier than the main series. Like the series, this is a great one to watch with classmates if you are in high school or college. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was released alongside Nyoron Churuya-san, but unfortunately it is out of print. 
 
With all that said, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya is a fun spinoff to the popular Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. The animation is good for an ONA, character development and plot get a pass, but it is a fun series because of how funny it is. It is an awesome spinoff. 
 
I give The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya an 8.9 out of 10. it is VERY GOOD! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment and join the club.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, seeing as how TMoHS is my absolute favorite anime of all time, this review will be extremely biased and may not be helpful at all. That being said here is my review: 
TMoHCS is basically a completely non-cannon and chibi version of TMoHS that is basically a little short-series consisting of about 3-5 minute episodes of hilarity. 
TMoHCS was heavily enjoyable for big fans of the series but would probably be mediocre with a couple of big laughs here and there for people who didn't like TMoHS or aren't fans of the series. This is pretty much just for when you're bored and would like to watch something slightly different. 
I enjoyed this heavily because I love the characters from TMoHS and this is really just a filler while I waited for the third season of TMoHS to come out. 
Hope I helped and I hope you enjoy the show!

          
 
       Helpful Okay, the only reason that I'm still a Haruhi fan is for two reasons: 1) the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2006 and 2) this ONA. ^^ 
 
The original idea of The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya came from a parody comic series that pretty much subtly made fun of the original anime. And, I'm not usually one for these kinds of parodies, but I just couldn't resist~! ^^ Also, I love how evil Yuki is shown to be in the series... *devious grin* Not to mention that random lion that was thrown into the mix as well... ^^;;;; 
 
The art... Well, let's just say that it's very rare to see chibis still keep their proper anatomy and such in tact. This, is a good thing. Haruhi-chan Suzumiya has managed to pull this off quite well. But, then again, we are talking about Kyoto Animation. Also, the first couple of episodes were done with 3D generated cell-shaded characters. After the first four or five episodes (give or take), though, they resumed to 2D traditional cell-shaded characters. 
 
The sound was, unbelievably, astounding. Usually, I'd get annoyed with Mikuru's voice, but the situations that the story showed made it so that it was actually quite enjoyable~! 
 
Characters seemed to be put on a more comedic spin. But, you do have to realize that this is a parody series that focuses on some points on the original series and pretty much spends about 2-5 minutes making fun of it. But, because they focused so much on the comedic side of things, there wasn't any real development in character. But, that's a given when you're watching a series of parodizing shorts on one of the Anime Industry's largest franchises. 
 
The enjoyment was DEFINATELY 10/10~! Not only did it have the element of satiric comedy, but it also had some... risque-ness into it as well. (is that even a word??) Such as the ""wall between hearts."" (Or, something like that.) Also, there was some awesome ass-kicking in a few episodes. ^^ 
 
Overall, it's not a story and plot-driven anime. It's not exactly focused on character development, either. No, it's merely a satire that makes fun of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, and personally, I think that they've done a swell job~! 
 
I give ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya"" a grand total score of 9/10!

Sou'unga a magical sword that has been sealed away for 700 years is found. Now everyone is after the sword and its powers but it seems the sword has something else in mind. 
 
(Source: ANN) 
","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","Two centuries ago, the great dog-demon Tōga denies his elder son Sesshomaru's request for ownership of two of his swords, Tessaiga and So'unga. Afterwards, Tōga heads to a mansion guarded by an army of samurai where his human wife, Lady Izayoi, is giving birth. The army's leader, Takemaru of Setsuna, who is in love with Izayoi, attempts to kill her by stabbing her and setting the mansion aflame. Tōga defeats the army and cuts off one of Takemaru's arms to enter the mansion, and uses his third sword, Tenseiga, to revive Izayoi. Tōga forces her to flee the burning mansion with their newborn, whom he names Inuyasha, then fights Takemaru. At a safe distance, Izayoi witness the mansion collapses on both men and Toga's spirit wishes her to live a long life with Inuyasha.
In the present day, Inuyasha travels through the Bone-Eater's Well from the Feudal era to visit Kagome Higurashi in the modern era. Unbeknownst to them, Kagome's family uncover an ancient sword as part of their shrine's treasures, which turns out to be So'unga. The spirit of So'unga's sheath, Saya, emerges before the sword finds its way to Inuyasha and Kagome. Saya tells Inuyasha that he must master the sword before it can destroy the modern world, but once he holds it, it possesses his arm and reverts him to his demon form, forcing him to return to the Feudal era. Inuyasha's friends, monk Miroku, demon slayer Sango, fox demon Shippo, and Sango's nekomata companion Kirara attempt to stop him, only to escape once Inuyasha uses the sword's deadly Dragon Twister attack. Kagome takes Saya with her to the Feudal era and reunites with everyone including Inuyasha's mentor Myoga, who knows Saya. They are eventually accompanied by blacksmith Totosai, the creator of Tōga's swords.
The possessed Inuyasha runs into his older brother, Sesshomaru, who battles Inuyasha for having taken up So’unga. So’unga orders Inuyasha to attack Sesshomaru's company, Jaken and Rin, until Kagome intervenes and uses the Beads of Subjugation necklace command on Inuyasha to release him from So’unga's possession. After So’unga flies off to find a new host, Sesshomaru leaves Jaken and Rin behind, while Inuyasha leaves an unconscious Kagome with them, vowing to destroy So’unga himself. After being joined by her friends, Totosai reveals that So’unga is possessed by an ancient evil demon, following its sealing since there were no instructions given by Tōga as to what to do with it following his death. Meanwhile, So’unga retrieves Sesshomaru’s severed arm from the past and revives Takemaru, who, equipped with the sword and a new body, vows revenge on Tōga by killing his sons. Takemaru takes over a nearby castle and slays its army, resurrecting the approximately two-thousand soldiers as an army of the undead, as well as opening a portal to the netherworld.
Kagome and the rest of the group, including Jaken and Rin, join Inuyasha and Sesshomaru in a battle against Takemaru’s army. Despite inflicting heavy casualties on the soldiers, Miroku uses his Wind Tunnel to eliminate the rest. Kagome informs Inuyasha that, according to Totosai, the only way to defeat Takemaru and So’unga is to combine the forces of Tessaiga's Backlash Wave and the Dragon Strike of Sesshomaru's Tōkijin; Inuyasha initially refuses, noting that he and Sesshomaru could never fight side-by-side. Inuyasha kills Takemaru, forcing So’unga to form a physical body of its own. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru continuously fail to destroy Takemaru individually; the brothers eventually give in and use the powers of their swords to destroy So’unga's body and send the sword into the netherworld. Tōga’s spirit appears, remarking that he's proud of his sons before the portal to the netherworld closes. Sesshomaru departs with Jaken and Rin as Inuyasha and his allies look over the surrounding environment turning back to normal.
","I think this movie did a nice job of adding to the pasts of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru while also providing some solid action. 
 
Adding a third sword was a nice way of dragging the brothers into the same conflict. Besides it also helped to show how the two felt about their father. It did a nice job with Sesshomaru and the kind of relationship he had with his father. Also shows the change from a guy who didn't see the need to have something to protect to someone who would jump in to save Rin when in danger.The story really was about those brothers. In that they did a good job. 
 
The battles were well done. Made good use of the abilities of Tetsusaiga and Tokijin. Whether it was the final battle or the skirmishes between the brothers it all looked great.  
 
The music as always is great with Inuyasha. Whether it's the fighting scenes or simply a conversation the music really adds to the atmosphere. Love adding the staples of the series like when Miroku uses his wind tunnel.  
 
Overall I think this is a good movie if you like the rivalry between Inuyasha and Sesshomaru. Heck it's a good movie if you like Sesshomaru since this is the most focus he gets in any of the Inuyasha movies. You may wonder about some of the explanations given, but considering these are movies they can be glossed over. The important thing is that this is an entertaining movie and one that should definitely be checked out.

          
 
       Helpful I have not seen Inuyasha in forever and do not remember the story, characters, or anything about it, but one day I stumbled upon a copy of this movie. It's as if something wanted me to remember the days of watching Inuyasha on TV. 
 
Story (7/10): 
The story was a bit corny and cliche (well, at first), yet had a certain charm to it that kept me watching. What I really liked was how this kept me up to date on the main story as of yet while still incorporating a movie worthy plot. 
 
Art (8/10): 
For the time, it was great art. For this time period, it's good art. Plain, has somewhat dark colors, but fluent and simple (in a good way). 
 
Sound (6/10): 
The soundtracks were nothing to dwell upon, but the english and japanese voice acting were as charming as the... 
 
Characters (8/10): 
How nice. Several characters are given backstories that may or may not have been mentioned in the main story (I don't remember). Even in the movie, they continue to develop. 
 
Enjoyment (9/10): 
I enjoyed it to the very end. It made me want to watch Inuyasha again, which I believe to be one reason for the creation of the movie. 
 
Overall (8/10): 
This deserves a watch weather you know the main story by heart or have forgotten the glory days, as I. You can tell the staff worked hard to make this an enjoyable experience, and fun for all ages. Gah! The cliche is contagious. Can't believe I said that.

          
 
       Helpful Much better than the previous movies and in my opinion, better than the show. Unlike the show which has them fighting a new demon every single episode, this movie has a real plot that isn't predictable and you won't get bored of it. 
 
In the beginning we get to see a flashback of Inuyasha when he was born and being protected by his father, a moment that we’ve never actually seen in the show. 
 
Basically the story has Inuyasha taking hold of his father’s old sword called “Sounga” (really a bastard of a sword that only seeks blood and destruction) and the sword possesses him. One of the greatest parts in my opinion is that Inuyasha fights so hard against the sword to not hurt the humans or his friends, which really shows his will to protect them.  
 
We know from previous experiences that Inuyasha can be a real jerk sometimes to people in general, but this movie somehow shows a side of Inuyasha that we don’t always see. 
 
Rather than a fight for the jewel shards it becomes a fight between Inuyasha, his brother, and his father’s power. Definitely an action-packed movie that you have to see!

14,1141,143,6.580469862,"Moving story, featuring mutual understanding between parents and children",Palme no Ki,"Palme is a puppet created by a man to care for his sickly wife. After her death Palme becomes paralyzed with sorrow, that is, until a woman being pursed happens to cross paths with Palme and his creator and ask them to deliver something precious to a sacred place called Tama. Palme, mistaking her for his masters late wife, accepts the request. This becomes his first step to becoming more human in order to understand his own feelings.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","A Tree of Palme can be seen as a distant allusion of the 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It concerns a small puppet, Palme, who was tasked by his creator to look over his ailing wife, Xian. After her death, Palme is visited by a mysterious woman whom he mistakenly believes to be Xian. Shaken out of his sadness, Palme accepts her request to deliver something special to a far-off place known as Tama. This sets Palme off on a journey to discover his own emotions, and what it truly means to be human.
","A Tree of Palme is a complicated anime that should really be viewed as ""Part One"" and ""Part Two"". With that in mind, I will be reviewing the movie not as a whole, but as two separate parts. 
 
""Part One"" of the film starts off slow, and really spends time on the atmosphere. The film feels like a trippy 70's poster, with creative backgrounds and creatures. Palme starts off the story as a silent puppet, constantly breaking. He's thrown into a confusing setting, with lots of energetic characters and action. I found it enjoyable how out-of-place hes character is and his inability to understand others.  
 
There's some action, and a lot of running away from some guys who are after Palme's oil, which all seems simple and enjoyable. Unfortunately, that all goes away after Palme has a existential crisis. 
 
""Part Two"" of the film is very different. It's fast, has inconsistent characters and a really overly complicated plot is slapped on. Palme get more character development and unfortunately it's terrible. It's lazy, half developed and he changes at the blink of an eye to keep the plot moving. The film hits a really slow pace about 3/4 into the film, which made me even question finishing the film. 
 
The first part of this film is quite enjoyable to watch. It gave me a similar feeling to ""Angel's Egg"" but the film finished feeling like a poor scifi action film. I would recommend watching it only for the beautiful background and designs. 

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the most underrated anime movies in all history. 
One of unique kind. If you are expecting some nice story with happy ending just stop reading this. 
It's one genre that stands out of all of the rest, it's Dystopian Sci-Fi anime. If you've watched Now and Then, Here and There or Gin'iro no Kami no Agito or Green Legend Ran or even Ergo Proxy and liked them, then you will definitely like this one, it's just plain brilliant, unique and unforgattable. I won't start explaining the story that mostly is so unique that you can't fully understand it without throughout thinking about it. It touches many aspects of human psychology like despair, fear, wanting to be acknowledged by people you love. It's brilliant story of puppet wanting become human. It's one of the greatest works of Takashi Nakamura, the genius who created Fantastic Children, one of the most greatest anime ever created. This movie is his another brilliant work that most people haven't seen or even heard of. The ending is so touching that you won't forget it for the rest of your life, and the ending music ""Sora no Aosa"" by Akino Arai just finishes the most brilliant artistic touch. Just watch it you won't regret it!

          
 
       Helpful This film was bizarre.  From character and setting to the story itself, it was downright strange.  The story is basically that of Pinoccio, but quickly dispel the Disney images from your mind.  This is the story of an emotionally disturbed puppet with a sever lack of empathy who is posessed by an equally emotionally disturbed amazoness who wants to become a real boy.  And while that might sound interesting, trust me, it isn't.  The ending impression is a feeling of 'what did I just witness' and 'I'm glad I didn't actually pay money to see that/I hope I can get a refund.'   
 
The imagery is stunning, and gorgeous, such as Palm and Popo in a canoo on a river filled with glowing lotus.  The setting was reallly beautiful.  However, that juxtaposed with a dying woman being attacked by what honestly look like giant phalac symbols is just plain strange and jarring, like watching a Dali Painting in motion.  Characters are also designed to look childish, which seems at odds with the dark story. 
 
The characters, overall, are an uninteresting bunch.  Two of the main group seem to be there to look cute but serve no real purpose to the plot or development of other characters.  Popo, the main heroine simply seems to be the world's whipping girl with no backbone.  Palme is manic and seemingl has some kind of bipolar disorder coupled with a serious empathy problem, even going so far as killing something because he feels like it and is curious and practically kidnaps and hurts Popo, who he claims to love.  Shaka, who becomes Palme's sidekick and son of one of the antagonists seems to be the most able bodied, mentally stable and interesting character but takes the back seat to our bipolar puppet friend.   
 
The story itself is straightforward.  The puppet wants to be a real boy and has to go on a journey to do so.  However, the plot advances very slowly leaving the audience to watch Palme's psychotic episodes, watch Popo be abused, and be subjected to trippy imagery.  With such a straightforward plot, one might have thought either the story could have been wrapped up sooner, or a little more effort could have been placed on characters.  It also becomes more complicated than it really needs to be.  Just when you think you have a grasp on Palme's psyche, or where the story is headed, it suddenly takes an unexplained, unnecessary manic change.  What really should have been a fairly simple story was taken too far, filled with unnecessary or two dimensional characters and filled with more disturbed disorders and surrealist imagery than you can shake a stick at.  It's completely disorienting.   
 
This is certainly not a children's movie!  If my descriptions of weird creatures shaped like male anatomy and psychotic puppets and violence were not enough to explain this, I'm not sure what will.   
 
Sound and imagery are beautiful though.  If anyone is interested in surealism or revisionist fairy tales, I would reccomend this, however for the general viewer it is simply trippy, boring and confusing to watch.  It is overall a disorienting experience and a waste of two otherwise productive hours.

With the two combined, Akari ends up becoming involved in a new world where she can use magic and attend an academy with new classmates and friends (humans and jewelpets alike) who all strongly wish to win the Jewel Star Grand Prix and achieve their own personal dreams. At the same time she must fight back with the magic she learns with Ruby against all the supernatural disasters that occur in that world. 
 
I absolutely love this setting because the different trials that Akari must go through definitely sends out the most meaningful messages. It begins with a difficult start with a lot of comedic moments, but slowly delves into the deep side of the story and including moments that made me shed tears countless times. Although the ages of these characters make them barely 12, it makes a beautiful coming-of-age anime.  
 
Art 7/10 
There isn't anything bad to say about the art. It's simply adorable, consistent, and worth watching for.  
 
Sound 4/10  
So Jewelpet Twinkle is not that strong in terms of music. They have the same opening and ending through all 52 episodes but they are definitely catchy.  
 
Character 10/10  
For an anime where the main purpose is to show the difficulties of growing up and changing, this anime does a splendid job. I am not exaggerating, Akari's development is the best I have ever seen in any anime (actually it is one of two of my favourites, the other being Yona). Not only Akari, but the other children in her magic class also have their time to shine and the way that they help each other out is nice to watch.  
 
But the true MVP of all the characters are definitely the jewelpets. Since they are the human's partner, they become the main guiding force that helps the characters become who they are in the end. Not that they know everything of course, but by simply being there as a friend and supporter, it made a pretty good difference. Its especially funny when the characters have to learn the hard way not to take the easy way out (Miria time travelling to prevent her mother from being famous or Akari trying to duplicate real life money using magic so she can get her mother a birthday present).  
 
Not only does she end up having to solve problems from within the academy, but also outside of it. 
 
Edit: I forgot to add in the most crucial point that makes the characters such an important element to the story. As seen in the anime description, there is romance in this story. Yes, romance. Despite it being a little kid's magical girl anime there is satisfying development towards this aspect of the story. And it doesn't stop there, Akari and the other girls who have their own problems dealing with family and people in general teaches a valuable lesson that starts off as a small problem, but soon becomes a real life challenge. Not to mention there is a satisfying lack of plot holes (or rather none that I can think of).  
 
Enjoyment 8/10  
The part I love most about this series is the way Akari and the rest grow as people and eventually succeed at things they thought they would need magic to do. I finished the story thinking ""it was so inspiring to see Akari do X and X despite how she was at the start"" rather than the usual ""they forgot to consider the X and X themes/plot elements which they started but never concluded... like always"".  
So yeah, there's no bait. That's mainly why its good. 
 
Overall 9/10  
An anime that starts off extremely childish eventually becomes the most mature magical girls I've come across. I actually think that with time, anyone of all ages could enjoy this.  


          
 
       Helpful I've never write a review before, but there isn't any review here, so i'll write something.  
 
This series is definitely not childish like most people think so.  
If you like magical-girl theme or innocent anime, please give it a try! I really recommend it.  
I like this series because of the characters (different characters from season 1), they are created by the designer of Nanatsuiro Drop.  
I really enjoy this series. Some day i will rewatch it. 

          
 
       Helpful Jewelpet tinkle is the two installment of the anime series Jewelpet, which is one of the prominent franchise of Sanrio. As you may expect, the story of tinkle has involved numerous cliches and overused tropes which I won't discuss here due to the rule that spoilers are disallowed, and it cannot escape the fact that it had bad opening episodes. However, if you can be patient enough to sit through the first 23 episode you would find the reason this season is way more popular than the other seasons. First, the character of this season is definitely fleshed out decently, the story managed to flow properly, and although the premise and story are still contained a ridiculous amount of cliches, those cliches were used in an acceptable way and much better than its previous (an Onegai my Melody ripoff) and succeeding seasons (nonsensical premises, chaotic story and inadequate character development).  
Overall, the 1st (some parts are omitted) and this season of Jewelpet is the ones that I managed to finish. It is an overall enjoyable series who wants a normal magical-school girl romance.

","(This is my first review and i'm not english, so i'm sorry for my language) 
I will be clear : this is not a bad series. It isn't a cosmic rip off like many others anime but this is not either a good anime. 
First the story is fair, the world is quite intriguing but this is clearly not a revolution. The scenario is really slow, some episode are the same quality level as a filler episode in Naruto. This is unequal and sometime totally useless to the advancement of the story. 
For the art, this is classic. Too classic... The animation is really static, and the background is cheap. 
The sound is one of the real problem. The voice acting is slovenly, some characters like Shuu don't act, they just read a text. And there is no english or french version, so we are convicted to ear one of the worst dubbing of history. And for the music, it's decent but there is only 15 tracks different, and we ear some of them every episode. The track "" One of the Few"" is exasperating ! There is only two tracks who are more than decent : ""Resource"" & ""Brick in the wall"". 
The characters are like the story : too classic. And this is really difficult to be concerned by there action. May, Ein & Zero are clearly the best characters because there are well develloped. Xuan (maybe not his name in the english traductionl) is my favourite characters but, like Rosso, she's not really useful. Rosso & Xuan maybe deserve a better devellopment. Fear is a great deception, because she is the best character and his devellopment is totally stopped in the middle of the anime. Shuu is basically a clone of Shinji in NG Evangelion, but in more weak. The story don't progress because of him. And finally, Dolly is insupportable. He is a sort of comic relief and you will probably want to punch your TV evrey time he is here. 
To finish, the biggest problem of this anime is that it's not pleasant to watch. When I watched it, I was bored and I look at my timeline everytime because this is tedious. And this is why I can't recommend this serie to everybody. This is too classic for an anime, a distopian story, a travel story or whatever. Clearly, only the more motivated people will continue to watch this after the fifth episode.

Unbeknownst to him, Al's next-door neighbor, Christina, is the test pilot of a prototype Gundam being developed in secret by the Earth Federation in the colony. A Zeon Special Forces team is assembled and tasked with infiltrating the colony in order to either steal or destroy it. 
 
When a skirmish breaks out between the Federation and infiltrating Zeon forces, the fascinated Alfred stumbles upon a Zaku mobile suit that has been shot down, piloted by Zeon rookie Bernard ""Bernie"" Wiseman. After this encounter, the two start a mutual friendship, so Alfred can learn more about the war that interests him so much, and Bernie can acquire inside information about the colony to aid his team's mission. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Drama', 'Mecha']","Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket is a side story to the main Gundam franchise continuity. The Gundam series is set in a fictional calendar era known as ""Universal Century"" and it establishes that there is a so-called ""One Year War"" between the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon—the setting for the original series—, and War in the Pocket is set in the last days of the war.In Universal Century 0079, Zeon intelligence has identified a prototype Federation Gundam under development in a Federation base in the Arctic. Elite Zeon MS commandos are dispatched to destroy the prototype, but before they can accomplish their mission the Gundam is launched into space. When the Gundam turns up in a Federation R&D base inside the neutral space colony Side 6, the Principality launches a covert operation to destroy the Gundam utilizing the commando team originally dispatched to assault the Arctic base, including young rookie Bernard ""Bernie"" Wiseman. However, the raid fails and the entire team is killed except for Bernie.
After crashing his mobile suit, Bernie manages to befriend Alfred ""Al"" Izuruha, an elementary school boy enamored with a romantic vision of warfare and excited by Bernie's status as a mobile suit pilot regardless of his allegiance, and Al's neighbor Christina ""Chris"" Mackenzie, secretly the Gundam test pilot. As Bernie tries to repair his damaged mobile suit while hiding out within the station, he develops a close friendship with Al and slowly becomes infatuated with Chris, both pilots remaining unaware of each other's true natures.
As time passes, Bernie discovers that Zeon will destroy Side 6 with a nuclear weapon if he cannot destroy the prototype Gundam. Feeling that he has no choice if the station is to be saved, Bernie takes his mobile suit and goes to engage the Gundam. Believing Side 6 to be under Zeon attack, Chris is ordered to pilot the Gundam in the station's defense, and she and Bernie engage in a destructive battle within the station. Al discovers that the Zeon ship carrying the nuclear weapons was captured, meaning Bernie has no more reason to fight. Alfred goes to try and stop Bernard, only to see Bernie's mobile suit destroyed and an injured Christina pulled from the heavily damaged Gundam, which leaves Al horrified.
Afterwards, Chris tells Al that she will be leaving Side 6, and asks Alfred to say goodbye to Bernard for her, still unaware that she had actually killed him. Al does not have the heart to tell her the truth and agrees to her request. The series closes with Al's school holding an assembly in which the principal talks about the effects of war. Al, remembering his time with Bernie, begins to weep uncontrollably during the speech. Al's friends, misunderstanding his grief, try to reassure him that another ""cool"" war is bound to happen soon.
","War in the Pocket is a stellar example of how revolutionizing a time-tested mecha franchise can bring about positive results. Preferring to avoid genre tropes such as angsty teenage pilots and testosterone-fueled robot brawls, this six-episode OVA chronicles a mature tale akin to celebrated war dramas. It’s the first Gundam series not directed by the legendary Yoshiyuki Tomino, but by no means does that make it inferior. In fact, War in the Pocket is easily the best entry in the saga until today. 
 
While most Gundam stories revolve around a brash teenage pilot, War in the Pocket opts for something completely different by having an eleven-year-old—a civilian—as its lead character. At first, Al hardly seems to be a good choice for a Gundam protagonist. Here we have a schoolboy who loves playing war games with his buddies and nothing else. Lacking the combat prowess and flair of the franchise's previous heroes, Al appears to be a dismissible individual in the beginning. With conflicts between the Federation and the Zeon occurring everywhere and Al not fighting in even a single battle, the story seems to be doomed to an uninteresting direction.  
 
But when Zeon forces raid his homeland on a secret mission, Al’s daring personality begins to shine as he observes the skirmishes unfazed. Instead of highlighting the mecha battles, the story remains focused on Al as he navigates through the wreckages of his city and observes the bloody corpses strewn across the streets. Because Al is still an innocent child, however, he does not realize the severity of the situation, and so proceeds to investigate the aftermath of the invasion while skirting dangerously close to the conflict. Ironically, by having a child like Al as a narrator, we are able to survey the destruction even better than through the perspective of a soldier directly involved in the war. 
 
War in the Pocket dives into its action quickly, but it’s not until Al’s fated meeting with Bernie that the ball starts rolling. After Al encounters the downed Zeon pilot, a fleeting moment of tension occurs before his bravery once again comes into play. Ignoring the gun pointed at him, Al surprises Bernie with a declaration to join his squad. This scene seems comically exaggerated at first, but it makes sense when you realize the lengths Al would go to partake in the war. From Al’s juvenile outlook, Bernie is not an enemy, but an opportunity to lead him to a new path. 
 
Bernie is a likable character and most likely the fan favorite. Although a member of the elite Zeon team that invaded Al’s homeland, his inexperience and tendency to panic clearly identifies him as a rookie. Think of him as a foil to Al. Since everyone else in his squad are gruff, battle-seasoned men, he is merely viewed as a tag-along brat who simply wants recognition. Bernie’s relationship with his comrades only worsens after allowing Al to become an informant for their squad, which is rather humorous considering that Al is the son of a late Federation official.  
 
Not everything is bad for our unlucky Zeon pilot, however, as Bernie finds unforeseen love in the form of Christie, a Federation soldier and Al’s longtime neighbor. Making this situation even more fascinating is that neither are aware of the other’s allegiance, introducing a twist to the usual “star-crossed lovers” scenario. United by love rather than ideology, Bernie and Christie share moments that serve as respites in the middle of all the violence. If not for their military expertise, Bernie and Christie could pass as a regular teenage couple. Despite taking a backseat in the second half for more pressing matters, the romance in War in the Pocket is genuinely heartfelt. The blossoming relationship between the two echoes War in the Pocket’s strongest anti-war message, where politics and beliefs are what mainly separate us as human beings. 
 
Ultimately, War in the Pocket is a story about Al and Bernie as they improve themselves by learning from each other. As the Zeon team's secret mission reaches its climax, Al realizes that war is nothing alike to the games he plays with his friends. His decision to join Bernie and his crew as an informant allows him to comprehend the bloodshed and aftermath of the war. Likewise, Bernie attempts to become more confident and serious in his duties by following the example of the fearless Al. Even Bernie’s squadmates, who initially dismissed him and Al as a couple of nuisances, eventually acknowledge their bravery. In just six episodes, Al and Bernie are meticulously fleshed out and become better individuals. 
 
It should be fairly obvious at this point that War in the Pocket prides in the growth of its cast more than anything else. Therefore, mecha fans might be displeased to learn that the show packs fewer action sequences compared to other entries in the franchise. Although War in the Pocket is not completely devoid of giant robot battles, most of them occur in the final two episodes during the climax of the story. Even so, these battles are beautifully animated and are no less fun to watch than that in other Gundam titles. But since War in the Pocket is narrated from Al’s viewpoint, these battles seem like random acts of violence instead of clashes of ideals. However, this works in the show’s favor since it reinforces the anti-war themes that it tries to convey. 
 
Even War in the Pocket’s dazzling visuals plays into its narrative. The watercolor backgrounds and the bright, somewhat grungy color scheme give the show an innocent feel, almost as if everything we see is based on Al’s perspective. In contrast, the bloody corpses and destruction of the mobile suits are rendered more realistically. Although the show was produced in 1989, it’s hard to disagree that War in the Pocket is one of the best-looking Gundam titles to date. 
 
War is hell, and it’s a message that War in the Pocket repeatedly declares throughout its six-episode run. Marrying mecha elements with a profound humanistic story, this fantastic addition to the Gundam saga is sure to please both fans and newcomers of the genre. More than two decades have passed since its inception, but it remains the strongest title in the franchise.

          
 
       Helpful 0080 is an incredibly touching side-story to the Gundam franchise, and I honestly feel like I've enjoyed it more than any other Gundam show I've seen.  
 
Story: This OVA is only 6 episodes, so the story is pretty short, but it packs a lot in. It's focus is on an entirely different perspective than the average Gundam show, taking place in a neutral colony and even sympathizing with the Zeon side(the main enemy faction in most UC Gundam material). The show's main draw was more on the characters, but there was still a great effort in capitalizing on more down-to-earth point of view amidst the more grand-scale events of the Gundam universe, emphasizing the tragedy of war. 
 
Art: The animation is absolutely gorgeous during the mech battles, with very bright and fluid animations that really bring them to life. In contrast, the quality drops once it leaves that field. The characters are still pretty well drawn, evoking lots of personality and energy, but there's no doubt that most of the budget went towards the mech battles.  
 
Sound: The anime mostly takes place from a child's point of view, and as such, most of the soundtrack has a very whimsical feel to it. Every song was charming in it's own right, but I did feel that some songs were used at bad timings occasionally. The opening and ending themes fit the show's theme perfectly and had a very appropriate melancholy feel to them. 
 
Character: Man, I seriously couldn't get enough of all the characters. This show did a great job of making them all feel very real and endearing, even those with less screentime. As such, it made me care for them greatly and had me rooting for them the whole way through. The interactions and development between the 2 main characters, a young soldier and a elementary school child, proved to really shine among the rest. I couldn't stop tearing up towards the end with the way the plot progressed, which rarely ever happens to me in anime. 
 
Enjoyment: I felt engaged all the way through, and felt that my time was well spent. 
 
Overall: I enjoyed this show so much that it felt bittersweet to know that it was only 6 episodes. But perhaps that's part of why it was so amazing, it kept things short and sweet without dragging things on unnecessarily. It made its point clear and concisely, using its characters to detail it in a wonderfully charming manner. It's pretty recommended to at least know the background story of the original 0079 Gundam before watching this, due to the many references, but I feel that anyone could embrace and enjoy this show.

War in the pocket is a great classic. The story follows a young boy who meets a crashed Zaku (Mech). The pilot seems to be alive and the young boy wants to help him. While with him, He is with another friend who is a pilot from the opposite. Straight forward and not confusing but simple can be the best. Its art, sound, character are purely outstanding and very good considering for the age. It has a bitter sweet ending but I will not continue because it is sad but leaves with a smile 
 
 
Overall, Great story and is Under-rated classic!

From it comes a moon goddess named Shaorin, dedicated to protecting her ""master"" -- no matter how much of a mess she makes doing it!","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Shounen']",none,"I can't believe I finished this anime. Why? Well first of all, it's not the kind of anime I would watch. The way the characters were drawn were a bit sub par for me (and there were occassions when Takashi's hair was miscolored) the color pallette used was a bit too tacky and it looked kinda old and dowdy for some reason. I just finished it because that's the way I am - I finish what I start. 
 
I have to say though that watching it was a bit too painful at times. Some episodes were just so bad, like the episode were Shaorin first went to school. let me tell you - it was bad. It was so boring I find myself half asleep and not bothering to understand the situation fully. There were episodes that were ok, like the one where Takashi, Tasuke's friend, accidentally took with him Shaorin's uniform. That was an episode that gave me a lot of laughs. 
 
It did remind me of Ranma 1/2. I would say it was a combination of Ranma and Ah! My Goddess, but the problem was the execution. It was executed poorly and it wasn't nearly as good as the two series I mentioned. I think it was the bad storylines - I just thought that some of the topics were shallow. 
 
The music was the first thing that got me to watch the anime. The opening and ending sequence showed Tasuke and Shaorin singing the songs, and apparently it takes that much to impress me. I realized later that the songs tend to be stupid and boring after the first two episodes, and it doesn't make up for the bad storyline. 
There were good points though. I loved the hoshigami. Rishu and Kohan were just too cute. I also find the Tasuke - Shaorin match up to be a bit endearing. Other than that, I can say no more. 
 
Like I said in the beginning, the fact that I finished watching all episodes is a bit surprising. I probably wouldn't even have watched it if I had known it had a weak storyline and poor execution. I can't say it's the worse anime ever, but It's definitely in the bottom of the food chain.

          
 
       Helpful It seems like a lot of people got interested in this anime because of its opening, and those same people seem to be disappointed by the show itself. I'm sort of in the same boat. 
 
The story is your basic magical girlfriend plot line;  if you've seen this kind of show, you know what to expect story-wise. It doesn't really do anything new in this department. Each episode tends to be a different misadventure of your main cast, and some of them can get kind of ridiculous, stupid, or boring. Mamotte Shugogetten tends to put more emphasis on the comedy than on the romance, though the humor can be really hit and miss. It might be enough to get a little laugh out of you, or might not. 
 
The show has a cast of about 8 main characters. A lot of the time the show seems to just cram every character it's got into each episode and it can feel kind of overwhelming and unnecessary. The characters themselves are, again, not anything very new, but I think they can be enjoyable. Shaorin and Tasuke are your main couple, and they're cute enough, just your average couple you would see in this genre. The rest of the cast is the center of comedy, with the main gag being that they're all constantly trying to win the affection of either Tasuke or Shaorin (with the exception of two of them). This joke can get really stale when it gets used so often. 
 
I think the art style is very nice, and Shaorin especially has a great design. Another one of the characters, Ruuan, also has a unique design that really sticks out. The animation itself isn't always great, but it does what it needs to do for this kind of show. The voice acting is fine and  voices suit the characters. The background music is just generic synth/MIDI-sounding stuff, nothing special there. However, the opening -- and I hate to say this -- is really the best thing in Mamotte Shugogetten. I didn't skip it even once. Its a really awesome song with visuals that suit it perfectly. The ending song is also pretty nice, with interesting and creative visuals. 
 
So, I didn't hate Mamotte Shugogetten, but I was let down. I was expecting something more unique and interesting. I guess the best way to describe this show is ""harmless"" or ""mediocre"". It doesn't really bring anything different or new, but it also isn't atrocious or offensively bad, and there is some charm to it. If you go into this show expecting a serious show and something really fresh and new, you're going to be seriously disappointed. But if you just want some simple lighthearted fun, I guess this is an okay anime for that, but you could do better. 
 
The manga is pretty different and focuses more on the romance instead of the comedy, and it also doesn't have the filler that the anime does. So if any of the ideas in this anime interest you, I'd recommend to just read the manga instead. You will have a much better time. 

          
 
       Helpful When I ran into this title, I foolishly set my expectations really high because the opening was fun and catchy and it made me look forward to meet the characters. However, it disappointed me completely to the point that at times it was really painful to watch; so painful that a couple of times I fell asleep. 
 
Mamotte starts as your average anime, it introduces its characters, gives you an idea of what is to follow and leaves you with an impression that you will watch a mediocre at least school-life comedy. Well, in the beginning, at least. After that what follows is a bunch of formulaic standalone episodes which pretty much follow the same pattern; something triggers a random event, Ruan makes the matter worse - usually while trying to get Tasuke’s attention- Tasuke gets in trouble and the kind Shaorin comes to save the day. 
 
As the story progresses, the only change is that Tasuke’s and Shaorin’s feelings for one another become clearer. But that doesn't necessarily mean that is actually a good thing as it can get annoying at times; the cheesy inside monologues and pointless melodramatic scenes do not really help.  
 
But it's not just Tasuke and Shaorin who want to express their love, everyone loves them, what every single character wants is either to gain Tasuke’s or Shaorin’s love or just to be there to support them, they have no other purpose and no development, a cast full of dry stereotypes. Even though there were a bunch of likeable side characters they were left in the shadows due to the poor storyline.  
 
I tried hard to enjoyed it as much as I could, with no results, it was with all honestly, a completely waste of time. I would not recommend this to anyone over 13-14 years old. In the end maybe I should have just watched the opening.
